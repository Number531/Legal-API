# PROJECT BACCHUS — ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE COMPANY ACQUISITION
## Comprehensive Legal Due Diligence Test Prompt

**Purpose**: Stress-test platform capabilities across alcoholic beverage regulation, TTB compliance, three-tier distribution, state ABC licensing, tied house laws, and beverage-specific regulatory frameworks not covered in prior tests. This validates expertise in Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulation (formula approval, label approval COLA, production permits, bonding), three-tier distribution system (producer → distributor → retailer, 21st Amendment state authority, tied house prohibitions), state Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) licensing (manufacturer, distributor, retailer licenses in all 50 states + DC), franchise laws (distributor termination restrictions, good cause requirements, compensation for brand value), standards of identity (27 CFR Part 5 beer/wine/spirits definitions, ingredient restrictions, aging requirements), federal excise tax (FET $13.50/proof gallon spirits, $1.07/barrel beer, $1.07-$3.40/gallon wine), label approval (COLA process, health warnings, product claims, appellations), advertising restrictions (BAC unfair competition, appeals to minors, health claims prohibitions), import/export compliance, and alcoholic beverage-specific regulatory frameworks unique to beer, wine, and spirits production and distribution.

**Key Differentiators from Prior Tests**:
- Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulation (27 CFR Parts 1-40) — Formula approval for distilled spirits/wine, label approval (COLA), production permits (brewery, winery, distillery), bonding requirements ($50K-$500K bonds)
- Three-tier distribution system (21st Amendment Section 2) — Mandatory separation: producers cannot distribute or retail (except limited exceptions), distributors cannot produce or retail, retailers cannot produce or distribute
- Tied house laws (27 U.S.C. § 205, 27 CFR Part 6) — Prohibition on producer financial interests in retailers, "things of value" restrictions, inducements prohibited (slotting fees, exclusivity payments, free products beyond samples)
- State ABC licensing (50 states + DC) — Separate manufacturer/distributor/retailer licenses required in each state, change of control approvals, character and fitness investigations, local approvals (county/city), dry jurisdictions
- Franchise laws (state-level) — Distributor protection statutes (25+ states), good cause required to terminate distributor, brand value compensation (fair market value for brands if terminated), perpetual rights in some states
- Standards of identity (27 CFR Part 5) — Beer (malt beverage, <0.5% ABV non-alcoholic, ingredients malt/hops/yeast/water), wine (grape wine, fruit wine, flavored wine, fortified wine), spirits (whiskey, vodka, gin, rum, tequila, brandy — aging, proof, ingredients)
- Federal excise tax (26 U.S.C. §§ 5001, 5041, 5051) — Spirits $13.50/proof gallon (reduced rates for small distillers), wine $1.07-$3.40/gallon (by alcohol content, sparkling/still), beer $3.50-$18/barrel (graduated by production volume)
- Label approval (COLA) — Certificate of Label Approval required for all beverage alcohol labels, TTB reviews brand name, alcohol content, health warnings, product descriptors, appellation of origin, mandatory statements
- Advertising restrictions — Federal Alcohol Administration Act (unfair competition, deceptive practices), BAC Code (Beverage Alcohol Code, industry self-regulation), state restrictions (billboards, appeals to minors, health claims)
- Trade practice regulations (27 CFR Part 6) — Exclusive outlet prohibitions (cannot require retailer to buy exclusively), commercial bribery prohibitions, consignment sales prohibitions, retailer inducements

**Concurrent Testing Strategy**: Run with Projects Meridian through Athena (education) to validate platform handling 18+ simultaneous complex transactions across different regulatory frameworks.

**Federal Excise Tax (FET)**:

**Beer FET** (26 U.S.C. § 5051):
- **Rate**: $3.50/barrel (first 60,000 barrels), $16/barrel (60,001-2,000,000 barrels), $18/barrel (>2,000,000 barrels)
- **ASBC production**: 485,000 barrels annually
  - First 60,000 barrels: 60,000 × $3.50 = $210,000
  - Next 425,000 barrels: 425,000 × $16 = $6,800,000
  - Total beer FET: $7,010,000 annually
- **Payment**: Semi-monthly (every 2 weeks, 14 days after end of period)

**Spirits FET** (26 U.S.C. § 5001):
- **Rate**: $2.70/proof gallon (first 100,000 proof gallons), $13.34/proof gallon (100,001-22,130,000 proof gallons), $13.50/proof gallon (>22,130,000 proof gallons)
- **ASBC production**: 100,000 proof gallons annually
  - All 100,000 proof gallons at reduced rate: 100,000 × $2.70 = $270,000
- **Payment**: Semi-monthly

**Wine FET** (26 U.S.C. § 5041) (mead):
- **Rate**: $1.07/gallon (≤14% ABV still wine), reduced rates for small producers
- **ASBC production**: 12,000 cases mead (9-liter cases = 108,000 liters = 28,530 gallons)
  - FET: 28,530 gallons × $1.07 = $30,527 annually

**Total FET**: $7,010,000 (beer) + $270,000 (spirits) + $30,527 (mead) = **$7,310,527 annually**

**Pending Regulatory Matters**:

**TTB Formula Investigation** (Bourbon):
- **Issue**: TTB investigation (September 2024) into ASBC's Single Barrel Bourbon formula (allegations from competitor that bourbon does not meet standards of identity — specifically, allegations that bourbon contains undisclosed flavoring additives)
- **Standards of identity** (27 CFR § 5.22(b)(1)): Bourbon must be produced from mash bill ≥51% corn, aged in new charred oak barrels, distilled at ≤160 proof, entered into barrel at ≤125 proof, bottled at ≥80 proof, **with no added coloring, flavoring, or blending materials except water**
- **ASBC's defense**: Single Barrel Bourbon meets all requirements, no added flavoring (uses toasted wood staves in aging barrels for flavor enhancement, argues toasted staves are part of "new charred oak barrel" aging process, not "added flavoring")
- **Status**: TTB review ongoing (submitted documentation October 2024), awaiting determination
- **Exposure**: 
  - If TTB finds violation → Suspend formula approval, recall all bourbon in market ($8.5M retail value), potential fine $1K-$10K per violation (could be per bottle = $850K-$8.5M for 85,000 bottles in market)
  - Civil penalty: 26 U.S.C. § 5687 ($1,000 per offense for spirits regulations violations)
  - Criminal penalty: 26 U.S.C. § 5601 (up to 5 years imprisonment, $10,000 fine — typically not pursued for labeling violations)

**State ABC Investigation** (Oregon):
- **Issue**: Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC) investigation (June 2024) into ASBC's tied house violations (allegations that ASBC provided free beer and branded merchandise to retail accounts in excess of permitted sampling amounts)
- **Tied house law** (ORS 471.392): Brewers prohibited from giving "things of value" to retailers (exceptions: product samples up to $50/month, POS materials, consumer advertising)
- **Allegations**: ASBC sales reps provided cases of free beer (24-pack cases, $42 retail value) to 12 retail accounts (bars, restaurants) in Portland metro (March-May 2024, total value $6,048)
- **ASBC's defense**: Free beer was within permissible sampling exception (intended for bar staff/bartender training, not for resale), isolated incident by single sales rep (terminated August 2024)
- **Status**: OLCC issued Notice of Violation (NOV) (September 2024), ASBC responded (October 2024), awaiting final decision
- **Exposure**: Fine $500-$5,000 per violation (12 violations = $6K-$60K), license suspension (7-30 days, unlikely for first offense if corrective action taken)

**Distributor Termination Litigation** (Texas):

**Case**: Lone Star Beverages, Inc. v. Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company, LLC (Texas District Court, Travis County, filed April 2024)

**Background**:
- Lone Star Beverages (LSB) = ASBC's beer distributor in Austin, TX market (2015-2024)
- **Termination**: ASBC terminated LSB (effective March 2024) for poor performance (declining sales, missed delivery targets, inadequate market coverage)
- **Texas Beer Franchise Law** (Tex. Alc. Bev. Code § 102.75): Brewers cannot terminate distributors without "good cause" (defined as material breach of agreement), must pay compensation for brand value (fair market value of brands if terminated)

**LSB's Claims**:
1. **Wrongful termination** (violation of Texas franchise law): ASBC did not have "good cause" (performance decline was due to market conditions, not LSB's fault)
2. **Breach of contract**: Distributor agreement required ASBC to provide marketing support, ASBC failed to provide adequate support (caused performance decline)
3. **Damages**: Compensation for brand value ($2.8M, expert valuation based on projected future profits from ASBC brands) + lost profits ($1.2M for wind-down period)

**ASBC's Defense**:
- "Good cause" existed: LSB breached agreement (failed to maintain 95% on-time delivery, failed to hire minimum sales staff, failed to meet annual sales targets)
- Marketing support was adequate (provided $180K annual marketing funds, LSB failed to use funds effectively)
- Brand value compensation not owed (termination was for cause, LSB forfeited brand rights due to breach)

**Status**: Discovery phase, mediation scheduled Q1 2026

**Exposure**: $2.8M-$4M (brand value compensation + lost profits if LSB prevails), attorneys' fees

**Label Violations and COLA Revocations**:

**TTB COLA Revocation** (Artisan IPA, 16 oz cans):
- **Issue**: TTB revoked COLA (August 2024) for Artisan IPA 16 oz can label (found label violated 27 CFR § 7.29 — mandatory health warning statement font size too small, not "readily legible")
- **Mandatory warning** (27 U.S.C. § 215): "GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems."
- **Violation**: Warning label font 6-point (TTB requires minimum 2mm letters, approximately 8-point font for readability)
- **Impact**: Cannot sell/distribute 16 oz cans with revoked label (120,000 cans in inventory, $840K wholesale value)
- **Resolution**: ASBC submitted new COLA application (September 2024) with corrected label, approved (October 2024), relabeling 120,000 cans ($72K cost for new labels + relabeling labor)

**Advertising Violations**:

**FTC Complaint** (Health Claims):
- **Issue**: Federal Trade Commission complaint (May 2024) alleging ASBC made deceptive health claims in advertising (social media posts claimed Artisan IPA contains "antioxidants from hops" and "health benefits of moderate beer consumption")
- **FTC position**: Health claims for alcoholic beverages are deceptive (no competent and reliable scientific evidence that moderate alcohol consumption provides health benefits, BAC Code prohibits health claims)
- **ASBC's defense**: Posts were deleted within 48 hours (user-generated content reposted by social media manager, not ASBC official advertising), immediately ceased all health-related claims
- **Status**: FTC investigation ongoing (ASBC submitted response June 2024), no final determination
- **Exposure**: Cease and desist order (likely), civil penalty $10K-$100K (FTC Act Section 5 deceptive practices), corrective advertising ($50K-$200K to run corrective ads)

**Import/Export Compliance**:

**International Markets** (8 countries):
- Canada: 15,000 cases beer, 2,400 cases spirits annually (distributed through Moosehead Breweries partnership)
- UK: 8,500 cases beer, 1,800 cases spirits (distributed through James Clay & Sons)

- Netherlands: 2,800 cases beer (distributed through Bavaria Brewery partnership)
- Mexico: 5,500 cases beer, 1,200 cases spirits (distributed through Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma)
- South Korea: 4,100 cases beer, 900 cases spirits

**Export Compliance**:
- **TTB export requirements**: Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) or Certificate of Age and Origin (for spirits), export bond (if not paid FET)
- **Customs compliance**: Export declarations, harmonized tariff codes, country of origin marking
- **Foreign regulations**: Each country has own labeling requirements (language, health warnings, ingredient disclosures, alcohol content formats)

**Trade Barriers**:
- **EU tariffs**: 25% retaliatory tariff on U.S. spirits (imposed 2018, related to Section 232 steel/aluminum tariffs) — Impacts UK, Germany, Netherlands spirits exports
- **Japan**: High excise taxes on imported spirits (approximately 35% of retail price)

**Pending Litigation**:

**Personal Injury** (Drunk Driving):
- **Case**: Smith v. Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company, LLC (Oregon Circuit Court, Multnomah County, filed July 2024)
- **Plaintiff**: Injured victim of drunk driving accident (September 2023)
- **Allegations**: Drunk driver (defendant Jones) consumed alcohol at ASBC's Portland taproom (5 beers over 3 hours), taproom staff served Jones despite visible intoxication, Jones caused accident 30 minutes after leaving taproom, injured plaintiff (severe injuries, $850K medical expenses)
- **Claims**: Dram shop liability (Oregon ORS 471.565 — commercial servers liable for serving visibly intoxicated persons who cause injuries), negligent training (staff not adequately trained to recognize intoxication, over-serving)
- **ASBC's defense**: Jones was not visibly intoxicated when served (blood alcohol 0.12% at time of accident, but may have been lower when at taproom), staff followed OLCC-required Alcohol Server Education training, Jones consumed additional alcohol after leaving taproom (at home, contributed to intoxication)
- **Status**: Discovery phase, expert depositions scheduled Q1 2026
- **Exposure**: $850K medical expenses + pain and suffering $1M-$3M (Oregon no cap on non-economic damages), potentially joint and several liability with driver
- **Insurance**: General liability insurance $5M coverage, dram shop coverage included, $100K retention

**Employment Discrimination** (EEOC):
- **Filed**: October 2024
- **Complainant**: Maria Gonzalez, bartender at Denver taproom (Hispanic female, terminated August 2024)
- **Allegations**: National origin discrimination, retaliation (Gonzalez filed wage complaint with Colorado Department of Labor, alleging unpaid overtime for shift preparation/cleanup time, terminated 2 weeks after complaint)
- **ASBC's defense**: Gonzalez terminated for performance issues (customer complaints, cash register discrepancies, tardiness), not retaliation for wage complaint
- **Status**: EEOC investigation, ASBC submitted position statement (November 2024), awaiting determination
- **Exposure**: Reinstatement + back pay ($35K for 16 months) + compensatory damages ($50K-$200K if retaliation found), front pay

## KEY TRANSACTION RISKS (REQUIRING ANALYSIS)

### TTB Permits and Federal Licensing

1. **Change of ownership** — Requires TTB approval for transfer of Brewer's Notice, DSP registration, Winery permit (all 5 permits)
2. **Timeline** — 60-90 days per permit (TTB application, background investigation, bond transfer)
3. **Bonding** — $450K total bonds (brewery $150K each × 3, distillery $250K, winery $50K), must remain in place or be replaced
4. **Formula approvals** — 42 approved formulas transfer with DSP, but pending investigation (bourbon formula) creates risk
5. **COLA transfers** — 280 approved labels remain valid, but must be re-submitted if label ownership changes (depends on TTB interpretation of "responsible advertiser" change)

### Three-Tier Distribution System and Tied House Compliance

6. **Three-tier separation** — ASBC cannot own distributors or retailers (except limited exceptions for taprooms tied to production)
7. **Tied house violations** — Oregon OLCC investigation (free beer to retailers $6,048 value, $6K-$60K fine + license suspension risk)
8. **Self-distribution** — Oregon self-distribution permit (15% of Oregon volume), must be transferred with TTB/OLCC approvals
9. **Inducements prohibition** — Cannot provide "things of value" to retailers beyond permitted exceptions (samples $50/month, POS materials, consumer advertising)
10. **Slotting fees** — Prohibited (cannot pay retailers for shelf space, tap handles, placement)

### State ABC Licensing — 50 States + DC

11. **118 state licenses** — Brewery licenses (50 states), distillery licenses (48 states, not UT/MS), retail licenses (18 taprooms across 5 states)
12. **Change of control approvals** — Most states require ABC approval for ownership change (background checks, financial suitability, character investigations)
13. **Timeline** — 30-180 days per state (some states fast-track, others slow), must coordinate 50+ state applications
14. **Local approvals** — 18 taprooms require local city/county approval (business licenses, conditional use permits, health permits)
15. **Dry jurisdictions** — ASBC does not operate in dry counties (religious/local prohibitions), but must verify no dry jurisdiction conflicts

### Distributor Franchise Laws and Termination Restrictions

16. **25 state franchise laws** — Protect beer/wine distributors (good cause required to terminate, brand value compensation, perpetual rights)
17. **180 beer distributors** — Covered by franchise laws in key states (CA, FL, TX, NY, IL, WI, NJ, MA, NC, VA)
18. **125 spirits distributors** — Some states have spirits franchise laws (weaker than beer, but still require good cause/compensation)
19. **Texas litigation** — Lone Star Beverages wrongful termination ($2.8M-$4M exposure, brand value compensation + lost profits)
20. **Termination restrictions** — Cannot terminate distributors without good cause (material breach, insolvency, license loss), limits flexibility for network optimization post-acquisition

### Standards of Identity and Formula Compliance

21. **TTB bourbon investigation** — Single Barrel Bourbon formula (toasted wood staves allegation, $850K-$8.5M recall exposure + fine)
22. **Standards of identity** (27 CFR § 5.22) — Bourbon, rye, vodka, gin, rum all have strict requirements (ingredients, aging, proof, production methods)
23. **Formula changes** — Any formula change requires new TTB approval (60-90 days), cannot modify products without approval
24. **Labeling accuracy** — Labels must match formula (alcohol content ±1%, ingredient disclosures, age statements must be accurate)
25. **Competitor complaints** — Bourbon investigation triggered by competitor complaint (industry policing, risk of future complaints on other formulas)

### Federal Excise Tax Compliance and Payment

26. **$7.3M annual FET** — Beer $7M, spirits $270K, wine $31K (semi-monthly payment, 14-day cycle)
27. **Bonding requirement** — Bonds guarantee FET payment (brewery $150K each, distillery $250K), must remain in place
28. **Payment timing** — Semi-monthly (every 2 weeks), late payment penalties 5% + interest + potential bond forfeiture
29. **Reduced FET rates** — Beer reduced rate (first 60,000 barrels $3.50 vs. $16), spirits reduced rate (first 100,000 proof gallons $2.70 vs. $13.34), must comply with small producer requirements
30. **FET assignment** — If ASBC assigned reduced rates to affiliates (controlled group rules 26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(5)), post-acquisition may lose reduced rates if ABP has other beverage companies in controlled group

### Label Approval (COLA) and Revocations

31. **280 approved COLAs** — All labels must have TTB approval before use

34. **Brand name approval** — TTB reviews brand names (cannot be misleading, confusing, obscene, geographic origin false)
35. **Appellation of origin** — If using geographic appellations (e.g., "Kentucky Straight Bourbon"), must comply with production location requirements

### Advertising and Marketing Compliance

36. **BAC Code** (Beverage Alcohol Code) — Industry self-regulation (no health claims, no appeals to minors, responsible depiction)
37. **FTC investigation** — Health claims in social media ($10K-$100K penalty + $50K-$200K corrective advertising)
38. **State restrictions** — Some states prohibit billboards near schools, restrict alcohol advertising on TV/radio (time restrictions), require health warnings
39. **Social media compliance** — User-generated content risks (ASBC reposted customer content with health claims), influencer marketing (must disclose material connections)
40. **Labeling vs. advertising** — TTB regulates labels, FTC regulates advertising, must comply with both (TTB allows "handcrafted" on labels, FTC requires substantiation for "handcrafted" in ads)

### Distributor Relationships and Network Management

41. **180 beer distributors + 125 spirits distributors** — 305 total distributor relationships, must manage post-acquisition
42. **Top 4 distributors** — RNDC (18% volume), SGWS (14% volume), Reyes (12% beer), Ben E. Keith (8% beer) = 52% of total volume through 4 distributors (concentration risk)
43. **Exclusive territories** — Distributors have exclusive territories (cannot appoint second distributor in same territory without cause)
44. **Performance requirements** — Distributor agreements have minimum sales targets, market coverage requirements, inventory levels
45. **Change of control clauses** — Some distributor agreements have change of control provisions (distributor consent required, or termination right if change occurs)

### Import/Export and International Compliance

46. **8 international markets** — Each has own labeling, import licensing, tax requirements (EU 25% retaliatory tariff on spirits impacts profitability)
47. **TTB export certificates** — Certificate of Age and Origin for spirits exports, COLA or export certification for beer/wine
48. **Foreign distributor agreements** — 8 foreign distributors (contract law varies by country, termination rules different from U.S.)
49. **Trade barriers** — EU tariffs 25%, Japan excise tax 35% of retail, Canada provincial monopolies (some provinces require listing fees, promotional fees)
50. **Currency risk** — International sales in foreign currency (CAD, GBP, JPY, AUD, EUR, MXN, KRW), exchange rate fluctuations impact revenue

### Taproom Retail Operations and Dram Shop Liability

51. **18 taprooms** — On-premise consumption, food service, retail packaged goods sales
52. **Dram shop liability** — Oregon lawsuit (drunk driving, $850K medical + $1M-$3M pain/suffering), staff training requirements
53. **OLCC server training** — Oregon requires Alcohol Server Education (all taproom staff), other states have similar requirements (TIPS, ServSafe Alcohol)
54. **Over-serving** — Staff must refuse service to visibly intoxicated patrons (Oregon ORS 471.565, other states have similar statutes)
55. **ID verification** — Must verify age (21+), some states require ID scanning, all states require physical ID check

### Environmental Compliance and Wastewater Discharge

56. **Brewery wastewater** — High BOD (biological oxygen demand), requires pretreatment before discharge to municipal sewer
57. **Portland brewery** — Pretreatment system (185,000 barrels/year production, ~5.7M gallons wastewater annually, BOD 1,200-2,000 mg/L)
58. **Clean Water Act permits** — Industrial pretreatment permits (EPA/state permits for discharge to POTW)
59. **Distillery waste** — Stillage (distillation byproduct), high organic content, requires disposal or beneficial reuse (livestock feed, composting)
60. **Air emissions** — Boilers, fermentation CO2, ethanol vapors (distillery), may require air permits depending on size/emissions

## SCOPE OF ENGAGEMENT

Please prepare a comprehensive legal due diligence memorandum addressing:

### 1. TTB PERMITS AND FEDERAL LICENSING TRANSFER ANALYSIS

#### A. Brewer's Notice Transfer (3 Facilities)

**Brewer's Notice** (27 CFR Part 25):
- Permit required for beer production (federal brewery permit)
- **ASBC's permits**: 3 Brewer's Notices
  1. Portland, OR (DSP-OR-12458, 350,000 barrels capacity)
  2. Denver, CO (DSP-CO-8842, 100,000 barrels capacity)
  3. Asheville, NC (DSP-NC-3387, 75,000 barrels capacity)

**Change of Ownership** (27 CFR § 25.71):
- Requires TTB approval (cannot operate brewery under new ownership without amended permit)
- **Application**: TTB Form 5130.10 (Brewer's Notice of Operations), amended to reflect new ownership
- **Timeline**: 60-90 days (TTB review, background investigation, bond review)

**Background Investigation**:
- TTB investigates new owners (ABP principals, officers, directors, >10% shareholders)
- **Review**: Criminal background (FBI fingerprints), financial background (credit reports, tax compliance), beverage alcohol industry experience
- **Disqualifying factors**: Felony convictions (especially alcohol/tax/fraud), tax delinquencies, prior TTB violations

**Bonding** (27 CFR § 25.91):
- Each brewery requires bond (guarantee FET payment)
- **ASBC's bonds**: $150K per facility ($450K total for 3 breweries)
- **Options**: 
  1. ASBC's bonds remain in place (surety company consents to ownership change)
  2. ABP obtains new bonds (must have $450K bonds in place before transfer approved)
- **Surety requirements**: Bonding company must be on TTB-approved list (Treasury Circular 570)

**Interim Operation**:
- ASBC cannot produce beer after closing until TTB approves amended Brewer's Notice
- **Gap coverage**: File applications 90 days before closing, seek TTB expedited review, plan for production shutdown if TTB approval delayed

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review all 3 Brewer's Notices (verify active status, no violations, bond amounts adequate)
2. Prepare TTB transfer applications (Form 5130.10 for all 3 facilities)
3. Engage surety company (confirm bond transfer or obtain new bonds)
4. Background check ABP principals (identify any disqualifying issues proactively)

#### B. Distilled Spirits Plant (DSP) Transfer

**DSP Registration** (27 CFR Part 19):
- Required for spirits production, storage, bottling, rectification
- **ASBC's DSP**: Portland, OR (DSP-OR-20145)

**Change of Ownership** (27 CFR § 19.112):
- Requires TTB approval (new DSP registration application)
- **Application**: TTB Form 5110.41 (Registration of Distilled Spirits Plant), new registration under ABP ownership
- **Timeline**: 90-120 days (longer than brewery, more complex)

**Formula Transfer**:
- 42 approved formulas (TTB Form 5100.51)
- **Transfer**: Formulas tied to DSP registration, transfer automatically when DSP transfers
- **Pending investigation**: Bourbon formula under investigation (toasted wood staves allegation)
  - **Risk**: If TTB denies formula during transfer process → Cannot produce Single Barrel Bourbon post-acquisition
  - **Mitigation**: Resolve investigation before closing (withdraw formula, reformulate, or obtain TTB clearance)

**Bonding** (27 CFR § 19.168):
- **ASBC's bond**: $250K (DSP operations bond)
- **Transfer**: Same as brewery (existing bond consent or new bond)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review DSP registration (verify active, no violations, production authorized)
2. Review all 42 formulas (verify approved, identify any issues beyond bourbon investigation)
3. Resolve bourbon investigation before closing (settlement with TTB, withdraw formula, or clearance)
4. Prepare DSP transfer application (Form 5110.41)

#### C. COLA Transfer and Relabeling Requirements

**Certificate of Label Approval (COLA)**:
- Required for all beverage alcohol labels (27 CFR §§ 7.24 (beer), 4.39 (wine), 5.35 (spirits))
- **ASBC's COLAs**: 280 approved labels (120 beer, 150 spirits, 8 mead, 2 cider)

**Change of Ownership Impact**:
- **TTB policy**: COLAs transfer if "responsible advertiser" (label registrant) unchanged
- **Issue**: If ABP changes ASBC's legal name or label registrant → Must re-apply for all 280 COLAs
  - **Timeline**: 60-90 days per COLA (TTB review)
  - **Cost**: $0 (no fee), but administrative burden

**Options**:
1. **No name change**: ASBC LLC remains legal entity, ABP acquires equity (COLAs remain valid, no re-application)
2. **Name change**: ASBC changes name to "ASBC, an ABP Company" → Must re-apply for all COLAs (280 applications, 60-90 days)

**COLA Revocation** (Artisan IPA):
- 120,000 cans with revoked COLA ($840K wholesale value)
- **Resolution**: New COLA approved (October 2024), relabeling in progress ($72K cost)
- **Due diligence**: Verify relabeling complete before closing (no invalid inventory)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Decide on name change strategy (retain ASBC name to avoid COLA re-application)
2. Review all 280 COLAs (verify valid, no pending revocations)
3. Verify Artisan IPA relabeling complete (120,000 cans relabeled with new COLA)

### 2. THREE-TIER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND TIED HOUSE COMPLIANCE

#### A. Three-Tier System Legal Framework

**21st Amendment Section 2**:
- Grants states authority to regulate alcohol (post-Prohibition)
- **State systems**: Most states adopted three-tier system (producer → distributor → retailer, mandatory separation)

**Federal Tied House Laws** (27 U.S.C. § 205, 27 CFR Part 6):
- Prohibits producers from having financial interest in retailers (slotting fees, ownership, inducements)
- **Exceptions**: On-premise consumption at production facility (brewpub/taproom exception), consumer advertising, product samples

**Three-Tier Implications for ASBC**:
- ASBC (producer) sells to 180 beer distributors + 125 spirits distributors (tier 2)
- Distributors sell to retailers (bars, restaurants, liquor stores — tier 3)
- **ASBC cannot**:
  - Own retail licenses (except taprooms tied to breweries/distillery)
  - Sell directly to retailers (except self-distribution in states allowing it, e.g., Oregon <15% volume)
  - Pay retailers for placement (slotting fees, tap handle fees, shelf space fees)
  - Provide free goods to retailers (except samples ≤$50/month, consumer advertising, POS materials)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review ASBC's distribution model (confirm three-tier compliance, no direct retail except permitted self-distribution)
2. Identify all self-distribution permits (Oregon, California, others — verify compliance with volume limits, reporting requirements)
3. Assess tied house risk (beyond Oregon investigation, any other free goods, inducements to retailers?)

#### B. Oregon OLCC Tied House Investigation

**Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC)**:
- Regulates alcohol in Oregon (licensing, enforcement, tied house law)

**Tied House Law** (ORS 471.392):
- Prohibits brewers/distillers from giving "things of value" to retailers
- **Exceptions**: 
  - Product samples (≤$50 retail value per month per retailer)
  - Point-of-sale materials (tap handles, coasters, glassware for on-premise use)
  - Consumer advertising (billboards, print ads, radio/TV spots)

**OLCC Investigation**:
- **Allegations**: ASBC sales reps gave free beer to 12 Portland-area retail accounts (March-May 2024)
  - 12 accounts × $504 per account (12 cases at $42/case) = $6,048 total value
- **Violation**: Exceeded $50/month sample limit (each account received $168/month in free beer for 3 months)

**ASBC's Defense**:
- Free beer intended for staff training/sampling (bartender education on ASBC products)
- **Counter**: OLCC position is that $50/month limit applies regardless of purpose (training vs. resale)

**OLCC NOV** (Notice of Violation):
- Issued September 2024
- **Proposed penalty**: $6K-$60K fine ($500-$5,000 per violation × 12 violations)
- **Proposed action**: Warning or license suspension (7-30 days)

**Status**: ASBC responded (October 2024), awaiting OLCC final decision (expected Q1 2026)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review OLCC NOV and ASBC response (assess likelihood of penalty, suspension)
2. Model settlement scenarios ($6K-$20K fine likely, 7-day suspension possible but unlikely for first offense)
3. Assess corrective action (ASBC terminated sales rep, implemented enhanced tied house training, monthly compliance audits)
4. Verify no other tied house violations (review sales rep practices in all states, promotional activities)

#### C. Self-Distribution Permits and Limitations

**Self-Distribution**:
- Some states allow small brewers/distillers to sell directly to retailers (bypass distributor tier)
- **Limitations**: Volume caps (e.g., <5,000 barrels/year), geographic restrictions (in-state only)

**ASBC's Self-Distribution**:
- **Oregon**: Self-distribution permit (ORS 471.282, allows brewers <100,000 barrels/year to self-distribute)
  - ASBC distributes ~72,500 barrels in Oregon (485,000 total production, ~15% to Oregon, ~15% of Oregon via self-distribution = 10,875 barrels self-distributed)
  - Remaining 85% of Oregon volume through independent distributors (Maletis Beverage, other OR distributors)

**Transfer Issues**:
- Self-distribution permit tied to ASBC's Oregon brewery license
- **Change of ownership**: Oregon requires notification, likely approval (OLCC review of new owner)

**Due Diligence**:
- Review Oregon self-distribution permit (verify active, volume within limits)
- Identify any other states where ASBC self-distributes (CA? Others?)
- Assess ABP's strategy (continue self-distribution? Or transition to full three-tier?)

### 3. STATE ABC LICENSING — 50-STATE CHANGE OF CONTROL APPROVALS

#### A. Manufacturing License Transfers (Brewery, Distillery, Winery)

**Brewery Licenses** (50 states):
- ASBC holds brewery manufacturer licenses in all 50 states (for interstate shipment, even if no physical brewery in state)
- **Change of control**: Most states require ABC approval for ownership change

**State-by-State Process**:

**Tier 1 States** (Highest Scrutiny, Longest Timeline):
- **California, New York, Illinois, Florida, Texas** (large markets, extensive background checks, 90-180 days)
- **Requirements**: Application, ownership disclosure, fingerprints, financial statements, tax clearance, background investigation

**Tier 2 States** (Moderate Scrutiny):
- **Colorado, Oregon, Washington, North Carolina, Georgia** (30-90 days)
- **Requirements**: Similar to Tier 1, but faster processing

**Tier 3 States** (Streamlined):
- **Most other states** (30-60 days, notification or abbreviated application)

**Disqualifying Factors** (common across states):
- Felony convictions (alcohol, tax, fraud, violence)
- Delinquent taxes (federal, state, local)
- Prior license revocations/suspensions
- Moral character concerns (DUI, domestic violence, etc.)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Create 50-state matrix (application requirements, fees, timelines, disqualifying factors)
2. Prepare state ABC transfer applications (file 90-120 days before closing in all states)
3. Background check ABP principals (identify any disqualifying issues in any state)
4. Coordinate with local counsel in key states (CA, NY, TX, FL, IL)

#### B. Retail License Transfers (18 Taprooms)

**Taproom Licenses**:
- 18 on-premise retail licenses (OR 8, CO 4, NC 3, WA 2, CA 1)
- **License types**: 
  - Tied to brewery/distillery (brewpub license, allows on-premise sales of own production)
  - Separate retail license (if standalone taproom not physically connected to brewery)

**Change of Ownership**:
- Each state requires ABC approval for retail license transfer
- **Additional approvals**: Local city/county (business license, health permit, conditional use permit)

**Oregon** (8 taprooms):
- Brewpub licenses (tied to Portland brewery)
- **OLCC approval**: Required for ownership change (30-60 days)
- **Local approvals**: Portland, Eugene, Bend, Salem (business licenses)

**Colorado** (4 taprooms):
- Brew pub licenses (Denver metro 3, Boulder 1)
- **State approval**: Colorado Liquor Enforcement Division (60 days)
- **Local approvals**: Denver, Boulder (business licenses, health permits)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review all 18 taproom licenses (verify active, no violations)
2. Identify local approval requirements (city/county business licenses, health permits, zoning)
3. File state ABC transfer applications (all 5 states: OR, CO, NC, WA, CA)

### 4. DISTRIBUTOR FRANCHISE LAWS AND TERMINATION LITIGATION

#### A. State Franchise Law Matrix (25 States)

**Beer/Wine Franchise Laws**:
- 25+ states have laws protecting beer/wine distributors
- **Key provisions**:
  1. **Good cause required**: Cannot terminate distributor without "good cause" (material breach, insolvency, license loss)
  2. **Brand value compensation**: If terminated for cause, must pay fair market value of brands (distributor's investment in brand development)
  3. **Perpetual rights**: Some states (WI, NJ) grant distributors perpetual rights (cannot terminate even for cause without compensation)

**ASBC's Exposure**:
- 180 beer distributors in all 50 states
- **Franchise law coverage**: Distributors in CA, FL, TX, NY, IL, WI, NJ, MA, NC, VA, GA, OH, PA, MD, MO (15+ states, ~85 distributors, ~60% of volume)

**Key State Provisions**:

**California** (AB 258, Bus. & Prof. Code § 25000.2):
- Good cause required (fraud, material breach)
- 60-day notice, right to cure
- No compensation requirement (unlike other states)

**Florida** (Fla. Stat. § 563.022):
- Good cause required
- **Compensation**: Fair market value of brands (based on distributor's investment, future profit projections)

**Texas** (Tex. Alc. Bev. Code § 102.75):
- Good cause required (breach, failure to comply with reasonable and material requirements)
- **Compensation**: Fair market value (typically 2-4× annual gross profit on brands)

**Wisconsin** (Wis. Stat. § 135.02):
- **Perpetual rights**: Distributors have perpetual territory rights (cannot terminate without compensation even for cause)
- **Compensation**: Full value (highest compensation in U.S., 5-8× annual gross profit)

**New Jersey** (N.J. Stat. § 33:1-93.13):
- Similar to Wisconsin (perpetual rights)
- Compensation required even for termination for cause

**Due Diligence**:
1. Create franchise law matrix (all 25+ states, termination requirements, compensation formulas, notice periods)
2. Review all 180 distributor agreements (identify franchise law states, assess performance issues, termination risks)
3. Model brand value compensation (if ABP wants to consolidate distributors post-acquisition, what would compensation cost?)

#### B. Texas Lone Star Beverages Litigation

**Case**: Lone Star Beverages, Inc. v. Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company, LLC (Texas District Court, Travis County)

**Background**:
- LSB = ASBC beer distributor in Austin, TX (2015-2024, 9-year relationship)
- **Performance issues** (ASBC's allegations):
  - On-time delivery declined from 98% (2020) to 88% (2023) (agreement requires 95%)
  - Sales declined 12% (2022-2023) in Austin market (ASBC claims market grew 5%, LSB underperforming)
  - Failed to hire minimum sales staff (agreement requires 8 sales reps for Austin territory, LSB had 5 in 2023)
- **Termination**: ASBC sent termination notice (January 2024, effective March 2024), cited performance failures as good cause

**LSB's Claims**:
1. **Wrongful termination**: Texas franchise law requires "good cause" (Tex. Alc. Bev. Code § 102.75)
   - LSB argues: Performance decline due to market conditions (COVID-19 recovery, inflation, consumer shift to hard seltzers/spirits), not LSB's fault
   - Agreement's performance requirements unreasonable in current market
2. **Breach of contract**: ASBC failed to provide agreed marketing support
   - Agreement: ASBC provides $180K annual marketing funds (billboards, events, POS materials)
   - LSB claims: ASBC provided funds but failed to provide strategic support (brand manager visits, sales training, market analysis) → LSB couldn't perform
3. **Damages**: 
   - Brand value compensation: $2.8M (expert valuation, 3.5× average annual gross profit $800K)
   - Lost profits: $1.2M (wind-down period, 18 months)

**ASBC's Defense**:
- Good cause existed: LSB materially breached agreement (on-time delivery, sales staff minimums, sales targets all breached)
- Marketing support adequate: Provided $180K annually (LSB's responsibility to deploy funds effectively)
- No compensation owed: Termination for material breach, LSB forfeited brand rights

**Status**:
- Discovery phase (depositions of ASBC sales managers, LSB executives, expert witnesses)
- Mediation scheduled Q1 2026

**Exposure**:
- **If LSB prevails**: $2.8M brand value + $1.2M lost profits = $4M total
- **If ASBC prevails**: $0 (LSB forfeited rights due to breach)
- **Settlement range**: $800K-$2M (likely compromise, ASBC pays partial compensation to avoid trial risk)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review LSB distributor agreement (termination provisions, performance requirements, marketing support obligations)
2. Review ASBC termination documentation (notices, performance data, breach evidence)
3. Assess litigation risk (strength of ASBC's good cause argument, likelihood of settlement)
4. Model settlement scenarios ($800K-$2M reserve for litigation)

#### C. Distributor Consolidation Strategy Post-Acquisition

**ABP's Options**:
1. **Retain all distributors**: Keep all 180 beer + 125 spirits distributors (no changes)
2. **Consolidate to top distributors**: Transition to larger national distributors (RNDC, SGWS, Reyes for beer)
   - **Advantages**: Fewer relationships to manage, better market coverage, national distribution platform
   - **Disadvantages**: Franchise law compensation ($5M-$15M to buy out smaller distributors), brand value payments in 25 states

**Brand Value Estimation**:
- **145 smaller distributors**: ~48% of volume, average $400K annual gross profit per distributor
- **Buyout cost**: 145 distributors × $400K gross profit × 2.5 multiple = **$145M potential exposure** (if terminate all small distributors in franchise law states)
- **Realistic scenario**: Consolidate 30-50 underperforming distributors, cost $10M-$25M

**Due Diligence**:
1. Model distributor consolidation scenarios (retain all vs. consolidate to top 50 vs. consolidate to top 20)
2. Calculate brand value compensation costs (state-by-state, distributor-by-distributor)
3. Assess ABP's distribution strategy (does ABP want to consolidate? Or maintain 305 distributors?)

### 5. STANDARDS OF IDENTITY AND FORMULA COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

#### A. TTB Bourbon Formula Investigation

**Standards of Identity for Bourbon** (27 CFR § 5.22(b)(1)):
- Mash bill: ≥51% corn
- Distillation: ≤160 proof
- Barrel entry: ≤125 proof
- Aging: New charred oak barrels (no requirement on duration for "bourbon", but "straight bourbon" requires ≥2 years)
- Bottling: ≥80 proof
- **NO added coloring, flavoring, or blending materials except water**

**ASBC's Single Barrel Bourbon**:
- Formula approved 2019 (TTB Form 5100.51)
- **Mash bill**: 70% corn, 20% rye, 10% malted barley (complies ✓)
- **Aging**: 4 years in new charred oak barrels (complies ✓)
- **Production method**: Uses toasted wood staves inserted into barrels during aging (flavor enhancement technique)

**TTB Investigation** (September 2024):
- **Complaint**: Competitor alleged ASBC's bourbon contains "added flavoring" (toasted wood staves)
- **TTB position**: Investigating whether toasted wood staves constitute "added flavoring material" (prohibited) or are part of "new charred oak barrel" aging (permitted)
- **Industry precedent**: 
  - Some distillers use toasted wood staves (legal under TTB interpretation as "finishing" technique if staves are oak and meet new/charred requirements)
  - **BUT**: TTB has inconsistent policy (some interpretations say staves OK, others say prohibited)

**ASBC's Defense**:
- Toasted oak staves are part of "new charred oak barrel" aging (staves placed in barrels during aging, not after)
- Staves are oak (same wood as barrel), toasted (not charred, but heat-treated)
- Industry practice (many craft distillers use staves for flavor enhancement)

**TTB's Likely Determination**:
- **Unclear**: TTB policy on wood staves is ambiguous
- **Possible outcomes**:
  1. **Approve**: TTB determines staves permissible (formula remains approved, no action)
  2. **Deny formula**: TTB determines staves are "added flavoring" (suspend formula, recall bourbon, fine)
  3. **Request reformulation**: TTB allows ASBC to reformulate without staves, grandfather existing inventory

**Exposure if Formula Denied**:
- **Recall**: 85,000 bottles in market ($8.5M retail value, ~$4M wholesale cost to ASBC)
- **Fine**: $1K-$10K per violation (26 U.S.C. § 5687)
  - **Per formula violation**: $1K-$10K (single violation)
  - **OR per bottle**: $1K × 85,000 bottles = $85M (unlikely, but possible under statute)
  - **Realistic**: $10K-$100K fine (TTB typically fines per formula violation, not per bottle)
- **Reputational damage**: Bourbon recalled for non-compliance (negative press, consumer trust issues)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review TTB investigation file (complaint, ASBC response, TTB correspondence)
2. Engage TTB counsel (negotiate resolution before closing, ideally obtain clearance or settle)
3. Model scenarios: 
   - **Approved** (no impact)
   - **Denied, recall required** ($4M inventory loss + $10K-$100K fine = $4.1M-$4.2M)
   - **Reformulation allowed** (grandfather inventory, reformulate future production, $0 current impact)

#### B. Other Standards of Identity Compliance Review

**Spirits Standards** (27 CFR § 5.22):

**Vodka**: Distilled at ≥190 proof, filtered to remove distinctive character (neutral spirit)
- **ASBC's Artisan Vodka**: Complies (distilled 190 proof, charcoal filtered, no flavoring except flavored varieties)

**Gin**: Juniper berries as primary flavor, distilled at <190 proof or redistilled/flavored neutral spirit
- **ASBC's Northwest Gin**: Complies (botanical distillation, juniper-forward, 10 botanicals)

**Rye Whiskey**: ≥51% rye mash bill, aged in new charred oak, distilled ≤160 proof, barrel entry ≤125 proof, bottled ≥80 proof
- **ASBC's Rye Whiskey**: Complies (95% rye, 2-year aged, meets all requirements)

**Due Diligence**:
- Review all 42 formulas (verify compliance with standards of identity)
- Identify any other production techniques that could raise issues (wood chips, flavor additives, accelerated aging, etc.)

### 6. FEDERAL EXCISE TAX COMPLIANCE AND REDUCED RATE ELIGIBILITY

#### A. Beer Federal Excise Tax and Small Brewer Rate

**Beer FET Rates** (26 U.S.C. § 5051):
- $3.50/barrel: First 60,000 barrels (small brewer rate)
- $16/barrel: 60,001 - 2,000,000 barrels (mid-tier rate)
- $18/barrel: >2,000,000 barrels (large brewer rate)

**ASBC's Current FET**:
- Production: 485,000 barrels
- FET: (60,000 × $3.50) + (425,000 × $16) = $210K + $6.8M = **$7.01M annually**

**Controlled Group Rules** (26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(5)):
- All brewers in "controlled group" (>50% common ownership) share single $3.50 rate (60,000 barrels total, not per brewer)
- **Post-acquisition**: If ABP owns other breweries → ASBC + ABP breweries = controlled group → Share 60,000 barrel reduced rate

**ABP's Other Holdings**:
- Assume ABP owns 2 other craft breweries (Brewery A: 120,000 barrels, Brewery B: 80,000 barrels)
- **Controlled group**: ASBC 485K + Brewery A 120K + Brewery B 80K = **685,000 barrels total**

**FET Impact**:
- **Assignment options**: ABP can assign 60,000 barrel reduced rate among 3 breweries
  - **Option 1**: All to ASBC → (60K × $3.50) + (425K × $16) = $7.01M (no change)
  - **Option 2**: Split equally → 20K each brewery
    - ASBC: (20K × $3.50) + (465K × $16) = $70K + $7.44M = $7.51M (**$500K increase**)
  - **Option 3**: All to Brewery A (smallest) → ASBC pays full $16 rate on first 60K
    - ASBC: 485K × $16 = $7.76M (**$750K increase**)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Identify ABP's other beverage holdings (breweries, distilleries, wineries)
2. Calculate controlled group beer production (total barrels across all breweries)
3. Model FET assignment scenarios (optimize to minimize total FET)
4. Assess FET increase impact on ASBC profitability ($500K-$750K annual increase possible)

#### B. Spirits Federal Excise Tax and Small Distiller Rate

**Spirits FET Rates** (26 U.S.C. § 5001):
- $2.70/proof gallon: First 100,000 proof gallons (small distiller rate)
- $13.34/proof gallon: 100,001 - 22,130,000 proof gallons (mid-tier rate)
- $13.50/proof gallon: >22,130,000 proof gallons (large distiller rate)

**ASBC's Current FET**:
- Production: 100,000 proof gallons
- FET: 100,000 × $2.70 = **$270K annually** (all at reduced rate)

**Controlled Group Impact**:
- If ABP owns other distilleries → Controlled group shares 100,000 proof gallon reduced rate
- **Example**: ABP owns Distillery C (80,000 proof gallons)
  - Total: ASBC 100K + Distillery C 80K = 180,000 proof gallons
  - Reduced rate: 100,000 proof gallons (split between ASBC/Distillery C)
  - **ASBC FET**: (50K × $2.70) + (50K × $13.34) = $135K + $667K = **$802K** (**$532K increase**)

**Due Diligence**:
- Identify ABP's distillery holdings
- Calculate controlled group spirits production
- Model FET assignment and impact

### 7. ADVERTISING COMPLIANCE AND FTC HEALTH CLAIMS INVESTIGATION

#### A. Federal Trade Commission Investigation

**FTC Complaint** (May 2024):
- Allegations: ASBC made deceptive health claims in advertising (social media posts)
- **Posts**: 
  1. Instagram post (March 2024): "Artisan IPA contains antioxidants from hops — enjoy the health benefits of moderate beer consumption! #craftbeer #healthy"
  2. Facebook post (April 2024): "Our hops are rich in polyphenols, which support heart health. Drink responsibly and live well! #hophealth"

**FTC Position**:
- Health claims for alcoholic beverages are deceptive (FTC Act Section 5, unfair/deceptive practices)
- **No scientific consensus**: No competent and reliable scientific evidence that moderate alcohol consumption provides net health benefits
- **Beverage Alcohol Code**: Industry self-regulation prohibits health claims

**ASBC's Defense**:
- Posts were user-generated content (customer posts reposted by ASBC social media manager)
- **Immediate action**: Posts deleted within 48 hours of FTC complaint
- Implemented social media policy (prohibit health claims, review all posts before publishing, train social media staff)

**FTC Investigation Status**:
- ASBC submitted response (June 2024, cease and desist commitment, no future health claims)
- FTC reviewing (no final determination yet, expected Q1 2026)

**Exposure**:
- **Cease and desist order**: FTC requires ASBC to cease health claims (already done, no additional impact)
- **Civil penalty**: $10K-$100K (FTC Act Section 5(m)(1)(A), $50,120 per violation as of 2024, adjusted for inflation)
  - **Violations**: 2 posts (Instagram, Facebook) = 2 violations = $20K-$100K penalty
- **Corrective advertising**: FTC may require ASBC to run corrective ads ($50K-$200K cost)
  - "Previous ads claimed health benefits. These claims were not substantiated. Artisan IPA does not provide health benefits."

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review FTC investigation file (complaint, ASBC response, FTC correspondence)
2. Assess likelihood of penalty (ASBC's swift action, cooperation likely mitigates penalty to lower range $10K-$20K)
3. Review ASBC's advertising compliance program (social media policy, review procedures, training)
4. Model exposure ($10K-$20K penalty + $50K-$100K corrective advertising = $60K-$120K total)

#### B. Beverage Alcohol Code (BAC) Compliance

**Beverage Alcohol Code**:
- Industry self-regulation (beer, wine, spirits)
- Administered by Distilled Spirits Council (DISCUS), Beer Institute, Wine Institute

**BAC Provisions**:
1. **No health claims**: Cannot claim alcohol provides health benefits
2. **No appeals to minors**: Cannot use imagery, language, or settings appealing to persons under 21 (cartoon characters, school settings, playground imagery)
3. **Responsible depiction**: Show responsible consumption (no excessive drinking, intoxication, dangerous activities while drinking)
4. **21+ audience**: Advertising must be placed in media where ≥71.6% of audience is 21+ (TV, radio, print, digital)

**ASBC's Compliance**:
- Violated health claims (FTC investigation)
- **Due diligence**: Review all advertising (TV, radio, print, digital, social media, point-of-sale) for BAC compliance

**Due Diligence**:
- Conduct BAC compliance audit (review all advertising materials)
- Identify any other violations (appeals to minors, irresponsible depiction, <71.6% adult audience)

### 8. DRAM SHOP LIABILITY AND TAPROOM OPERATIONS RISK

#### A. Oregon Dram Shop Litigation (Smith v. ASBC)

**Case**: Smith v. Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company, LLC (Oregon Circuit Court, Multnomah County, filed July 2024)

**Background**:
- **Incident**: September 2023, drunk driving accident (Portland)
- **Drunk driver**: Defendant Jones consumed 5 beers at ASBC Portland taproom (6pm-9pm, 3 hours)
- **After leaving**: Jones drove, caused accident (9:30pm, 30 minutes after leaving taproom)
- **Injuries**: Plaintiff Smith (passenger in other vehicle), severe injuries ($850K medical expenses, permanent disability)

**Dram Shop Law** (Oregon ORS 471.565):
- Commercial servers (bars, restaurants, taprooms) liable for serving visibly intoxicated persons who cause injuries
- **Liability**: Server liable if served person who server knew or should have known was visibly intoxicated
- **Causation**: Intoxication must be proximate cause of injury (service at taproom caused/contributed to intoxication that caused accident)

**Plaintiff's Allegations**:
1. **Visible intoxication**: Jones was visibly intoxicated when served (slurred speech, unsteady gait, bloodshot eyes), taproom staff should have recognized intoxication and refused service
2. **Over-serving**: Jones consumed 5 beers in 3 hours (approximately 0.12% BAC at time of accident, based on blood test 1 hour post-accident)
3. **Negligent training**: ASBC failed to adequately train staff (Oregon requires Alcohol Server Education, but ASBC's training was minimal)
4. **Damages**: $850K medical + $1M-$3M pain/suffering (permanent disability, lost wages, loss of enjoyment of life)

**ASBC's Defense**:
1. **Not visibly intoxicated**: Jones appeared normal when served (no slurred speech, walked normally, engaged in coherent conversation), staff monitored patrons, Jones did not exhibit signs of intoxication
2. **Consumption after leaving**: Jones consumed additional alcohol at home before driving (30-minute gap between leaving taproom and accident, BAC 0.12% at accident could reflect post-taproom drinking)
3. **Adequate training**: All taproom staff completed Oregon-required Alcohol Server Education (OLCC-approved training, covers recognition of intoxication, refusal of service)
4. **Intervening cause**: Jones' decision to drive (not ASBC's service) was proximate cause of accident

**Expert Testimony**:
- **Plaintiff's expert** (toxicologist): BAC 0.12% at time of accident → Approximately 0.09% when left taproom (accounting for elimination rate 0.015%/hour) → Jones was intoxicated when left taproom
- **ASBC's expert**: Jones may have consumed additional alcohol after leaving (30-minute gap), BAC could have been 0.04-0.05% when left taproom (not visibly intoxicated), rose to 0.12% due to post-taproom consumption

**Status**: Discovery phase, expert depositions Q1 2026, trial Q2 2026

**Exposure**:
- **Medical expenses**: $850K (special damages, established)
- **Pain and suffering**: $1M-$3M (general damages, jury discretion)
- **Total**: $1.85M-$3.85M exposure
- **Joint and several liability**: Oregon has modified joint and several liability (defendant liable for full amount if >15% at fault, proportionate share if <15%)
  - **Jones** (primary defendant, 85% at fault): $1.57M-$3.27M
  - **ASBC** (15% at fault): $277K-$577K (but could be liable for full amount if Jones insolvent)

**Insurance**:
- **General liability**: $5M coverage, includes dram shop coverage
- **Retention**: $100K (ASBC pays first $100K, insurance covers above)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review litigation file (complaint, discovery, expert reports, depositions)
2. Assess liability (was Jones visibly intoxicated? Did ASBC over-serve? Training adequate?)
3. Review insurance coverage (GL policy, dram shop inclusion, limits, retention)
4. Model settlement scenarios ($500K-$1.5M settlement range vs. $1.85M-$3.85M verdict risk)

#### B. Taproom Operations and Server Training

**18 Taprooms**:
- Oregon: 8
- Colorado: 4
- North Carolina: 3
- Washington: 2
- California: 1

**Server Training Requirements** (state-by-state):

**Oregon**:
- **Alcohol Server Education** (ORS 471.542): Required for all servers/bartenders
- **Training**: OLCC-approved courses (recognize intoxication, check ID, refuse service, intervene)
- **Certification**: Valid 5 years, must renew

**Colorado**:
- **TIPS or ServSafe Alcohol**: Not legally required, but recommended
- **Responsible Vendor Program**: Voluntary, provides liability protection if completed

**North Carolina**:
- **Responsible Alcohol Seller Server (RASS)**: Required for all servers (ABC Commission-approved training)

**Washington**:
- **Mandatory Alcohol Server Training (MAST)**: Required for all servers (WSLCB-approved courses)

**California**:
- **RBS (Responsible Beverage Service) Training**: Required as of July 2022 (AB 1221)

**ASBC's Training**:
- All 950 taproom employees completed required state training
- **Additional training**: ASBC provides in-house training (recognize intoxication, cut-off procedures, ID verification, handle difficult situations)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Verify all 950 taproom employees have current certifications (Oregon Alcohol Server Education, CO TIPS, NC RASS, WA MAST, CA RBS)
2. Review ASBC's in-house training program (adequate? Covers all required topics?)
3. Assess other dram shop claims (any other pending/prior claims? Pattern of over-serving?)

### Risk Matrix
For each material finding:
- **Severity** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Probability** (%)
- **Quantified Exposure Range** ($M)
- **Regulatory/Litigation Timeline**
- **Mitigation Strategy**

### TTB Permits Transfer Roadmap
State-by-state timeline:
1. **Brewer's Notices** (3 facilities): TTB Form 5130.10, 60-90 days per facility, $150K bond each, background investigation (ABP principals)
2. **DSP Registration** (Portland distillery): TTB Form 5110.41, 90-120 days, $250K bond, 42 formulas transfer (bourbon investigation must resolve before closing)
3. **Winery Permit** (Hood River meadery): 60-90 days, $50K bond
4. **COLAs** (280 labels): Transfer if ASBC name unchanged, or re-apply if name change (60-90 days per COLA)
5. **Interim operation**: Production shutdown if TTB approvals delayed (file 90 days before closing, coordinate timing)

### Three-Tier Distribution Analysis
Critical findings:
1. **Federal tied house laws** (27 U.S.C. § 205, 27 CFR Part 6): Producer cannot own retailers, provide inducements, slotting fees prohibited
2. **Oregon OLCC investigation**: Free beer to 12 retailers ($6,048 value, $6K-$60K fine + license suspension 7-30 days possible)
3. **Self-distribution** (Oregon): 10,875 barrels self-distributed (15% of OR volume), requires OLCC transfer approval
4. **Taproom exception**: 18 taprooms tied to breweries/distillery (can sell own products on-premise), separate retail licenses required
5. **Compliance program**: Enhanced tied house training post-investigation, monthly audits, sales rep monitoring

### State ABC Licensing Matrix
50-state breakdown:
1. **Brewery licenses** (50 states): All states require change of control notification/approval, Tier 1 states (CA, NY, TX, FL, IL) 90-180 days
2. **Distillery licenses** (48 states, not UT/MS state monopolies): Similar timelines, background checks, financial review
3. **Retail licenses** (18 taprooms in OR/CO/NC/WA/CA): State ABC + local approvals (city, county, health permits)
4. **Disqualifying factors**: Felony convictions, tax delinquencies, prior license violations (ABP principals background check critical)
5. **Coordination**: File all 50 states simultaneously (90-120 days before closing), engage local counsel in Tier 1 states

### Distributor Franchise Law Assessment
State-by-state exposure:
1. **25 franchise law states**: CA, FL, TX, NY, IL, WI, NJ, MA, NC, VA, GA, OH, PA, MD, MO (good cause required, brand value compensation)
2. **85 distributors in franchise states**: ~60% of ASBC volume, termination requires good cause (material breach, insolvency, license loss)
3. **Compensation formulas**: TX 2-4× gross profit, WI 5-8× gross profit (perpetual rights), FL/CA varies (fair market value based on investment)
4. **Texas Lone Star litigation**: $2.8M brand value + $1.2M lost profits = $4M exposure (discovery ongoing, mediation Q1 2026)
5. **Consolidation costs**: If ABP consolidates 30-50 underperforming distributors → $10M-$25M brand value payments in franchise states

### Standards of Identity Compliance Report
Formula-by-formula review:
1. **Bourbon investigation**: Single Barrel Bourbon toasted wood staves (TTB investigating whether "added flavoring" prohibited or "new charred oak aging" permitted)
2. **Exposure if denied**: $4M inventory recall (85,000 bottles) + $10K-$100K fine (per formula violation, not per bottle)
3. **Resolution options**: (a) TTB approves (no impact), (b) reformulation allowed (grandfather inventory, $0 current impact), (c) denial/recall ($4.1M-$4.2M)
4. **Other formulas**: 41 other formulas comply with standards of identity (vodka, gin, rye, rum, liqueurs — no issues identified)
5. **Due diligence**: Resolve bourbon investigation before closing (settlement, withdrawal, or clearance)

### Federal Excise Tax Impact Analysis
Quantification of:
1. **Current FET**: Beer $7.01M, spirits $270K, wine $31K = $7.31M total annually
2. **Controlled group rules**: If ABP owns other breweries → Share 60,000 barrel reduced rate → ASBC FET increases $500K-$750K (beer)
3. **Spirits controlled group**: If ABP owns other distilleries → Share 100,000 proof gallon reduced rate → ASBC FET increases $532K (spirits)
4. **Total FET increase**: $500K-$1.3M annually (if controlled group with ABP's other holdings)
5. **Mitigation**: Assign reduced rates optimally (minimize total FET across ABP portfolio), model assignment scenarios

### Advertising Compliance and FTC Investigation
Assessment of:
1. **FTC health claims**: Instagram/Facebook posts claimed hops contain antioxidants, health benefits ($10K-$20K penalty likely)
2. **Corrective advertising**: FTC may require $50K-$100K corrective ads ("previous claims not substantiated")
3. **Total exposure**: $60K-$120K (penalty + corrective advertising)
4. **BAC Code compliance**: Review all advertising (no other health claims, no appeals to minors, responsible depiction, 71.6%+ adult audience)
5. **Social media policy**: Implemented post-investigation (prohibit health claims, review all posts, train staff)

### Dram Shop Liability and Taproom Risk
Findings on:
1. **Oregon Smith v. ASBC**: Drunk driving accident ($850K medical + $1M-$3M pain/suffering = $1.85M-$3.85M total exposure)
2. **Liability theory**: Served visibly intoxicated patron (Jones 5 beers, BAC 0.12% at accident), over-serving, inadequate training
3. **ASBC's defense**: Not visibly intoxicated, post-taproom consumption contributed to BAC, adequate OLCC training
4. **Settlement range**: $500K-$1.5M (vs. $1.85M-$3.85M verdict risk)
5. **Insurance**: $5M general liability (dram shop included), $100K retention

### Source Verification
All findings must cite:
- **TTB regulations**: 27 CFR Parts 1-40 (alcohol beverage regulations), Part 25 (beer), Part 19 (distilled spirits), Part 24 (wine), Part 5 (labeling/advertising), Part 6 (tied house)
- **Federal statutes**: 27 U.S.C. § 205 (tied house prohibitions), 26 U.S.C. §§ 5001, 5041, 5051 (federal excise tax), 27 U.S.C. § 215 (health warning labels)
- **State ABC laws**: Oregon ORS 471 (liquor control), Texas Alc. Bev. Code, California Bus. & Prof. Code, others
- **Franchise laws**: Texas Alc. Bev. Code § 102.75, Wisconsin Stat. § 135.02, others
- **Standards of identity**: 27 CFR § 5.22 (spirits), 27 CFR § 7.24 (beer)
- **FTC Act**: 15 U.S.C. § 45 (unfair/deceptive practices)

### Cross-Reference Architecture
Trace each finding to transaction provisions:
- **Conditions to closing**: TTB permit approvals (all 5 permits), state ABC approvals (all 118 licenses), bourbon investigation resolved (no recall required), Oregon tied house fine paid (<$20K)
- **Reps & warranties**: Valid TTB permits (3 brewery, 1 DSP, 1 winery, $450K bonds), valid state licenses (118 licenses active, no violations except disclosed), distributor agreements valid (305 distributors, TX Lone Star litigation disclosed), formulas approved (42 formulas except bourbon investigation)
- **Covenants**: File TTB transfer applications 90 days pre-closing, file state ABC applications 90-120 days pre-closing, resolve bourbon investigation, settle Oregon tied house (pay fine, implement corrective action)
- **Purchase price adjustment**: Texas Lone Star settlement, bourbon recall (if required), Oregon tied house fine, FTC penalty
- **Indemnification**: Pre-closing tied house violations, pre-closing formula violations (bourbon recall), pre-closing dram shop claims (Smith v. ASBC), FTC investigation

## SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. TTB Bourbon Formula Investigation Resolution — Pre-Closing Strategy

**Timeline Imperative**: Bourbon investigation must resolve before closing (cannot close with pending formula denial risk)

**Resolution Options**:

**Option 1: Negotiate Clearance**
- **Strategy**: Engage TTB counsel, provide technical documentation (wood staves are oak, part of aging vessel, not "added flavoring")
- **Supporting arguments**:
  - Industry precedent (other distillers use oak staves, TTB has approved in past)
  - Scientific analysis (staves are oak aging, not flavor additives)
  - Labeling disclosure ("finished with toasted oak" on label, consumers informed)
- **Timeline**: 30-60 days (negotiations with TTB, submit additional documentation, obtain clearance letter)
- **Outcome**: Formula approved, no recall, no fine ✓

**Option 2: Reformulate and Grandfather**
- **Strategy**: Submit new formula without wood staves, request TTB grandfather existing inventory
- **New formula**: Single Barrel Bourbon without toasted staves (standard 4-year barrel aging only)
- **Grandfather**: TTB allows ASBC to sell existing 85,000 bottles (no recall), future production uses new formula
- **Timeline**: 60-90 days (new formula approval)
- **Outcome**: No recall, no fine, future batches slightly different flavor profile

**Option 3: Withdraw Formula**
- **Strategy**: Withdraw Single Barrel Bourbon formula, discontinue product
- **Impact**: Lose $18M annual revenue (18% of spirits revenue), but avoid recall/fine
- **Downside**: Major product line discontinued, customer disappointment

**Option 4: Accept Recall**
- **Strategy**: If TTB denies, accept recall and fine
- **Costs**: $4M inventory + $10K-$100K fine = $4.1M-$4.2M
- **Timeline**: Immediate (post-denial, 30 days to complete recall)

**Recommended Approach**:
- Pursue Option 1 (negotiate clearance) immediately
- If unsuccessful by 30 days pre-closing → Pivot to Option 2 (reformulate and grandfather)
- **Closing condition**: Bourbon investigation resolved (clearance, reformulation, or withdrawal) before closing

**Due Diligence**:
1. Retain TTB regulatory counsel (experienced with formula approvals, spirits standards of identity)
2. Prepare technical documentation (wood stave composition, aging process, scientific rationale)
3. Engage TTB (request meeting, present case, negotiate resolution)
4. Set hard deadline (60 days pre-closing, if no resolution → reformulate or withdraw)

### 2. Distributor Franchise Law Consolidation Analysis

**ABP's Strategic Question**: Should ABP consolidate ASBC's 305 distributors (180 beer + 125 spirits) to larger national distributors?

**Current State**:
- **Top 4 distributors**: RNDC (18% volume), SGWS (14%), Reyes (12%), Ben E. Keith (8%) = 52% volume
- **145 smaller distributors**: 48% volume, fragmented, varying performance

**Consolidation Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Status Quo** (retain all 305 distributors)
- **Advantages**: No franchise law compensation costs, maintain existing relationships, avoid litigation risk
- **Disadvantages**: 305 relationships to manage, inconsistent performance, suboptimal market coverage

**Scenario 2: Consolidate to Top 20 Distributors**
- **Target**: Transition to 20 largest national/regional distributors (RNDC, SGWS, Reyes, Ben E. Keith, plus 16 strong regional distributors)
- **Terminate**: ~285 smaller distributors
- **Franchise law exposure** (85 distributors in 25 franchise law states):
  - Average gross profit: $400K per distributor
  - Compensation: 2.5× multiple (average across states)
  - **Total cost**: 85 distributors × $400K × 2.5 = **$85M**
- **Benefits**: Streamlined management (20 vs. 305 relationships), better market coverage, higher-performing distributors
- **Timeline**: 3-5 years (phased terminations, negotiate buyouts, litigate if necessary)

**Scenario 3: Consolidate Underperformers Only** (terminate 30-50 worst distributors)
- **Target**: Terminate bottom 30-50 distributors (poor sales, non-compliance, market coverage gaps)
- **Franchise law exposure** (assume 20-30 in franchise states):
  - **Total cost**: 25 distributors × $400K × 2.5 = **$25M**
- **Benefits**: Eliminate worst performers, optimize network without massive consolidation cost
- **Timeline**: 1-2 years

**Recommendation**: Scenario 3 (consolidate underperformers only)
- **Rationale**: Balances network optimization with manageable franchise law costs ($25M vs. $85M)
- **Post-acquisition**: Conduct distributor performance review (sales, market coverage, compliance), identify 30-50 underperformers, negotiate buyouts or litigate

**Due Diligence**:
1. Model all 3 scenarios (status quo, top 20, underperformers)
2. Calculate franchise law compensation costs (state-by-state, distributor-by-distributor)
3. Assess ABP's distribution strategy (aggressive consolidation? Or conservative optimization?)

### 3. Controlled Group FET Impact Mitigation

**Issue**: If ABP owns other breweries/distilleries, ASBC's FET could increase $500K-$1.3M annually due to controlled group rules

**Controlled Group Definition** (26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(5)):
- All brewers with ≥50% common ownership = single controlled group
- Controlled group shares single reduced FET rate (60,000 barrels beer, 100,000 proof gallons spirits)

**ABP's Holdings** (assume):
- ASBC: 485,000 barrels beer, 100,000 proof gallons spirits
- Brewery A: 120,000 barrels beer
- Brewery B: 80,000 barrels beer
- Distillery C: 80,000 proof gallons spirits
- **Total**: 685,000 barrels beer, 180,000 proof gallons spirits

**FET Assignment Options**:

**Beer** (60,000 barrel reduced rate):
- **Option 1**: All to ASBC → ASBC $7.01M (no change), Brewery A $1.92M, Brewery B $1.28M
  - **Total beer FET**: $10.21M
- **Option 2**: Split proportionally (ASBC 42,582 barrels, Brewery A 10,526 barrels, Brewery B 6,892 barrels)
  - ASBC: (42,582 × $3.50) + (442,418 × $16) = $149K + $7.08M = $7.23M (**$220K increase**)
  - Brewery A: (10,526 × $3.50) + (109,474 × $16) = $37K + $1.75M = $1.79M
  - Brewery B: (6,892 × $3.50) + (73,108 × $16) = $24K + $1.17M = $1.19M
  - **Total beer FET**: $10.21M (same, but ASBC pays more)
- **Option 3**: All to smallest (Brewery B) → Minimize ASBC's tax
  - ASBC: 485,000 × $16 = $7.76M (**$750K increase**)
  - Brewery A: 120,000 × $16 = $1.92M
  - Brewery B: (60,000 × $3.50) + (20,000 × $16) = $210K + $320K = $530K
  - **Total beer FET**: $10.21M (same, but ASBC pays most)

**Optimal Beer Assignment**: **Option 1** (all to ASBC, minimize ASBC's FET increase)

**Spirits** (100,000 proof gallon reduced rate):
- **Option 1**: All to ASBC → ASBC $270K (no change), Distillery C $1.07M
  - **Total spirits FET**: $1.34M
- **Option 2**: Split proportionally (ASBC 55,556 PG, Distillery C 44,444 PG)
  - ASBC: (55,556 × $2.70) + (44,444 × $13.34) = $150K + $593K = $743K (**$473K increase**)
  - Distillery C: (44,444 × $2.70) + (35,556 × $13.34) = $120K + $474K = $594K
  - **Total spirits FET**: $1.34M (same, but ASBC pays more)

**Optimal Spirits Assignment**: **Option 1** (all to ASBC, no increase)

**Overall Strategy**: Assign all reduced rates to ASBC (minimize ASBC's FET increase to $0)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Identify all ABP beverage holdings (breweries, distilleries, wineries)
2. Calculate total controlled group production (barrels, proof gallons, wine gallons)
3. Model FET assignment scenarios (optimize to minimize ASBC's increase)
4. Coordinate with ABP tax team (align FET assignment with overall ABP tax strategy)
