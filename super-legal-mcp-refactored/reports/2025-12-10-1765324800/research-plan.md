**Timeline:** 0-60 minutes
**Deliverables:** 12 specialist reports in session directory

### PHASE 2: Sequential Dependent Research (T13-T14)
**Objective:** Execute specialists requiring T1 context (SNM license transfer, security/safeguards details depend on NRC operating license structure)
**Timeline:** 60-75 minutes
**Dependencies:** T13-T14 require T1 (NRC regulatory framework) findings

### PHASE 3: Financial Aggregation (T15)
**Objective:** Run financial-analyst to aggregate all quantified risks, Monte Carlo scenarios
**Timeline:** 75-90 minutes
**Dependencies:** T15 requires T1-T14 findings (all quantified exposures identified)
**Decision Gate:** If total quantified exposure >$1M (guaranteed here given Price-Anderson $275.2M, DOE +$120M, etc.), invoke financial-analyst

### PHASE 4: Quality Assurance Review (V1)
**Objective:** Tiered parallel validation (research-review-analyst gate, then fact-validator + coverage-gap-analyzer + risk-aggregator in parallel)
**Timeline:** 90-100 minutes
**Decision Gate:** V1.1 (research-review-analyst) runs first; if PROCEED → V1.2-4 parallel; if REMEDIATE → spawn additional specialists

### PHASE 5: Memorandum Synthesis
**Objective:** Generate complete memorandum via modular architecture (10 section writers parallel + executive summary + citations + assembly + QA)
**Timeline:** 100-150 minutes
**Output:** final-memorandum.md (70,000-85,000 words, 300-400 footnotes)

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Document key assumptions for specialist context:

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| NRC approves license transfer | Historical precedent (PE-backed acquisitions approved if financial/technical qualified, foreign ownership compliant) | Deal-blocking if denied; must restructure ownership or abandon |
| APH retains GLNPC management | User prompt assumes management retention for technical qualifications | NRC may deny if new management unqualified; must demonstrate equivalent experience |
| No undisclosed NRC violations | Only disclosed: September 2024 emergency planning NOV (Severity IV), May 2024 reactor coolant leak (no violation) | Material violations could affect license transfer, increase NRC scrutiny |
| PPA with NIEC remains valid post-closing | Assume no change of control termination right or acquires NIEC consent | Revenue loss if NIEC terminates; affects financial qualifications |
| DOE Phase II judgment $120M-$180M recoverable | High probability (90-95%) based on precedent, Phase I success | If GLNPC loses or recovers less, dry cask costs not offset, affects cash flow |
| NDT investment returns continue 6.2% average | Historical 2015-2024 performance, diversified portfolio | Market downturn reduces NDT balance, increases premature shutdown shortfall risk |
| No nuclear incident triggering Price-Anderson | <1% annual probability, historical data (only TMI 1979, no assessment) | $275.2M assessment over 7 years ($42M annually) materially impacts EBITDA |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual NRC license transfer application content (not provided, will model based on 10 CFR 50.80 requirements and precedents)
- Actual PPA with NIEC (terms assumed based on user prompt description, ideally review full contract in data room)
- Actual NDT trust agreement (investment policy, trustee agreement terms, ideally review)
- APH's actual financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, credit facilities - model based on $3.2B equity, assume PE backing provides adequate resources)
- Actual foreign ownership veto rights (assume none based on prompt, but critical to verify in APH operating agreement)

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:**
1. Phase 1 (T1-T12 parallel) must complete before Phase 2 (T13-T14 sequential) can begin
2. All T1-T14 must complete before Phase 3 (T15 financial aggregation)
3. Phase 4 (V1 QA) runs after all research complete, tiered structure (V1.1 gate → V1.2-4 parallel)

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Foreign ownership (QIA 20%)**: Qatari sovereign wealth fund may trigger heightened NRC scrutiny beyond typical foreign investor; Negation Action Plan critical
2. **Premature shutdown scenarios**: Post-2035 merchant risk significant; if both units shut 2030 → $1.0B NDT shortfall requires APH parent guarantee
3. **Price-Anderson retrospective premium**: $275.2M contingent liability not on balance sheet but real cash flow risk if triggered; APH investors must understand
4. **DOE litigation timing**: Trial Q3 2026 during transaction process; judgment post-closing means APH receives recovery (favorable), but litigation risk remains

**Escalation Triggers:**
1. If T2 (foreign ownership) identifies QIA 20% as non-compliant with Section 103d → Flag immediately, may require ownership restructure
2. If T4 (Price-Anderson) identifies assessment probability >5% (higher than historical <1%) → Escalate to APH Investment Committee
3. If T5 (DOE litigation) assesses win probability <80% (lower than expected 90-95%) → Quantify downside if GLNPC loses Phase II
4. If T6 (NDT) identifies current balance <120% of NRC minimum (vs. stated 127%) → Verify data room records, may require increased contributions

**Research Intensity Justification:**
- $3.2B transaction (large, complex)
- Nuclear power plant (highly regulated, NRC/EPA/DOE jurisdiction, Price-Anderson liability unique to nuclear)
- Foreign ownership 45% (heightened scrutiny, Qatari sovereign wealth fund)
- Multiple pending litigations ($120M-$180M DOE, $50M-$150M class action, $1M+ ADEA)
- Long-term liabilities (spent fuel storage indefinite, decommissioning 2037/2041, PPA expiration 2035)
- Requires 10+ legal domains, 14-15 specialist reports, full memorandum 70,000-85,000 words

---

**RESEARCH PLAN STATUS:** READY FOR EXECUTION
**NEXT STEP:** Spawn T1-T12 specialists in parallel (Phase 1)
**ESTIMATED COMPLETION:** Phase 1-3 research 90 minutes, Phase 4-5 memorandum 60 minutes, total 150 minutes

### CROSS-REFERENCE PATTERNS (Mandatory in Memorandum)

Based on HIGH severity findings, these cross-domain connections MUST appear:

| # | Source Finding | Source Section | Target Section | Doctrine | Contract Provision |
|---|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | NPDES permit denial → NDT shortfall | IV.C Environmental | IV.F Decommissioning | 10 CFR 50.75 premature shutdown | APH parent guarantee up to $1.0B |
| 2 | QIA 20% foreign government → NRC approval | IV.B Foreign Ownership | IV.A NRC Regulatory | Section 103d "control/dominance" affects Section 184 approval | Enhanced NAP as binding license condition |
| 3 | DOE Phase II recovery → Dry cask costs | IV.E Spent Fuel/DOE | IV.F Decommissioning | Nuclear Waste Policy Act 42 USC 10222 | $200M PV dry cask - $138.75M DOE = $61.25M net |
| 4 | IRC § 754 seller cooperation → Deal value | IV.K Tax Structure | All Sections | IRC § 754 stepped-up basis election | **MANDATORY CLOSING CONDITION** (deal-blocking if refused) |
| 5 | Price-Anderson retrospective premium → NRC financials | IV.D Nuclear Liability | IV.A NRC Regulatory, IV.G Securities | 10 CFR 50.33(f) financial qualifications | Blackstone parent guarantee $316M |
| 6 | PPA expiration 2035 → Premature shutdown | IV.I Commercial Contracts | IV.F Decommissioning | Post-2035 merchant risk increases voluntary shutdown probability | Correlation ρ = 0.65 with NPDES risk |
| 7 | Management retention → Technical qualifications | IV.J Employment/Labor | IV.A NRC Regulatory | 10 CFR 50.40(b) technical qualifications | $2M-$3M CNO retention bonus within 30 days |
| 8 | Peterson age discrimination → WARN obligations | IV.H Litigation | IV.J Employment/Labor | ADEA disparate impact + WARN Act 29 USC 2101 | Additional layoffs trigger 60-day notice requirement |
| 9 | Foreign nationals access authorization → Vital areas | IV.B Foreign Ownership | IV.L Security/Safeguards | 10 CFR 73.56 access authorization program | CPPIB/QIA Board prohibited from reactor control room, spent fuel pool, ECCS |
| 10 | CFIUS mandatory declaration → NRC NAP harmonization | IV.B Foreign Ownership | IV.A NRC Regulatory | 31 CFR 800.401 (QIA = foreign government in TID) | CFIUS mitigation agreement parallel to NRC NAP |

**Cross-Reference Checklist for Section Writers:**

- [ ] IV.C → IV.F: NPDES permit denial triggers premature shutdown scenarios with $480M-$1.0B NDT shortfall
- [ ] IV.B → IV.A: QIA 20% foreign ownership affects Section 184 license transfer approval under Section 103d
- [ ] IV.E → IV.F: DOE Phase II recovery +$138.75M offsets dry cask costs $200M PV → $61.25M net exposure
- [ ] IV.K → ALL: IRC § 754 election is mandatory closing condition (eliminates $1.0B value driver if refused)
- [ ] IV.D → IV.A, IV.G: Price-Anderson $316M contingent liability affects NRC financial qualifications and securities disclosure
- [ ] IV.I → IV.F: PPA expiration 2035 creates merchant risk increasing premature shutdown probability 30-50% (2036-2040)
- [ ] IV.J → IV.A: Management retention (CNO/Plant Manager/Ops Manager) critical for NRC technical qualifications (70-80% denial risk if depart)
- [ ] IV.H → IV.J: Peterson age discrimination case affects future RIF decisions under WARN Act (additional layoffs trigger 60-day notice)
- [ ] IV.B → IV.L: Foreign nationals access authorization restrictions under 10 CFR 73.56 (CPPIB/QIA Board excluded from vital areas)
- [ ] IV.B → IV.A: CFIUS mandatory declaration (31 CFR 800.401) must harmonize with NRC NAP (both address QIA 20% foreign government ownership)

**Pattern Count:** 10 mandatory cross-references

**Usage:** memo-section-writers should check off these cross-references as they write. memo-executive-summary-writer should verify all are present.

### GAPS REQUIRING REMEDIATION

**NO CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED** requiring additional specialist research before proceeding to V1.2-4.

Minor gaps (do not require remediation):
- ANI/NEIL policy-specific terms (exclusions, endorsements) rely on industry-standard estimates rather than certified copies from data room
  - **Impact:** Minimal - $500M ANI primary layer and NEIL property coverage are NRC regulatory requirements (10 CFR Part 140)
  - **Recommendation:** Actual policy review during post-QA data room access; does not affect research completeness for memorandum synthesis
- PPA with NIEC full contract text not provided
  - **Impact:** Low - Assumptions are reasonable and conservative; change-of-control provisions analyzed based on industry-standard utility PPAs
  - **Recommendation:** Contract language verification during definitive agreement negotiation; does not impair risk quantification accuracy
- APH consolidated financial statements not verified
  - **Impact:** Low - Blackstone Infrastructure Partners $98B AUM and combined sponsor $1.9T AUM provide ample financial capacity demonstration
  - **Recommendation:** NRC pre-application meeting will confirm specific documentation requirements; does not affect 85-90% approval probability assessment
