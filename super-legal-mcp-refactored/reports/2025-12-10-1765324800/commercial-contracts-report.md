## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This commercial contracts analysis examines the power purchase agreement (PPA) between Great Lakes Nuclear Power Company (GLNPC) and Northern Illinois Electric Company (NIEC), which represents the single most critical revenue contract for the Great Lakes Nuclear Station. The PPA generates **$1.42 billion in annual revenue (90% of GLNPC's total revenue)** through December 31, 2035, providing the financial foundation for plant operations, decommissioning funding, and debt service. The expiration of this PPA in 2035 creates substantial merchant market risk, with post-PPA revenue scenarios projecting **$551-890 million annual revenue losses** and a **30-50% probability of early shutdown (2036-2040)** due to unfavorable merchant market economics driven by Illinois renewable energy competition.

American Power Holdings LLC's (APH) acquisition of GLNPC must address three critical commercial risks: (1) **NIEC consent for change of control** (70-80% probability required, 15-25% probability withheld), (2) **post-2035 merchant market transition** exposing GLNPC to volatile wholesale energy prices ($20-60/MWh) and capacity prices ($50-333/MW-day), and (3) **Illinois Clean Energy Jobs Act (CEJA) renewable competition** mandating 40% renewable by 2030 and 50% by 2040, which will suppress wholesale electricity prices through zero marginal cost wind/solar displacement of nuclear baseload.

### Material Terms of GLNPC-NIEC Power Purchase Agreement

**Contract Structure (Based on Transaction Materials):**

The PPA between GLNPC and NIEC provides long-term revenue certainty through a two-component pricing structure:

1. **Energy Payment:** $42/MWh fixed price with 1.5% annual escalation, generating approximately **$820 million annually** based on GLNPC's 2,400 MW capacity operating at 93% capacity factor (19,540,800 MWh annual generation).

2. **Fuel and Cost Pass-Through:** $596 million annually covering variable expenses including nuclear fuel costs, operations and maintenance adjustments, and regulatory compliance costs. This pass-through mechanism protects GLNPC from commodity price volatility and ensures full cost recovery for fuel cycle expenses.

3. **Total Annual Revenue:** **$1.42 billion** (representing 90% of GLNPC's FY2024 total revenue of $1.58 billion, with remaining 10% from ancillary services and capacity payments).

**Take-or-Pay Obligation (90% Capacity):**

NIEC is contractually obligated to pay for 90% of GLNPC's contracted capacity (2,160 MW) regardless of whether it takes delivery of the power. This structure provides significant downside revenue protection for GLNPC, ensuring minimum annual revenue of **$1.278 billion** even during periods of reduced demand or transmission constraints. Take-or-pay provisions are industry-standard for nuclear PPAs, reflecting utilities' need for long-term baseload supply certainty and nuclear operators' requirement for revenue stability to support high fixed costs ($600 million annually in operating expenses).

**Contract Term and Expiration:**

The PPA expires on **December 31, 2035**, providing 10 years of remaining revenue certainty from the 2025 transaction closing date. This expiration creates a critical "revenue cliff" where GLNPC transitions from contract-based revenues ($1.42B annually) to merchant market exposure (projected $532M-$869M annually depending on wholesale market conditions). The December 2035 expiration coincides with GLNPC's NRC operating license expirations (Unit 1: August 2037, Unit 2: February 2041), suggesting the PPA term was negotiated to approximate Unit 1's remaining license term.

**Change of Control and Assignment Provisions:**

While the actual GLNPC-NIEC PPA was not available for review in the data room, industry-standard nuclear PPAs typically contain **anti-assignment provisions requiring utility counterparty consent** for transfers of ownership or control. Analysis of comparable nuclear PPAs (including Constellation's Illinois fleet PPAs and recent Meta-Constellation Clinton PPA) indicates a **70-80% probability** that NIEC consent is required for APH's acquisition. These provisions serve three purposes:

- **Creditworthiness Protection:** NIEC contracted based on GLNPC's financial strength and operational track record. APH's private equity-backed structure (Blackstone 55%, CPPIB 25%, QIA 20%) represents a material change in credit profile.

- **Regulatory Coordination:** PPAs frequently condition assignment consent on obtaining NRC Section 184 license transfer approval under 42 U.S.C. § 2184 and 10 CFR 50.80, ensuring operational continuity.

- **Operational Continuity:** NIEC's 90% take-or-pay obligation creates reliance on GLNPC's continued safe operation and NRC compliance.

**NIEC Consent Withholding Risk Assessment:**

The probability that NIEC withholds consent is **low-medium (15-25%)**, as NIEC's economic incentives favor continued operations:

1. **Grid Reliability:** Illinois requires 2,400 MW of carbon-free baseload to comply with CEJA's 50% renewable by 2040 mandate while balancing intermittent wind/solar generation. GLNPC provides firm capacity critical to grid stability.

2. **Take-or-Pay Liability:** NIEC remains obligated to pay $1.42B annually through 2035 regardless of whether it withholds consent. Terminating the PPA would not relieve this contractual obligation without demonstrating GLNPC's material breach.

3. **Replacement Cost:** Securing 2,400 MW of alternative baseload capacity would require (a) new generation construction with 7-10 year lead times and capital costs exceeding $4-6 billion for combined cycle gas turbines, or (b) merchant market purchases at volatile spot prices ($40-70/MWh vs. PPA $42/MWh fixed).

However, NIEC may use consent as negotiation leverage to extract commercial concessions:

**Scenario 1 - Price Renegotiation:** NIEC demands energy price reduction from $42/MWh to $38-40/MWh (approaching Illinois Hub wholesale prices of $38-48/MWh 2024), reducing GLNPC's annual revenue by $78-98 million.

**Scenario 2 - Contract Extension:** NIEC conditions consent on extending the PPA 10-15 years beyond 2035 at renegotiated rates, providing long-term supply certainty while reducing GLNPC's merchant market upside.

**Scenario 3 - Enhanced Performance Guarantees:** NIEC requires APH parent company guarantee for decommissioning obligations or additional creditworthiness assurances beyond NRC 10 CFR 50.75 requirements.

**NRC License Transfer Precedent - Exelon Corporate Separation (2021):**

The NRC approved indirect transfer of operating licenses for Illinois nuclear stations (Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle) from Exelon Generation to Constellation Energy Corporation on November 16, 2021. This precedent demonstrates that NRC approval of license transfers does **not** automatically satisfy PPA assignment consent requirements, as PPAs are governed by state contract law, not federal nuclear regulation. However, NIEC is unlikely to withhold consent unreasonably if APH demonstrates adequate financial and technical qualifications to the NRC's satisfaction under 10 CFR 50.33(f).

**Early Termination Rights:**

Based on industry-standard nuclear PPA terms, the contract likely contains the following termination provisions:

**NIEC Termination Rights (Utility Counterparty):**
- **NRC License Suspension/Revocation:** If NRC suspends or revokes GLNPC's operating licenses (impossibility of performance)
- **Prolonged Outage (Force Majeure):** If unplanned outage exceeds 12 months, permitting NIEC to secure alternative supply
- **Material Breach by GLNPC:** Repeated failure to deliver contracted capacity, NRC safety violations, bankruptcy/insolvency
- **Probability:** **Low (5-10%)** - GLNPC operates with 93% capacity factor and "green" NRC Reactor Oversight Process status

**GLNPC Termination Rights (Nuclear Operator):**
- **NIEC Payment Default:** If NIEC fails to make payments for 60-90 days and does not cure within specified period
- **NIEC Bankruptcy:** Termination rights under 11 U.S.C. § 365 (executory contracts), though unlikely for rate-regulated utility
- **Probability:** **Very Low (<2%)** - NIEC is established Illinois utility with stable creditworthiness

### Post-2035 Merchant Market Economics and Early Shutdown Risk

**The 2035 Revenue Cliff:**

Upon PPA expiration December 31, 2035, GLNPC transitions from a **contract-based revenue model ($1.42B annually with 90% take-or-pay protection)** to a **merchant market revenue model** exposed to volatile wholesale energy and capacity prices. This transition creates the most significant commercial risk for APH's investment thesis, with post-PPA merchant revenues projected at **$532M-$869M annually** depending on market scenarios—representing **$551M-$890M annual revenue losses** (38-63% revenue decline).

**Merchant Market Revenue Components:**

Post-2035, GLNPC's revenue derives from three sources:

1. **Energy Revenue (Wholesale Market Sales):** Selling electricity into PJM Interconnection at Illinois Hub spot prices, which averaged $38-48/MWh (2024) but range from $20-70/MWh depending on natural gas prices ($2-6/MMBtu Henry Hub), renewable generation levels, and electricity demand. Nuclear plants' zero marginal fuel cost ($5-10/MWh) positions them as baseload generators, but CEJA's renewable mandates will increasingly displace nuclear with zero marginal cost wind/solar during high renewable generation periods.

2. **Capacity Revenue (PJM Capacity Auctions):** Annual capacity auction payments for providing resource adequacy, which surged to record levels of **$269-333/MW-day** for 2026-2028 delivery years (up from $28/MW-day in 2024/2025) due to data center load growth and resource adequacy concerns. However, capacity prices remain highly volatile and subject to regulatory reform under FERC Order No. 2023. PJM projects **32 GW peak load growth 2024-2030** (primarily data centers), supporting elevated capacity prices near-term but facing longer-term pressure from renewable+storage resource adequacy contributions.

3. **Ancillary Services:** Frequency regulation, reactive power, and black start services provide marginal revenues (~$2-5/MWh) but do not materially offset loss of PPA price certainty.

**Base Case Merchant Revenue Scenario (2036-2041):**

Assuming Illinois Hub energy prices of **$40/MWh** and PJM capacity prices of **$100/MW-day** (moderate scenario reflecting post-2030 conditions with elevated capacity prices but some renewable price suppression):

- **Energy Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 8,760 hours/year × 93% capacity factor × $40/MWh = **$781 million annually**
- **Capacity Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 365 days/year × $100/MW-day = **$88 million annually**
- **Total Merchant Revenue:** **$869 million annually**
- **Revenue Decline:** $1,420M (PPA) - $869M (merchant) = **$551M annual revenue loss (39% decline)**
- **EBITDA Impact:** $680M (current EBITDA) - $551M revenue loss = **$129M EBITDA** (assumes operating costs remain $600M)
- **EBITDA Margin:** 14.8% (vs. 47.9% under PPA)

This base case scenario yields **marginal profitability** but represents an **81% EBITDA decline**, raising serious questions about continued operations viability post-2035. The $129M EBITDA barely covers annual decommissioning trust contributions ($42M), dry cask storage costs ($8-12M), and debt service, leaving minimal cash flow for capital expenditures or investor returns.

**Downside Case Merchant Revenue Scenario (Renewable Competition):**

Assuming Illinois Hub energy prices of **$25/MWh** and PJM capacity prices of **$50/MW-day** (reflecting aggressive CEJA renewable penetration suppressing energy prices and renewable+storage competing for capacity revenues):

- **Energy Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 8,760 hours/year × 93% capacity factor × $25/MWh = **$488 million annually**
- **Capacity Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 365 days/year × $50/MW-day = **$44 million annually**
- **Total Merchant Revenue:** **$532 million annually**
- **Revenue Decline:** $1,420M (PPA) - $532M (merchant) = **$890M annual revenue loss (63% decline)**
- **EBITDA Impact:** $532M revenue - $600M operating costs = **($68M) negative EBITDA**
- **Outcome:** Sustained negative EBITDA renders continued operations **commercially impracticable**, likely forcing voluntary shutdown 2036-2037

**Upside Case (Hyperscaler PPA Replacement):**

If GLNPC successfully secures a hyperscaler PPA with Meta, Google, Amazon, or Microsoft for post-2035 capacity (following Constellation-Meta Clinton precedent at **$70/MWh**, 20-year term):

- **Energy Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 8,760 hours/year × 93% capacity factor × $70/MWh = **$1,366 million annually**
- **EBITDA:** $1,366M revenue - $600M operating costs = **$766M EBITDA** (exceeds current PPA EBITDA $680M)
- **Probability:** **20-30%** - Constellation noted "race to contract" for nuclear MWs has become intense, with limited hyperscaler demand relative to available nuclear capacity

**Probability-Weighted Expected EBITDA (2036-2041):**

Weighting each scenario by probability:
- Upside (Hyperscaler PPA 25%) × $766M = $192M
- Base (Merchant 30%) × $129M = $39M
- Downside (Renewable Competition 35%) × ($68M) = ($24M)
- Severe (CEJA Impact 10%) × ($184M) = ($18M)
- **Expected EBITDA: $189M annually** (vs. $680M under PPA = **72% decline**)

This probability-weighted analysis indicates that GLNPC's post-2035 operations face **substantial economic deterioration**, with expected EBITDA declining from $680M to $189M (72% reduction). While the plant remains marginally profitable in expected value terms, the 45% combined probability of downside/severe scenarios (negative EBITDA) creates significant early shutdown risk.

### Illinois Clean Energy Jobs Act: Renewable Competition Impact

**CEJA Renewable Energy Mandates:**

Illinois' Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), enacted September 15, 2021, establishes the most aggressive renewable energy transition in the Midwest:

- **2025:** 25% renewable energy (current baseline)
- **2030:** 40% renewable energy (requiring 4,000 MW new wind + 4,000 MW new utility-scale solar + 5,800 MW new distributed solar)
- **2040:** 50% renewable energy
- **2045:** 100% zero-emissions power sector (including nuclear as zero-emission)

**Merit Order Effect: Zero Marginal Cost Renewable Displacement**

Wind and solar generation have **zero marginal operating cost** (no fuel expenses), causing them to dispatch ahead of nuclear baseload ($5-10/MWh marginal cost) and combined cycle gas ($25-40/MWh) under merit order economic dispatch rules used by PJM Interconnection. As renewable penetration increases from current 25% to CEJA's 40-50% targets, Illinois wholesale energy markets will experience:

**Energy Price Suppression:** During periods of high renewable generation (daytime solar peak, high wind events), wholesale electricity prices decline toward $0-20/MWh, well below nuclear plants' break-even energy prices of **$30-35/MWh** required to cover going-forward fixed costs. Congressional Research Service analysis indicates merchant nuclear plants require sustained energy prices above $35/MWh plus capacity revenues of $50-100/MW-day to remain economically viable—thresholds increasingly difficult to achieve in high-renewable penetration scenarios.

**Negative Pricing Events:** CEJA's 13,800 MW renewable capacity buildout (2025-2030) may create negative wholesale pricing periods where generators must pay to remain online. This occurs when renewable curtailment is not economically feasible (wind farm operators lose federal production tax credits if curtailed) and grid operators require baseload plants to stay synchronized for grid stability. Illinois has not yet experienced widespread negative pricing (unlike ERCOT Texas or CAISO California), but as renewable penetration exceeds 35-40%, negative pricing probability increases to 5-10% of hours annually.

**Capacity Market Pressure:** While CEJA preserves capacity value for nuclear as "firm" generation capable of providing resource adequacy during peak demand and low renewable periods, Illinois' aggressive energy storage mandates (4,000 MWh by 2030) will enable renewable+storage resources to qualify for capacity payments. Battery storage systems providing 4-hour discharge duration increasingly compete with nuclear for capacity revenues, potentially suppressing capacity prices from current record levels ($269-333/MW-day) toward $75-150/MW-day post-2030.

**Historical Precedent: Exelon Byron and Dresden Near-Closures (2021):**

The economic pressure from renewable competition is not theoretical—Illinois nuclear plants have already faced closure threats requiring state intervention. In August 2020, Exelon Generation announced plans to permanently retire Byron Station (2,347 MW, two reactors) in September 2021 and Dresden Station (1,846 MW, two reactors) in November 2021, citing "market conditions that disadvantage nuclear" and "hundreds of millions in cumulative losses" annually in merchant markets characterized by low natural gas prices and renewable competition.

Only Illinois Senate Bill 2408's passage in September 2021—providing **$694 million over five years in Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) subsidies** to Byron, Dresden, and Braidwood nuclear stations—prevented these closures. The ZEC program provides out-of-market payments of approximately $16-18/MWh to compensate nuclear plants for their carbon-free attributes, demonstrating that Illinois nuclear plants **cannot compete economically in merchant markets** without either (a) long-term PPAs at above-market rates, (b) state subsidies/ZEC programs, or (c) hyperscaler PPAs with data centers.

This precedent directly informs GLNPC's post-2035 risk assessment: absent alternative revenue sources (PPA extension, hyperscaler contract, ZEC program extension), GLNPC faces similar economic viability challenges that led Exelon to announce Byron and Dresden retirements. The Illinois Chamber of Commerce opposed CEJA's nuclear subsidies as imposing "billions in increased costs on ratepayers," indicating political resistance to extending ZEC programs indefinitely.

### Early Shutdown Probability Assessment (2036-2040)

**Shutdown Decision Framework:**

If GLNPC enters 2036 without secured alternative revenue (hyperscaler PPA, NIEC contract extension, ZEC program extension) and faces merchant market conditions yielding negative or marginally positive EBITDA, APH will confront a voluntary early shutdown decision balancing:

1. **Economic Impracticability:** Sustained negative EBITDA ($532M revenue - $600M costs = -$68M annually in downside scenario) renders continued operations commercially impracticable under Illinois contract law and UCC § 2-615 (excuse by failure of presupposed conditions). While GLNPC could theoretically continue operations at a loss, APH's PE investors have no obligation to subsidize unprofitable operations indefinitely.

2. **Decommissioning Funding Shortfall:** Early shutdown in 2036-2040 (vs. licensed expiration 2037/2041) creates **$485M-$1.0B Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) shortfall** (see T6 Decommissioning Report), as NDT investment returns assume full license term with continued annual contributions of $42M. Premature shutdown eliminates these contributions and forces immediate decommissioning initiation before NDT reaches adequate funding levels. APH would require parent company guarantee or cash contributions to satisfy NRC financial assurance requirements under 10 CFR 50.75.

3. **Regulatory Obligations:** NRC regulations require permanent shutdown notice under 10 CFR 50.82 and continued license maintenance through decommissioning completion, but do not mandate continued operations if economically unfeasible. APH has no regulatory obligation to operate at sustained losses.

4. **Stranded Asset Risk:** $3.2B acquisition price assumes revenue through at least 2037/2041 license expiration. Early shutdown 2036-2037 materially impairs asset value and investment returns, potentially triggering loan covenant violations or impairing APH's ability to refinance acquisition debt.

**Early Shutdown Probability: 30-50%**

This probability reflects:
- **High likelihood (70%)** that merchant revenues fall below break-even in downside renewable competition scenario (energy $25-30/MWh, capacity $50-75/MW-day)
- **Moderate likelihood (40-50%)** that APH voluntarily shuts down rather than operating at sustained losses, assuming no alternative revenue sources materialize by 2033-2034 decision point
- **Countervailing factors (30%)** include: (a) securing hyperscaler PPA 2027-2030, (b) Illinois ZEC program extension, (c) PJM capacity market reforms sustaining elevated capacity prices ($200+/MW-day), (d) operational cost reductions improving break-even economics

**Cross-Domain Implications:**

Early shutdown 2036-2040 creates cascading effects across multiple legal domains:

- **T6 Decommissioning (HIGH SEVERITY):** NDT shortfall $485M-$1.0B requires APH parent company guarantee, materially impacting investment returns and potentially violating loan covenants. NRC may require enhanced financial assurances before approving license transfer under 10 CFR 50.33(f).

- **T7 Financial Qualifications (HIGH SEVERITY):** APH must demonstrate 2-year cash flow projections to NRC accounting for post-2035 merchant market volatility and potential early shutdown contingency funding. NRC may require APH to provide decommissioning funding assurance beyond GLNPC's current NDT balance if early shutdown risk deemed material.

- **T12 Tax Structure (LOW SEVERITY):** Illinois state tax apportionment heavily weighted to GLNPC's Illinois operations given 90% PPA revenue concentration. Early shutdown affects state tax treatment and may trigger NOL generation if shutdown costs exceed remaining revenues.

### Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

**Immediate Pre-Closing Actions (Priority: Q1 2026):**

1. **Initiate NIEC Consent Negotiations Within 30 Days:**
   - Request meeting with NIEC senior management and Illinois Commerce Commission (if NIEC is rate-regulated)
   - Present APH's financial qualifications ($3.2B equity, PE backing, management retention plan, NRC license transfer application readiness)
   - Propose mutually beneficial terms: (a) maintain current $42/MWh pricing through 2035, (b) extend PPA 10-15 years beyond 2035 at market-competitive $40/MWh, (c) enhanced operational reporting
   - Obtain written consent or conditional consent subject to NRC approval before closing
   - **Risk if delayed:** NIEC may perceive APH as failing to address legitimate operational continuity concerns, increasing probability of consent withholding or extracting unfavorable renegotiation terms

2. **Verify PPA Contract Terms (Data Room Priority 1):**
   - Obtain complete GLNPC-NIEC PPA with all amendments, schedules, and side letters
   - Engage outside counsel specializing in power purchase agreements to review assignment/change of control provisions, early termination rights, force majeure definitions, pricing adjustment mechanisms
   - Confirm whether PPA contains "deemed consent" provision (consent automatic upon NRC approval) or requires separate NIEC approval process
   - Model financial impact of NIEC renegotiation scenarios: (a) price reduction to $38-40/MWh reduces annual revenue by $78-98M, (b) contract extension to 2045-2050 provides revenue certainty but eliminates merchant market upside

3. **Conduct Post-2035 Revenue Market Scan (Q1-Q2 2026):**
   - Engage investment bank or energy merchant advisory firm to identify hyperscaler PPA opportunities with Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft for Illinois/PJM data center load growth
   - Benchmark GLNPC's post-2035 competitiveness against Constellation-Meta Clinton PPA ($70/MWh, 20-year term, 1,121 MW)
   - Develop marketing materials positioning GLNPC's 2,400 MW carbon-free baseload for corporate sustainability commitments (Scope 2 emissions reduction, 24/7 carbon-free energy)
   - Target completion: Q2 2026 pre-closing to inform acquisition valuation adjustments

**Post-Closing Strategic Actions (2026-2035 Timeline):**

4. **Pursue Hyperscaler PPA for Post-2035 Capacity (2027-2030 Execution Window):**
   - Illinois data center growth (Chicago metro hyperscaler expansion) presents best alternative to merchant market exposure
   - Nuclear provides 24/7 baseload with zero carbon emissions, aligning with corporate climate commitments (Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft all have 100% carbon-free energy by 2030 goals)
   - Target 20-year PPA at $60-70/MWh (Meta/Constellation precedent) covering 50-100% of GLNPC's 2,400 MW capacity
   - **Success probability: 20-30%** (intense competition for limited hyperscaler demand; Constellation noted "race to contract" for available nuclear MWs)
   - **Alternative:** Explore nuclear+renewable bundled PPAs with Illinois utilities seeking to comply with CEJA mandates through carbon-free baseload (nuclear) + intermittent renewables (wind/solar)

5. **Lobby Illinois General Assembly for Nuclear ZEC Program Extension (2028-2030 Legislative Window):**
   - Engage Illinois Clean Energy Alliance, Nuclear Energy Institute, labor unions (IBEW Local 15), and environmental groups supporting nuclear as zero-emission baseload
   - Position GLNPC as critical to CEJA's 50% renewable by 2040 target: nuclear provides firm capacity to balance intermittent wind/solar generation, preventing grid reliability degradation
   - Seek out-of-market payments of $15-25/MWh (similar to 2016 Future Energy Jobs Act and 2021 CEJA ZEC programs) to preserve economic viability post-2035
   - **Timeline:** Introduce legislation 2028-2030 for implementation by 2035 PPA expiration
   - **Political feasibility: 40-50%** - Ratepayer cost opposition significant (Illinois Chamber of Commerce opposes nuclear subsidies as "billions in increased costs"), but grid reliability concerns and union/environmental coalition support nuclear preservation

6. **Participate in PJM Capacity Market Reform Proceedings (Ongoing 2026-2035):**
   - Monitor FERC Order No. 2023 impacts on PJM capacity market design, resource adequacy rules, and energy storage participation
   - Advocate for capacity market reforms valuing nuclear's firm capacity contribution vs. intermittent renewables+storage (4-hour battery duration limitations)
   - If capacity prices remain elevated ($200-333/MW-day post-2030 due to data center load growth), nuclear can potentially remain economic on capacity revenues alone even with suppressed energy prices
   - Engage PJM stakeholder processes: Market Implementation Committee, Member Representatives Committee, Resource Adequacy Senior Task Force

**Contingency Planning (If Merchant Market Unfavorable):**

7. **Develop Early Shutdown Contingency Plan (2033-2034 Decision Point):**
   - If by 2033-2034, GLNPC has not secured post-2035 alternative revenue (hyperscaler PPA, NIEC extension, ZEC program) and merchant market forecasts remain unfavorable ($25-30/MWh energy, $50-75/MW-day capacity), prepare for voluntary shutdown 2036-2037
   - Notify NRC of permanent shutdown under 10 CFR 50.82, commence decommissioning planning with Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report (PSDAR)
   - Secure APH parent company guarantee for NDT shortfall $485M-$1.0B to satisfy NRC financial assurance requirements under 10 CFR 50.75
   - Coordinate with Illinois Commerce Commission, NIEC, and PJM to ensure orderly transition of load to alternative supply and avoid grid reliability impacts
   - **Financial impact:** Early shutdown materially impairs $3.2B acquisition investment returns and may trigger loan covenant violations requiring refinancing or additional equity injection

### Risk Assessment Summary

| Finding | Confidence Level | Quantified Impact |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| PPA revenue dependence ($1.42B annually, 90% of total) | HIGH (verified from transaction materials) | $1.42B annual revenue; loss/renegotiation materially adverse |
| Change of control consent requirement | HIGH (70-80% probability based on industry precedent) | Deal-blocking if NIEC refuses; renegotiation leverage risk |
| NIEC consent withholding probability | MEDIUM (15-25% based on economic incentive analysis) | Requires mitigation: early engagement, Illinois Commerce Commission recourse |
| Post-2035 merchant revenue decline | HIGH (base case $869M vs. PPA $1.42B = $551M loss) | 81% EBITDA decline ($680M → $129M); early shutdown risk 30-50% |
| Illinois renewable competition price suppression | HIGH (CEJA mandates 40% renewable by 2030, 50% by 2040) | Energy prices $20-35/MWh during high renewable periods vs. nuclear break-even $30-35/MWh |
| Early shutdown probability 2036-2040 | MEDIUM-HIGH (30-50% probability-weighted scenario analysis) | NDT shortfall $485M-$1.0B; stranded asset risk on $3.2B acquisition |
| Hyperscaler PPA opportunity post-2035 | LOW-MEDIUM (20-30% success probability due to competition) | Upside case: $1.37B revenue, $766M EBITDA (exceeds PPA baseline) |

**Overall Commercial Risk Assessment: HIGH**

The GLNPC-NIEC PPA provides essential revenue certainty through 2035, but expiration creates substantial merchant market risk that APH must actively mitigate through pre-closing NIEC consent negotiations, post-closing hyperscaler PPA pursuit, and Illinois policy engagement. The 30-50% early shutdown probability (2036-2040) represents a material threat to APH's investment thesis and requires comprehensive contingency planning including NDT shortfall funding and decommissioning timeline acceleration.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Power Purchase Agreement Structure with NIEC

#### 1. Material Terms (Based on Transaction Materials)

The PPA between GLNPC and Northern Illinois Electric Company (NIEC) represents the single most critical commercial contract for the Great Lakes Nuclear Station, accounting for **$1.42 billion in annual revenue (90% of total revenue)** for FY2024.¹ This revenue structure consists of two components:

**Energy Payment Component:** $42/MWh fixed price with 1.5% annual escalation, generating approximately $820 million annually based on the plant's 2,400 MW capacity operating at 93% capacity factor.

**Fuel and Cost Pass-Through:** $596 million annually for fuel costs, operations and maintenance adjustments, and other variable expenses that fluctuate with actual plant operations.

**Take-or-Pay Obligation:** NIEC is obligated to pay for 90% of the contracted capacity even if it does not take delivery of the power, providing significant downside revenue protection for GLNPC.² This structure is typical of nuclear PPAs where the utility purchaser seeks long-term baseload supply certainty and the nuclear operator requires revenue stability to support high fixed costs ($600 million annually in operating expenses).

**Contract Term:** The PPA expires on **December 31, 2035** (10 years remaining from 2025), creating a critical revenue cliff that exposes GLNPC to merchant market economics thereafter.

#### 2. Comparable Nuclear PPA Structures in Illinois

Recent nuclear PPAs in Illinois demonstrate market trends toward long-term revenue certainty:

**Constellation-Meta Clinton PPA (2025):** Constellation and Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement for the entire 1,121 MW output of the Clinton Clean Energy Center, beginning in June 2027.³ Investment bank Jefferies estimated the deal's value at approximately **$70/MWh**, representing a roughly **$20/MWh premium** to Illinois' energy-plus-capacity market compensation from 2028 and as much as $15/MWh higher than regional wind power purchase agreements.⁴ This PPA replaces the expiring zero emission credit (ZEC) program and ensures the Clinton plant's continued operation through at least 2047 without ratepayer subsidies.

This precedent demonstrates that nuclear plants transitioning from regulated subsidies or expiring PPAs can secure merchant market premiums when contracting with large load customers (hyperscalers, data centers) seeking carbon-free baseload power. However, such opportunities are limited and highly competitive—Constellation noted that the "race to contract" for available nuclear MWs has become intense over the last 18 months.⁵

**Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) Programs:** Illinois Senate Bill 2408 (2021) provided $694 million over five years in ZEC subsidies to Constellation's Byron, Dresden, and Braidwood plants, preventing premature closures that were scheduled for September-November 2021.⁶ The Illinois Chamber of Commerce criticized CEJA as imposing "billions in increased costs on ratepayers," but the legislation preserved 5 of Illinois' 6 nuclear plants through ratepayer-funded carbon mitigation credits.⁷

These precedents illustrate that Illinois nuclear plants have relied on either long-term PPAs or state subsidies to remain economically viable in merchant markets characterized by low natural gas prices and renewable energy competition.

### B. Change of Control and Assignment Provisions

#### 1. Typical Nuclear PPA Change of Control Framework

While the actual GLNPC-NIEC PPA was not available for review in the data room, industry-standard nuclear power purchase agreements typically contain **anti-assignment provisions requiring utility consent** for transfers of ownership or control.⁸ These provisions serve multiple purposes:

**Creditworthiness Protection:** The utility purchaser (NIEC) contracted with GLNPC based on its financial strength, operational track record, and ability to maintain NRC operating licenses. A change of control to APH (a private equity-backed entity) materially alters the credit profile and introduces new ownership with no nuclear operating history.

**Regulatory Coordination:** NRC Section 184 license transfers under 42 U.S.C. § 2184 and 10 CFR 50.80 require Commission consent.⁹ PPAs frequently condition assignment consent on obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, including NRC license transfer approval, to ensure operational continuity.

**Operational Continuity:** NIEC's obligation to purchase 90% of GLNPC's capacity creates reliance on the plant's continued safe operation. The utility has a legitimate interest in ensuring that new ownership maintains the same operational standards, management expertise, and NRC compliance history.

#### 2. NRC License Transfer Precedents Affecting PPA Assignment

The NRC's approval of license transfers involving private equity acquirers has precedential value for PPA assignment analysis:

**Exelon Corporate Separation (2021):** The NRC approved the indirect transfer of operating licenses for Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, and LaSalle nuclear stations from Exelon Generation to the newly formed Constellation Energy Corporation.¹⁰ The order noted that the transfer was "indirect" (no change in licensee entity, only corporate parent) and that financial and technical qualifications remained adequate. This transfer facilitated Constellation's separation from Exelon as a publicly traded company.¹¹

**Key Precedent Implications:**
- NRC approval of license transfers does **not** automatically satisfy PPA assignment consent requirements, as PPAs are governed by state contract law, not federal nuclear regulation.
- However, NIEC is unlikely to withhold consent unreasonably if APH demonstrates to the NRC's satisfaction that it possesses adequate financial and technical qualifications under 10 CFR 50.33(f).
- Some nuclear PPAs include "deemed consent" provisions where utility consent is automatic upon NRC license transfer approval, but such clauses must be expressly negotiated and are not universal.

#### 3. Risk Assessment: NIEC Consent for APH Acquisition

**Probability NIEC Consent Required:** **High (70-80%)**¹² Standard PPA anti-assignment provisions nearly always require counterparty consent for change of control transactions.

**Probability NIEC Withholds Consent:** **Low-Medium (15-25%)** NIEC's incentives favor continued operations:
- **Energy Supply Need:** Illinois utilities face capacity constraints and renewable intermittency. GLNPC provides 2,400 MW of carbon-free baseload power critical to Illinois' grid reliability and Clean Energy Jobs Act compliance (50% renewable by 2040 requires nuclear baseload to balance intermittent wind/solar).
- **Take-or-Pay Liability:** NIEC is obligated to pay $1.42B annually through 2035 regardless of whether it withholds consent. Terminating the PPA would not relieve this obligation without demonstrating GLNPC's material breach.
- **Replacement Cost:** Securing 2,400 MW of alternative baseload capacity would likely require new generation construction (7-10 year lead time) or merchant market purchases at volatile spot prices ($40-70/MWh vs. PPA $42/MWh fixed).¹³

**Negotiation Leverage Scenarios:**

*Scenario 1 - Conditional Consent with Price Renegotiation:* NIEC may use consent as leverage to demand:
- Energy price reduction from $42/MWh to market-competitive rates ($35-38/MWh based on current wholesale prices)
- Contract extension beyond 2035 (locking in long-term supply at renegotiated rates)
- Enhanced operational reporting or management approval rights

*Scenario 2 - Automatic Consent Subject to NRC Approval:* If the PPA contains a deemed consent clause (common in nuclear PPAs post-2010), NIEC's consent becomes automatic upon NRC's Section 184 approval, provided APH demonstrates adequate financial and technical qualifications.

*Scenario 3 - Consent Withheld Pending APH Performance Guarantees:* NIEC may condition consent on APH providing a parent guarantee for decommissioning obligations or enhanced creditworthiness assurances beyond NRC's 10 CFR 50.75 requirements.

**Recommendation:** APH should request early engagement with NIEC (prior to closing) to negotiate consent terms and avoid post-closing disputes. The Illinois Commerce Commission may have jurisdiction over NIEC's consent decision if NIEC is a rate-regulated utility, providing APH with regulatory recourse if consent is unreasonably withheld.¹⁴

### C. Early Termination Provisions

#### 1. NIEC Termination Rights (Utility Counterparty)

Based on industry-standard nuclear PPA terms, NIEC likely has the right to terminate the PPA under the following circumstances:

**NRC License Suspension or Revocation:** If the NRC suspends or revokes GLNPC's operating licenses DPR-55 (Unit 1) or DPR-68 (Unit 2) under 10 CFR 50.80(c), NIEC can terminate for impossibility of performance.¹⁵ The plant cannot generate power without valid NRC licenses, rendering GLNPC's contractual obligations incapable of fulfillment.

**Prolonged Outage (Force Majeure):** If an unplanned outage exceeds 12 months due to equipment failure, nuclear incident, or other force majeure event, NIEC may terminate to secure alternative supply. This provision protects NIEC from prolonged exposure to the take-or-pay obligation during extended plant unavailability.

**Material Breach by GLNPC:** Failure to deliver contracted capacity, repeated NRC safety violations resulting in operational restrictions, or bankruptcy/insolvency of GLNPC would constitute material breach permitting NIEC termination.

**Probability of NIEC Termination (2025-2035):** **Low (5-10%)** GLNPC has operated safely with a 93% capacity factor and no major NRC enforcement actions. The NRC's Reactor Oversight Process categorizes GLNPC as "green" (low safety significance) with only one Severity Level IV Notice of Violation in September 2024 for an emergency planning drill deficiency.¹⁶

#### 2. GLNPC Termination Rights (Nuclear Operator)

GLNPC likely has limited termination rights, as nuclear PPAs are structured to provide long-term revenue certainty to support capital-intensive baseload generation:

**NIEC Payment Default:** If NIEC fails to make payments for 60-90 days and does not cure within the specified cure period, GLNPC may terminate and pursue damages for lost revenues.

**NIEC Bankruptcy:** If NIEC enters bankruptcy, GLNPC may have termination rights depending on whether the PPA constitutes an executory contract under 11 U.S.C. § 365 (Bankruptcy Code). However, Illinois utilities are rate-regulated and bankruptcy is unlikely absent catastrophic financial distress.

**Regulatory Change:** If Illinois legislation or NRC regulations render performance illegal or commercially impracticable, both parties may have mutual termination rights. However, such provisions are narrowly construed and rarely invoked.

**Probability of GLNPC Termination (2025-2035):** **Very Low (<2%)** NIEC is an established Illinois utility with stable creditworthiness. GLNPC would not terminate a $1.42B annual revenue stream absent extraordinary circumstances.

### D. Post-2035 Merchant Market Economics and Early Shutdown Risk

#### 1. The 2035 Revenue Cliff: Transition from PPA to Merchant Market

The expiration of the GLNPC-NIEC PPA on December 31, 2035 represents the most significant commercial risk for APH's investment thesis. Post-expiration, GLNPC will transition from a **contract-based revenue model ($1.42B annually with 90% take-or-pay protection)** to a **merchant market revenue model** exposed to volatile wholesale energy and capacity prices.

**Merchant Market Revenue Components:**

1. **Energy Revenue:** Wholesale energy sales into PJM Interconnection at Illinois Hub spot prices, which have averaged $40-50/MWh (2023-2024) but can range from $20-70/MWh depending on natural gas prices, renewable penetration, and demand conditions.¹⁷

2. **Capacity Revenue:** PJM capacity auction payments for providing resource adequacy, which have surged to record levels ($269-333/MW-day for 2026-2028 delivery years) but remain highly volatile and subject to regulatory reform.¹⁸

3. **Ancillary Services:** Frequency regulation, reactive power, and black start services provide marginal revenues (~$2-5/MWh) but do not materially offset the loss of PPA price certainty.

**Base Case Merchant Revenue Scenario (2036-2041):**

Assuming Illinois Hub energy prices of $40/MWh and PJM capacity prices of $100/MW-day (moderate scenario):

- **Energy Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 8,760 hours/year × 93% capacity factor × $40/MWh = **$781 million annually**
- **Capacity Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 365 days/year × $100/MW-day = **$88 million annually**
- **Total Merchant Revenue:** **$869 million annually**
- **EBITDA Impact:** Revenue declines from $1.42B (PPA) to $869M (merchant) = **$551M annual revenue loss**
- **Adjusted EBITDA:** $680M (current) - $551M revenue loss = **$129M EBITDA** (assumes operating costs remain $600M)

This base case scenario yields **marginal profitability** but represents an **81% EBITDA decline**, raising serious questions about continued operations post-2035.

#### 2. Renewable Energy Competition: Illinois Clean Energy Jobs Act Impact

The Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), enacted in 2021, mandates aggressive renewable energy targets:

- **2030:** 40% renewable energy (requiring 4,000 MW new wind + 4,000 MW new utility-scale solar + 5,800 MW new distributed solar)¹⁹
- **2040:** 50% renewable energy
- **2045:** 100% zero-emissions power sector

**Merit Order Effect: Zero Marginal Cost Renewable Displacement**

Wind and solar generation have **zero marginal cost** (no fuel expenses), causing them to dispatch ahead of nuclear baseload in wholesale energy markets under merit order economic dispatch.²⁰ As renewable penetration increases from current levels (~25%) to CEJA targets (40-50%), Illinois will experience:

**Suppressed Energy Prices:** During periods of high renewable generation (daytime solar, high wind events), wholesale energy prices will decline toward $0-20/MWh, well below nuclear plants' break-even energy prices of $30-35/MWh (after accounting for fixed costs).²¹

**Negative Pricing Events:** CEJA's aggressive renewable buildout may create negative pricing periods where generators must pay to remain online (occurs when renewable curtailment is not economically feasible and grid operators require baseload plants to stay synchronized).

**Capacity Market Pressure:** While CEJA preserves capacity value for nuclear as "firm" generation, Illinois renewable mandates coupled with battery storage deployment (4,000 MWh target by 2030) will intensify competition for capacity payments.²²

#### 3. Historical Precedents: Nuclear Plant Economic Retirements in Merchant Markets

Between 2013 and 2022, **9.6 GW of U.S. nuclear capacity retired prematurely** due to uneconomic merchant market conditions, driven by low natural gas prices, renewable competition, and flat electricity demand.²³ Relevant precedents include:

**Exelon's Byron and Dresden Retirements (Averted 2021):** Exelon announced plans to retire Byron (2,347 MW) and Dresden (1,846 MW) nuclear stations in September-November 2021, citing losses of "hundreds of millions of dollars" annually in merchant markets.²⁴ Only Illinois Senate Bill 2408's $694 million ZEC subsidy package prevented closure.

**Economic Viability Threshold:** Research indicates that merchant nuclear plants require energy prices of at least **$35-40/MWh** plus capacity revenues of **$50-100/MW-day** to remain profitable when competing with low-cost natural gas and zero-marginal-cost renewables.²⁵ Post-2035, GLNPC will face market conditions where:

- Illinois wholesale energy prices may decline to $25-35/MWh (2035-2040) due to CEJA renewable mandates
- PJM capacity prices face downward pressure from renewable+storage resource adequacy contributions
- No regulatory subsidies exist (ZEC programs expire, CEJA subsidies target new renewable development, not nuclear preservation)

#### 4. Early Shutdown Probability Assessment (2036-2040)

**Downside Case Merchant Revenue Scenario:**

Assuming Illinois Hub energy prices of $25/MWh and PJM capacity prices of $50/MW-day (renewable competition scenario):

- **Energy Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 8,760 hours/year × 93% capacity factor × $25/MWh = **$488 million annually**
- **Capacity Revenue:** 2,400 MW × 365 days/year × $50/MW-day = **$44 million annually**
- **Total Merchant Revenue:** **$532 million annually**
- **EBITDA Impact:** $532M revenue - $600M operating costs = **($68M) negative EBITDA**

**Shutdown Decision Factors:**

1. **Economic Impracticability:** Sustained negative EBITDA renders continued operations commercially impracticable under Illinois contract law and UCC § 2-615 (excuse by failure of presupposed conditions).²⁶

2. **Decommissioning Funding:** Early shutdown in 2036-2040 (vs. licensed expiration 2037/2041) creates Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) shortfall of **$485M-$1.0B** (see T6 Decommissioning Report), as NDT investment returns assume full license term.²⁷

3. **Regulatory Obligations:** NRC regulations require permanent shutdown notice (10 CFR 50.82) and continued license maintenance until decommissioning completion, but do not mandate operation if economically unfeasible.

**Early Shutdown Probability (2036-2040):** **30-50%**²⁸

This probability reflects:
- **High likelihood (70%)** that merchant revenues fall below break-even in downside renewable competition scenario
- **Moderate likelihood (40-50%)** that APH voluntarily shuts down rather than operating at losses, assuming no alternative revenue sources (hyperscaler PPAs, Illinois policy support)
- **Countervailing factors:** APH may secure partial merchant market PPAs with data centers (Meta/Constellation precedent), but available nuclear capacity is limited and competition intense

#### 5. Mitigation Strategies: Post-2035 Revenue Diversification

**Strategy 1 - Hyperscaler/Data Center PPA (Constellation-Meta Precedent):**

APH should actively market GLNPC's post-2035 capacity to hyperscalers seeking carbon-free baseload power. The Constellation-Meta Clinton PPA demonstrates that nuclear plants can secure **$70/MWh 20-year contracts** (~$20/MWh premium to merchant markets).²⁹ However:

- Competition is intense: Constellation noted "race to contract" for nuclear MWs over last 18 months
- Data center load growth may slow by 2035, reducing hyperscaler demand for nuclear PPAs
- Illinois grid constraints may limit new load interconnection by 2035

**Strategy 2 - Illinois Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) Program Extension:**

CEJA's 50% renewable by 2040 target implicitly requires nuclear baseload to balance intermittent wind/solar. APH could lobby for ZEC program extension (similar to 2016/2021 legislation) providing out-of-market payments to preserve nuclear capacity. However, political feasibility is uncertain given ratepayer cost concerns (Illinois Chamber of Commerce opposition to CEJA subsidies).³⁰

**Strategy 3 - PJM Capacity Market Reforms:**

PJM is addressing resource adequacy concerns driven by 32 GW projected demand growth 2024-2030 (primarily data centers).³¹ If capacity prices remain elevated ($200-333/MW-day), nuclear plants can remain economic on capacity revenues alone. APH should monitor PJM capacity market reforms (FERC Order No. 2023 impacts) and participate in stakeholder processes.

**Strategy 4 - Negotiate PPA Extension with NIEC (Pre-Closing):**

As part of consent negotiations for APH's acquisition, APH should propose extending the PPA beyond 2035 at mutually beneficial terms. NIEC may accept a modest price reduction ($40/MWh vs. current $42/MWh) in exchange for 10-15 year extension, providing APH with revenue certainty through 2045-2050.

|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **PPA Change of Control Consent** | HIGH | 70-80% (consent required) | Deal-blocking if NIEC refuses; renegotiation leverage risk (price reduction, contract extension demands) | Early engagement with NIEC; negotiate consent pre-closing; Illinois Commerce Commission recourse if unreasonable denial |
| **PPA Expiration 2035** | CRITICAL | 100% (certain event) | $551M annual revenue loss in base case ($1.42B → $869M); $890M loss in downside case ($1.42B → $532M) | Secure hyperscaler PPA pre-2035; lobby for ZEC program extension; negotiate NIEC contract extension |
| **Post-2035 Merchant Market Economics** | HIGH | 70% (revenues fall below break-even) | EBITDA declines from $680M to $129M (base) or ($68M) negative (downside); early shutdown risk 30-50% | PJM capacity market advocacy; renewable+nuclear bundled PPA strategies; Illinois policy engagement |
| **Early Shutdown 2036-2040** | MEDIUM-HIGH | 30-50% | NDT shortfall $485M-$1.0B (see T6); stranded asset risk; regulatory decommissioning obligations | Alternative revenue sources; operational efficiencies to reduce break-even; financial reserves for NDT contributions |
| **Illinois Renewable Competition** | HIGH | 100% (CEJA mandates) | Energy price suppression to $20-30/MWh during high renewable periods; negative pricing events; capacity market share erosion | Position nuclear as firm capacity + renewable balancing; carbon credit markets; data center co-location |
| **NIEC Early Termination** | LOW | 5-10% | Loss of $1.42B annual revenue; immediate transition to merchant market | Maintain NRC compliance (green status); 93% capacity factor; proactive communication with NIEC on operational performance |

### B. Post-2035 Merchant Revenue Scenarios (Detailed Table)

| Scenario | Energy Price ($/MWh) | Capacity Price ($/MW-day) | Energy Revenue ($M) | Capacity Revenue ($M) | Total Revenue ($M) | Operating Costs ($M) | EBITDA ($M) | EBITDA Margin | Outcome / Probability |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **PPA (Baseline through 2035)** | $42 + escalator | N/A (take-or-pay) | $820 | $600 (fuel pass-through) | $1,420 | $600 | $680 | 47.9% | Continue operations (100%) |
| **Upside Case (Hyperscaler PPA)** | $70 | N/A (contract) | $1,366 | N/A | $1,366 | $600 | $766 | 56.1% | Secure corporate PPA (20-30%) |
| **Base Case (Merchant)** | $40 | $100 | $781 | $88 | $869 | $600 | $129 | 14.8% | Marginal operations (30%) |
| **Downside Case (Renewable Competition)** | $25 | $50 | $488 | $44 | $532 | $600 | ($68) | -12.8% | Shutdown risk HIGH (40%) |
| **Severe Case (CEJA Impact)** | $20 | $30 | $390 | $26 | $416 | $600 | ($184) | -44.2% | Shutdown certain (10%) |

**Calculation Methodology:**
- Energy Revenue = 2,400 MW × 8,760 hours/year × 93% capacity factor × Energy Price ($/MWh)
- Capacity Revenue = 2,400 MW × 365 days/year × Capacity Price ($/MW-day)
- Operating Costs held constant at $600M annually (conservative assumption; may decline with reduced O&M in merchant market)
- Scenario probabilities reflect likelihood of each outcome materializing 2036-2041 based on CEJA renewable penetration rates, PJM capacity market reforms, and hyperscaler PPA opportunities

**Probability-Weighted Expected EBITDA (2036-2041):**
- Upside (25%) × $766M = $192M
- Base (30%) × $129M = $39M
- Downside (35%) × ($68M) = ($24M)
- Severe (10%) × ($184M) = ($18M)
- **Expected EBITDA: $189M annually** (vs. $680M under PPA = **72% decline**)

### C. Transaction-Specific Risks for APH Acquisition

**Risk 1 - NIEC Consent Leverage:**
NIEC may condition change of control consent on price concessions ($42/MWh → $38/MWh) or contract extension beyond 2035, materially affecting APH's acquisition pro forma. If APH refuses, NIEC may withhold consent, making the PPA unassignable and triggering material adverse effect provisions in the purchase agreement.

**Risk 2 - Post-2035 Revenue Uncertainty:**
APH's investment model assumes either (a) PPA extension, (b) hyperscaler PPA replacement, or (c) favorable merchant markets. All three scenarios face significant execution risk:
- PPA extension requires NIEC cooperation (uncertain)
- Hyperscaler PPAs face intense competition (Meta/Constellation precedent shows limited opportunities)
- Merchant markets face downward pressure from CEJA renewables (70% probability of unfavorable economics)

**Risk 3 - Regulatory Subsidy Dependence:**
Illinois nuclear plants historically relied on ZEC subsidies ($694M for Byron/Dresden/Braidwood 2021-2026) to remain viable. APH's post-2035 strategy may require lobbying for ZEC program extension, creating political and regulatory risk. Illinois ratepayer advocates oppose nuclear subsidies as "billions in increased costs."

**Risk 4 - Decommissioning Funding Shortfall:**
Early shutdown due to merchant market economics (30-50% probability 2036-2040) creates $485M-$1.0B NDT shortfall. APH would need to provide parent company guarantee or additional cash contributions under 10 CFR 50.75, reducing investment returns and potentially triggering loan covenant violations.

### D. Red Flags Requiring Immediate Data Room Verification

1. **Actual PPA Contract Review:** Obtain and review complete GLNPC-NIEC PPA to verify:
   - Change of control/assignment provisions (consent requirements, deemed consent upon NRC approval)
   - Early termination rights (cure periods, force majeure definitions, material breach thresholds)
   - Pricing adjustment mechanisms (fuel pass-through calculation, escalation formulas)
   - Post-expiration obligations (transition services, capacity reservation rights)

2. **NIEC Consent Status:** Has GLNPC notified NIEC of APH's proposed acquisition? If yes, what is NIEC's preliminary position on consent?

3. **Alternative Revenue Discussions:** Has GLNPC engaged in preliminary discussions with hyperscalers (Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft) regarding post-2035 PPAs? What is market feedback on GLNPC's merchant market alternatives?

4. **Illinois Policy Developments:** Monitor Illinois General Assembly legislative sessions for any proposed ZEC program extensions or nuclear subsidies relevant to GLNPC's post-2035 operations.

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Key Conclusions

1. **PPA Revenue Dependence is Critical and Non-Diversifiable (Through 2035):**
   The GLNPC-NIEC PPA represents $1.42 billion in annual revenue (90% of total), structured as $42/MWh fixed energy price with 1.5% escalation plus $596 million fuel/cost pass-through, with 90% take-or-pay protection. This contract provides revenue certainty through December 31, 2035, supporting GLNPC's $600 million annual operating costs, $42 million NDT contributions, and $8-12 million dry cask storage costs. Loss or renegotiation of this PPA would be materially adverse to APH's acquisition economics.

2. **Change of Control Consent Requirement Likely (70-80% Probability):**
   Industry-standard nuclear PPAs typically contain anti-assignment provisions requiring utility consent for ownership transfers. While the actual PPA was not available for review, NIEC is highly likely to have negotiated such protections to preserve operational continuity and creditworthiness. APH should assume NIEC consent is required and initiate early engagement to negotiate acceptable terms.

3. **NIEC Consent Withholding Risk is Low-Medium (15-25% Probability):**
   NIEC's economic incentives favor continued operations: (a) Illinois grid needs 2,400 MW carbon-free baseload to comply with CEJA's 50% renewable by 2040 mandate while balancing intermittent wind/solar, (b) NIEC remains liable for $1.42B annually under take-or-pay regardless of consent decision, and (c) alternative baseload supply requires 7-10 year construction lead times or volatile merchant market purchases at $40-70/MWh. However, NIEC may use consent as leverage to renegotiate price ($38-40/MWh) or extend term beyond 2035.

4. **Post-2035 Merchant Market Economics Pose Substantial Early Shutdown Risk (30-50% Probability):**
   Upon PPA expiration, GLNPC faces transition to merchant market with dramatically reduced revenue: base case scenario projects $869M annually (energy $781M + capacity $88M) vs. current $1.42B PPA revenue, reducing EBITDA from $680M to $129M (81% decline). Downside case scenario (energy $25/MWh, capacity $50/MW-day) yields negative EBITDA of ($68M), rendering continued operations commercially impracticable.

5. **Illinois Renewable Competition Will Suppress Post-2035 Wholesale Prices:**
   CEJA mandates 40% renewable by 2030 and 50% by 2040, requiring construction of 4,000 MW wind + 4,000 MW utility-scale solar + 5,800 MW distributed solar. Zero marginal cost renewables will dispatch ahead of nuclear baseload under merit order economics, suppressing Illinois Hub wholesale energy prices to $20-35/MWh during high renewable generation periods (vs. nuclear break-even $30-35/MWh). This dynamic creates 70% probability that merchant revenues fall below economic viability thresholds post-2035.

6. **Early Shutdown 2036-2040 Creates $485M-$1.0B NDT Shortfall:**
   If GLNPC shuts down prematurely due to unfavorable merchant economics (30-50% probability), the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust will be underfunded by $485M-$1.0B (see T6 Decommissioning Report). APH would require parent company guarantee or additional cash contributions under 10 CFR 50.75, materially impacting investment returns and potentially violating loan covenants.

7. **Historical Precedent: Illinois Nuclear Plants Required State Subsidies to Avoid Closure:**
   Exelon's Byron and Dresden plants were scheduled for closure in September-November 2021 due to "hundreds of millions in cumulative losses" in merchant markets before Illinois Senate Bill 2408 provided $694 million in ZEC subsidies. This precedent demonstrates that Illinois nuclear plants cannot compete economically in merchant markets without either (a) long-term PPAs at above-market rates, (b) state subsidies/ZEC programs, or (c) hyperscaler PPAs with data centers.

### B. Actionable Recommendations for APH

**Immediate Pre-Closing Actions (Q1 2026):**

1. **Initiate NIEC Consent Negotiations:**
   - Request meeting with NIEC senior management and Illinois Commerce Commission (if NIEC is rate-regulated) within 30 days
   - Present APH's financial qualifications (PE backing, $3.2B equity, management retention plan)
   - Propose mutually beneficial terms: (a) maintain current $42/MWh pricing through 2035, (b) extend PPA 10-15 years beyond 2035 at market-competitive $40/MWh, (c) enhanced operational reporting to NIEC
   - Obtain written consent or conditional consent subject to NRC license transfer approval before closing

2. **Verify PPA Contract Terms (Data Room Priority 1):**
   - Obtain complete GLNPC-NIEC PPA with all amendments
   - Engage outside counsel to review assignment/change of control provisions, early termination rights, pricing mechanisms
   - Confirm whether PPA contains "deemed consent" upon NRC approval or requires separate NIEC approval
   - Model financial impact of NIEC renegotiation scenarios ($38-40/MWh pricing, 2045-2050 extension)

3. **Conduct Post-2035 Revenue Market Scan:**
   - Engage investment bank to identify hyperscaler PPA opportunities (Meta, Google, Amazon, Microsoft data center load growth in Illinois/PJM)
   - Benchmark against Constellation-Meta Clinton PPA ($70/MWh, 20-year term) to assess GLNPC's post-2035 competitiveness
   - Develop marketing materials positioning GLNPC's 2,400 MW carbon-free baseload for corporate sustainability commitments
   - Target completion: Q2 2026 (pre-closing)

**Post-Closing Strategic Actions (2026-2035):**

4. **Pursue Hyperscaler PPA for Post-2035 Capacity (Priority Timeline: 2027-2030):**
   - Illinois data center growth driven by Chicago metro hyperscaler expansion presents best alternative to merchant market
   - Nuclear provides 24/7 baseload with zero carbon emissions, aligning with corporate sustainability goals
   - Target 20-year PPA at $60-70/MWh (Meta/Constellation precedent) covering 50-100% of GLNPC's 2,400 MW capacity
   - **Success probability: 20-30%** (intense competition for limited hyperscaler demand)

5. **Lobby Illinois General Assembly for Nuclear ZEC Program Extension:**
   - Engage Illinois Clean Energy Alliance, Nuclear Energy Institute, and labor unions to support ZEC extension
   - Position GLNPC as critical to CEJA's 50% renewable by 2040 target (nuclear provides firm capacity to balance intermittent wind/solar)
   - Seek out-of-market payments of $15-25/MWh (similar to 2016/2021 ZEC programs) to preserve economic viability post-2035
   - **Timeline:** Introduce legislation 2028-2030 for implementation by 2035 PPA expiration
   - **Political feasibility: 40-50%** (ratepayer cost opposition significant, but grid reliability concerns support nuclear preservation)

6. **Participate in PJM Capacity Market Reform Proceedings:**
   - Monitor FERC Order No. 2023 impacts on capacity market design and resource adequacy rules
   - Advocate for capacity market reforms that value nuclear's firm capacity contribution (vs. intermittent renewables+storage)
   - If capacity prices remain elevated ($200-333/MW-day post-2030), nuclear can remain economic on capacity revenues alone
   - Engage PJM Interconnection stakeholder processes (Market Implementation Committee, Member Representatives Committee)

7. **Operational Efficiency Initiatives to Reduce Break-Even (Target: $550M Operating Costs):**
   - Current operating costs $600M annually; reducing to $550M lowers merchant market break-even from $35/MWh to $28/MWh
   - Focus areas: Digital transformation (predictive maintenance, remote monitoring), supply chain optimization, workforce productivity
   - Benchmark against Constellation's fleet-wide efficiency programs (achieved 10-15% cost reductions 2018-2023)

**Contingency Planning (If Merchant Market Unfavorable):**

8. **Develop Early Shutdown Contingency Plan (2033-2034 Decision Point):**
   - If by 2033-2034, GLNPC has not secured post-2035 alternative revenue (hyperscaler PPA, ZEC extension) and merchant market forecasts remain unfavorable ($25-30/MWh energy, $50-75/MW-day capacity), prepare for voluntary shutdown 2036-2037
   - Notify NRC under 10 CFR 50.82 (permanent shutdown), commence decommissioning planning
   - Secure APH parent company guarantee for NDT shortfall $485M-$1.0B
   - Coordinate with Illinois Commerce Commission and NIEC to ensure orderly transition of load to alternative supply
