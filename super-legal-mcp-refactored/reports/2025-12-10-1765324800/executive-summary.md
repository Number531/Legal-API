PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Acquisition of Great Lakes Nuclear Power Company LLC
**Prepared for**: Atlas Power Holdings Investment Committee and Board of Directors
**Date**: January 3, 2026
**Session**: 2025-12-10-1765324800

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Risk Rating**: HIGH - This $3.2 billion acquisition presents compelling risk-adjusted returns (+$636.7M probability-weighted net benefit), but material regulatory and commercial exposures require enhanced contractual protections, a $500M three-tier escrow structure, and mandatory closing conditions addressing NRC approval, NIEC PPA consent, and IRC Section 754 tax election.

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

We recommend proceeding with this acquisition subject to specified conditions. The transaction offers risk-adjusted IRR of 15-17% exceeding the 12-14% hurdle rate, driven primarily by $1.0B NPV tax benefit from IRC Section 754 election (92.5% probability) and $138.75M DOE Phase II litigation recovery (92.5% probability). Primary risks requiring mitigation include: (1) NRC Section 184 license transfer approval (75-80% probability given unprecedented 45% foreign ownership with QIA 20% Qatar), (2) NPDES permit IL0048232 renewal (22-35% combined adverse outcome probability, 9% tail risk of deal-blocking), and (3) post-2035 PPA expiration merchant market exposure (30-50% early shutdown probability). Immediate action required: execute management retention agreements for SRO-licensed Plant Manager Rodriguez and Operations Manager Thompson within 30 days to secure NRC technical qualifications demonstration.

### Rationale

The Great Lakes Nuclear Power Company acquisition presents a favorable risk-return profile when probability-weighted exposures are aggregated. The P50 (median) outcome produces +$803.3M net favorable value creation, with 70% probability of favorable outcome across all scenarios. Two exceptional value drivers--the IRC Section 754 tax benefit (+$952.75M) and DOE Phase II damages recovery (+$138.75M)--generate combined +$1.091B in high-probability favorable exposures that substantially offset the identified risk portfolio.

However, this transaction carries material tail risks that must be addressed through contractual protections. The NPDES permit renewal (December 2028) creates 9% probability of deal-blocking outcomes (cooling tower retrofit requirement or permit denial). The NRC Section 184 license transfer faces 20-25% denial probability--higher than typical nuclear transactions due to the unprecedented 45% foreign ownership structure combining Canadian pension fund (CPPIB 25%) and Qatari sovereign wealth fund (QIA 20%) investors. The post-2035 PPA expiration eliminates $1.42B contracted annual revenue and creates 30-50% probability of early voluntary shutdown under adverse merchant market conditions, triggering $485M-$900M NDT shortfall requiring parent guarantee.

The recommended transaction structure with $50M purchase price reduction, $500M escrow, and specified closing conditions appropriately allocates these risks while preserving APH's ability to capture the substantial upside from this 2,260 MWe baseload nuclear asset with 11-15 years remaining NRC license life.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **NRC License Transfer Approval** - Section 184 approval required; file application within 30 days post-signing with comprehensive Negation Action Plan (NAP) addressing 45% foreign ownership - **See Section IV.A, IV.B** for detailed analysis
2. **IRC Section 754 Election** - Seller cooperation mandatory closing condition; $150M gross-up payment to compensate seller's $252-357M tax liability - **See Section IV.K** for $1.0B NPV benefit calculation
3. **Management Retention** - Execute retention agreements with CNO Robert Chen, Plant Manager Susan Rodriguez (SRO), and Operations Manager Michael Thompson (SRO) with minimum 24-month terms; total cost $2.5-4.0M - **See Section IV.J** for deal-blocking retention risk analysis
4. **NIEC PPA Consent** - Obtain Northern Illinois Electric Company consent to change of control; consent condition tied to NRC approval - **See Section IV.I** for consent provisions and renegotiation risk
5. **Material Adverse Effect Clause** - NPDES permit denial or NRC license denial constitutes MAE allowing buyer termination without penalty - **See Section IV.C, IV.A** for deal-blocking scenarios

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Will NRC approve Section 184 license transfer with 45% foreign ownership (CPPIB 25% + QIA 20%)? | **Probably Yes** | 75-80% approval probability. While unprecedented for non-NATO QIA 20% ownership, Calvert Cliffs/EDF precedent (49.99% French government) demonstrates NRC willingness to approve substantial foreign ownership with robust NAP. APH's $1.19T combined sponsor AUM (372x transaction value) provides exceptional financial qualifications. | IV.A, IV.B |
| 2 | Will CFIUS clear the transaction? | **Probably Yes** | 70-80% approval probability. QIA 20% sovereign wealth fund triggers mandatory declaration, but comprehensive NAP limiting foreign investor Board access to vital areas and SGI should satisfy national security concerns. CPPIB (Canada) benefits from Five Eyes partnership. | IV.B |
| 3 | Will NPDES permit IL0048232 be renewed by December 2028? | **Probably Yes, with restrictions** | 78% probability of approval (55% clean renewal + 23% approval with restrictions); 22% probability of adverse outcomes including 9% deal-blocking (cooling tower or denial). Biological studies must commence by February 2026 to support renewal application. | IV.C |
| 4 | What is APH's exposure under Price-Anderson retrospective premium assessments? | **$275.2M maximum, minimal expected** | Maximum $137.6M per unit x 2 units, but <1% annual probability of any U.S. nuclear incident triggering assessment. No Price-Anderson assessment has ever been levied since 1957 program inception. Expected value $1.38M. | IV.D |
| 5 | Will DOE Phase II litigation recover spent fuel damages? | **Yes** | 90-95% probability of $120-180M recovery. Great Lakes II (Fed. Cl.) trial scheduled Q3 2026 with judgment Q4 2026-Q1 2027. Government liability for Standard Contract breach is established; only quantum disputed. | IV.E |
| 6 | Is the NDT adequately funded for decommissioning? | **Yes, if operations continue to license expiration** | NDT balance $1.58-1.62B (127% of $1.24-1.276B NRC minimum). However, premature shutdown before 2035 creates $485M-$900M shortfall (20-30% probability), requiring parent guarantee. | IV.F |
| 7 | Does APH satisfy NRC financial qualifications under 10 CFR 50.33(f)? | **Yes** | Combined sponsor AUM $1.19T (Blackstone $1.08T + CPPIB $575B + QIA $475B) provides 372x coverage of $3.2B transaction. 95-98% approval probability for financial qualifications. | IV.G |
| 8 | Is spent fuel storage capacity adequate through license expiration? | **Yes, with expansion** | Current ISFSI capacity sufficient through 2028-2030; $15-25M expansion (50-cask pad) required by 2032-2035. DOE Phase II recovery ($120-180M) offsets 60-100% of storage lifecycle costs. | IV.H |
| 9 | Will NIEC consent to PPA assignment upon change of control? | **Probably Yes** | 70-80% probability consent granted upon NRC approval. PPA change-of-control provision requires consent not unreasonably withheld. Risk: NIEC may demand $78-98M annual price reduction as consent condition. | IV.I |
| 10 | Are Peterson ADEA claims material litigation exposure? | **Probably Yes** | Individual claim $956K expected value (85% liability probability); class action $4.95M expected value (45% certification probability). 7.5:1 termination rate ratio in April 2024 RIF substantially exceeds EEOC 80% rule threshold. | IV.J |
| 11 | Does IRC Section 754 election provide material tax benefit? | **Yes** | $1.0B NPV benefit over 15-20 years through stepped-up basis depreciation (92.5% probability). Requires $150M gross-up payment to seller (80/20 value split standard). | IV.K |
| 12 | Can foreign investor Board members access vital areas and SGI? | **No** | 95-100% certainty NRC will prohibit unescorted vital area access and SGI access for CPPIB (Canadian) and QIA (Qatari) Board members. NAP must include Board governance restrictions. | IV.L |

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. NPDES Permit Renewal Cascade (Environmental -> NDT -> Securities)

The NPDES permit IL0048232 renewal (December 2028) creates interconnected risks across multiple domains with potential $3.3B aggregate exposure in tail risk scenarios.

**Primary Finding**: Section IV.C - NPDES permit renewal faces 22-35% combined probability of adverse outcomes, including 9% tail risk of deal-blocking scenarios (cooling tower retrofit $1.8-3.0B or permit denial requiring immediate shutdown).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Decommissioning Funding (Section IV.F Finding 2)**: NPDES permit denial triggers immediate shutdown, accelerating decommissioning before NDT reaches adequate funding. The $1.58-1.62B NDT balance (127% of NRC minimum) assumes continued operation through license expiration (2037/2041). Premature shutdown creates $485M-$900M shortfall requiring parent guarantee under 10 CFR 50.75(e)(1).
- **Securities/Financial Qualifications (Section IV.G)**: Cooling tower retrofit ($1.8-3.0B) would consume 41-68% of remaining cash flows through 2035, rendering continued operations economically infeasible. APH would rationally choose shutdown over retrofit, following Diablo Canyon precedent.
- **Commercial/PPA (Section IV.I)**: NPDES permit denial constitutes Material Adverse Effect under PPA, potentially triggering NIEC termination rights or force majeure claims.

**Probability-Weighted Impact**: 9% x $3.3B = $297M expected value for deal-blocking tail risk

**Mitigation**: (1) Initiate biological studies February 2026 to support renewal application; (2) $300M Tier 1 escrow (36 months) tied to NPDES resolution; (3) MAE clause permitting buyer termination if permit denied.

### B. Foreign Ownership Cascade (CFIUS/NAP -> NRC Approval -> Employment Access)

The 45% foreign ownership (CPPIB 25% Canada + QIA 20% Qatar) creates unprecedented NRC approval risk requiring comprehensive Negation Action Plan with governance implications.

**Primary Finding**: Section IV.B - NRC Section 184 license transfer faces 20-25% denial risk due to QIA's 20% ownership representing first non-NATO, non-Five Eyes sovereign wealth fund investment in U.S. nuclear operating license. No precedent exists for Qatari ownership of NRC-licensed nuclear facility.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Employment/Access Authorization (Section IV.J Finding 4)**: Foreign Board members (2 CPPIB Canadian + 1 QIA Qatari) face 6-12 month FBI background check processing, with QIA representative having only 10-20% approval probability for vital area access. NAP must prohibit unescorted vital area access and SGI access for all foreign nationals.
- **Security/Safeguards (Section IV.L Finding 1)**: NRC will require NAP Article 4 restricting foreign investor Board participation in security-related discussions, force-on-force exercise observation, and classified DBT briefings. Foreign Board seats (3 of 7, 43%) cannot access security committee matters.
- **Commercial Negotiations**: CPPIB and QIA may resist governance restrictions impacting fiduciary oversight rights. APH must negotiate amended investment agreements acknowledging NRC access limitations pre-closing.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: Deal-blocking (20-25% denial probability); $500K-$1M governance restructuring costs; ongoing NAP compliance $3.25M PV over 10 years

**Mitigation**: (1) Pre-filing meeting with NRC Region III staff to assess receptivity; (2) Draft NAP incorporating EDF-Calvert Cliffs precedent provisions; (3) Educate CPPIB/QIA Board designees on access restrictions before closing.

### C. Post-2035 Merchant Market Cascade (PPA Expiration -> NDT -> Securities)

PPA expiration December 31, 2035 eliminates $1.42B annual contracted revenue, creating 30-50% early voluntary shutdown probability under adverse merchant market conditions.

**Primary Finding**: Section IV.I Finding 1 - Post-2035 merchant market revenue declines to $532M-$869M annually (vs. $1.42B PPA), with P90 (stress) scenario showing EBITDA potentially falling below debt service requirements.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Decommissioning Funding (Section IV.F)**: Early shutdown 2036-2040 triggers $485M-$900M NDT shortfall because: (a) NDT loses 6-10 years of investment return accumulation; (b) annual contributions cease; (c) decommissioning costs are incurred immediately rather than 2041.
- **Tax Benefits (Section IV.K)**: Early shutdown truncates IRC Section 754 depreciation benefit recovery period, potentially reducing $1.03B NPV to $650-800M if shutdown occurs 2036-2038.
- **Securities/Financial Qualifications**: NRC 10 CFR 50.33(f) review requires demonstration of adequate financial resources for at least two years. Post-2035 merchant market projections showing negative EBITDA scenarios may trigger enhanced NRC financial assurance requirements.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $7.07B NPV aggregate impact (probability-weighted); 30-50% early shutdown; $485-900M NDT shortfall

**Mitigation**: (1) Commission merchant market analysis pre-closing (Brattle Group, $200-350K); (2) Initiate hyperscaler PPA marketing to Meta/Google/Amazon 2027-2030; (3) Parent guarantee for NDT shortfalls exceeding $300M.

### D. Management Retention Cascade (Employment -> NRC Technical Qualifications)

Loss of SRO-licensed key managers creates 70-80% NRC license transfer denial risk, making retention a deal-blocking threshold issue.

**Primary Finding**: Section IV.J Finding 2 - Without retention agreements, industry data indicates 40-60% voluntary departure probability for Plant Manager Susan Rodriguez (SRO) and Operations Manager Michael Thompson (SRO) during M&A transitions. Their departure triggers 70-80% NRC denial risk because APH (newly formed entity with no nuclear operating experience) demonstrates technical qualifications solely through GLNPC's existing licensed management.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **NRC License Transfer (Section IV.A)**: 10 CFR 50.80 and NUREG-1556 require demonstration of technical qualifications through "training and experience of key personnel." Without SRO-licensed managers, APH cannot satisfy NRC technical qualifications test.
- **Timeline**: SRO license replacement requires 18-36 months facility-specific training plus NRC biannual examination. This timeline is incompatible with 12-18 month license transfer review.
- **Securities/Financial Qualifications**: Management departures may trigger rating agency negative watch, affecting acquisition financing.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: Deal-blocking (30% combined probability without retention); $2.5-4.0M retention budget required

**Mitigation**: (1) Execute retention agreements pre-signing; (2) Retention structure: CNO $1.0-1.5M, Plant Manager $500-800K, Operations Manager $400-600K (50% at closing, 50% at 24 months); (3) Make management retention a closing condition.

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section Reference |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Purchase Price | $3.15B | $3.15B | $3.25B | risk-summary.json |
| Total Escrow | $600M (18.75%) | $500M (15.6%) | $400M (12.5%) | Section II |
| Environmental Escrow Duration | 48 months | 36 months | 24 months | Section IV.C |
| IRC Section 754 Gross-Up | $100M (33% of seller tax) | $150M (50%) | $200M (66%) | Section IV.K |
| NDT Parent Guarantee | Full shortfall | >$300M shortfall | >$500M shortfall | Section IV.F |
| Indemnity Survival | 36 months general | 24 months general | 18 months general | Sections IV.C-J |
| Management Retention | Mandatory 36 months | Mandatory 24 months | Mandatory 18 months | Section IV.J |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **IRC Section 754 Value Split**: APH controls $1.0B NPV value creation contingent on seller cooperation. Offer $150M gross-up (15% of value) while retaining $850M (85%). Seller's alternative (no election) yields $0 benefit. This creates strong seller incentive to cooperate.

2. **NPDES Permit Timeline**: Biological studies must commence February 2026 (60 days post-target closing). Seller cannot restart these studies post-closing--APH's cooperation is mandatory. Use this timeline pressure to secure enhanced environmental representations and Tier 1 escrow.

3. **Management Retention Pre-Signing**: Require seller to facilitate retention agreement execution before definitive agreement signing. Rodriguez and Thompson departure after signing but before closing creates deal uncertainty that benefits neither party.

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| # | Expected Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence Basis |
|---|--------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | "45% foreign ownership is comparable to EDF-Calvert Cliffs (49.99%)" | HIGH | EDF is French (NATO ally); QIA is Qatari (no Five Eyes, ITAR precedent). Different risk profile requires enhanced NAP. | Section IV.B precedent analysis |
| 2 | "NPDES permit renewal is routine; 9% tail risk overstated" | HIGH | Great Lakes environmental litigation (Fermi 2 precedent) and EPA Region 5 institutional skepticism toward once-through cooling justify tail risk pricing. | Section IV.C counter-analysis |
| 3 | "$500M escrow (15.6%) exceeds market standard (10%)" | MEDIUM | Nuclear transactions carry unique regulatory risk; escrow appropriate given $3.3B tail risk exposure at 9% probability. | Section IV.C, IV.F cascade analysis |
| 4 | "Post-2035 merchant risk is APH's operating risk, not transaction risk" | MEDIUM | 30-50% early shutdown probability is knowable at signing; affects valuation. Price accordingly or accept NDT parent guarantee. | Section IV.I Finding 1 |

**Negotiation Playbook:**

| Scenario | If Seller Says... | We Respond... | Fallback Position |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Escrow Amount | "15% is excessive; market is 10%" | "9% NPDES tail risk + 20% NRC denial risk = 29% combined deal-blocking; $500M is conservative" | Accept 12.5% with extended 48-month Tier 1 |
| Section 754 Gross-Up | "$150M is too high; $100M is fair" | "Value split 85/15 is standard; $850M to APH, $150M to seller. Seller's alternative is $0." | Accept $125M with seller providing Section 754 election guarantee |
| NDT Guarantee | "No parent guarantee; NDT is adequately funded" | "127% funding assumes normal operations. 30% premature shutdown probability creates $187M expected shortfall." | Accept guarantee threshold of $500M (vs. $300M) |
| Management Retention | "Rodriguez and Thompson are committed to company" | "M&A studies show 40-60% departure without retention. Execute retention pre-signing or accept deal-blocking risk." | Accept post-signing but pre-closing execution deadline |

### Critical Path Risks

- **NPDES Biological Studies**: If biological studies do not commence by February 2026, data will be insufficient for June 2028 permit application, increasing renewal denial probability from 9% to 15-25%.
- **NRC Review Timeline**: 12-18 month Section 184 review may extend to 24 months if NRC raises substantial questions regarding QIA foreign ownership. This creates operational uncertainty during review period.
- **Management Retention**: If Rodriguez or Thompson provide resignation notice during NRC review period, APH must immediately notify NRC and demonstrate alternative technical qualifications strategy--likely triggering NRC supplemental information requests extending timeline 3-6 months.

## VIII. DECISION REQUIRED

```
DECISION REQUIRED: Authorization to proceed with definitive agreement negotiation at
$3.15B purchase price with specified conditions, by Investment Committee by
January 15, 2026.

OPTIONS:

Option A: Proceed at $3.2B as drafted (seller's ask)
- Risk: Accepts $636.7M probability-weighted upside but foregoes $50M negotiated reduction
- Benefit: Faster execution; seller goodwill preserved
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (leaves value on table)

Option B: Proceed with conditions at $3.15B (recommended structure)
- Risk: Seller may reject $50M reduction, requiring negotiation
- Benefit: Captures risk-adjusted value; $500M escrow protects against tail risks;
  IRC Section 754 condition ensures $1.0B tax benefit; management retention
  eliminates deal-blocking departure risk
- Status: RECOMMENDED

Option C: Proceed at $3.0B (aggressive discount)
- Risk: Seller likely to reject 6.25% discount as excessive
- Benefit: Greater protection against P90 stress scenarios
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (may terminate negotiations)

Option D: Terminate negotiations
- Risk: Forfeits strategic nuclear portfolio opportunity in constrained market
- Benefit: Preserves capital for alternatives; avoids NPDES/NRC regulatory risk
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (risk-adjusted returns exceed hurdle rate)

RECOMMENDED: Option B

Rationale: Risk-adjusted IRR of 15-17% exceeds 12-14% hurdle rate. The $1.091B
probability-weighted favorable exposures (IRC Section 754 + DOE recovery) substantially
offset $502M adverse exposures. The recommended structure with $500M escrow, mandatory
Section 754 election, and management retention closes key risk gaps while preserving
transaction economics.
