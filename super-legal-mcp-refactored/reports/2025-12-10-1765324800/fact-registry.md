### Liability Type Classification Guide

| Type | Characteristics | Correct Methodology | Formula |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Perpetual** | Recurring annually, no end date | NPV | Annual ÷ Discount Rate |
| **Contingent** | Single event, uncertain outcome | EV (Expected Value) | Probability × Magnitude |
| **Hybrid** | Multi-year program, defined timeline | DCF | Σ (CF_t ÷ (1+r)^t) |

### Default Discount Rate
All NPV/DCF calculations use **8% WACC** unless specified otherwise in source reports.
Securities-financial-report.md uses **7% discount rate** for tax benefit NPV calculation.

|------------|----------------|--------|----------------------|---------|--------|
| NDT balance >120% of NRC minimum | Transaction materials | **VALIDATED** | decommissioning-analyst (T5) | NDT $1.58B-$1.62B = 127% of $1.24B-$1.276B minimum | Confirms adequacy for normal shutdown |
| 45% foreign ownership (CPPIB 25% + QIA 20%) | Transaction materials | **VALIDATED** | foreign-ownership-analyst (T2), securities-analyst (T7) | Confirmed in all reports | Triggers NAP requirements |
| PPA expiration 2035 creates merchant risk | Transaction materials | **VALIDATED** | commercial-contracts-analyst (T9) | Post-2035 merchant revenue $532M-$869M vs. $1.42B PPA | 30-50% early shutdown probability |
| Workforce size 1,850 employees | Transaction materials | **VALIDATED** | employment-labor-analyst (T11) | 1,850 full-time employees confirmed | Workforce analysis accurate |
| Transaction value $3.2B | Transaction materials | **VALIDATED** | ALL analysts (T1-T15) | Consistent across all 15 reports | Confirmed asking price |

### Status Definitions

## NOTES FOR MEMORANDUM WRITERS

### Critical Dependencies
1. **IRC § 754 Tax Election**: $1.0B NPV benefit REQUIRES seller cooperation - make this a CLOSING CONDITION
2. **Management Retention**: SRO retention (Plant Manager Rodriguez, Operations Manager Thompson) is DEAL-BLOCKING if they depart
3. **NPDES Permit Timeline**: Application due June 2027 (180 days before Dec 2028 expiration) - MUST START BIOLOGICAL STUDIES Q1 2026
4. **DOE Phase II Cash Flow**: Expected $120M-$180M recovery Q4 2026-Q1 2027 affects Year 1 buyer cash flow projections

### Material Uncertainties Requiring Attorney Review
1. **NRC License Number Conflict**: NPF-37/NPF-66 vs. DPR-55/DPR-68 - verify in NRC ADAMS database
2. **Reactor Type Conflict**: BWR vs. PWR - verify in NRC license documents (affects decommissioning cost estimates)
3. **NDT Balance Variance**: $1.58B vs. $1.62B reported - verify in latest NDT trustee statement

### Cross-Domain Coordination Required
1. **NPDES Permit Risk → NDT Shortfall**: 9% probability of cooling tower ($2.4B) causes premature shutdown → $485M-$900M NDT shortfall
2. **PPA Expiration 2035 → Early Shutdown**: Post-PPA merchant economics create 30-50% shutdown probability 2036-2040
3. **Foreign Ownership 45% → NAP Requirements**: CPPIB 25% + QIA 20% triggers enhanced NRC scrutiny and Board access restrictions
