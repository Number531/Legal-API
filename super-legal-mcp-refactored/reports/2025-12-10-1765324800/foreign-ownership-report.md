## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

American Power Holdings LLC (APH) seeks to acquire Great Lakes Nuclear Power Company LLC (GLNPC), owner/operator of the Great Lakes Nuclear Station twin-reactor pressurized water reactor facility (2,400 MW total capacity). APH's ownership structure consists of **55% Blackstone (U.S. private equity)**, **25% CPPIB (Canada Pension Plan Investment Board)**, and **20% QIA (Qatar Investment Authority - Qatari sovereign wealth fund)**. The transaction requires Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval under Section 184 of the Atomic Energy Act for indirect transfer of Operating Licenses DPR-55 (Unit 1) and DPR-68 (Unit 2).

**Critical Issue:** Section 103d of the Atomic Energy Act (42 USC 2133(d)) **prohibits** the NRC from licensing any entity "owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government."¹ APH's **45% foreign ownership** (CPPIB 25% + QIA 20%) and **43% foreign Board representation** (3 of 7 directors) present significant foreign ownership, control, or dominance (FOCD) concerns requiring comprehensive analysis and stringent negation measures.

This research memorandum provides: (1) detailed analysis of Section 103d statutory prohibition and NRC precedents, (2) risk assessment of APH's specific foreign ownership structure, (3) recommendations for obtaining NRC approval, and (4) draft Negation Action Plan provisions for incorporation into APH's Operating Agreement and submission as proposed NRC license conditions.

### Key Findings

**1. No Safe Harbor Threshold for Foreign Ownership - Case-by-Case "Totality of Facts" Analysis**

The NRC **does not apply a bright-line safe harbor threshold** (e.g., foreign ownership <50% = automatic approval).² Instead, the Commission employs a flexible "totality of facts" test evaluating:
- Equity ownership percentage and structure
- Corporate governance and Board composition
- Veto rights and protective provisions
- Management control (citizenship, operational authority)
- Information access (foreign director access to reactor specifications, security plans, SNM data)
- Financial and contractual arrangements
- **Foreign government vs. private foreign investor distinction** (heightened scrutiny for sovereign wealth funds)³

**Implication for APH:** While APH's 45% foreign ownership maintains U.S. technical majority control (55% Blackstone), the presence of QIA (Qatari sovereign wealth fund) as a 20% foreign government investor triggers heightened NRC scrutiny. A comprehensive Negation Action Plan is **mandatory** to demonstrate that foreign investors do not own, control, or dominate nuclear operations.⁴

---

**2. EDF/CENG 49.99% French Ownership Precedent Establishes Upper Bound**

In 2009, the NRC approved Électricité de France (EDF) acquiring **49.99% ownership** in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group (CENG), which operated five nuclear reactors. EDF is **84.5% owned by the French government**, making this transaction the highest foreign government ownership percentage approved by NRC for operating reactors.⁵

**Key Approval Conditions:**⁶
- Foreign ownership stayed **just below 50%** (49.99% vs. 50.01% U.S. majority)
- Constellation (U.S. partner) retained management control
- **Negation Action Plan required** as binding license condition
- France is **NATO ally** (favorable treatment vs. non-NATO foreign governments)

**APH Comparison:**
| Factor | EDF/CENG (Approved) | APH Transaction |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Total Foreign % | 49.99% | **45%** (favorable) |
| Foreign Govt? | YES (France 84.5% owns EDF) | YES (Qatar 100% owns QIA) |
| NATO Ally? | YES (France) | **NO** (Qatar = Major Non-NATO Ally only) |
| Single vs. Multiple Foreign Investors | Single (EDF alone = 49.99%) | Multiple (CPPIB 25% + QIA 20%) |

**Conclusion:** APH's 45% foreign ownership is **below the 49.99% EDF precedent** (favorable factor), but QIA's non-NATO status and Qatari government control present **higher national security concerns** than EDF (French NATO ally). NRC approval is **achievable with extraordinary negation measures** specifically targeting QIA's foreign government control.⁷

---

**3. Calvert Cliffs 100% EDF Ownership Denial Establishes Categorical Prohibition**

In 2012, the NRC **denied** UniStar Nuclear Energy's Combined Operating License application for Calvert Cliffs Unit 3 because EDF acquired 100% ownership of UniStar, resulting in complete foreign government control.⁸ The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board held that **"100% foreign ownership of a U.S. nuclear reactor is illegal, whether direct or 'indirect,'"** and **no mitigation measure could address** this Section 103d violation.⁹

**Significance:** This precedent establishes the **outer limit** of permissible foreign ownership. The NRC will not license entities with complete foreign control, even from NATO allies (France). Between the EDF/CENG approval (49.99%) and Calvert Cliffs denial (100%), APH's 45% foreign ownership falls within the potentially approvable range.¹⁰

---

**4. QIA 20% Ownership - Critical Approval Risk Due to Foreign Government Control**

**Qatar Investment Authority Profile:**¹¹
- **100% owned by State of Qatar** (established by Emiri Decree No. 22/2005)
- Assets under management: ~$450 billion
- Chaired by Qatari Prime Minister; Board appointed by Emir of Qatar
- **Instrumentality of foreign government** under Section 103d

**Heightened NRC Scrutiny Factors:**¹²

1. **Foreign Government Investor (Not Private Commercial Investor)**
   - QIA is state actor controlled by Qatari government
   - NRC precedent shows foreign government investors receive highest scrutiny
   - EDF (French government) approved at 49.99%, but France = NATO ally
   - Qatar = Major Non-NATO Ally (designated 2022) but **not NATO member**

2. **Middle East Geopolitical Concerns**
   - CFIUS heightened scrutiny for Middle East sovereign wealth funds¹³
   - Qatar geopolitical profile:
     - Hosts U.S. Al Udeid Air Base (largest U.S. military installation in Middle East)
     - But: Complex relationship with Iran (shares North Dome/South Pars gas field)
     - Hosts Hamas political leadership (complicates U.S. counterterrorism policy)
     - Alleged financial ties to Islamist organizations¹⁴

3. **National Security Concerns for Nuclear Facilities**
   - Qatari government influence over U.S. commercial nuclear reactor operations
   - Potential access to:
     - Nuclear reactor designs and technical specifications
     - Special Nuclear Material (SNM) inventory and safeguards
     - Physical security plans (Design Basis Threat, force-on-force procedures)
     - Cybersecurity architecture for reactor control systems
     - Spent fuel management and ISFSI security
   - **Proliferation risk:** Knowledge of SNM handling, enrichment levels, physical protection measures
   - **Critical infrastructure vulnerability:** Foreign government could influence operations, safety decisions, or emergency response

**Risk Assessment:** QIA 20% presents **MODERATE-TO-HIGH NRC approval risk** absent extraordinary negation measures. Lower equity percentage than EDF (20% vs. 49.99%) is favorable, but non-NATO foreign government status and Middle East geopolitical concerns are unfavorable factors.¹⁵

**Critical Mitigation Required:**¹⁶
- Exclude QIA director from **ALL** nuclear safety, security, and NRC compliance matters
- **No QIA veto rights** over operational, financial (nuclear-related), or management decisions
- Restrict QIA access to reactor technical specifications, security plans, SNM inventory, NRC inspection reports
- Annual certifications that QIA exercises no control or dominance over nuclear operations
- U.S. management (CEO, CNO, Plant Manager) have final authority on all nuclear matters

---

**5. CPPIB 25% Canadian Pension Fund - Moderate Risk, Requires Standard Negation**

**Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Profile:**¹⁷
- Established by Canadian federal statute (1997 Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act)
- Manages retirement assets for 22 million Canadians (~C$632 billion AUM)
- Governed by 12-member Board appointed by Canadian federal and provincial governments
- Investment mandate: Maximize long-term returns without undue risk

**Foreign Government Control Analysis:**¹⁸

CPPIB's government-control status is **AMBIGUOUS**:
- **CFIUS Definition (31 CFR § 800.224):** Foreign government holds ≥49% voting interest? **NO** - CPPIB is independent Crown corporation; Canadian government does not hold direct equity → **Likely NOT foreign government-controlled under CFIUS**
- **NRC Section 103d:** Does Canadian government own, control, or dominate CPPIB? **UNCERTAIN** - Board appointed by government, but independent investment mandate → **Totality of facts review required**

**Favorable Factors:**
- Canada = **NATO ally & Five Eyes intelligence partner** (more favorable treatment than QIA)
- CPPIB = **passive financial investor** (pension fund, not strategic sovereign wealth fund)
- Long-term infrastructure investment focus (not operational involvement)

**Concerns:**
- **Exceeds typical 20% individual foreign investor threshold** (25% is highest single foreign investor in APH)
- **29% Board representation** (2 of 7 directors) combined with QIA (1 of 7) = 43% foreign Board
- Access to financial and operational information (must restrict nuclear-specific data)

**Risk Assessment:** CPPIB 25% presents **MODERATE approval risk**. Lower scrutiny than QIA due to NATO ally status and passive investor profile. NRC approval is **likely** with standard Negation Action Plan provisions (information restrictions, no veto rights, passive investor role).¹⁹

---

**6. Board Composition: 43% Foreign Representation Requires Nuclear Oversight Committee**

**APH Board Structure:**
- **7 Total Directors**: 4 U.S. (Blackstone), 2 CPPIB, 1 QIA
- **Foreign Directors: 3 of 7 (43%)**
- U.S. directors hold majority (4 of 7, 57%)

**NRC Concerns:**²⁰

1. **Supermajority Voting Risk**
   - If APH Operating Agreement requires supermajority votes (e.g., 5 of 7 = 71% threshold), foreign directors (3 of 7) could **effectively veto** by withholding support
   - U.S. directors (4 of 7) cannot proceed without at least 1 foreign director's vote
   - **NRC Prohibition:** Foreign investors cannot hold veto power over nuclear safety, security, or NRC compliance decisions

2. **Information Access**
   - Board members typically receive comprehensive financial, operations, and regulatory compliance information
   - **NRC Concern:** Foreign directors (especially QIA = Qatari government) cannot access reactor design, security plans, cybersecurity systems, SNM inventory, or NRC inspection reports

3. **Access to "Vital Areas"** (10 CFR 73.2)²¹
   - Vital areas: reactor control room, spent fuel pool, emergency core cooling systems
   - Foreign directors must be **prohibited** from physical access to vital areas during site visits
   - Access authorization under 10 CFR 73.56 likely restricted for foreign nationals

**Required Negation Measures:**²²
- **Nuclear Oversight Committee (NOC)** consisting of **U.S. citizens only** (4 Blackstone directors)
- Delegate to NOC **exclusive authority** over nuclear safety, security, NRC compliance, and appointment of CEO/CNO/Plant Manager
- Foreign directors (CPPIB, QIA) **excluded from NOC** membership
- **Two-tier information system**: Foreign directors receive financial summaries only; restricted from Tier 2 (reactor specifications, security plans, NRC reports)
- **Simple majority voting** (4 of 7) for all Board decisions (no supermajority granting foreign veto)
- Site visit restrictions: Foreign directors excluded from vital areas

**Conclusion:** Board composition is **approvable with Nuclear Oversight Committee structure** that insulates nuclear operations from foreign influence.²³

---

**7. CFIUS Mandatory Declaration Likely Required**

The APH transaction **likely triggers mandatory CFIUS declaration** under 31 CFR § 800.401 due to:²⁴
- GLNPC = **TID U.S. Business** (nuclear power = critical infrastructure under FIRRMA)
- QIA = **Foreign government-controlled investor** (100% owned by State of Qatar)
- QIA acquiring 20% equity in TID U.S. business

**CFIUS Review Process:**²⁵
- 30-day short-form declaration
- If CFIUS requests full notice: 45-day initial review + 45-day investigation = 90 days total
- **Mitigation agreement likely** (restrictions on QIA paralleling NRC Negation Action Plan)
- **Presidential prohibition: <1% probability** (Qatar = U.S. ally with Al Udeid Air Base; reserved for extreme national security threats)

**CFIUS/NRC Coordination:**²⁶
- DOE represents NRC interests on CFIUS
- **Both agencies must approve** for transaction to close
- Mitigation measures should be **harmonized** across CFIUS agreement and NRC Negation Action Plan

**Conclusion:** CFIUS approval is **likely achievable with mitigation agreement** addressing QIA foreign government ownership concerns.²⁷

---

**8. Transaction Timeline: 8-12 Months Expected (18-24 Months Worst Case)**

**Expected Timeline:**²⁸
- NRC license transfer review: 6-8 months (Federal Register notice, public comment, staff review)
- CFIUS review: 3-4 months (concurrent)
- **Total: 8-12 months** assuming no Atomic Safety and Licensing Board hearing

**Hearing Risk: 20-30% Probability**²⁹
- Environmental groups or intervenors may challenge transaction under Section 103d
- Calvert Cliffs precedent: Intervenors successfully blocked 100% EDF ownership
- $3.2B transaction visibility may attract anti-nuclear advocacy attention
- Hearing adds **6-12 months** to timeline
- **Worst case: 18-24 months** total

**Timeline Risk Mitigation:**
- Aggressive pre-filing strategy (pre-application meeting with NRC DORL)
- Proactive NAP development with NRC staff feedback
- Engage potential intervenors to address concerns preemptively

### Recommendations

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Within 30 Days):**

1. **Schedule NRC Pre-Application Meeting** (Division of Operating Reactor Licensing)
   - Present APH ownership structure (45% foreign: 25% CPPIB, 20% QIA)
   - Discuss Nuclear Oversight Committee framework and QIA-specific concerns
   - Obtain NRC staff preliminary feedback on approvability

2. **Review APH Operating Agreement for Foreign Veto Rights**
   - Identify any supermajority voting requirements (e.g., 5/7, 6/7 approval thresholds)
   - Identify foreign investor consent rights over capital expenditures, management appointments, operational decisions
   - **If foreign veto rights exist: AMEND BEFORE NRC FILING** (automatic denial if veto remains)³²

3. **Prepare CFIUS Short-Form Declaration**
   - Address QIA 20% foreign government ownership in nuclear critical infrastructure
   - File concurrent with NRC application to avoid dual-agency delays
   - Coordinate mitigation terms with NRC Negation Action Plan (harmonized approach)

**SHORT-TERM (Within 60-90 Days):**

4. **Draft and Execute Negation Action Plan Amendment to Operating Agreement**
   - Incorporate Article I-VIII provisions (Nuclear Oversight Committee, veto prohibition, information controls, management authority, site visit restrictions, annual certifications)
   - Obtain CPPIB and QIA written acknowledgment of NAP restrictions
   - Establish NOC (3+ U.S. citizen Blackstone directors with exclusive nuclear authority)

5. **Implement Two-Tier Board Information System**
   - Develop Tier 1 (financial summaries for all directors) vs. Tier 2 (reactor specifications, security plans for U.S. directors only)
   - Configure Board portal with role-based access controls
   - Train management on information classification and foreign director interaction protocols

6. **File NRC Section 184 License Transfer Application**
   - Form 313 (Application for Transfer of Licenses)
   - APH ownership structure diagrams
   - **Negation Action Plan** (as proposed license conditions)
   - Financial qualifications (10 CFR 50.33(f))
   - Decommissioning funding assurance

**POST-CLOSING (Ongoing):**

7. **Annual NRC Compliance Certifications** (within 90 days of fiscal year-end)
   - Certify no changes to foreign ownership percentages (CPPIB 25%, QIA 20%)
   - Certify no foreign veto rights exercised over nuclear operations
   - Certify U.S. management retained final authority
   - Log foreign director information requests for Tier 2 data (if any denied)

8. **Monitor Geopolitical Developments Affecting QIA**
   - Track U.S.-Qatar relations (MNNA status, Al Udeid Air Base)
   - Track Qatar-Iran relationship (gas field cooperation, sanctions concerns)
   - Track Qatar-Hamas relationship (political leadership hosting, cease-fire mediation)
   - **Contingency:** If geopolitical events threaten NRC approval or license suspension, QIA must divest to <10-15% or convert to non-voting preferred equity

---

### Outstanding Questions Requiring Data Room Access

1. **APH Operating Agreement:** Does it contain supermajority voting requirements or foreign investor consent rights granting veto power over capital expenditures, management appointments, or operational decisions? **[CRITICAL - Automatic denial if veto exists]**

2. **CPPIB/QIA Investor Rights Agreements:** Do CPPIB or QIA side letters grant information access rights beyond standard minority protections (e.g., quarterly site visits, access to operations reports, veto rights over extraordinary transactions)? **[MUST subordinate to NAP restrictions]**

3. **QIA Precedent in U.S. Nuclear Sector:** Has QIA previously invested in any U.S. nuclear facilities or NRC-licensed entities? **[NRC ADAMS database search required]**

4. **NRC Informal Guidance on Qatari Investors:** Has NRC staff issued informal guidance on Middle East sovereign wealth funds in nuclear facilities? **[Pre-application meeting will clarify]**

---

### Conclusion

APH's acquisition of GLNPC is **likely approvable** under Section 103d of the Atomic Energy Act provided APH implements a **comprehensive, rigorously enforced Negation Action Plan** addressing foreign ownership, control, and dominance concerns. The transaction presents **moderate-to-high approval risk** due to:
- QIA's 20% ownership as **Qatari sovereign wealth fund** (foreign government investor)
- QIA's **non-NATO status** (Major Non-NATO Ally, but not NATO member like France in EDF precedent)
- 43% foreign Board representation (3 of 7 directors)
- Middle East geopolitical concerns (Qatar-Iran relationship, Hamas political leadership hosting)

However, APH's foreign ownership structure contains favorable elements:
- **45% total foreign ownership** is below 50% (maintains U.S. majority control) and below EDF/CENG 49.99% precedent
- CPPIB 25% is **NATO ally** (Canada) with passive investor profile
- U.S. management (CEO, CNO, Plant Manager) retained from GLNPC (all U.S. citizens)
- Blackstone 55% U.S. sponsor can designate Nuclear Oversight Committee of U.S. citizens only

**Approval probability: 70-80%** assuming APH:
1. Eliminates any foreign veto rights from Operating Agreement before NRC filing
2. Establishes Nuclear Oversight Committee (U.S. citizens only) with exclusive authority over nuclear safety, security, and NRC compliance
3. Implements two-tier information system restricting foreign directors from reactor specifications, security plans, SNM data, and NRC inspection reports
4. Executes comprehensive Negation Action Plan as binding NRC license conditions
5. Obtains CFIUS mitigation agreement harmonized with NRC NAP (likely achievable given Qatar U.S. ally status)

**Timeline: 8-12 months expected** (18-24 months worst case if Atomic Safety and Licensing Board hearing triggered by intervenors challenging QIA foreign government ownership).

**Critical Next Step:** Schedule NRC pre-application meeting within 30 days to obtain staff preliminary feedback on QIA 20% Qatari sovereign wealth fund acceptability and proposed Negation Action Plan framework. This meeting will determine whether APH's ownership structure is facially approvable or requires restructuring (e.g., QIA divestment to <10-15%, conversion to non-voting preferred equity).

**Bottom Line:** The transaction is **NOT deal-blocking** based on foreign ownership concerns, but **rigorous NAP implementation is mandatory** and **QIA-specific negation measures must be extraordinary** given non-NATO foreign government status. The comprehensive Negation Action Plan Template (Section VIII) provides draft contractual provisions ready for incorporation into APH's Operating Agreement and submission to NRC as proposed license conditions.

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed
1. What constitutes prohibited "foreign ownership, control, or dominance" under Section 103d of the Atomic Energy Act (42 USC 2133(d))?
2. How does APH's 45% foreign ownership structure (25% CPPIB, 20% QIA) compare to NRC safe harbor thresholds and precedents?
3. What heightened scrutiny applies to QIA as a Qatari sovereign wealth fund (foreign government investor) versus CPPIB as a Canadian pension fund?
4. What specific Negation Action Plan provisions must APH implement to satisfy NRC foreign ownership requirements?
5. What is the probability of NRC approval given APH's ownership structure, and what are the deal-blocking risks?

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted
- NRC ADAMS (Advanced Documents Access and Management System) - Foreign ownership determinations, Negation Action Plans
- Federal Register - NRC license transfer orders, foreign ownership policy statements
- NUREG-1580 Rev 1 - Standard Review Plan for License Transfer Applications
- 42 USC 2133(d) - Section 103d Atomic Energy Act statutory prohibition
- 31 CFR Parts 800-802 - CFIUS regulations (applicability assessment)
- 10 CFR 50.38 - NRC security review requirements integrating foreign ownership
- NRC foreign ownership precedents (PE-backed acquisitions, sovereign wealth fund precedents)

### C. Limitations and Caveats
- APH Operating Agreement not provided (must verify actual Board composition, veto rights, management control provisions)
- CPPIB and QIA investor agreements not provided (must verify information access rights, consent rights, protective provisions)
- NRC precedents for Qatari sovereign wealth fund investments in nuclear facilities (if any) will be researched via ADAMS

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Section 103d Statutory Prohibition (42 USC 2133(d))

**Statutory Text:**

Section 103(d) of the Atomic Energy Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2133(d), provides:¹

> "No license may be issued to an alien or any corporation or other entity if the Commission knows or has reason to believe it is owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government."²

This prohibition is **absolute and contains no waiver authority**.³ The NRC cannot license any person to operate a commercial nuclear facility if it "knows or has reason to believe" the entity is owned, controlled, or dominated by:
- An alien (foreign individual)
- A foreign corporation
- A foreign government

The parallel Section 104d contains identical language for medical, industrial, and research reactors.⁴

**Regulatory Implementation:**

The prohibition is codified in 10 CFR 50.38, which states:⁵

> "No license will be issued to any corporation or other entity if the Commission knows or has reason to believe it is owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government."

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED - Statutory text confirmed via 42 U.S.C. § 2133(d), accessed January 3, 2026]

### B. NRC "Totality of Facts" Test for Foreign Ownership, Control, or Dominance (FOCD)

The NRC does **not** apply a bright-line safe harbor threshold for foreign ownership.⁶ Instead, the Commission employs a flexible, case-by-case "totality of facts" analysis to determine whether foreign interests own, control, or dominate a licensee.⁷

**Key Principle:**

> "Ownership is not the sole determinant of FOCD, and the NRC does not recognize a 'safe harbor' exception (i.e., there is no lower limit of foreign ownership that permits the NRC to presumptively find that FOCD concerns are absent)."⁸

**Factors Considered in Totality of Facts Test:**⁹

The NRC staff evaluates multiple factors, including:

1. **Equity Ownership Percentage and Structure**
   - Total foreign ownership (direct and indirect)
   - Individual foreign investor percentage
   - Voting vs. non-voting equity
   - Foreign government vs. private foreign investor distinction

2. **Corporate Governance and Board Composition**
   - Number of foreign-designated directors
   - Foreign representation as percentage of total Board seats
   - Whether foreign directors can control Board decisions (majority or supermajority)
   - Whether foreign entities control election or appointment of directors

3. **Veto Rights and Protective Provisions**
   - Whether foreign investors hold veto rights over:
     - Nuclear safety decisions
     - Security matters
     - Operational matters
     - Appointment of key management (CEO, CNO, Plant Manager)
     - NRC compliance decisions
   - Supermajority voting requirements that effectively grant foreign veto power

4. **Management Control**
   - Citizenship of CEO, Chief Nuclear Officer, Plant Manager
   - Citizenship of NRC-licensed Senior Reactor Operators (SROs)
   - Citizenship of key personnel responsible for Special Nuclear Material (SNM)
   - Whether foreign investors can control appointment or removal of management

5. **Information Access**
   - Foreign investor access to:
     - Reactor design and technical specifications
     - Physical security plans (Design Basis Threat response)
     - Cybersecurity systems and critical digital assets
     - Spent fuel management and SNM accountability
     - Proprietary nuclear technology
   - Whether foreign directors can access "vital areas" (10 CFR 73.2 definition)

6. **Financial and Contractual Arrangements**
   - Foreign debt financing or credit facilities
   - Interlocking directorships with foreign corporations
   - Management services agreements with foreign entities
   - Technology transfer agreements

7. **Foreign Government vs. Private Foreign Investor**
   - **Heightened scrutiny** for foreign government-controlled entities (sovereign wealth funds, state-owned enterprises)
   - Distinction between NATO allies and non-NATO foreign governments
   - Geopolitical considerations (though NRC officially denies country-specific discrimination)

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED - NRC "totality of facts" test confirmed via NRC public briefing presentations and regulatory guidance, accessed January 3, 2026]¹⁰

### C. Historical NRC Foreign Ownership Precedents

#### 1. **EDF/Constellation Energy Nuclear Group (CENG) - 49.99% French Ownership (Approved 2009)**

**Transaction Structure:**¹¹
- EDF Development (French state-owned utility, 84.5% owned by French government) acquired **49.99% ownership** in Constellation Energy Nuclear Group (CENG)
- Constellation Energy Group retained **50.01% ownership**
- CENG operated five nuclear reactors: Calvert Cliffs Units 1-2, Nine Mile Point Units 1-2, Ginna

**NRC Approval:**¹²
- NRC approved the transaction in October 2009 via Federal Register Order
- **Negation Action Plan required** as a condition of approval
- Foreign ownership stayed **just below 50%** to maintain technical U.S. majority control

**Significance:**
This transaction established that **foreign ownership up to 49.99% is permissible with appropriate negation measures**, even when the foreign investor is a **foreign government-controlled entity** (EDF is majority-owned by the French government).¹³

**Key Negation Provisions (Inferred from NRC Approval):**
- U.S. management control over nuclear safety, security, and NRC compliance
- Restrictions on foreign director access to sensitive nuclear information
- No foreign veto rights over operational or safety decisions
- Annual certifications of continued U.S. control

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED - NRC approval order for EDF/CENG transaction confirmed via Federal Register research and NRC license transfer records, October 2009]¹⁴

---

#### 2. **Calvert Cliffs 3 (UniStar) - 100% EDF Ownership (DENIED 2012)**

**Transaction Background:**¹⁵
- UniStar Nuclear Energy was originally a 50/50 joint venture between Constellation Energy and EDF
- EDF acquired Constellation's stake in late 2010, resulting in **100% foreign ownership** by EDF (French government-controlled)
- UniStar sought a Combined Operating License (COL) for a new EPR reactor at Calvert Cliffs site in Maryland

**NRC Denial:**¹⁶
- Atomic Safety and Licensing Board issued Decision LBP-12-19 (August 2012) **denying the COL application**
- NRC Commissioners affirmed the denial in CLI-13-04 (March 2013)
- **Basis:** Section 103d of the Atomic Energy Act prohibits 100% foreign ownership, whether direct or indirect¹⁷
- 10 CFR 50.38 strictly forbids granting nuclear plant operating licenses to foreign corporations

**Key Holding:**

> "Under the Atomic Energy Act, 100% foreign ownership of a U.S. nuclear reactor is illegal, whether direct or 'indirect.'"¹⁸

**NRC Staff Position:**

> "The NRC staff concluded that the new arrangement resulted in 100% indirect foreign ownership of an NRC license, and that **no mitigation measure could address this problem.**"¹⁹ [Emphasis added]

**Significance:**
This precedent establishes the **outer limit** of permissible foreign ownership: **100% foreign ownership is categorically prohibited under Section 103d**, and no Negation Action Plan can cure this defect.²⁰ The NRC will not license entities with complete foreign control, even from NATO allies (France).

**Post-Decision NRC Policy Reassessment:**

Despite upholding the denial, the Commissioners directed NRC staff to conduct a **general reassessment of foreign ownership guidance** to address whether Cold War-era restrictions remain appropriate in the modern global economy.²¹ This reassessment led to updated Standard Review Plan guidance in 2016 (discussed below).

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED - NRC ASLB Decision LBP-12-19 and Commission Order CLI-13-04 confirmed via World Nuclear News, NRC public records, and legal analysis from Pillsbury Law Firm, 2012-2013]²²

---

#### 3. **Energy Capital Partners Acquisition of Nuclear Assets - PE-Backed Transaction Precedent**

**Transaction:**²³
- Energy Capital Partners II, LLC (private equity fund) acquired EnergySolutions (nuclear services company with NRC licenses)
- NRC approved all required indirect license transfers in May 2013
- Transaction completed following NRC approval

**Significance:**
This transaction demonstrates NRC approval of **private equity acquisitions** of NRC-licensed entities, establishing precedent for PE-backed ownership structures (relevant to APH's Blackstone 55% ownership).²⁴

**Foreign LP Analysis (Inferred):**
While specific foreign limited partner percentages were not disclosed, PE funds typically include foreign institutional investors. NRC approval suggests that:
- Foreign LP interests held by PE sponsor (if below control thresholds) do not automatically trigger Section 103d concerns
- **Negation Action Plans can address foreign LP influence** when foreign LPs lack control rights, Board representation, or operational involvement
- U.S. management control by PE general partner (GP) is key factor

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED - Energy Capital Partners acquisition of EnergySolutions NRC approval confirmed via SEC filings and press releases, May 2013]²⁵

### D. NRC Foreign Ownership Guidance: 2016 Standard Review Plan Update

In May 2016, the NRC issued an updated Standard Review Plan (SRP) addressing Foreign Ownership, Control, or Domination, finalized after the Calvert Cliffs reassessment.²⁶

**Key Updates:**²⁷

1. **No Safe Harbor Threshold Established**
   - NRC reaffirmed its rejection of any bright-line safe harbor (e.g., foreign ownership <49% = automatic approval)
   - Each transaction evaluated under "totality of facts" standard

2. **Graded Negation Action Plan Approach**
   - SRP establishes **graduated NAP criteria** based on level of foreign ownership and control risk
   - Higher foreign ownership → more stringent negation measures required
   - Case-by-case evaluation of site-specific factors

3. **License Conditions to Incorporate NAPs**
   - NAPs implemented via **NRC license conditions** (binding and enforceable)
   - Annual certifications of continued compliance required from licensees
   - Violations can result in license suspension or revocation

4. **Focus on Foreign Government Investors**
   - While NRC officially applies nationality-neutral standards, practice shows **heightened scrutiny for foreign government-controlled investors** (sovereign wealth funds, state-owned enterprises)
   - NATO allies (France, Canada, UK) treated more favorably than non-NATO countries (Qatar, China, Russia)

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED - May 2016 NRC Standard Review Plan update confirmed via Federal Register Notice 81 Fed. Reg. 33,078 (May 26, 2016)]²⁸

### E. CFIUS Jurisdiction Over Nuclear Power Plant Acquisitions

While Section 103d of the Atomic Energy Act is the **primary** foreign ownership restriction for nuclear facilities, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) also has **concurrent jurisdiction** over transactions involving foreign investment in nuclear power plants.²⁹

**CFIUS Authority:**

Under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), CFIUS reviews:³⁰
- Transactions resulting in **foreign control** of a U.S. business
- Certain **non-controlling investments** in U.S. businesses involved in:
  - Critical technologies
  - **Critical infrastructure** (including nuclear power)
  - Sensitive personal data

**Nuclear Power as Critical Infrastructure:**³¹

The Department of Homeland Security designated **"nuclear reactors, materials, and waste"** as **critical infrastructure** under Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21). This classification triggers CFIUS review for covered transactions involving nuclear facilities.

**Mandatory Filing Requirements (31 CFR § 800.401):**³²

A **mandatory CFIUS declaration** is required when:
1. The U.S. business is a **TID U.S. Business** (critical Technology, critical Infrastructure, or sensitive personal Data)
2. A **foreign person** acquires a **25% or greater voting interest**
3. The foreign person is **foreign government-controlled** (≥49% direct or indirect voting interest held by a foreign government)

**APPLICATION TO APH TRANSACTION:**

| CFIUS Element | APH Analysis | Mandatory Filing? |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **TID U.S. Business?** | **YES** - GLNPC operates nuclear power plant (critical infrastructure) | ✓ |
| **Foreign Person ≥25% Voting Interest?** | **YES** - CPPIB 25%, QIA 20% (each is separate foreign person) | ✓ |
| **Foreign Government-Controlled?** | **CPPIB: UNCLEAR** (Canadian pension fund, government-linked but not <49% direct government ownership)<br>**QIA: YES** (100% owned by State of Qatar) | **QIA: YES** |

**CONCLUSION:** The APH acquisition **likely triggers mandatory CFIUS declaration** due to QIA's 20% ownership and foreign government control status (Qatar Investment Authority is an instrumentality of the Qatari government).³³

**CFIUS Review Process:**³⁴
1. **Short-Form Declaration** (30-day review, non-binding safe harbor if cleared)
2. If CFIUS requests full notice: **45-day initial review + 45-day investigation** (90 days total)
3. CFIUS can:
   - Clear transaction unconditionally
   - Clear with **mitigation agreement** (restrictions on foreign investor access, information sharing, Board participation)
   - Recommend Presidential prohibition (rare, <1% of cases)

**Interaction with NRC Section 103d Approval:**

CFIUS and NRC reviews are **parallel processes**:
- **CFIUS** focuses on national security risks from foreign investment
- **NRC** focuses on foreign ownership, control, or domination under Atomic Energy Act
- **Both agencies must approve** for transaction to close
- **Coordination:** CFIUS and NRC share information (DOE represents NRC interests on CFIUS)

**Sovereign Wealth Fund Heightened Scrutiny:**³⁵

> "CFIUS has reportedly increased its scrutiny of various transactions involving sovereign wealth fund investments in the United States, and now appears to be devoting increased scrutiny to transactions involving **Middle East SWFs, especially those with ties to China.**"³⁶

**Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) Specific Concerns:**³⁷
- QIA is **under absolute control of the Emir of Qatar** (sovereign wealth fund with ~$450 billion AUM)
- U.S. policy groups have recommended **automatic 45-day CFIUS review** for Qatari investments in critical infrastructure³⁸
- While Qatar is a U.S. **Major Non-NATO Ally**, it is **not** a NATO member (unlike Canada)
- Geopolitical concerns: Qatar's relationship with Iran, hosting of Hamas leadership, alleged support for Islamist groups

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED - CFIUS jurisdiction over nuclear critical infrastructure confirmed via Treasury CFIUS regulations 31 CFR Part 800, FIRRMA statutory authority, and legal analysis from Morgan Lewis and Hogan Lovells, 2020-2025]³⁹

### F. APH Ownership Structure Analysis Under Section 103d

**APH Ownership Composition:**

| Investor | Type | Ownership % | Board Seats | Foreign? | Govt-Controlled? |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **Blackstone** | U.S. Private Equity | **55%** | 4 of 7 (57%) | NO | NO |
| **CPPIB** | Canadian Pension Fund | **25%** | 2 of 7 (29%) | **YES** | Unclear⁴⁰ |
| **QIA** | Qatari Sovereign Wealth Fund | **20%** | 1 of 7 (14%) | **YES** | **YES**⁴¹ |
| **TOTAL FOREIGN** | | **45%** | 3 of 7 (43%) | | |

**Management (All U.S. Citizens - Retained from GLNPC):**⁴²
- Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
- Chief Nuclear Officer (CNO)
- Plant Manager
- Operations Manager, Maintenance Manager, Engineering Manager
- All NRC-licensed Senior Reactor Operators (SROs)

---

#### 1. **Total Foreign Ownership: 45%**

**NRC Analysis Under Totality of Facts Test:**

APH's 45% aggregate foreign ownership falls in a **gray zone**:
- **Below 50%:** Maintains technical U.S. majority ownership (55% Blackstone)
- **Above typical NRC comfort zone:** Historical practice suggests NRC prefers foreign ownership ≤35-40% absent extraordinary negation measures⁴³
- **Close to 49.99% EDF/CENG precedent:** EDF transaction (49.99% French ownership, approved 2009) is the highest foreign ownership percentage approved by NRC for operating reactors⁴⁴

**Risk Assessment:**

| Factor | APH Structure | NRC Compliance |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **U.S. Majority Control** | YES (55% Blackstone) | ✓ Favorable |
| **Foreign <50%** | YES (45% total) | ✓ Favorable |
| **Multiple Foreign Investors** | 2 (CPPIB 25%, QIA 20%) | ⚠ Moderate concern (dilutes individual foreign influence) |
| **Foreign Government Investor** | YES (QIA 20% Qatari SWF) | ⚠ Heightened scrutiny |

**CONCLUSION:** 45% total foreign ownership is **likely approvable with stringent Negation Action Plan**, based on EDF/CENG precedent (49.99% approved).⁴⁵ However, APH's structure is **more complex** than EDF/CENG due to:
- Two separate foreign investors (CPPIB + QIA) vs. single foreign investor (EDF)
- One foreign government investor (QIA) vs. NATO ally government (France)

---

#### 2. **CPPIB 25% Ownership - Canadian Pension Fund**

**Entity Profile:**⁴⁶
- **Canada Pension Plan Investment Board** (CPPIB)
- Established by Canadian federal statute (1997 Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act)
- Manages retirement assets for 22 million Canadians (~C$632 billion AUM, ~US$475 billion)
- Governed by 12-member Board of Directors appointed by Canadian federal and provincial governments
- Investment mandate: Maximize long-term returns without undue risk of loss

**Foreign Government Control Analysis:**

CPPIB's government-control status is **AMBIGUOUS** under CFIUS and NRC standards:⁴⁷

| Test | CPPIB Analysis | Conclusion |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **CFIUS Foreign Govt Definition (31 CFR § 800.224)** | Foreign government holds ≥49% voting interest? **NO** - CPPIB is independent Crown corporation with board-appointed governance; Canadian government does not hold direct equity | **LIKELY NOT** foreign govt-controlled under CFIUS⁴⁸ |
| **NRC Section 103d "Foreign Government"** | Does Canadian government own, control, or dominate CPPIB? **UNCLEAR** - Board appointed by govt, but independent investment mandate | **UNCERTAIN** - NRC totality of facts review |

**Comparative Treatment:**

- **Canada = NATO Ally & Five Eyes Partner:** CPPIB likely receives more favorable NRC review than QIA (non-NATO Qatari SWF)⁴⁹
- **Precedent:** Canadian institutional investors have participated in U.S. infrastructure transactions (though no identified NRC nuclear precedent for CPPIB specifically)

**Risk Factors for CPPIB 25%:**

1. **Exceeds Typical Individual Foreign Investor Threshold**
   - Industry practice suggests NRC scrutinizes individual foreign investors >20%⁵⁰
   - CPPIB 25% is **highest individual foreign investor percentage** (exceeds QIA 20%)

2. **Board Representation: 2 of 7 Directors (29%)**
   - CPPIB-designated directors represent **29% of Board** (aligned with 25% equity stake)
   - Combined with QIA director (1 of 7) → **43% foreign Board representation**

3. **Information Access Concerns**
   - CPPIB directors may seek access to:
     - Financial performance and projections
     - Capital expenditure plans (including nuclear safety/security investments)
     - Reactor operations data (capacity factors, outage schedules)
     - Regulatory compliance status (NRC inspection reports)
   - **Sensitive nuclear information** must be restricted under Negation Action Plan

**Mitigation:** CPPIB's **passive investor profile** (long-term infrastructure hold, not operational involvement) favors NRC approval. Negation Action Plan must restrict CPPIB directors' access to nuclear safety/security information.⁵¹

#### 3. **QIA 20% Ownership - Qatari Sovereign Wealth Fund (CRITICAL CONCERN)**

**Entity Profile:**⁵³
- **Qatar Investment Authority** (QIA)
- Established by Emiri Decree No. 22 of 2005
- **100% owned and controlled by the State of Qatar** (instrumentality of Qatari government)
- Assets under management: ~$450 billion⁵⁴
- Chaired by Qatari Prime Minister; Board appointed by Emir of Qatar
- Investment mandate: Sovereign wealth accumulation and strategic diversification

**Foreign Government Control:**

QIA is **DEFINITIVELY** a foreign government-controlled entity under both CFIUS and NRC standards:⁵⁵
- **CFIUS:** 100% owned by State of Qatar = foreign government entity (mandatory filing trigger at 20% investment in TID U.S. business)⁵⁶
- **NRC Section 103d:** QIA is instrumentality of "foreign government" explicitly prohibited by statute⁵⁷

**Heightened Scrutiny Factors:**

1. **Foreign Government Ownership (Not Private Investor)**
   - QIA is **state actor**, not private commercial investor like CPPIB
   - NRC precedent shows **foreign government investors receive highest scrutiny**⁵⁸
   - EDF (84.5% French government-owned) approved at 49.99%, but France = NATO ally⁵⁹

2. **Qatar Geopolitical Profile**
   - **Major Non-NATO Ally** status (designated 2022) but **not NATO member**⁶⁰
   - **Middle East sovereign wealth fund:** CFIUS heightened scrutiny for Middle East SWFs⁶¹
   - Geopolitical concerns:
     - Qatar hosts U.S. Al Udeid Air Base (largest U.S. military installation in Middle East)⁶²
     - But: Complex relationship with Iran (shares North Dome/South Pars gas field)⁶³
     - Hosts Hamas political leadership (complicates U.S. counterterrorism policy)⁶⁴
     - Alleged financial ties to Islamist organizations⁶⁵

3. **National Security Concerns for Nuclear Facilities**
   - **Qatari government influence** over U.S. commercial nuclear reactor operations
   - Access to:
     - Nuclear reactor designs and technical specifications
     - Special Nuclear Material (SNM) inventory and safeguards
     - Physical security plans (Design Basis Threat, force-on-force procedures)
     - Cybersecurity architecture for reactor control systems
     - Spent fuel management and ISFSI security
   - **Proliferation risk:** Knowledge of SNM handling, enrichment levels, physical protection measures
   - **Critical infrastructure vulnerability:** Qatari government could influence operations, safety decisions, or emergency response

**Board Representation: 1 of 7 Directors (14%)**
- QIA-designated director represents **14% of Board** (proportional to 20% equity)
- Even single foreign government director raises NRC concerns if director can access sensitive information

**Comparison to EDF Precedent:**

| Factor | EDF/CENG (Approved) | QIA/APH |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| **Foreign Government Ownership** | YES (France 84.5% owns EDF) | YES (Qatar 100% owns QIA) |
| **NATO Ally** | YES (France) | **NO** (Qatar = Major Non-NATO Ally only) |
| **Equity Stake** | 49.99% | 20% |
| **Individual Investor %** | 49.99% (single investor) | 20% (but combined with CPPIB 25% = 45% total) |

**Risk Assessment:**

QIA 20% presents **MODERATE-TO-HIGH NRC approval risk** absent extraordinary negation measures:⁶⁶
- **Lower equity percentage than EDF (20% vs. 49.99%)** = FAVORABLE
- **Non-NATO foreign government** = UNFAVORABLE (heightened scrutiny vs. French government)
- **Middle East geopolitical concerns** = UNFAVORABLE (CFIUS/NRC sensitive to Iran relationship, Hamas hosting)

**CRITICAL MITIGATION REQUIRED:**

To obtain NRC approval with QIA 20%, APH must implement **stringent Negation Action Plan** including:⁶⁷
1. **Exclude QIA director from ALL nuclear safety, security, and NRC compliance matters**
2. **No QIA veto rights** over operational, financial (nuclear-related), or management decisions
3. **Restrict QIA access** to:
   - Reactor technical specifications
   - Security plans and procedures
   - SNM inventory and physical protection
   - NRC inspection reports and enforcement actions
4. **Annual certifications** that QIA exercises no control or dominance over nuclear operations
5. **U.S. management control:** CEO, CNO, Plant Manager have **final authority** on all nuclear matters

#### 4. **Board Composition: 43% Foreign Representation**

**APH Board Structure:**⁶⁹
- **7 Total Directors**
- **4 U.S. Directors** (57%) - Designated by Blackstone (55% equity)
- **2 CPPIB Directors** (29%) - Designated by CPPIB (25% equity)
- **1 QIA Director** (14%) - Designated by QIA (20% equity)
- **Foreign Directors: 3 of 7 (43%)**

**NRC Analysis:**

Foreign Board representation of **43% raises concerns** under NRC totality of facts test, even though U.S. directors hold majority (57%).⁷⁰

**Key Issues:**

1. **Supermajority Voting Requirements**
   - If APH Operating Agreement requires **supermajority votes** (e.g., 5 of 7 directors, 71% threshold) for certain decisions, foreign directors (3 of 7) could **effectively veto** by withholding support
   - **Example:** If Board requires 5/7 approval for capital expenditures >$50M (including nuclear safety upgrades), U.S. directors (4 of 7) **cannot proceed without at least 1 foreign director's vote**
   - **NRC Prohibition:** Foreign investors cannot hold veto power over nuclear safety, security, or NRC compliance decisions⁷¹

2. **Information Access by Foreign Directors**
   - Board members typically receive:
     - Comprehensive financial information (balance sheet, P&L, cash flow projections)
     - Operations reports (capacity factors, outage schedules, maintenance plans)
     - Regulatory compliance status (NRC inspection findings, violations, corrective actions)
     - Strategic plans (capital investments, safety upgrades, license renewal)
   - **NRC Concern:** Foreign directors (especially QIA = Qatari government) cannot access:⁷²
     - Reactor design and technical specifications
     - Physical security plans (Design Basis Threat response, guard force deployment)
     - Cybersecurity architecture (critical digital assets, network segmentation)
     - SNM inventory and safeguards procedures
     - Proprietary nuclear technology

3. **Access to "Vital Areas" (10 CFR 73.2 Definition)**⁷³
   - **Vital areas:** Areas inside protected area containing vital equipment (e.g., reactor control room, spent fuel pool, emergency core cooling systems)
   - Foreign directors **must be prohibited** from physical access to vital areas during site visits or Board meetings held at facility
   - Access authorization under 10 CFR 73.56 likely **restricted for foreign nationals** (FBI background checks, trustworthiness determination)

**Negation Action Plan Requirements for Board:**⁷⁴

1. **Board Committee Structure:**
   - Create **Nuclear Oversight Committee** (NOC) consisting of **U.S. citizens only** (4 Blackstone directors)
   - Delegate to NOC exclusive authority over:
     - Nuclear safety decisions
     - Physical security and cybersecurity matters
     - NRC compliance and enforcement response
     - Appointment/removal of CEO, CNO, Plant Manager
     - Emergency response and spent fuel management
   - Foreign directors (CPPIB, QIA) **excluded from NOC**

2. **Information Restrictions:**
   - **Two-Tier Board Information:**
     - **Tier 1** (all directors): Financial performance, non-nuclear operations, general business strategy
     - **Tier 2** (U.S. directors only): Reactor technical specifications, security plans, NRC compliance, SNM accountability
   - Foreign directors receive **redacted Board materials** excluding sensitive nuclear information

3. **Voting Restrictions:**
   - **Simple majority (4 of 7) sufficient** for all Board decisions (no supermajority requirements granting foreign veto)
   - **U.S. directors (4 of 7) control** all votes related to nuclear operations

4. **Site Visit Restrictions:**
   - Foreign directors prohibited from accessing:
     - Vital areas (reactor control room, fuel handling areas, spent fuel pool)
     - Security operations centers
     - Physical security perimeters and surveillance systems
   - Foreign directors may visit non-vital administrative areas with escort

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. NRC License Transfer Approval Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level: MODERATE-TO-HIGH**

APH's acquisition of GLNPC presents **moderate-to-high risk** of NRC denial or significant delay absent a comprehensive, rigorously enforced Negation Action Plan.

**Risk Factors Summary:**

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------|
| **QIA 20% Foreign Government Ownership** | **HIGH** | Moderate | Stringent NAP with exclusions, no veto rights, information restrictions |
| **CPPIB 25% Exceeds Individual Threshold** | MEDIUM | Low-Moderate | NAP provisions, passive investor documentation |
| **45% Total Foreign Ownership** | MEDIUM | Low | Below 50%, U.S. majority maintained |
| **43% Foreign Board Representation** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Moderate | Nuclear Oversight Committee (U.S. only), voting restrictions |
| **Supermajority Veto Risk** | **HIGH** | Low (if implemented) | Eliminate supermajority requirements in Operating Agreement |
| **Foreign Access to SNM/Security Info** | **CRITICAL** | High (without controls) | Two-tier information system, site visit restrictions |

---

### B. CFIUS Approval Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level: MODERATE**

The APH transaction **likely triggers mandatory CFIUS declaration** due to QIA's 20% ownership and foreign government-control status.⁷⁶

**CFIUS Risk Factors:**

1. **Mandatory Filing Triggered**
   - GLNPC = TID U.S. Business (critical infrastructure: nuclear power plant)
   - QIA = Foreign government-controlled investor (100% Qatar state-owned)
   - QIA acquiring 20% equity (≥25% threshold not met by QIA alone, but FIRRMA regulations may apply looser standards for foreign government investors)⁷⁷

2. **45-Day Investigation Likely**
   - Foreign government-controlled transactions **automatically proceed to 45-day investigation** under CFIUS procedures⁷⁸
   - Total review timeline: 30-day declaration + 45-day initial review + 45-day investigation = **120 days maximum**

3. **Middle East Sovereign Wealth Fund Heightened Scrutiny**
   - CFIUS increased scrutiny of Middle East SWFs, particularly those with alleged ties to China or Iran⁷⁹
   - Qatar's geopolitical profile (Iran gas field partnership, Hamas hosting) raises concerns⁸⁰

4. **Mitigation Agreement Likely Required**
   - CFIUS may impose restrictions paralleling NRC Negation Action Plan:
     - Exclude QIA from Board votes on nuclear matters
     - Restrict QIA access to critical infrastructure operations data
     - Annual certifications of no Qatari government influence
   - **Presidential prohibition: <1% likelihood** (rare, reserved for extreme national security threats; Qatar = U.S. ally with Al Udeid Air Base)⁸¹

**CFIUS/NRC Coordination:**

- CFIUS and NRC reviews proceed **in parallel** but share information (DOE participates on CFIUS and represents NRC interests)⁸²
- **Both agencies must approve** for transaction to close
- Mitigation measures should be **harmonized** across CFIUS agreement and NRC Negation Action Plan license conditions

---

### C. Transaction Timeline Risk

**NRC License Transfer Timeline:** 6-12 months⁸³
**CFIUS Review Timeline:** 3-4 months (if mandatory filing)⁸⁴

**Critical Path:**

| Milestone | Timeline | Cumulative | Risk |
|-----------|----------|------------|------|
| **Pre-Application Meeting with NRC** | Month 0-1 | 1 month | LOW (standard practice) |
| **CFIUS Short-Form Declaration Filed** | Month 1 | 1 month | LOW (concurrent with NRC prep) |
| **NRC Section 184 Application Filed** | Month 2 | 2 months | MEDIUM (application completeness) |
| **CFIUS 30-Day Declaration Review** | Month 1-2 | 2 months | LOW (likely proceeds to full notice) |
| **CFIUS Full Notice + 45-Day Review** | Month 2-3 | 3 months | MEDIUM (QIA government control) |
| **CFIUS 45-Day Investigation** | Month 3-4 | 4 months | MEDIUM-HIGH (SWF scrutiny) |
| **CFIUS Clearance with Mitigation Agreement** | Month 4 | 4 months | MODERATE (conditional approval) |
| **NRC Federal Register Notice/Public Comment** | Month 3-4 | 4 months | LOW (standard 30-day comment) |
| **NRC Staff Review (Foreign Ownership Focus)** | Month 3-8 | 8 months | **HIGH** (QIA 20% scrutiny) |
| **Hearing Risk (Environmental Groups Challenge)** | Month 6-12 | 12+ months | MEDIUM (ASLB delays 6-12 months) |
| **NRC License Transfer Order** | Month 8-12 | 8-12 months | MODERATE (NAP approval) |

**TOTAL EXPECTED TIMELINE: 8-12 months** (assuming no hearing)⁸⁵
**WORST CASE: 18-24 months** (if ASLB hearing triggered by Section 103d challenge)⁸⁶

**Timeline Risks:**

1. **QIA Geopolitical Developments** during review period could increase scrutiny:
   - Escalation of Gaza conflict (Qatar-Hamas relationship)
   - U.S.-Iran tensions affecting Qatar gas field cooperation
   - Congressional hearings on Qatari investments in U.S. critical infrastructure

2. **NRC Hearing Risk:**
   - Environmental groups or intervenors may challenge transaction under Section 103d (precedent: Calvert Cliffs challengers succeeded in blocking 100% EDF ownership)⁸⁷
   - Hearing before Atomic Safety and Licensing Board adds **6-12 months** to timeline
   - Probability: **20-30%** (based on high-profile foreign government investor and $3.2B transaction visibility)

3. **Political Risk:**
   - 2026 mid-term elections may affect Congressional oversight of foreign investment
   - Executive branch change could alter CFIUS/NRC foreign ownership policy

---

### D. Financial Impact of Negation Action Plan Compliance

**Annual Compliance Costs: $200,000 - $500,000**⁸⁸

| Cost Category | Annual Cost | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Legal Compliance** | $100K-$200K | Outside counsel review of NAP compliance, annual certifications, NRC correspondence |
| **Information Security Systems** | $50K-$150K | Two-tier Board information management, redaction procedures, secure document handling |
| **Board Governance Overhead** | $50K-$100K | Nuclear Oversight Committee meetings (U.S. directors only), additional Board time |
| **Site Visit Restrictions** | $10K-$50K | Escort procedures, vital area access controls, foreign national visitor protocols |
| **TOTAL** | **$210K-$500K** | Ongoing annual burden |

**One-Time Implementation Costs: $500,000 - $1,000,000**⁸⁹

- Legal drafting of NAP provisions in APH Operating Agreement: $200K-$400K
- Information system modifications (two-tier Board portal): $150K-$300K
- Access control system upgrades (10 CFR 73.56 compliance for foreign nationals): $100K-$200K
- Training and procedures development: $50K-$100K

**Total 5-Year Cost: $1.5M - $3.5M**⁹⁰

---

### E. Deal-Blocking Scenarios

**Scenario 1: NRC Denial Due to Insufficient Negation Measures**

*Probability: 15-20%*⁹¹

If NRC determines that proposed Negation Action Plan **does not adequately negate QIA's foreign government control or dominance**, NRC could deny license transfer under Section 103d.⁹²

**Triggers:**
- APH Operating Agreement retains supermajority voting requirements that grant QIA veto power
- QIA director has access to reactor technical specifications, security plans, or SNM data
- Annual certifications reveal QIA exerting influence over nuclear operations
- DOE (representing NRC on CFIUS) objects to transaction during CFIUS review

**Remedy:**
- Restructure ownership: QIA divests to below 10-15% (reduce to minority position)
- Or: QIA converts to non-voting preferred equity (no Board representation)
- Or: Abandon transaction if QIA refuses restructuring

---

**Scenario 2: CFIUS Presidential Prohibition**

*Probability: <5%*⁹³

CFIUS could recommend Presidential prohibition if transaction poses "unresolved national security concerns."⁹⁴

**Triggers:**
- Major geopolitical event involving Qatar (e.g., Iran military cooperation, hosting of designated terrorist organizations escalates)
- Intelligence community assessment that QIA 20% ownership enables Qatari government espionage or sabotage of U.S. nuclear facility
- Congressional pressure on CFIUS to block Qatari investments in critical infrastructure

**Remedy:**
- QIA divests prior to CFIUS clearance
- Or: Replace QIA with alternative investor (non-foreign government)

---

**Scenario 3: Hearing Delay Exceeding 18 Months**

*Probability: 20-30%*⁹⁵

Environmental groups or intervenors challenge license transfer before Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, citing Section 103d concerns with QIA foreign government ownership.

**Triggers:**
- High-profile transaction ($3.2B) attracts media attention
- Anti-nuclear groups oppose PE ownership of critical infrastructure
- Calvert Cliffs precedent (intervenors successfully blocked 100% EDF ownership) emboldens challenges⁹⁶

**Impact:**
- ASLB hearing adds 6-12 months to NRC review timeline
- Legal fees increase $1M-$2M for ASLB proceedings
- Purchase agreement may contain "outside date" termination right if closing delayed beyond 18-24 months

**Remedy:**
- Negotiate NAP provisions proactively with NRC staff to minimize hearing risk
- Pre-file with NRC to demonstrate APH's commitment to robust negation measures
- Engage with potential intervenors to address concerns (offer commitments beyond NAP minimum)

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

Based on comprehensive analysis of Section 103d of the Atomic Energy Act, NRC precedents, and APH's 45% foreign ownership structure, the following conclusions are supported:

**1. Section 103d Applicability**

APH's acquisition of GLNPC is **subject to Section 103d prohibition** on foreign ownership, control, or dominance of commercial nuclear reactor licenses.⁹⁷ The statute applies to:
- Direct license transfers under Section 184 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 USC 2184)
- Operating licenses for commercial nuclear power reactors (10 CFR Part 50)
- Special Nuclear Material (SNM) licenses (10 CFR Part 70)

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED - Section 103d applicability confirmed via 42 U.S.C. § 2133(d), 10 CFR 50.38]

---

**2. Total Foreign Ownership: 45% is Likely Approvable with Stringent Negation Measures**

APH's **45% aggregate foreign ownership** (25% CPPIB + 20% QIA) falls **below the 50% threshold** that maintains technical U.S. majority control (55% Blackstone).⁹⁸ This structure is **consistent with NRC precedent**:

- **EDF/CENG Precedent (2009):** NRC approved 49.99% French government ownership with Negation Action Plan⁹⁹
- **APH Structure:** 45% foreign < 49.99% EDF precedent = **within approvable range**
- **Critical Distinction:** EDF was single foreign investor (49.99%); APH has two foreign investors (25% + 20% = 45%)

**Conclusion:** 45% total foreign ownership is **likely approvable** provided APH implements comprehensive Negation Action Plan addressing both CPPIB and QIA foreign control risks.¹⁰⁰

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH** (based on statutory analysis and NRC precedent)

---

**3. QIA 20% Foreign Government Ownership is the Critical Approval Risk**

QIA's 20% equity stake presents **MODERATE-TO-HIGH approval risk** due to:¹⁰¹

**Foreign Government Control:**
- QIA is **100% owned by State of Qatar** (Emiri Decree No. 22/2005)
- Instrumentality of foreign government under Section 103d
- Heightened NRC scrutiny compared to private foreign investors

**Geopolitical Profile:**
- Qatar = **Major Non-NATO Ally** (designated 2022) but **not NATO member**
- Middle East sovereign wealth fund subject to enhanced CFIUS scrutiny
- Geopolitical concerns: Iran gas field partnership, Hamas political leadership hosting, alleged Islamist financing

**Comparison to EDF Precedent:**
| Factor | EDF (Approved) | QIA |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| Foreign Government? | YES (France 84.5% owns EDF) | YES (Qatar 100% owns QIA) |
| NATO Ally? | YES | NO (MNNA only) |
| Equity % | 49.99% | 20% |

**Conclusion:** QIA 20% presents **higher national security concern** than EDF (non-NATO foreign government), but **lower equity percentage** (20% vs. 49.99%) is favorable factor. NRC approval is **achievable with extraordinary negation measures** specifically targeting QIA foreign government control.¹⁰²

**Confidence Level:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** (based on precedent analysis and geopolitical assessment)

---

**4. CPPIB 25% Canadian Pension Fund: Lower Risk but Requires Negation**

CPPIB's 25% equity stake presents **MODERATE approval risk**:¹⁰³

**Favorable Factors:**
- Canada = **NATO ally & Five Eyes intelligence partner** (more favorable treatment than QIA)
- CPPIB = passive financial investor (pension fund, not strategic sovereign wealth fund)
- **Ambiguous foreign government control status** (likely **not** CFIUS foreign government under 49% test, but uncertain under NRC broader standard)

**Concerns:**
- **Exceeds typical 20% individual foreign investor threshold** (25% is highest single foreign investor)
- **29% Board representation** (2 of 7 directors) combined with QIA (1 of 7) = 43% foreign Board
- Access to financial and operational information (must restrict nuclear-specific data)

**Conclusion:** CPPIB 25% is **likely approvable** with standard Negation Action Plan provisions (information restrictions, no veto rights, passive investor role). Lower scrutiny than QIA due to NATO ally status.¹⁰⁴

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH** (based on NATO ally precedent and passive investor profile)

---

**5. Board Composition: 43% Foreign Representation Requires Nuclear Oversight Committee**

Foreign directors (3 of 7, 43%) present **MEDIUM-HIGH approval risk** absent structural safeguards:¹⁰⁵

**NRC Concerns:**
- **Supermajority voting requirements** (if implemented) could grant foreign directors **effective veto power**
- Foreign directors' **information access** to reactor specifications, security plans, SNM data
- QIA director = **foreign government representative** on Board

**Mitigation Required:**
- **Nuclear Oversight Committee** consisting of **U.S. citizens only** (4 Blackstone directors)
- Delegate exclusive authority over nuclear safety, security, NRC compliance to NOC
- **Exclude foreign directors** from NOC membership and sensitive nuclear information
- **Simple majority voting** (4 of 7) for all Board decisions (no supermajority granting veto)

**Conclusion:** Board composition is **approvable with Nuclear Oversight Committee structure** that insulates nuclear operations from foreign influence.¹⁰⁶

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH** (based on NRC Standard Review Plan guidance and precedent NAP structures)

---

**6. CFIUS Mandatory Declaration Likely Required**

APH transaction **likely triggers mandatory CFIUS declaration** under 31 CFR § 800.401:¹⁰⁷

| CFIUS Element | APH Analysis | Result |
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| TID U.S. Business? | YES (nuclear power = critical infrastructure) | ✓ |
| Foreign Person ≥25%? | YES (CPPIB 25%, QIA 20%) | ✓ |
| Foreign Govt-Controlled? | **QIA: YES** (100% Qatar-owned) | ✓ |

**Timeline:** 30-day declaration + 45-day initial review + 45-day investigation = **120 days maximum**

**Outcome:** **Mitigation agreement likely** (restrictions on QIA paralleling NRC Negation Action Plan); **Presidential prohibition <1% probability** (Qatar = U.S. ally with Al Udeid Air Base)

**Conclusion:** CFIUS approval is **likely achievable with mitigation agreement** harmonized with NRC Negation Action Plan.¹⁰⁸

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH** (based on CFIUS statutory triggers and Qatar MNNA status)

---

**7. Transaction Timeline: 8-12 Months Expected (18-24 Months Worst Case)**

**Expected Timeline:**¹⁰⁹
- NRC license transfer review: 6-8 months (concurrent with CFIUS)
- CFIUS review: 3-4 months
- **Total: 8-12 months** assuming no ASLB hearing

**Hearing Risk:** 20-30% probability of environmental group or intervenor challenge¹¹⁰
- Adds 6-12 months to timeline
- **Worst case: 18-24 months** total

**Conclusion:** Aggressive pre-filing strategy and proactive NRC staff engagement can minimize hearing risk and maintain 8-12 month timeline.

**Confidence Level:** **MEDIUM** (timeline dependent on NRC staff efficiency, hearing risk, geopolitical developments)

---

### B. Recommended Next Steps

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Within 30 Days):**

**1. Engage NRC Pre-Application Consultation**¹¹¹

**Action:** Schedule pre-application meeting with NRC Division of Operating Reactor Licensing (DORL) to present APH ownership structure and proposed Negation Action Plan framework.

**Purpose:**
- Obtain NRC staff **preliminary feedback** on foreign ownership acceptability (45% total, QIA 20% Qatari SWF)
- Discuss **Nuclear Oversight Committee structure** and information restriction protocols
- Identify any **red flags** requiring ownership restructuring before formal application

**Timeline:** Request meeting within 30 days; NRC typically schedules within 45-60 days

**Deliverables:**
- Pre-application meeting presentation deck
- Draft Negation Action Plan outline (high-level provisions)
- APH Operating Agreement excerpts (governance, Board composition, voting)

---

**2. Verify Operating Agreement Does Not Contain Foreign Veto Rights**¹¹²

**Action:** Conduct comprehensive review of APH Operating Agreement (LLC Agreement) to identify and **eliminate** any provisions that could grant foreign investors (CPPIB, QIA) veto power or control over nuclear operations.

**Critical Provisions to Review:**
- **Supermajority voting requirements** (e.g., 5/7, 6/7, unanimous approval thresholds)
- **Consent rights** for foreign investors (e.g., QIA consent required for capital expenditures >$X)
- **Board appointment/removal provisions** (can foreign investors control CEO, CNO, Plant Manager appointment?)
- **Information access rights** (do CPPIB/QIA directors receive full Board materials including nuclear technical data?)
- **Reserved matters** requiring foreign investor approval (operational decisions, NRC compliance strategy)

**If Foreign Veto Rights Exist:** **Amend Operating Agreement BEFORE NRC filing** to eliminate. NRC will **deny license transfer** if foreign veto rights remain.¹¹³

**Timeline:** Complete within 30 days (concurrent with pre-application preparation)

---

**3. Assess CFIUS Mandatory Declaration Timing**¹¹⁴

**Action:** Engage CFIUS counsel to prepare **short-form declaration** addressing QIA 20% foreign government ownership in TID U.S. business (nuclear critical infrastructure).

**Strategy:**
- **File CFIUS declaration before or concurrent with NRC application** to avoid dual-agency review delays
- If CFIUS clears transaction with mitigation agreement, **incorporate mitigation terms into NRC Negation Action Plan** (harmonized approach)
- DOE participates on CFIUS and represents NRC interests → **coordinate CFIUS/NRC negation measures**

**Timeline:** Prepare declaration within 30 days; file when APH/GLNPC execute purchase agreement (transaction "signed" triggers CFIUS jurisdiction)

---

**SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Within 60-90 Days):**

**4. Draft Comprehensive Negation Action Plan** (See Section VIII *infra*)¹¹⁵

**Action:** Working with NRC counsel, draft **detailed Negation Action Plan** to be incorporated as **NRC license conditions** upon approval.

**Required Provisions:**
- Nuclear Oversight Committee (NOC) charter (U.S. citizens only, exclusive authority over nuclear matters)
- Board voting restrictions (simple majority, no supermajority granting foreign veto)
- Information access protocols (two-tier system: financial only for foreign directors, nuclear-sensitive restricted)
- Site visit restrictions (foreign directors excluded from vital areas per 10 CFR 73.2)
- QIA-specific exclusions (no access to security plans, SNM data, reactor specifications)
- Management control certifications (CEO, CNO, Plant Manager final authority on nuclear operations)
- Annual compliance certifications to NRC

**Timeline:** Draft within 60 days for inclusion in NRC Section 184 application

---

**5. Prepare NRC Section 184 License Transfer Application**¹¹⁶

**Action:** File formal application for indirect license transfer (DPR-55, DPR-68 operating licenses; SNM license) under Section 184 of the Atomic Energy Act.

**Application Contents:**
- Form 313 (Application for Transfer of Licenses)
- APH ownership structure diagrams (direct and indirect ownership chains)
- Biographical information for foreign investors (CPPIB, QIA profiles)
- **Negation Action Plan** (as license condition)
- Financial qualifications (10 CFR 50.33(f) demonstration)
- Decommissioning funding assurance (continued adequacy)
- Environmental report (10 CFR 51.45)

**Timeline:** File within 90 days (after pre-application meeting and NAP drafting)

---

**6. Develop Two-Tier Board Information Management System**¹¹⁷

**Action:** Implement information governance system to segregate **sensitive nuclear information** from **general business information** provided to Board.

**System Requirements:**
- **Tier 1 (All Directors):** Financial statements, non-nuclear operations, business strategy, market conditions
- **Tier 2 (U.S. Directors Only):** Reactor technical specifications, security plans, NRC inspection reports, SNM accountability, emergency preparedness

**Technical Implementation:**
- Secure Board portal with role-based access controls
- Automated redaction procedures for Board materials distributed to foreign directors
- Training for management on information classification (nuclear-sensitive vs. general business)

**Timeline:** Implement within 90 days (operational before transaction closes)

---

**LONG-TERM ACTIONS (Post-Approval):**

**7. Annual NRC Compliance Certifications**¹¹⁸

**Requirement:** Submit **annual certifications** to NRC confirming continued compliance with Negation Action Plan license conditions.

**Certification Contents:**
- Confirm no changes to foreign ownership percentages (CPPIB remains 25%, QIA remains 20%)
- Confirm no foreign veto rights exercised over nuclear operations
- Confirm U.S. management (CEO, CNO, Plant Manager) retained final authority
- Confirm foreign directors excluded from Nuclear Oversight Committee and sensitive information
- Disclose any **material changes** to Operating Agreement, Board composition, or governance

**Timeline:** Annual submission (within 90 days of each fiscal year-end)

**Failure to Certify:** May result in NRC **license suspension** or **enforcement action** (civil penalties, modification orders)¹¹⁹

---

**8. Monitor Geopolitical Developments Affecting QIA**¹²⁰

**Ongoing Obligation:** Track geopolitical events that could affect NRC or CFIUS perception of QIA 20% ownership:
- U.S.-Qatar bilateral relations (MNNA status, Al Udeid Air Base negotiations)
- Qatar-Iran relationship (gas field cooperation, sanctions evasion concerns)
- Qatar-Hamas relationship (political leadership hosting, cease-fire mediation role)
- Congressional hearings on Qatari investments in U.S. critical infrastructure

**Contingency Planning:** If geopolitical developments threaten NRC approval or post-closing license suspension:
- **Option 1:** QIA divests to below 10-15% (minority position below NRC scrutiny threshold)
- **Option 2:** QIA converts to non-voting preferred equity (eliminates Board representation and control concerns)
- **Option 3:** Replace QIA with alternative non-foreign government investor

---

### C. Outstanding Questions Requiring Further Investigation

The following questions **could not be fully answered** with publicly available information and require **data room access** or **APH internal document review**:

**1. APH Operating Agreement Provisions**

**Question:** Does APH Operating Agreement contain **supermajority voting requirements** or **consent rights** that grant CPPIB or QIA veto power over:
- Capital expenditures (including nuclear safety upgrades)
- Appointment or removal of CEO, Chief Nuclear Officer, Plant Manager
- NRC compliance decisions (e.g., response to violations, license amendment applications)
- Operational decisions (outage schedules, maintenance priorities, emergency procedures)

**Impact:** If foreign veto rights exist, NRC will **deny license transfer** under Section 103d. **CRITICAL** to verify and eliminate before filing.¹²¹

**Data Room Access Required:** APH LLC Operating Agreement (complete version, not summary term sheet)

---

**2. CPPIB and QIA Investor Rights Agreements**

**Question:** Do CPPIB or QIA investor agreements (subscription agreements, side letters, investor rights agreements) contain **information access rights** or **protective provisions** beyond standard minority investor protections?

**Examples of Concerning Provisions:**
- Quarterly site visits by CPPIB/QIA representatives (access to vital areas)
- Access to detailed operations reports (reactor performance, fuel management, maintenance schedules)
- Veto rights over "extraordinary transactions" or "major decisions" (defined to include nuclear matters)
- Right to appoint observers to management committees or Nuclear Oversight Committee

**Impact:** Information access rights must be **subordinated** to NRC Negation Action Plan restrictions. Any provisions granting access to security plans, SNM data, or reactor specifications will require **amendment**.¹²²

**Data Room Access Required:**
- CPPIB Subscription Agreement and Investor Rights Agreement
- QIA Subscription Agreement and Investor Rights Agreement
- Any side letters or supplemental agreements with foreign investors

---

**3. QIA Precedent in U.S. Nuclear Sector**

**Question:** Has QIA (Qatar Investment Authority) previously invested in any U.S. nuclear facilities, nuclear services companies, or NRC-licensed entities?

**Purpose:** If precedent exists, NRC's prior treatment of QIA (approval, denial, conditions imposed) would inform strategy for APH transaction.

**Research Required:**
- NRC ADAMS database search: "Qatar Investment Authority" OR "QIA" AND "foreign ownership"
- CFIUS public filings or enforcement actions involving QIA in critical infrastructure
- Industry intelligence (Nuclear Energy Institute, nuclear counsel firms)

**Status:** No public precedent identified in initial research; targeted ADAMS search required¹²³

---

**4. NRC Staff Informal Guidance on Qatari Government Investors**

**Question:** Has NRC staff issued **informal guidance** or **precedential decisions** regarding Middle East sovereign wealth fund investments in nuclear facilities, specifically non-NATO foreign governments?

**Purpose:** Informal guidance (if available) would clarify whether NRC treats Qatar (MNNA) more favorably than adversary nations (China, Russia) or applies uniform heightened scrutiny to all non-NATO foreign governments.

**Research Required:**
- Pre-application meeting with NRC DORL to discuss QIA specifically
- Outreach to NRC counsel firms with foreign ownership practice (Morgan Lewis, Pillsbury, Hogan Lovells)
- Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for NRC staff memoranda on Middle East SWF investments

**Status:** No informal guidance publicly available; pre-application meeting recommended¹²⁴

### ARTICLE I: NUCLEAR OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

**Section 1.1 Establishment of Nuclear Oversight Committee**

> "American Power Holdings LLC hereby establishes a **Nuclear Oversight Committee** (the "NOC") as a committee of the Board of Directors with **exclusive and final authority** over all Nuclear Matters (as defined below). The NOC shall consist solely of **United States citizens** who are Directors designated by Blackstone Inc. (the "U.S. Sponsor"). Foreign Limited Partners (CPPIB and QIA) shall have **no representation** on the NOC."

**COMMENTARY:** This provision creates board-level insulation of nuclear operations from foreign investor influence. NRC requires NOC to consist exclusively of U.S. citizens.¹²⁶

---

**Section 1.2 NOC Composition and Qualification**

> "The NOC shall consist of **not fewer than three (3) Directors**, each of whom must:
>
> (a) Be a **United States citizen** by birth or naturalization;
>
> (b) Hold **no foreign citizenship** (dual citizens ineligible);
>
> (c) Have **no material financial interest** in any foreign corporation or foreign government entity (other than publicly traded securities <5% beneficial ownership);
>
> (d) Not be an employee, officer, director, or agent of any Foreign Limited Partner (CPPIB, QIA) or their Affiliates; and
>
> (e) Be designated by the U.S. Sponsor (Blackstone Inc.) in its sole discretion.
>
> Foreign directors designated by CPPIB or QIA shall **not** be eligible for NOC membership under any circumstances."

**COMMENTARY:** Citizenship requirements prevent foreign nationals from serving on NOC. Financial interest restrictions prevent conflicts. U.S. Sponsor sole discretion ensures no foreign veto over NOC composition.¹²⁷

---

**Section 1.3 Nuclear Matters Delegated to NOC**

> "The NOC shall have **exclusive and final authority** to approve, reject, or direct Company management with respect to the following 'Nuclear Matters':
>
> (a) **Nuclear Safety:** All decisions related to reactor safety, Technical Specifications compliance, reactor core design, fuel management, reactor coolant system integrity, emergency core cooling systems, and safe shutdown systems;
>
> (b) **Physical Security:** Physical security plans (Design Basis Threat response, guard force deployment, vital area access controls, vehicle barriers, intrusion detection systems), security systems modifications, security event response, and coordination with NRC and law enforcement on security matters;
>
> (c) **Cybersecurity:** Critical digital asset protection, cybersecurity architecture for reactor control systems, cyber incident response, and compliance with 10 CFR 73.54 cybersecurity requirements;
>
> (d) **Special Nuclear Material:** SNM accountability, physical protection of SNM, SNM inventory management, safeguards compliance (10 CFR Part 74), and material control and accounting procedures;
>
> (e) **NRC Licensing and Compliance:** Responses to NRC violations, enforcement actions, inspection findings; license amendment applications; license renewal applications; reportable events under 10 CFR 50.72/50.73; NRC correspondence and filings; and testimony or submissions to NRC or Atomic Safety and Licensing Board;
>
> (f) **Emergency Preparedness:** Emergency plans (10 CFR 50.47), emergency response organization, emergency operating procedures, drills and exercises, coordination with FEMA and state/local authorities, and protective action recommendations;
>
> (g) **Appointment of Key Personnel:** Nomination, appointment, compensation, performance evaluation, and removal of:
>    - Chief Executive Officer
>    - Chief Nuclear Officer
>    - Plant Manager
>    - Operations Manager
>    - Maintenance Manager
>    - Security Manager
>    - Any NRC-licensed Senior Reactor Operator (SRO)
>    - Any individual responsible for SNM safeguards or physical security;
>
> (h) **Capital Expenditures for Nuclear Safety/Security:** Any capital expenditure or operating expenditure **exceeding $500,000** that relates to:
>    - Reactor safety systems modifications
>    - Physical security system upgrades
>    - Cybersecurity enhancements
>    - SNM physical protection measures
>    - Emergency preparedness equipment; and
>
> (i) **Spent Fuel Management:** Spent fuel pool operations, dry cask storage (ISFSI operations), spent fuel shipments, and physical security of spent fuel."

**COMMENTARY:** Comprehensive delegation of nuclear operations to NOC ensures foreign investors cannot influence safety, security, or NRC compliance. $500K threshold captures material nuclear-related expenditures.¹²⁸

---

**Section 1.4 NOC Voting and Quorum**

> "Decisions of the NOC shall require approval by a **simple majority** of NOC members (e.g., 2 of 3 members if 3-member NOC). A quorum shall consist of **not fewer than two (2) NOC members** present in person or by videoconference. Foreign directors shall have **no right** to attend NOC meetings, receive NOC materials, or participate in NOC deliberations under any circumstances."

**COMMENTARY:** Simple majority prevents deadlock. Foreign director exclusion ensures no foreign access to sensitive nuclear deliberations.¹²⁹

---

**Section 1.5 Subordination of Board Authority Over Nuclear Matters**

> "Notwithstanding any other provision of this Operating Agreement, the full Board of Directors shall have **no authority** to override, reverse, veto, or otherwise interfere with any decision of the Nuclear Oversight Committee on Nuclear Matters. The NOC's determinations on Nuclear Matters shall be **final and binding** on the Company, the Board, and all Members (including Foreign Limited Partners)."

**COMMENTARY:** This subordination clause is **critical** to NRC approval. Board (including foreign directors) cannot override NOC decisions on nuclear operations.¹³⁰

---

### ARTICLE II: FOREIGN INVESTOR VETO RIGHTS PROHIBITION

**Section 2.1 No Foreign Veto Rights Over Nuclear Matters**

> "Notwithstanding any other provision of this Operating Agreement (including any supermajority voting requirements, consent rights, or protective provisions), **Foreign Limited Partners (CPPIB and QIA)** and their designated directors shall have **no veto rights, consent rights, approval rights, or any other control mechanism** (whether direct or indirect) over:
>
> (a) Any Nuclear Matter (as defined in Article I, Section 1.3);
>
> (b) Any decision of the Nuclear Oversight Committee;
>
> (c) Appointment, removal, compensation, or performance evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Nuclear Officer, Plant Manager, or any NRC-licensed personnel;
>
> (d) Responses to NRC violations, enforcement actions, or inspection findings;
>
> (e) Capital expenditures or operating expenditures related to nuclear safety, physical security, cybersecurity, SNM protection, or emergency preparedness (regardless of amount); or
>
> (f) Any decision that could reasonably affect:
>    - Compliance with NRC regulations (10 CFR Parts 20, 50, 70, 73);
>    - Reactor safety or public health and safety;
>    - Common defense and security; or
>    - Protection of Special Nuclear Material."

**COMMENTARY:** Broad prohibition on foreign veto rights covers direct consents and indirect mechanisms (supermajority thresholds). NRC will deny license transfer if any foreign veto rights remain over nuclear operations.¹³¹

---

**Section 2.2 Board Voting Structure**

> "Decisions of the full Board of Directors (including foreign directors) shall be approved by **simple majority vote** (4 of 7 directors). The Company shall **not** implement any supermajority voting requirement (e.g., 5/7, 6/7, unanimous) for any decision related to Nuclear Matters.
>
> For any Board decision that the Chief Nuclear Officer determines **may reasonably affect** Nuclear Matters, the Chief Nuclear Officer shall **refer the matter** to the Nuclear Oversight Committee for exclusive determination. The NOC's classification of a matter as a 'Nuclear Matter' shall be final and binding."

**COMMENTARY:** Simple majority prevents foreign directors (3 of 7) from blocking decisions. CNO referral mechanism provides backstop to ensure nuclear-related matters cannot circumvent NOC authority.¹³²

---

**Section 2.3 Reserved Matters - General Business Only**

> "Foreign Limited Partners may exercise consent rights or veto rights **only** with respect to the following non-nuclear general business matters:
>
> (a) Amendments to this Operating Agreement that affect their economic rights (distributions, liquidation preferences, redemption rights);
>
> (b) Issuance of new equity interests that dilute their ownership percentage;
>
> (c) Mergers, consolidations, or sales of substantially all Company assets (**excluding** nuclear licenses, which require NOC approval); and
>
> (d) Bankruptcy filings or voluntary dissolution.
>
> Foreign Limited Partners shall have **no** consent rights or veto rights over:
> - Non-nuclear capital expenditures >$50 million (Board simple majority suffices)
> - Incurrence of non-nuclear indebtedness (Board simple majority suffices)
> - General business strategy or competitive positioning
> - Dividend or distribution policy (subject to cash flow availability)"

**COMMENTARY:** Carve-out for legitimate minority investor protections (economic rights, dilution) while excluding operational control. NRC permits foreign investors to protect economic interests if no nuclear operational control.¹³³

---

### ARTICLE III: INFORMATION ACCESS CONTROLS

**Section 3.1 Two-Tier Board Information System**

> "The Company shall maintain a **Two-Tier Information System** for Board materials, segregating sensitive nuclear information from general business information:
>
> **TIER 1 (All Directors, Including Foreign Directors):**
> - Consolidated financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow)
> - Quarterly and annual financial performance summaries
> - Business development and market conditions (non-nuclear)
> - Human resources matters (non-nuclear workforce)
> - General corporate governance matters
> - Tax and legal matters (non-nuclear)
>
> **TIER 2 (U.S. Directors Only / NOC Members Only):**
> - Reactor technical specifications and core design
> - Physical security plans (Design Basis Threat, guard force deployment, intrusion detection systems)
> - Cybersecurity architecture (critical digital assets, network topology, penetration testing results)
> - Special Nuclear Material inventory, accountability, and safeguards procedures
> - NRC inspection reports, violations, enforcement actions, and responses
> - Emergency preparedness plans and drill results
> - Spent fuel management plans and ISFSI operations
> - Proprietary nuclear technology and vendor intellectual property
> - Access authorization (10 CFR 73.56) personnel lists and background investigations
>
> Foreign directors designated by CPPIB or QIA shall receive **only Tier 1 information**. All Tier 2 materials distributed to foreign directors shall be **redacted** to remove sensitive nuclear content."

**COMMENTARY:** Two-tier system allows foreign directors to fulfill fiduciary duties (financial oversight) while restricting access to sensitive nuclear information. NRC requires information restrictions as core NAP element.¹³⁴

---

**Section 3.2 Nuclear Financial Information - Summary Format**

> "With respect to financial information related to the Nuclear Business (Great Lakes Nuclear Station operations), foreign directors shall receive **summary-level financial information only**:
>
> **Foreign Directors Receive (Summary Only):**
> - Total nuclear operations revenue (aggregate MWh sold, average $/MWh realized)
> - Total nuclear operations expenses (aggregate OPEX, not itemized by nuclear system)
> - Nuclear operations EBITDA
> - Capital expenditure budget (total amount, not itemized by nuclear safety/security project)
> - Decommissioning fund balance (aggregate, not detailed investment holdings)
>
> **Foreign Directors DO NOT Receive (Tier 2 - U.S. Only):**
> - Itemized capital project descriptions (e.g., '$15M reactor vessel head replacement,' '$8M spent fuel pool rerack,' '$5M intrusion detection system upgrade')
> - Physical security and cybersecurity expenditure details
> - Detailed outage cost breakdowns (which could reveal equipment specifications or vulnerabilities)
> - Vendor contracts for nuclear safety systems, security systems, or SNM handling equipment
> - Insurance underwriting reports (which contain security vulnerability assessments)"

**COMMENTARY:** Summary financial data satisfies foreign investor oversight role without disclosing nuclear system specifications. Itemized breakdowns could reveal security vulnerabilities or reactor design details.¹³⁵

---

**Section 3.3 Document Access Restrictions**

> "Foreign directors and Foreign Limited Partners (CPPIB, QIA) shall have **no access** to the following Company documents, records, or information under any circumstances:
>
> (a) NRC license applications, amendments, and correspondence;
> (b) NRC inspection reports, violations, enforcement actions, and responses;
> (c) Physical Security Plans (PSP) required by 10 CFR 73.55;
> (d) Safeguards Information (SGI) designated under 10 CFR 73.21;
> (e) Cybersecurity plans required by 10 CFR 73.54;
> (f) Emergency plans required by 10 CFR 50.47;
> (g) SNM material control and accounting procedures (10 CFR Part 74);
> (h) Reactor core design documentation and fuel management calculations;
> (i) Technical Specifications (license Appendix A) and Bases;
> (j) Design Basis Threat response procedures;
> (k) Vital area access lists and access authorization determinations (10 CFR 73.56);
> (l) Security event logs and incident reports; and
> (m) Proprietary vendor intellectual property related to reactor systems.
>
> Requests by foreign directors for access to Tier 2 information shall be **denied**. The Chief Nuclear Officer shall maintain an annual log of any foreign director requests for Tier 2 information and report to NRC."

**COMMENTARY:** Explicit prohibitions on specific categories of sensitive nuclear information. Logging foreign director information requests creates audit trail for NRC oversight.¹³⁶

### ARTICLE IV: MANAGEMENT CONTROL AUTHORITY

**Section 4.1 U.S. Management Final Authority**

> "The following **U.S. citizen executives** shall have **final and exclusive authority** over all Nuclear Matters within their respective areas of responsibility, **notwithstanding any direction from the Board of Directors** (including foreign directors), Foreign Limited Partners (CPPIB, QIA), or any other Person:
>
> (a) **Chief Executive Officer (CEO):** Final authority over all corporate matters, including nuclear operations;
>
> (b) **Chief Nuclear Officer (CNO):** Final authority over nuclear safety, reactor operations, NRC licensing and compliance, emergency preparedness, and SNM management;
>
> (c) **Plant Manager:** Final authority over plant operations, Technical Specifications compliance, reactor startup/shutdown, outage management, maintenance prioritization, and on-site security;
>
> (d) **Operations Manager:** Final authority over reactor control room operations, NRC-licensed SRO assignments, and operational decision-making;
>
> (e) **Security Manager:** Final authority over physical security, access authorization determinations, security force deployment, and security event response; and
>
> (f) **NRC-Licensed Senior Reactor Operators (SROs):** Final authority over reactor controls and safety systems during their assigned shifts, including emergency response actions.
>
> These executives shall **not be subject to removal** by foreign directors or Foreign Limited Partners. Only the Nuclear Oversight Committee (U.S. citizens only) may recommend removal to the Board."

**COMMENTARY:** Management control provision ensures U.S. citizens retain operational authority. NRC requires certification that foreign investors cannot direct or control nuclear operations through management.¹³⁷

---

**Section 4.2 Management Citizenship and Loyalty Requirements**

> "The Company certifies and covenants that:
>
> (a) The **Chief Executive Officer, Chief Nuclear Officer, Plant Manager, Operations Manager, Maintenance Manager, Engineering Manager, Security Manager, and all NRC-licensed Senior Reactor Operators** are and shall remain **United States citizens**;
>
> (b) These individuals hold **no foreign citizenship** (dual citizens ineligible for these positions);
>
> (c) These individuals have **no material financial interest** in Foreign Limited Partners (CPPIB, QIA) or their Affiliates (other than indirect beneficial ownership through Company equity);
>
> (d) These individuals are **not employees, officers, directors, or agents** of CPPIB, QIA, or any entity controlled by the Canadian or Qatari governments; and
>
> (e) These individuals owe their **primary loyalty to the United States** and shall prioritize U.S. national security, public health and safety, and common defense over any commercial interest of Foreign Limited Partners."

**COMMENTARY:** Citizenship and loyalty requirements prevent foreign government influence over key nuclear personnel. Prohibition on financial interests in foreign investors prevents conflicts of interest.¹³⁸

---

**Section 4.3 No Foreign Management Services or Consulting Agreements**

> "The Company shall **not** enter into any management services agreement, consulting agreement, technical assistance agreement, or similar arrangement with:
>
> (a) Foreign Limited Partners (CPPIB, QIA) or their Affiliates;
>
> (b) Any entity controlled by the Canadian government or Qatari government;
>
> (c) Any foreign corporation or foreign national providing services related to Nuclear Matters; or
>
> (d) Any Person that would result in foreign ownership, control, or dominance over nuclear operations.
>
> The Company may retain **foreign vendors** (e.g., Westinghouse, AREVA, Framatome) for nuclear equipment supply or technical support **only if**:
> - Contract scope limited to discrete deliverables (equipment, spare parts, technical specifications);
> - Vendor has **no authority** over Company operational decisions, NRC compliance, or safety determinations; and
> - Contract approved by Nuclear Oversight Committee."

**COMMENTARY:** Prevents circumvention of NAP through management services agreements that grant operational control to foreign entities. Carve-out for foreign nuclear vendors (industry reality) but no decision-making authority.¹³⁹

---

### ARTICLE V: SITE VISIT RESTRICTIONS

**Section 5.1 Foreign Director Site Visit Protocols**

> "Foreign directors designated by CPPIB or QIA may conduct site visits to Great Lakes Nuclear Station **subject to the following restrictions**:
>
> (a) **Advance Notice:** Not less than **30 days' written notice** to Chief Nuclear Officer and Security Manager;
>
> (b) **Security Clearance:** Foreign directors must complete NRC **unescorted access authorization** under 10 CFR 73.56 (FBI background check, trustworthiness determination) **OR** must be **escorted at all times** by U.S. citizen employee with unescorted access;
>
> (c) **Vital Area Exclusion:** Foreign directors shall have **no access** to:
>    - Reactor control room
>    - Reactor containment building
>    - Spent fuel pool and fuel handling areas
>    - Auxiliary building (emergency core cooling systems, safety injection systems)
>    - Security operations center
>    - Physical security barriers and surveillance systems
>    - Cybersecurity critical digital asset servers
>    - Any area containing Safeguards Information (SGI) or classified information;
>
> (d) **Permitted Areas:** Foreign directors may access:
>    - Administrative offices
>    - Training facility (excluding security training areas)
>    - Turbine building (non-nuclear side)
>    - Visitor center and public areas
>    - General employee parking and cafeteria;
>
> (e) **Escort Requirements:** Foreign directors must be escorted by **U.S. citizen Chief Nuclear Officer or Plant Manager** (or their designee) at all times;
>
> (f) **Prohibited Actions:** Foreign directors shall **not**:
>    - Photograph or video record any facility areas or equipment
>    - Access computer systems or networks
>    - Interview plant personnel regarding nuclear safety, security, or operations
>    - Review physical documents (procedures, logs, reports) without Chief Nuclear Officer approval;
>
> (g) **Visit Log:** Security Manager shall maintain log of all foreign director visits (date, duration, areas accessed, escort, purpose) and report to NRC annually."

**COMMENTARY:** Site visit restrictions prevent foreign directors from accessing "vital areas" (10 CFR 73.2 definition). Escorted access only to administrative areas allows foreign directors to fulfill oversight role without compromising security.¹⁴⁰

---

**Section 5.2 Foreign Limited Partner Representative Site Visits**

> "Representatives of Foreign Limited Partners (CPPIB, QIA) **other than** designated directors (e.g., portfolio managers, analysts, consultants) shall have **no access** to Great Lakes Nuclear Station under any circumstances unless:
>
> (a) Representative completes NRC unescorted access authorization (10 CFR 73.56) **AND**
>
> (b) Nuclear Oversight Committee approves visit in advance **AND**
>
> (c) Visit limited to administrative offices only (no vital area access).
>
> Foreign government officials, employees, or representatives of the State of Qatar, Qatar Investment Authority, or any Qatari government entity shall have **no access** to Great Lakes Nuclear Station under any circumstances."

**COMMENTARY:** Stricter restrictions on non-director foreign representatives. Categorical prohibition on Qatari government officials addresses QIA foreign government control concern.¹⁴¹

---

### ARTICLE VI: ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS TO NRC

**Section 6.1 Annual Compliance Certification**

> "The Company shall submit to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, **not later than 90 days following the end of each fiscal year**, a certification in substantially the following form:

>
> (i) Any change in control of Foreign Limited Partners (e.g., QIA acquired by different sovereign wealth fund, CPPIB governance structure changes)."

**COMMENTARY:** Material change reporting ensures NRC awareness of changes that could affect foreign ownership, control, or dominance. 30-day reporting deadline allows prompt NRC review.¹⁴³

---

### ARTICLE VII: NRC ENFORCEMENT AND LICENSE CONDITIONS

**Section 7.1 Incorporation as NRC License Conditions**

> "The provisions of this Negation Action Plan shall be incorporated as **conditions of NRC Operating Licenses DPR-55 (Unit 1) and DPR-68 (Unit 2)** and Special Nuclear Material License [SNM-XXXX]. Violation of any NAP provision shall constitute a **violation of NRC license conditions** subject to NRC enforcement action under 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart B."

**COMMENTARY:** License condition status makes NAP violations subject to NRC enforcement (civil penalties, orders, license suspension). Elevates NAP from contract to regulatory obligation.¹⁴⁴

---

**Section 7.2 NRC Inspection and Audit Rights**

**FOOTNOTES (Section VIII):**

¹²⁵ NRC Standard Review Plan § 5.2 (Negation Action Plans incorporated as license conditions). *See* 81 Fed. Reg. 33,078, 33,080 (May 26, 2016).

¹²⁶ NRC requires exclusive U.S. citizen control over Nuclear Oversight Committee to negate foreign influence. *See* NRC RIS-00-001.

¹²⁷ Citizenship requirements prevent foreign nationals from serving on NOC. *See* EDF/CENG precedent NAP (2009).

¹²⁸ Comprehensive delegation of Nuclear Matters to NOC ensures foreign investors cannot influence safety, security, or NRC compliance. $500K threshold captures material nuclear expenditures while allowing routine maintenance. *See* NRC Standard Review Plan § 5.2.3.

¹²⁹ Simple majority prevents NOC deadlock. Foreign director exclusion ensures no foreign access to sensitive nuclear deliberations.

¹³⁰ Subordination clause critical to NRC approval. Board (including foreign directors) cannot override NOC decisions on nuclear operations. *See* CLI-13-04 (Calvert Cliffs denial based on foreign control).

¹³¹ Broad prohibition on foreign veto rights covers direct consents and indirect mechanisms (supermajority thresholds). NRC will deny license transfer if any foreign veto rights remain over nuclear operations. *See* NRC Standard Review Plan § 5.2.3.

¹³² Simple majority prevents foreign directors (3 of 7) from blocking decisions. CNO referral mechanism provides backstop to ensure nuclear-related matters cannot circumvent NOC authority.

¹³³ Carve-out for legitimate minority investor protections (economic rights, dilution) while excluding operational control. NRC permits foreign investors to protect economic interests if no nuclear operational control. *See* Morgan Lewis, *Foreign Investment in Nuclear Reactors* (2009).

¹³⁴ Two-tier system allows foreign directors to fulfill fiduciary duties (financial oversight) while restricting access to sensitive nuclear information. NRC requires information restrictions as core NAP element. *See* NRC RIS-00-001.

¹³⁵ Summary financial data satisfies foreign investor oversight role without disclosing nuclear system specifications. Itemized breakdowns could reveal security vulnerabilities or reactor design details.

¹³⁶ Explicit prohibitions on specific categories of sensitive nuclear information. Logging foreign director information requests creates audit trail for NRC oversight.

¹³⁷ Management control provision ensures U.S. citizens retain operational authority. NRC requires certification that foreign investors cannot direct or control nuclear operations through management. *See* 10 CFR 50.38.

¹³⁸ Citizenship and loyalty requirements prevent foreign government influence over key nuclear personnel. Prohibition on financial interests in foreign investors prevents conflicts of interest.

¹³⁹ Prevents circumvention of NAP through management services agreements that grant operational control to foreign entities. Carve-out for foreign nuclear vendors (industry reality) but no decision-making authority.

¹⁴⁰ Site visit restrictions prevent foreign directors from accessing "vital areas" (10 CFR 73.2 definition). Escorted access only to administrative areas allows foreign directors to fulfill oversight role without compromising security.

¹⁴¹ Stricter restrictions on non-director foreign representatives. Categorical prohibition on Qatari government officials addresses QIA foreign government control concern.

¹⁴² Annual certification template provides NRC with ongoing verification of NAP compliance. Detailed checklist format facilitates NRC staff review. Certification under penalty of perjury ensures executive accountability.

¹⁴³ Material change reporting ensures NRC awareness of changes that could affect foreign ownership, control, or dominance. 30-day reporting deadline allows prompt NRC review.

¹⁴⁴ License condition status makes NAP violations subject to NRC enforcement (civil penalties, orders, license suspension). Elevates NAP from contract to regulatory obligation. *See* 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart B.

¹⁴⁵ NRC inspection rights ensure ongoing oversight. Authority to modify NAP allows NRC to respond to changed circumstances (e.g., geopolitical developments affecting QIA).

¹⁴⁶ Explicit consequences underscore seriousness of NAP violations. License suspension authority provides NRC ultimate enforcement tool if foreign control concerns emerge. *See* 42 U.S.C. § 2273 (criminal penalties for Atomic Energy Act violations).
