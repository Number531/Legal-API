## REMEDIATION OUTPUT: W2-PROV-002
## IP AUCTION PROHIBITION PROVISION

**Session:** 2026-01-29-1738200293
**Task ID:** W2-PROV-002
**Priority:** HIGH
**Target Section:** IV.D IP Retention Mechanisms
**Generated:** 2026-01-29

---

### TASK SUMMARY

**Objective:** Draft comprehensive contract provision prohibiting standalone IP auction and mandating going-concern sale structure to preserve intellectual property value.

**Context:** Section IV.D of the final memorandum documents that going-concern IP integration yields 2-5× higher value than standalone distressed auctions. The cautionary precedent of *In re Eastman Kodak Company* (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2012) demonstrates the severe value destruction (80% discount: $525M realized versus $2.2-2.6B pre-bankruptcy valuation) when patents are sold separately from manufacturing operations.

**Provision Requirements:**
- 150+ words professional format
- Prohibition on § 363(f) IP-only sales
- Going-concern sale mandate
- § 365(n) license preservation requirements
- Trade secret protection via employee retention
- IP claims escrow ($10M-$25M for 3 years)
- Disclosure representations
- Value differential acknowledgment (2-5×)

## DRAFT PROVISION: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SALE RESTRICTIONS

**For Inclusion In:** DIP Financing Term Sheet (Section 6 - Negative Covenants) or § 363 Sale Procedures Order (Section 4 - Sale Process Requirements)

---

### Article 6.15 - Intellectual Property Sale Structure Requirements

**(a) Going-Concern Sale Mandate.** The Debtor shall not, and shall not permit any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to, sell, transfer, assign, license (except in the ordinary course of business consistent with Historical Practice), or otherwise dispose of any Intellectual Property except as part of a Going-Concern Sale that includes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(i)** All patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights, mask works, and trade secrets (collectively, "**Intellectual Property**") used in or related to the operation of the Business;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(ii)** All manufacturing facilities, equipment, inventory, customer contracts, and supplier relationships necessary to operate the Business as currently conducted;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iii)** Employment offers to at least eighty-five percent (85%) of Key Technical Employees (as defined below) to ensure retention of trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, and process expertise embodied in employee knowledge; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iv)** Assignment and assumption of all Technology Licenses (as defined below) in accordance with 11 U.S.C. § 365(n), preserving both licensor and licensee rights under existing licensing arrangements.

**(b) Prohibition on Standalone IP Auctions.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any order of the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtor shall not:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(i)** Conduct any auction, sale process, or disposition of Intellectual Property separate from the sale of operating assets of the Business (a "**Standalone IP Auction**");

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(ii)** Seek bankruptcy court approval for any sale of Intellectual Property under 11 U.S.C. § 363(f) that does not include substantially all operating assets of the Business as a Going-Concern Sale;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iii)** Bifurcate or separate patent portfolios, trademark portfolios, or trade secret assets from manufacturing operations for purposes of achieving separate valuations or attracting non-operating buyers (such as patent assertion entities, brand licensing companies, or financial buyers without operational capacity); or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iv)** Market, solicit bids for, or negotiate regarding Intellectual Property with any party that does not demonstrate capability and intent to continue operating the Business as a going concern.

**Rationale:** This prohibition protects against the value destruction documented in *In re Eastman Kodak Company*, Case No. 12-10202 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2012), where standalone patent auctions realized only $525 million (an 80% discount from the $2.2-2.6 billion pre-bankruptcy valuation). Empirical analysis of Western Pennsylvania manufacturing bankruptcies demonstrates that integrated going-concern sales achieve 2-5× higher intellectual property valuations compared to distressed standalone auctions. See Footnote 42 [Section IV.D.B.1 case study analysis].

**(c) Technology License Preservation.** In connection with any sale of assets under 11 U.S.C. § 363, the Debtor shall:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(i)** Assume and assign all executory contracts constituting Technology Licenses (defined as contracts under which the Debtor licenses intellectual property to third parties or receives licenses from third parties) in accordance with 11 U.S.C. § 365, curing all defaults and providing adequate assurance of future performance by the purchaser;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(ii)** Preserve the rights of all non-debtor licensees under 11 U.S.C. § 365(n) to retain their intellectual property rights upon continued payment of royalties, recognizing that rejection of technology licenses does not terminate licensee property interests per *Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC*, 139 S. Ct. 1652, 1663-64 (2019);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iii)** Ensure that any purchaser of assets continues to honor all licensing obligations and provide ongoing technical support, software updates, and improvements contemplated under Technology Licenses to avoid the $8.2 million expected value impairment associated with loss of technical assistance (DCF analysis, Section IV.D §2); and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iv)** Provide written notice to all Technology Licensees at least thirty (30) days prior to any proposed sale, informing licensees of their rights under § 365(n) and the purchaser's identity and commitment to honor licensing obligations.

**Limitation:** This provision recognizes that 11 U.S.C. § 365(n) does not require the debtor-licensor to provide ongoing technical support, updates, or improvements post-rejection. Accordingly, the sale procedures shall require purchaser commitments to maintain technical support infrastructure.

**(d) Trade Secret and Know-How Protection.** To preserve the ninety percent (90%) of Intellectual Property value embodied in employee expertise, trade secrets, and manufacturing know-how:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(i)** The Debtor shall implement Key Employee Retention Plans (KERPs) providing retention bonuses of $[2,500,000] in the aggregate for Key Technical Employees, defined as: (A) all engineers with manufacturing process expertise; (B) all research and development personnel; (C) quality control managers; and (D) employees identified on Schedule A holding confidential know-how not documented in patent applications or written procedures;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(ii)** KERP bonuses shall vest upon the earlier of: (A) closing of a Going-Concern Sale with assumption of employment by purchaser, or (B) twelve (12) months from the Petition Date, with fifty percent (50%) payable at six (6) months to incentivize retention during the sale process;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iii)** Any purchaser in a § 363 sale shall offer employment to Key Technical Employees on terms substantially similar to current compensation and shall execute confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements protecting trade secrets transferred with the Business; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iv)** The Debtor shall file protective orders under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018 to seal all sale documents, schedules, and exhibits disclosing trade secrets, manufacturing processes, customer lists, supplier pricing, or confidential technical information, limiting access to qualified potential purchasers subject to confidentiality agreements.

**Cross-Reference:** See Section IV.E (Environmental Liability Offset Analysis) regarding coordination of going-concern sale structure with environmental liability segregation to maximize offset opportunities and purchaser willingness to pay going-concern premium.

**(e) Intellectual Property Representations and Warranties.** In connection with any Going-Concern Sale, the Debtor shall provide, and any Asset Purchase Agreement shall include, the following representations regarding Intellectual Property:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(i)** **Ownership and Title:** Schedule [X] contains a complete and accurate list of all material Intellectual Property owned by the Debtor, including: (A) all issued patents and pending patent applications; (B) all registered trademarks and trademark applications; (C) all registered copyrights; and (D) all material trade secrets and confidential technical information, to the extent reasonably capable of identification;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(ii)** **Non-Infringement:** To Debtor's Knowledge (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement), the operation of the Business as currently conducted does not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any intellectual property rights of third parties, and the Debtor has not received any written notice of infringement claims within the three (3) year period preceding the Petition Date;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iii)** **No Encumbrances:** Except for Permitted Liens (defined as: (A) DIP Financing liens; (B) pre-petition secured creditor liens to be satisfied at closing; and (C) non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course), the Intellectual Property is free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances, licenses, and restrictions on transfer;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iv)** **Validity:** To Debtor's Knowledge, all issued patents included in the Intellectual Property are valid and enforceable, no inter partes review or post-grant review proceedings are pending or threatened before the USPTO Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and no third-party prior art references have been identified that would reasonably be expected to invalidate material patent claims; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(v)** **Employee Assignments:** All employees, consultants, and contractors who have contributed to the development of Intellectual Property have executed written assignment agreements transferring all rights, title, and interest in inventions, works of authorship, and discoveries to the Debtor, and all such assignment agreements are valid, binding, and enforceable.

**(f) Intellectual Property Claims Escrow.** To secure post-closing intellectual property indemnification obligations and validity risks:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(i)** **Escrow Establishment:** The purchaser in any Going-Concern Sale shall withhold from the purchase price an amount equal to ten percent (10%) to twenty percent (20%) of the Intellectual Property Valuation (the "**IP Escrow Amount**"), with the specific percentage determined based on: (A) the proportion of patent-intensive technology versus commodity manufacturing processes; (B) the extent of pre-existing technology licenses that limit enforcement options; and (C) whether any material patents have been subject to validity challenges or inter partes review proceedings. For a manufacturing company with Intellectual Property valued at $[100,000,000], the IP Escrow Amount shall be $[15,000,000];

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(ii)** **Escrow Purpose:** The IP Escrow Amount shall serve as security for: (A) patent invalidity claims arising within the applicable statute of limitations (six years under 35 U.S.C. § 286); (B) third-party infringement claims alleging that the Business infringes third-party intellectual property rights; (C) breaches of intellectual property representations and warranties under subsection (e); and (D) loss of key technical employees resulting in inability to operate manufacturing processes or maintain product quality;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iii)** **Escrow Term:** The IP Escrow Amount shall be held for thirty-six (36) to forty-eight (48) months following the closing date, representing a practical compromise between the six-year patent statute of limitations and standard 12-18 month survival periods for general representations and warranties. This extended survival period reflects the heightened risk of latent intellectual property defects in bankruptcy sales conducted under compressed timeframes with limited due diligence; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iv)** **Phased Release:** The IP Escrow Amount shall be released as follows: (A) 30% at eighteen (18) months post-closing if no intellectual property claims exceeding $1,000,000 have been asserted; (B) 40% at thirty (30) months post-closing upon completion of any patent validity reviews or third-party licensing negotiations; and (C) 30% at forty-eight (48) months post-closing upon final release of all remaining escrow amounts, subject to deduction for pending claims.

**Escrow Sizing Methodology:** IP Escrow Amount calculation based on: (i) patent-intensive manufacturer IP valuation of 15-25% of enterprise value; (ii) 10-20% escrow on IP value component; (iii) precedent transactions demonstrating 30-50% validity discounts for untested patents sold in bankruptcy; and (iv) $8.2M technical support loss risk (Section IV.D Finding #2). For illustrative $500M manufacturer, IP value range $75M-$125M yields IP Escrow Amount range $10M-$25M.

**(g) Value Preservation Acknowledgment.** The parties acknowledge and agree that:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(i)** Empirical evidence from bankruptcy case studies, including *In re Eastman Kodak Company* (80% patent auction discount), *In re Westinghouse Electric Company* (going-concern sale at $4.6 billion preserving nuclear IP value), and *In re General Motors Corporation* (40-day § 363 transfer preserving operational patent value), demonstrates that going-concern intellectual property integration yields 200% to 500% higher valuations compared to standalone distressed patent auctions;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(ii)** Standalone IP Auctions face structural impediments including: (A) insufficient due diligence time (60-90 day bankruptcy timelines); (B) loss of complementary assets (R&D teams, manufacturing facilities, customer relationships); (C) validity uncertainty (30-50% discounts for invalidity risk on untested patents); (D) technology lifecycle risks (declining market relevance); and (E) existing license encumbrances that limit enforcement options for acquirers;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iii)** For a typical $500 million revenue manufacturing company, the expected intellectual property impairment from choosing liquidation over going-concern restructuring equals $19.5 million (70% probability of 50-80% distressed sale discount applied to $50 million going-concern IP value), representing 16% of total IP value at risk; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iv)** The restrictions in this Section 6.15 serve the interests of all constituencies by maximizing estate value, preserving going-concern employment, and avoiding the documented value destruction of the Kodak precedent.

**(h) Definitions.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(i)** "**Going-Concern Sale**" means a sale of assets under 11 U.S.C. § 363 in which the purchaser acquires substantially all operating assets necessary to continue the Business as currently conducted, assumes ongoing customer and supplier relationships, offers employment to substantially all employees, and commits to operate the Business rather than liquidate assets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(ii)** "**Key Technical Employees**" means employees identified on Schedule A who possess: (A) knowledge of manufacturing processes not documented in written procedures or patent applications; (B) customer-specific technical expertise and relationships; (C) proprietary research and development work product; or (D) trade secrets within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1839 embodied in employee expertise rather than documented form.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iii)** "**Technology Licenses**" means: (A) all agreements under which the Debtor licenses intellectual property to third parties (out-licenses), including patent licenses, trademark licenses, copyright licenses, software licenses, and trade secret licenses; and (B) all agreements under which the Debtor receives licenses from third parties (in-licenses) necessary to operate the Business, including manufacturing process licenses, software licenses, and component technology licenses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(iv)** "**Historical Practice**" means ordinary course licensing consistent with the Debtor's practices during the two (2) year period preceding the Petition Date, including: (A) non-exclusive licenses to customers for use of products incorporating Debtor technology; (B) cross-licenses entered in settlement of patent disputes; and (C) evaluation licenses with standard confidentiality terms and duration not exceeding twelve (12) months.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(v)** "**Intellectual Property Valuation**" means the fair market value of Intellectual Property determined using the relief-from-royalty methodology, adjusted for: (A) distressed sale conditions (16-80% discount depending on sale structure, per Section IV.D.B.1 analysis); (B) validity risks for untested patents (30-50% discount); (C) technology lifecycle stage (declining sectors receive additional 20-40% discount); and (D) existing license encumbrances that limit enforcement options.

### DRAFTING NOTES

**1. Precedent Reference:**

This provision is designed to prevent the value destruction documented in *In re Eastman Kodak Company*, Case No. 12-10202 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2012), where the bankruptcy court approved sale of 1,150 patents to Intellectual Ventures and RPX Corporation for $525 million—representing an 80% discount from the $2.2-2.6 billion pre-bankruptcy valuation range. Contributing factors to the Kodak discount included:

- **Time Pressure:** 60-90 day auction timelines insufficient for thorough patent due diligence
- **Loss of Complementary Assets:** Patents separated from imaging business operations, R&D personnel, and manufacturing know-how
- **License Encumbrances:** Broad pre-existing licenses limited enforcement options for acquirers
- **Validity Uncertainty:** Most patents untested in litigation; acquirers applied 30-50% risk discounts
- **Technology Obsolescence:** Digital camera patents displaced by smartphone technology

**2. Comparable Provisions:**

This provision incorporates elements from:

- **GM § 363 Sale (2009):** 40-day going-concern transfer required bundled IP with manufacturing operations; all patents and trademarks transferred to New GM at full operational value
- **Westinghouse § 363 Sale (2018):** $4.6 billion Brookfield acquisition required AP1000 nuclear reactor IP bundled with operations and NRC licenses (court recognized that nuclear IP is worthless without regulatory licenses and operational expertise)
- **Toys "R" Us Wind-Down (2018):** Controlling lenders holding trademark collateral chose NOT to auction Geoffrey Giraffe mascot (valued $500M+) but instead formed TRU Kids, Inc. for controlled brand revival, prioritizing long-term value over distressed sale proceeds

**3. Bankruptcy Code Cross-References:**

- **11 U.S.C. § 363(b)(1):** Authorizes debtor to sell property outside ordinary course with court approval
- **11 U.S.C. § 363(f):** Permits free and clear sales; this provision restricts § 363(f) application to going-concern sales only
- **11 U.S.C. § 365(n):** Protects technology licensees upon rejection; provision requires assumption and assignment rather than rejection
- **11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1):** Property of estate includes all IP interests; provision governs disposition of estate property

**4. Trade Secret Protection Rationale:**

Section 365(n) statutory definition of "intellectual property" in 11 U.S.C. § 101(35A) **excludes trade secrets and trademarks** (though *Mission Product Holdings* extended rejection protections to trademark licensees). The 90% employee expertise figure derives from specialist analysis that manufacturing know-how, customer-specific adaptations, process optimizations, and quality control expertise reside primarily in employee knowledge rather than documented form. KERPs ensure retention of this undocumented IP value through the sale process.

**5. Escrow Sizing Cross-Reference:**

The IP Escrow Amount of 10-20% of Intellectual Property Valuation represents market practice for patent-intensive manufacturers. For a $500M manufacturing company:

- **Enterprise Value:** $500M
- **IP Component:** 15-25% = $75M-$125M (going-concern valuation)
- **IP Escrow:** 10-20% of IP value = $10M-$25M
- **Escrow Term:** 36-48 months (compromise between 35 U.S.C. § 286 six-year patent statute of limitations and standard 12-18 month survival periods)

This escrow secures: (i) patent invalidity claims; (ii) third-party infringement claims; (iii) key employee departure risks; and (iv) technical support obligations under Technology Licenses.

**6. Integration with Environmental Strategy:**

Cross-reference to Section IV.E: Going-concern sale structure enables environmental liability offset mechanisms by:

- Preserving buyer willingness to assume limited environmental obligations in exchange for operating assets
- Maintaining facility value necessary for environmental indemnity escrow sizing
- Enabling EPA prospective purchaser agreements (42 U.S.C. § 9607(r)) conditioned on continued operations
- Supporting hybrid § 363 sale + plan structure where environmental claims addressed through separate settlement

Liquidation destroys both IP value (80% discount per Kodak) and environmental offset leverage (buyers demand 40-60% discount for environmental risk in asset liquidations).

---

### SECTION IV.D CROSS-REFERENCE

This provision implements the strategic recommendations from **Section IV.D.B.1 Finding #1** (Going-Concern IP Integration Yields 2-5× Higher Value) and **Section IV.D.C Recommendations** by:

1. **Prohibiting Standalone IP Auctions:** Prevents debtor from pursuing Kodak-style patent auction that yielded 80% discount ($525M realized vs. $2.2-2.6B valuation)

2. **Mandating Going-Concern Structure:** Requires IP transfer bundled with manufacturing operations, following GM and Westinghouse precedents that preserved full operational IP value

3. **Preserving § 365(n) Licenses:** Implements Supreme Court guidance from *Mission Product Holdings* (2019) that rejection constitutes breach but does not terminate licensee property rights

4. **Protecting Trade Secrets via KERPs:** Addresses the limitation that § 365(n) excludes trade secrets from statutory definition of "intellectual property" (11 U.S.C. § 101(35A)); employee retention preserves 90% of IP value embodied in workforce expertise

5. **Implementing IP Escrow:** Secures $10M-$25M (10-20% of IP value) for 36-48 months to address validity risks, infringement claims, and technical support obligations—balancing 35 U.S.C. § 286 six-year statute of limitations against practical survival period constraints

6. **Quantifying Value Differential:** Acknowledges empirical finding that going-concern integration achieves $19.5M higher value for typical $500M manufacturer versus standalone auction (70% probability of 50-80% discount on $50M IP value)

**Expected Impact:** This provision protects $15M-$40M in IP value preservation for a medium-sized manufacturing bankruptcy, representing the difference between integrated going-concern sale ($50M IP component) and distressed standalone auction ($10M-$35M realization after 30-80% discount).
