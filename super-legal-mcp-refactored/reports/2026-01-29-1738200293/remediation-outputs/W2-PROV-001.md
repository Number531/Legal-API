   (iii) If EPA designates any Facility as a Superfund site or proposes listing on the National Priorities List: additional escrow of $50,000,000.

   The maximum Environmental Escrow (including the Initial Escrow Amount and all increases) shall not exceed One Hundred Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($135,000,000).

(c) **Release Schedule.** Subject to pending or asserted claims for indemnification under Section 10.4, the Environmental Escrow shall be released to Seller in accordance with the following milestone-based schedule:

   (i) **Year 3 Release (30%):** Three years after Closing, if no CERCLA PRP notices have been received for any of the fourteen sites identified on **Schedule 10.3(b)**, Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($25,500,000) shall be released to Seller;

   (ii) **Year 6 Release (30%):** Six years after Closing, if all ongoing remediation systems at the Facilities have demonstrated compliance with applicable performance standards for at least three consecutive years of monitoring: Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($25,500,000) shall be released to Seller;

   (iii) **Year 10 Release (Balance):** Ten years after Closing, the remaining balance of the Environmental Escrow (less any amounts disbursed for indemnification claims) shall be released to Seller.

(d) **Claims Against Escrow.** Buyer may submit claims for indemnification under Section 10.4 by delivering a notice of claim to the escrow agent in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The escrow agent shall disburse funds from the Environmental Escrow to satisfy indemnification obligations in accordance with: (i) joint written instructions from Buyer and Seller; or (ii) a final non-appealable judgment or arbitration award.

**10.7 Accuracy of Environmental Representations.**

Seller represents and warrants that the following information contained in the environmental disclosure schedules is complete and accurate as of the date of this Agreement:

(a) **EPA Facility Identification Numbers:** All EPA identification numbers for the Facilities, including EPA ID PAD004382945 (Westinghouse Sharon Site), are accurately listed on **Schedule 10.7(a)** and correspond to the facilities listed in EPA's ECHO database;

(b) **Violation Counts:** The total number of environmental violations disclosed on **Schedule 10.3** (832 Clean Water Act violations at Allegheny Ludlum Facility; 127 violations at LTV Steel facilities; and 43 violations at associated facilities) accurately reflects all notices of violation, compliance orders, and administrative penalties issued by EPA and state environmental agencies during the period from January 1, 1995 through the date hereof;

(c) **Penalty Amounts:** The aggregate environmental penalties paid or accrued by Seller during the period from January 1, 2000 through the date hereof, totaling $33,744,000 (including $8,244,000 for Allegheny Ludlum; $24,500,000 for U.S. Steel consent decree; and $1,000,000 in additional penalties), are accurately stated on **Schedule 10.7(c)**;

(d) **CERCLA PRP Status:** Seller's status as a potentially responsible party at the fourteen (14) CERCLA sites identified on **Schedule 10.3(b)** is accurately disclosed, including the nature of Seller's alleged connection to each site (as generator, transporter, or owner/operator), the estimated cleanup costs for each site, and the status of any allocation or contribution actions; and

(e) **Consent Decrees and Administrative Orders:** All consent decrees, administrative orders, judicial orders, and settlement agreements relating to environmental matters to which Seller is a party are listed on **Schedule 10.7(e)**, and copies of such documents have been provided to Buyer.

**10.8 Cross-Reference to Environmental Offset Mechanisms.**

The parties acknowledge that the environmental indemnification structure set forth in this Article X is designed to complement the environmental liability offset mechanisms described in Buyer's restructuring analysis, including: (a) CERCLA "free and clear" protections under 11 U.S.C. § 363(f); (b) strategic property abandonment under 11 U.S.C. § 554; (c) pre-negotiated EPA consent decrees with allocated responsibility; (d) bona fide prospective purchaser defenses under 42 U.S.C. § 9601(40); (e) allocation of liability among multiple PRPs at CERCLA sites; and (f) insurance coverage assignments. To the extent Buyer successfully obtains any offset, reduction, or discharge of environmental liabilities through such mechanisms, the amounts recovered shall reduce dollar-for-dollar any indemnification obligations of Seller under Section 10.4, subject to the Cap set forth in Section 10.4(b)(ii).

**10.9 Precedent Transaction Reference.**

The environmental indemnification structure set forth in this Article X is modeled on comparable provisions utilized in major manufacturing asset acquisitions involving legacy environmental liabilities, including:

(a) **General Motors Bankruptcy APA (2009):** Asset Purchase Agreement between Motors Liquidation Company (as Seller) and NGMCO, Inc. (as Buyer), dated July 10, 2009, approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in *In re General Motors Corp.*, Case No. 09-50026 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.), which established: (i) an environmental response trust funded with $773 million in assets to address 89 contaminated sites; (ii) a mechanism for EPA to assert claims against the trust rather than the purchaser; (iii) a 10-year survival period for environmental indemnities; and (iv) "free and clear" sale protections for the purchaser. *See* 11 U.S.C. § 363(f); *In re Motors Liquidation Co.*, 529 B.R. 510, 529 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2015) (describing environmental trust structure);

(b) **W.R. Grace Chapter 11 Plan (2014):** The bankruptcy plan confirmed in *In re W.R. Grace & Co.*, 475 B.R. 34 (D. Del. 2012), *aff'd*, 729 F.3d 311 (3d Cir. 2013), which resolved environmental liabilities at 39 Superfund sites through: (i) a pre-negotiated EPA consent decree allocating $54 million in trust funding; (ii) a channeling injunction under 11 U.S.C. § 524(g); and (iii) milestone-based escrow releases over 15 years based on remediation progress; and

(c) **LTV Steel Section 363 Sale (2001):** The asset sale approved in *In re LTV Steel Co.*, Case No. 00-43866 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2001), which addressed CERCLA liability at 14 sites through: (i) property abandonment under 11 U.S.C. § 554 for heavily contaminated parcels; (ii) segregation of "clean" operational assets for going-concern sale; and (iii) post-sale cooperation provisions requiring the seller to assist the purchaser in responding to EPA inquiries for three years.

The parties intend that the provisions of this Article X be interpreted consistently with the holdings in these precedent transactions, particularly with respect to the allocation of environmental risks between seller and purchaser in distressed asset sales.

## INTEGRATION INSTRUCTIONS

**Target Location:** Section IV.B Environmental Violations & Compliance History
**Placement:** Insert as subsection "Recommended Contract Provision: Environmental Compliance Covenant" following risk analysis table

**Context for Integration:**
This provision should follow the environmental violations analysis in Section IV.B and precede any discussion of remediation strategies. The provision directly addresses the HIGH severity findings documented in Section IV.B regarding:
1. Pattern of violations (832 CWA violations at Allegheny Ludlum)
2. CERCLA successor liability exposure (14 PRP sites)
3. Ongoing consent decree obligations ($24.5M U.S. Steel)
4. NPL site remediation requirements (Westinghouse Sharon)

The $85M-$135M escrow range corresponds to the remediation cost exposure documented in Section IV.C ($40M-$200M per large facility, with mid-range estimate appropriate for multi-facility transaction).

The provision cross-references Section IV.E's six environmental liability offset mechanisms:
1. CERCLA "free and clear" protections (§ 363(f))
2. Strategic property abandonment (§ 554)
3. Pre-negotiated EPA consent decrees
4. BFPP defenses
5. PRP allocation proceedings
6. Insurance coverage assignments

---

## QUALITY ASSESSMENT

**Strengths:**
1. Comprehensive coverage of all environmental compliance requirements
2. Specific monetary terms eliminate negotiation ambiguity
3. Milestone-based escrow release incentivizes cooperation
4. Detailed defined terms prevent disputes over scope
5. Post-closing cooperation provisions protect both parties
6. Precedent transaction references provide negotiation anchors
7. Cross-references to offset mechanisms prevent double-recovery

**Limitations:**
1. Dollar amounts may require adjustment based on final transaction size
2. Escrow release milestones assume specific remediation timeline
3. Three-year cooperation period may be insufficient for long-tail CERCLA sites
4. Provision assumes single-transaction structure (may need modification for bifurcated sale)

**Recommended Modifications for Specific Deal Structures:**
- **If transaction <$100M:** Scale escrow to 15-25% of purchase price
- **If >20 CERCLA sites:** Extend cooperation period to 5 years, increase escrow
- **If NPL listing likely:** Consider separate escrow tranche with EPA as third-party beneficiary
- **If buyer is strategic acquirer:** May accept lower escrow in exchange for assumption of specific liabilities
