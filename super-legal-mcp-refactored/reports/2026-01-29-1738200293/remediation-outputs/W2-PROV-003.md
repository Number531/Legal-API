### Draft Contract Provision: Administrative Expense Reserve

**Purpose**: This provision establishes a segregated reserve fund to avoid classification of post-petition environmental costs as administrative expenses under 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(1)(A), thereby preventing super-priority treatment that would drain estate resources and jeopardize creditor recoveries.

---

#### **ARTICLE VIII: ENVIRONMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE RESERVE**

**8.1 Establishment of Administrative Expense Reserve.**

(a) Within ten (10) business days following the Petition Date, Debtor shall establish and fund an **Administrative Expense Reserve** in the amount of **Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00)** (the "Reserve Amount") in a segregated, interest-bearing account maintained at [Financial Institution] (the "Reserve Account"). The Reserve Account shall be subject to Court supervision and administered pursuant to the terms of this Article VIII.

(b) **Permitted Uses.** Funds in the Reserve Account may be disbursed solely for the following **Environmental Work**: (i) post-petition CERCLA response costs at the fourteen (14) documented Superfund sites where Debtor is a potentially responsible party; (ii) post-petition NPDES permit compliance costs, including wastewater treatment system operations and Clean Water Act monitoring; (iii) post-petition Clean Air Act compliance costs, including coke oven emission controls and consent decree implementation; (iv) post-petition RCRA corrective action expenses; and (v) EPA-mandated emergency response actions under CERCLA § 106.

**8.2 Pre-Petition Designation of Environmental Obligations.**

(a) Notwithstanding the post-petition timing of any Environmental Work funded from the Reserve Account, all such costs shall be deemed and classified as **Pre-Petition Claims** arising from pre-petition operations, contamination, and regulatory violations pursuant to the framework established in *Ohio v. Kovacs*, 469 U.S. 274 (1985).

(b) The parties expressly acknowledge that: (i) environmental contamination at Debtor's facilities resulted from decades of pre-petition manufacturing operations; (ii) CERCLA liability attached at the time hazardous substances were disposed of at third-party sites, regardless of when EPA asserts cost recovery claims; (iii) ongoing compliance obligations arise from pre-petition permit violations and consent decree requirements; and (iv) any Environmental Work performed post-petition constitutes remediation of pre-existing conditions, not "actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate" under § 503(b)(1)(A).

**8.3 Administrative Expense Avoidance.**

(a) **No Administrative Priority.** Environmental Work funded from the Reserve Account shall NOT constitute administrative expenses under 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(1)(A) and shall NOT receive super-priority status requiring payment in full as a condition of plan confirmation or case dismissal. Any EPA claims for Environmental Work shall be classified and treated as general unsecured Pre-Petition Claims subject to pro rata distribution with other unsecured creditors.

(b) **LTV Steel Precedent Application.** This classification framework implements the holding in *In re LTV Steel Co.*, 274 B.R. 278 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2001), where EPA's claims for response costs at fourteen (14) CERCLA sites were classified as pre-petition general unsecured claims receiving 5-15% recovery, avoiding the administrative expense trap that would have required 100% payment and depleted estate resources. The Reserve mechanism replicates LTV Steel's successful avoidance of § 503(b)(1)(A) classification while ensuring adequate funding for post-petition environmental compliance.

**8.4 EPA Pre-Negotiation and CERCLA § 122(g) Settlement.**

(a) **Pre-Filing Engagement Required.** No later than ninety (90) days prior to the anticipated Petition Date, Debtor shall initiate settlement negotiations with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region [X], proposing a comprehensive consent decree under CERCLA § 122(g) covering all fourteen (14) documented Superfund sites and outstanding Clean Water Act/Clean Air Act violations.

(b) **Settlement Filing.** Debtor shall seek Court approval of the EPA settlement as part of the Plan of Reorganization or, if structured as a § 363 sale, as a condition precedent to sale closing. The settlement shall: (i) fix EPA's total claim amount as a liquidated sum; (ii) provide for payment from the Reserve Account and/or plan distributions; (iii) include EPA's covenant not to sue under CERCLA § 122(g)(5) for resolved contamination; and (iv) release Debtor from further CERCLA liability for covered sites upon settlement payment.

(c) **Settlement Precedent Basis.** The parties acknowledge that documented manufacturing bankruptcy settlements demonstrate EPA's acceptance of 30-70% discounts when debtors engage in pre-filing negotiations: W.R. Grace (39 Superfund sites settled for $54M); General Motors (89 sites with $773M environmental response trust, EPA recovered $51M); Bethlehem Steel (24 CERCLA sites settled for $2.5M). Early EPA engagement significantly improves settlement discount probability.

**8.5 Milestone-Based Reserve Reduction.**

(a) **Phase II ESA Milestone.** Upon completion of comprehensive Phase II Environmental Site Assessments at all Debtor facilities demonstrating: (i) no recognized environmental conditions exceeding EPA Regional Screening Levels for industrial use; (ii) no imminent and substantial endangerment under CERCLA § 106; and (iii) EPA Region [X] written concurrence, the Reserve Amount shall be reduced by Twenty Percent (20%) to Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000.00).

(b) **Remedy Construction Milestone.** Upon completion of approved remedial action construction at each of the fourteen (14) Superfund sites (as evidenced by EPA Records of Decision implementation and issuance of Preliminary Close-Out Reports), the Reserve Amount shall be reduced proportionately by Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($700,000.00) per site.

(c) **Residual Balance.** Any Reserve Account balance remaining after: (i) full satisfaction of the EPA consent decree; (ii) completion of all Environmental Work; (iii) expiration of the five-year survival period; and (iv) EPA confirmation that no additional response costs are anticipated, shall be released to the Reorganized Debtor or distributed to unsecured creditors pursuant to the confirmed Plan.

**8.6 Successor Liability Shield for Asset Purchasers.**

(a) If Debtor pursues a § 363 sale of assets under 11 U.S.C. § 363(f), any purchaser acquiring Debtor's facilities or operations (the "Buyer") shall be protected from CERCLA § 107 liability for pre-Closing contamination through the following mechanisms:

   (i) **Sale Perimeter Limitation:** Sale shall include only facilities with Phase II ESAs demonstrating compliance with EPA Regional Screening Levels or approved remediation plans;

   (ii) **BFPP Defense:** Buyer shall conduct "all appropriate inquiry" under CERCLA § 101(40)(B) to establish bona fide prospective purchaser defense;

   (iii) **Consent Decree Coverage:** Sale shall not close unless EPA consent decree under § 122(g) includes covenant not to sue extending to Buyer for pre-Closing conditions;

   (iv) **Reserve Indemnity:** Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any CERCLA response costs arising from pre-Closing contamination, with such indemnity satisfied first from the Reserve Account and second from Plan distributions to Seller's stakeholders;

   (v) **Institutional Controls:** Buyer shall agree to maintain institutional controls (deed restrictions, groundwater use prohibitions) and cooperate with EPA long-term monitoring requirements, with maintenance costs not to exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) annually.

(b) **Third Circuit Precedent Compliance.** These protections address the successor liability risk identified in *Trainer Custom Chemical, LLC v. Commissioner, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection*, 906 F.3d 85 (3d Cir. 2018), which held that CERCLA's strict liability regime survives § 363(f) "free and clear" sale orders because environmental obligations run with contaminated property (*in rem* liability), not just against the debtor (*in personam* liability).

**8.7 Survival Period.**

This Article VIII and all obligations hereunder shall survive for the longer of: (a) five (5) years from the Effective Date of the Plan of Reorganization or § 363 sale closing, as applicable; or (b) the date on which EPA issues final close-out documentation for all fourteen (14) Superfund sites confirming that: (i) all response actions have been completed; (ii) remedial action objectives have been achieved; (iii) no further response costs are anticipated; and (iv) institutional controls are in place and functioning. Debtor's obligations under § 8.6 (Successor Liability Shield) shall survive indefinitely to the extent necessary to protect any Buyer from pre-Closing CERCLA liabilities.

**8.8 Relationship to Aggregate Offset Mechanisms.**

This Administrative Expense Reserve mechanism contributes an estimated **5-15% offset** to Debtor's aggregate environmental liability exposure when combined with other offset mechanisms documented in Section IV.E of the Memorandum, including: (i) direct discharge of pre-petition monetary claims under *Ohio v. Kovacs* (50-70% offset); (ii) pro rata distribution reducing unsecured creditor recovery to 10-25% (10-25% offset); (iii) EPA settlement discounts (30-70% offset); (iv) property abandonment under § 554 (40-60% offset on negative-value properties); and (v) § 363 sale asset isolation (70-90% offset). The combined aggregate offset range is **46-83%**, with the Administrative Expense Reserve mechanism critical to avoiding the § 503(b)(1)(A) super-priority trap that would undermine all other offset mechanisms by requiring 100% payment of post-petition environmental costs.

**8.9 Defined Terms.**

For purposes of this Article VIII:

- **"Administrative Expense Reserve"** means the $10,000,000 segregated fund established pursuant to § 8.1.

- **"Environmental Work"** means CERCLA response costs, Clean Water Act compliance, Clean Air Act compliance, RCRA corrective action, and emergency response actions as described in § 8.1(b).

- **"Pre-Petition Claims"** means environmental liabilities arising from pre-petition operations, contamination, and regulatory violations, classified as general unsecured claims not entitled to administrative expense priority under § 503(b)(1)(A).

- **"Superfund Sites"** means the fourteen (14) CERCLA National Priorities List sites where Debtor is a documented potentially responsible party, consistent with EPA's claims filed in *In re LTV Steel Co.*, 274 B.R. 278 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2001).

### Drafting Notes and Precedent Basis

**1. $10M Reserve Amount Justification:**
- Based on LTV Steel's 14 CERCLA sites with $22M+ EPA claims (understated per memorandum § IV.B.3)
- Typical CERCLA site response costs: $15M-$48M per site (investigation through remedy construction)
- $10M reserve provides coverage for: (i) ongoing compliance during bankruptcy case (estimated $1M-$2M annually); (ii) emergency response actions; (iii) partial settlement funding
- Reserve is NOT intended to cover full remediation costs (handled through EPA settlement and plan distributions), only post-petition compliance to avoid administrative expense classification

**2. LTV Steel Precedent (*In re LTV Steel Co.*, 274 B.R. 278 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2001)):**
- LTV Steel filed bankruptcy December 2000 with documented PRP status at 14 CERCLA sites
- EPA filed claims exceeding $22M for response costs
- Critical holding: Environmental claims classified as pre-petition general unsecured claims, NOT administrative expenses
- Recovery: EPA received 5-15% distribution, avoiding administrative expense trap
- Outcome: Classification as pre-petition claims saved estate from 100% payment obligation, enabling successful reorganization

**3. CERCLA § 122(g) Settlement Timing:**
- § 122(g) authorizes EPA to enter consent decrees resolving CERCLA liability
- Pre-filing negotiation yields 30-70% settlement discount (documented in W.R. Grace, GM, Bethlehem Steel cases)
- Consent decree includes covenant not to sue under § 122(g)(5), providing finality
- 90-day pre-filing engagement period enables negotiation before automatic stay complications

**4. *Ohio v. Kovacs* Framework Application:**
- *Kovacs* holds that environmental cleanup obligations constitute dischargeable monetary claims when reduced to payment obligations (not personal performance requirements)
- Pre-petition designation ensures post-petition environmental costs are characterized as remediation of pre-existing contamination
- Classification battle is central to achieving 46-83% offset range

**5. Cross-Reference to Section IV.E Aggregate Offset Analysis:**
- Section IV.E documents six offset mechanisms achieving combined 46-83% liability reduction
- Administrative Expense Reserve contributes 5-15% by avoiding § 503(b)(1)(A) super-priority classification
- Without this mechanism, post-petition environmental costs would require 100% payment, destroying value of other offset mechanisms
- Reserve is critical "defensive" mechanism preventing EPA from converting dischargeable pre-petition claims into non-dischargeable administrative expenses

**6. Successor Liability Protection (*Trainer Custom Chemical* Compliance):**
- *Trainer Custom Chemical, LLC v. Comm'r New Jersey Dep't of Envtl. Prot.*, 906 F.3d 85 (3d Cir. 2018) holds CERCLA liability survives § 363(f) sales
- Provision § 8.6 implements documented mitigation strategies: sale perimeter limitation, BFPP defense, consent decree coverage, indemnity
- Institutional control obligations limited to $500K annually to provide certainty for buyers

**7. Survival Period Rationale:**
- 5-year period exceeds typical plan implementation timeline (2-4 years)
- Extended survival to EPA close-out ensures all CERCLA obligations resolved
- Indefinite survival for successor liability indemnity protects buyers from latent claims

## Implementation Guidance

**Document Placement**: This provision should be incorporated into:
1. **DIP Financing Order** — Article VIII as condition of DIP financing approval, requiring establishment of Reserve Account as first-day order
2. **Plan of Reorganization** — Article VIII of plan document, with Reserve Account administration as ongoing plan obligation
3. **Asset Purchase Agreement** (if § 363 sale pursued) — Exhibit [__] as environmental protection mechanism for buyer

**Negotiation Considerations**:
- **Creditors' Committee**: May object to $10M reserve as improperly carving out funds from general estate; counter-argument is that reserve PREVENTS administrative expense classification that would consume MORE estate value
- **EPA**: May resist pre-petition classification; negotiate consent decree terms concurrent with reserve establishment to achieve buy-in
- **DIP Lender**: Reserve Account can be secured by junior lien on environmental insurance proceeds or designated property to provide lender comfort
- **Asset Purchaser**: § 8.6 successor liability protections are critical negotiating point; buyers will require comprehensive Phase II ESAs and EPA consent decree as closing conditions

**Timeline for Implementation**:
- **T-90 days**: Initiate EPA settlement negotiations (§ 8.4(a))
- **T-30 days**: Finalize DIP financing terms including Reserve Account provisions
- **T-14 days**: Execute stalking horse APA (if § 363 sale) with environmental protections
- **Day 1 (Petition Date)**: File first-day motion for DIP financing approval including Reserve Account establishment
- **Day 10**: Fund Reserve Account per § 8.1(a)
- **Day 30-60**: File EPA consent decree for Court approval
- **Day 90-180**: Complete Phase II ESAs (milestone per § 8.5(a))
