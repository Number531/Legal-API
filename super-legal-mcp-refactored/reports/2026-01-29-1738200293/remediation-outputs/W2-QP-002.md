# REMEDIATION OUTPUT: W2-QP-002

**Task ID**: W2-QP-002
**Priority**: HIGH
**Target**: Reorder Questions Presented by Risk Priority
**Input**: W2-QP-001.md (reformatted Under/Does/When questions)
**Date**: 2026-01-29

## REMEDIATION SUMMARY

This remediation reorders the 12 Questions Presented from W2-QP-001 to prioritize highest-risk questions first, placing environmental discharge and offset mechanisms (the core client questions) at the top.

**Ordering Rationale**: Questions are ordered by financial exposure magnitude and deal-blocking potential. Environmental liability discharge (Questions 1-3 in new order) represents the core client concern with $40M-$200M exposure and determines whether the bankruptcy strategy is viable. Administrative expense and successor liability issues follow as high-priority items affecting purchase price. IP retention strategies appear in the middle tier, with procedural considerations last.

**Priority Tiers Applied**:
- **CRITICAL** (Questions 1-3): Deal-blocking discharge limitations and offset quantification (>$100M exposure)
- **HIGH** (Questions 4-7): Purchase price impacts and successor liability ($50M-$100M exposure)
- **MEDIUM** (Questions 8-10): IP retention and strategic considerations ($10M-$50M exposure)
- **LOW** (Questions 11-12): Procedural and historical context matters (<$10M direct exposure)

**Type**: REPLACE SECTION

**EDITED_START [Line 470]**

## II. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

### 1. Environmental Liability Discharge

Under the Supreme Court's holding in *Ohio v. Kovacs*, 469 U.S. 274 (1985), and the Third Circuit's application in *In re Torwico Electronics, Inc.*, 8 F.3d 146 (3d Cir. 1993), does a Western Pennsylvania manufacturing company achieve discharge of CERCLA response cost obligations at third-party Superfund sites as general unsecured claims, when: (a) the company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; (b) the cleanup obligations have been reduced to documented monetary claims; (c) the company does not retain ownership of the contaminated property; and (d) the EPA has not obtained pre-petition injunctive orders requiring personal performance of remediation activities?

### 2. Environmental Offset Quantification

Under the combined discharge mechanisms established in *Ohio v. Kovacs*, 469 U.S. 274 (1985), 11 U.S.C. § 1122 (classification), 11 U.S.C. § 363(f) (free-and-clear sales), and 11 U.S.C. § 554 (abandonment), does a Western Pennsylvania manufacturing company with $40M-$200M CERCLA cleanup obligations achieve 46-83% offset through combined bankruptcy mechanisms, when the company employs: (a) direct discharge of pre-petition monetary claims under *Kovacs*; (b) pro rata distribution to unsecured creditors at 5-25% recovery rates; (c) negotiated EPA settlements at 30-70% discount (comparable to W.R. Grace: $54M for 39 sites; GM: $51M EPA recovery from $773M trust); (d) property abandonment under *Midlantic* achieving 100% offset (40-80% success rate); and (e) Section 363 sales isolating clean assets (70-90% effectiveness)?

### 3. Non-Dischargeable Injunctive Obligations

Under the Supreme Court's holding in *Ohio v. Kovacs*, 469 U.S. 274 (1985), and the Third Circuit's application in *In re Torwico Electronics, Inc.*, 8 F.3d 146 (3d Cir. 1993), does an environmental cleanup obligation constitute a non-dischargeable "injunctive obligation requiring personal performance" rather than a dischargeable "monetary claim," when: (a) the EPA has obtained a pre-petition order requiring active remediation (not merely payment of costs); (b) the debtor retains ownership of the contaminated property with continuing in rem liability; (c) the obligation has not been reduced to a monetary judgment or fixed-dollar settlement; (d) the cleanup requires ongoing compliance with NPDES, CAA, or RCRA permit requirements; and (e) the obligation arises post-petition as an administrative expense under 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)?

### 4. Administrative Expense Priority

Under 11 U.S.C. § 503(b)(1)(A) (administrative expense priority) and the Third Circuit's holding in *In re Conroy*, 24 F.3d 568 (3d Cir. 1994), do post-petition EPA/state environmental enforcement actions constitute administrative expenses entitled to 100% priority payment, when: (a) a Chapter 11 debtor manufacturing company continues operating post-petition; (b) the facilities have ongoing NPDES water discharge permit violations, CAA air emission exceedances, or RCRA hazardous waste management deficiencies; (c) the violations occur after the petition date; and (d) the police powers exception under 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(4) exempts the enforcement actions from the automatic stay?

### 5. CERCLA Successor Liability in Section 363 Sales

Under the Third Circuit's holding in *Trainer Custom Chemical, LLC v. Kinder Morgan, Inc.*, 906 F.3d 173 (3d Cir. 2018), does CERCLA's strict liability regime survive Section 363(f) sales despite "free and clear" order language, when: (a) the bankruptcy sale order purports to extinguish all claims and interests; (b) the buyer acquires contaminated manufacturing property; (c) CERCLA § 9607(a) imposes in rem liability on current owners regardless of acquisition method; and (d) the buyer does not qualify for the bona fide prospective purchaser defense under CERCLA § 9601(40)?

### 6. Hybrid Restructuring Strategy Viability

Under 11 U.S.C. § 363(f) (free-and-clear sales), 11 U.S.C. § 554 (abandonment), and CERCLA § 122(g) (consent decree authority), does a hybrid restructuring strategy combining Section 363 sale of clean operational assets, strategic property abandonment, and pre-negotiated EPA consent decree provide superior NPV versus standalone reorganization or liquidation approaches, when: (a) a manufacturing company holds both valuable IP assets ($500M+ in process patents) and substantial environmental liabilities ($40M-$200M remediation obligations); (b) the Section 363 sale of clean operational assets generates $350M proceeds with bundled IP transfer; (c) strategic property abandonment under § 554 eliminates negative-value contaminated sites; (d) the pre-negotiated EPA consent decree achieves $50-75M settlement (30-70% discount); and (e) the combined approach produces NPV premium of $23M-$50M versus alternatives?

### 7. Property Abandonment Limitations

Under the Supreme Court's holding in *Midlantic National Bank v. New Jersey DEP*, 474 U.S. 494 (1986), and the Third Circuit's narrow construction in *In re Smith-Douglass, Inc.*, 856 F.2d 12 (4th Cir. 1988), does a bankruptcy court authorize abandonment of contaminated manufacturing property under 11 U.S.C. § 554, when: (a) the property has negative net value (cleanup costs exceed property value by $5M-$50M); (b) the contamination consists of routine industrial pollution (petroleum, metals) without imminent and identifiable harm to public health; (c) the secured creditor consents to abandonment; (d) Phase II ESA documentation demonstrates no immediate threat to drinking water aquifers or trespasser exposure; and (e) the state environmental agency does not object?

### 8. IP Retention Value Differential

Under 11 U.S.C. § 363 (asset sales) and documented case precedent including *In re Eastman Kodak Company* (80% patent auction discount), *In re Nortel Networks Inc.* (450% premium anomaly), and *In re Westinghouse Electric Company* ($4.6B going-concern sale), does the expected value differential between standalone distressed patent/trademark auctions and integrated going-concern sales range from 2-5x favoring going-concern integration, when: (a) a manufacturing company holds $500M+ in process patents and trade secrets; (b) standalone auction conditions create 70-80% discounts (Kodak: $525M vs. $2.2B valuation); (c) going-concern sales preserve operational integration value; and (d) bankruptcy strategies prohibit standalone IP auctions through DIP financing covenants?

### 9. Section 365(n) Licensee Protection

Under 11 U.S.C. § 365(n) (intellectual property licensee protections) and the Supreme Court's holding in *Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC*, 139 S. Ct. 1652 (2019), do technology licensees retain rights to continue using licensed IP after rejection of executory licensing agreements, when: (a) a debtor manufacturing company holding valuable process patents and trade secrets rejects licensing agreements under 11 U.S.C. § 365; (b) the licensee elects to retain rights under § 365(n) rather than treat rejection as breach; (c) the licensee continues making royalty payments for the duration of the agreement; and (d) the licensed IP includes trademarks (now protected post-*Mission Product Holdings*)?

### 10. IP Valuation Methodologies in Distress

Under standard valuation principles applied in *In re Eastman Kodak Company* (patent auction), *In re Nortel Networks Inc.* (competitive technology auction), and *In re Westinghouse Electric Company* (going-concern sale), does the relief-from-royalty methodology provide the appropriate valuation for manufacturing patents, trademarks, and trade secrets for DIP financing collateral, Section 363 sale pricing, and plan feasibility projections, when: (a) distress conditions create documented 16-80% discounts depending on sale structure; (b) standalone patent auctions achieve 70-80% discounts from pre-distress valuations (Kodak: $525M vs. $2.2-2.6B); (c) competitive technology auctions may achieve premium valuations (Nortel: $4.5B representing 450% premium due to 4G technology race); (d) going-concern integration preserves 2-5x value versus standalone auction; and (e) alternative methodologies include DCF of licensing revenue and market comparables?

### 11. Pre-Bankruptcy Violation Patterns

Under CERCLA § 107(a) (successor liability), EPA settlement practice, and 11 U.S.C. § 1129(a)(11) (plan feasibility), do environmental violations systematically increase in the 1-5 years preceding bankruptcy filings due to deferred capital expenditures, creating a "doom loop" pattern that affects successor liability exposure, EPA settlement leverage, and plan feasibility, when: (a) a Western Pennsylvania manufacturing facility follows documented pre-bankruptcy compliance patterns (comparable to LTV Steel, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel, Bethlehem Steel, and Allegheny Ludlum); (b) the company defers environmental capital expenditures during financial distress; (c) the violation count increases 50-200% in pre-bankruptcy years; and (d) the EPA leverages violation history in settlement negotiations?

### 12. Delaware vs. Pennsylvania Venue Selection

Under 28 U.S.C. § 1408 (bankruptcy venue) and 28 U.S.C. § 1412 (venue transfer for convenience), does Delaware's specialized bankruptcy expertise provide measurable advantages over W.D. Pa./E.D. Pa. in environmental liability settlement outcomes, Section 363 sale efficiency, and plan confirmation rates, when: (a) a Western Pennsylvania manufacturing company evaluates Chapter 11 filing jurisdiction; (b) 40% of comparable cases filed in Delaware/New York versus 30% in Pennsylvania venues; (c) Delaware judges have specialized expertise in complex environmental settlements (Armstrong World Industries: 6-year asbestos case; Arch Coal: $640M reclamation liability); and (d) Section 363 sales average 6-8 months to closing in Delaware versus 9-12 months in other jurisdictions?
