## Remediation Details

### PROVISION 1: Environmental Escrow (Finding 1: Universal Environmental Violation Risk)

**Location**: Section IV.B, line ~1774-1833
**Provision Type**: Environmental Escrow with phased release
**Severity**: HIGH

#### [EDITED_START]

**Special Environmental Escrow (Article II, Section 2.3):**
```
(a) **Environmental Escrow Establishment**: At Closing, Purchaser shall withhold $[25,000,000] from the Purchase Price (the "Environmental Escrow Amount"), to be deposited with [Escrow Agent] pursuant to the Environmental Escrow Agreement.

(b) **Environmental Escrow Purpose**: The Environmental Escrow Amount shall serve as security for:

    (i) Seller's indemnification obligations under Section 8.5 (Environmental Indemnification);

    (ii) Environmental Liabilities identified in Phase II Environmental Site Assessments but not yet quantified as of the Closing Date;

    (iii) Potential CERCLA liability at sites identified on Schedule 3.15(e);

    (iv) Costs to achieve compliance with Environmental Laws for violations disclosed on Schedule 3.15(c); and

    (v) Long-term monitoring and institutional control costs for contamination disclosed in Phase II reports.

(c) **Environmental Escrow Release Schedule**:

    (i) **Initial Release (18 months post-Closing)**: Thirty percent (30%) of Environmental Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller if:

        (A) No Environmental Liabilities exceeding $1,000,000 in the aggregate have been asserted against Purchaser by any Governmental Authority;

        (B) Purchaser has received "No Further Action" letters or equivalent regulatory closure from EPA and Pennsylvania DEP for any remedial investigations required by consent decrees or administrative orders disclosed on Schedule 3.15(c);

        (C) All NPDES permits, Title V air permits, and RCRA permits for the Facilities have been transferred to Purchaser and Purchaser has achieved compliance with all permit conditions; and

        (D) No CERCLA potentially responsible party notices have been received by Purchaser for undisclosed sites.

    (ii) **Second Release (36 months post-Closing)**: An additional thirty-five percent (35%) of Environmental Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller if:

        (A) The conditions for Initial Release have been satisfied;

        (B) No Environmental Liabilities exceeding $2,000,000 in the aggregate have been asserted since Closing;

        (C) Purchaser has obtained confirmation from EPA that Purchaser qualifies as a bona fide prospective purchaser under 42 U.S.C. § 9601(40) with respect to any pre-Closing contamination at the Facilities; and

        (D) All environmental capital improvements required to achieve compliance with Best Available Technology standards under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act have been completed and are operational.

    (iii) **Final Release (60 months post-Closing)**: The remaining thirty-five percent (35%) of Environmental Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller if:

        (A) The conditions for Initial Release and Second Release have been satisfied;

        (B) The representations and warranties in Section 3.15 have not been breached; and

        (C) No unresolved Environmental Liabilities exist that would reasonably be expected to result in costs to Purchaser exceeding $500,000.

    (iv) **Claim Offset**: If Purchaser asserts an indemnification claim under Section 8.5 during the Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount equal to 150% of the claimed Environmental Liabilities until such claim is resolved through agreement of the parties or final adjudication. Any amounts paid to Purchaser from the Environmental Escrow shall reduce future release amounts on a pro rata basis.

(d) **Environmental Escrow Sizing**: The Environmental Escrow Amount of $[25,000,000] was calculated based on:

    (i) Phase II Environmental Site Assessment findings identifying [X] areas of environmental concern with estimated remediation costs of $[Y];

    (ii) Expected value of undisclosed contamination: [60-90%] probability × $[Z] median remediation cost = $[A];

    (iii) CERCLA liability allocation for [number] sites where Company is PRP: estimated [share]% × $[total response costs] = $[B];

    (iv) Capital costs to achieve CWA/CAA compliance: $[C] based on engineering estimates; and

    (v) Long-term monitoring costs (30 years, present value at 8% discount rate): $[D].
```

**Comparable Precedent:**
*In re General Motors* Environmental Trust (2009, $773M trust funded from estate for 89 contaminated sites, phased remediation over 15+ years with milestone-based releases). *In re Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel* Settlement (2000, $25M environmental settlement reduced from $270M EPA claim for plan confirmation, 91% offset achieved). *In re Bethlehem Steel* § 363 Sale to ISG (2003, 24 CERCLA sites resolved via $2.5M settlement with phased escrow release tied to regulatory closure milestones, representing 95%+ offset from estimated full exposure).

### PROVISION 2: CWA Indemnification (Finding 2: Clean Water Act Violations)

**Location**: Section IV.B, line ~1861-1874
**Provision Type**: Specific indemnification for Clean Water Act violations
**Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH

#### [EDITED_START]

**Specific Indemnification for CWA Violations:**
```
Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for:

(i) Any civil penalties assessed by EPA or Pennsylvania DEP for NPDES permit violations occurring prior to the Closing Date, including penalties for violations discovered after Closing but attributable to pre-Closing operations;

(ii) Costs to upgrade wastewater treatment systems to achieve compliance with NPDES permit limits if such noncompliance existed as of the Closing Date;

(iii) Costs of supplemental environmental projects (SEPs) required as part of consent decrees or settlement agreements for pre-Closing CWA violations; and

(iv) Third-party damages resulting from unpermitted discharges of pollutants occurring prior to Closing, including natural resource damages, fish kill remediation costs, and municipal water treatment cost increases.

**Limitation**: Indemnification for capital costs to upgrade wastewater treatment systems under subsection (ii) shall be capped at $[10,000,000], recognizing that the Purchaser assumes ongoing obligations to maintain CWA compliance post-Closing.
```

**Comparable Precedent:**
*United States v. Allegheny Ludlum Corp.* CWA Consent Decree (2003, 832 NPDES violations resulted in $8.244M penalty—second-largest CWA penalty in history—plus capital improvements for wastewater treatment systems, demonstrating EPA enforcement precedent for systematic violations at Pennsylvania steel facilities). *United States v. U.S. Steel Corp.* Clairton Consent Decree (2019, $24.5M penalty for Clean Air Act violations at coke plant, with 10-year injunctive relief and ongoing monitoring, establishing precedent for long-tail indemnification survival periods in Western Pennsylvania manufacturing transactions).

### PROVISION 3: Technology License Indemnification (Finding #2: Technical Support Loss)

**Location**: Section IV.D, line ~3759-3778
**Provision Type**: Indemnification for technology license rejection in bankruptcy
**Severity**: MEDIUM

#### [EDITED_START]

**Indemnification (Article VIII, Section 8.3 - Technology License Indemnification):**

```
(a) Seller Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses arising from or related to:

    (i) Any breach of representations in Section 3.13 (Technology Licenses and Source Code Escrow);

    (ii) The rejection under 11 U.S.C. § 365 by any licensor of a Critical Technology License, resulting in loss of technical support, maintenance, updates, or other services that Purchaser cannot reasonably replicate internally or procure from alternative vendors;

    (iii) The failure of any source code escrow or technology escrow arrangement to provide Purchaser with materials sufficient to independently use, maintain, support, and modify the licensed technology without ongoing licensor assistance;

    (iv) Costs incurred by Purchaser to: (A) transition from licensed technology to alternative technology solutions, (B) engage replacement vendors or consultants to provide technical support and maintenance, (C) hire former employees of licensors to provide institutional knowledge and support capabilities, or (D) re-engineer, reverse-engineer, or develop substitute technology to replace Critical Technology Licenses that are terminated or become unsupported.

(b) Indemnification under this Section 8.3 shall be subject to:

    (i) A deductible of **$250,000** (the "Technology Mini-Basket") for claims under subsection (i); **no deductible** for claims under subsections (ii), (iii), or (iv);

    (ii) A cap of **$12,000,000** (the "Technology Indemnity Cap"), representing 150% of the DCF present value of expected technical support transition costs identified in Section C (Risk Assessment);

    (iii) Survival of **forty-eight (48) months** from the Closing Date.
```

**Comparable Precedent:**
*In re Nortel Networks* Technology Asset Sale (2011, $4.5B patent portfolio auction included extensive source code escrow provisions and 24-month technical support transition agreements for operating company buyers, recognizing licensor bankruptcy creates immediate support disruption risk). *In re LyondellBasell* DIP Financing (2009, $8.5B secured by IP assets, required comprehensive source code escrow for all manufacturing control systems and 36-month indemnification for licensor rejection scenarios under § 365(n)). *Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC* (2019, Supreme Court confirmed rejection constitutes breach but does not rescind rights, establishing framework for indemnification calculation based on cost to replicate rejected services rather than full license value).

### PROVISION 4: Administrative Expense Escrow (Finding 2: Administrative Expense Elevation Risk)

**Location**: Section IV.C, line ~2868 onwards (this provision needs to be inserted)
**Provision Type**: Escrow for post-petition environmental administrative expenses
**Severity**: HIGH

#### [EDITED_START]

##### Finding 2: Administrative Expense Elevation Risk (Post-Petition EPA Orders)

**Severity:** HIGH | **Exposure:** $6.8M expected value (60% probability × $10M full elevation) | **Recommended Escrow:** $10M (immediate access for post-petition obligations if bankruptcy filing anticipated)

**Administrative Expense Reserve (Article II, Section 2.4):**

```
2.4 Administrative Expense Reserve.

(a) Reserve Amount: At Closing, Buyer shall withhold $10,000,000 from the Purchase Price (the "Administrative Expense Reserve"), to be deposited with [Escrow Agent] pursuant to the Administrative Expense Escrow Agreement.

(b) Purpose: The Administrative Expense Reserve shall serve as security for environmental obligations that may be elevated to administrative expense priority status under 11 U.S.C. § 503(b) if Seller files for bankruptcy protection within [24] months of Closing, including:

    (i) Post-petition environmental compliance costs at facilities operated during bankruptcy;
    (ii) EPA or state agency administrative orders requiring immediate response actions;
    (iii) Emergency removal actions under CERCLA § 106;
    (iv) Post-petition permit violations requiring 100% payment as administrative expenses; and
    (v) Natural resource damages claims arising from post-petition operations.

(c) Release Conditions: The Administrative Expense Reserve shall be released to Seller upon the earlier of:

    (i) Twenty-four (24) months from Closing Date if Seller has not filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code;

    (ii) Plan confirmation or case dismissal in any bankruptcy proceeding filed by Seller, provided that:
        (A) No EPA administrative orders have been entered requiring post-petition environmental expenditures;
        (B) All post-petition environmental obligations have been paid in full as administrative expenses;
        (C) Buyer has not been named as a potentially responsible party or successor operator at any facilities due to Seller's post-petition operations; and
        (D) No environmental claims exceed the Administrative Expense Reserve amount.

(d) Claims Against Reserve: Buyer may draw on the Administrative Expense Reserve for:

    (i) Reimbursement of costs incurred due to EPA administrative orders entered against Seller during bankruptcy that create successor liability for Buyer;
    (ii) Defense costs for CERCLA contribution actions arising from Seller's post-petition operations;
    (iii) Payment of administrative expense environmental claims that Seller fails to satisfy during bankruptcy; and
    (iv) Natural resource damages assessed for post-petition releases.

(e) Insufficient Reserve: If administrative expense environmental obligations exceed the Administrative Expense Reserve amount, Buyer shall have recourse to:

    (i) Environmental Escrow under Section 2.3 (up to available amounts);
    (ii) Direct claims against Seller's bankruptcy estate for reimbursement; and
    (iii) Claims against Seller personally for fraud or intentional misrepresentation regarding environmental compliance status.
```

**Comparable Precedent:**
*Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources v. Conroy* (3d Cir. 1994, 24 F.3d 568, holding post-petition environmental cleanup costs constitute administrative expenses requiring 100% priority payment, establishing Third Circuit precedent governing Western Pennsylvania bankruptcy transactions). *In re W.R. Grace* Administrative Expense Settlement (2014, EPA negotiated $15M immediate-access escrow for post-petition environmental monitoring during 13-year bankruptcy, with release conditions tied to emergence and regulatory compliance certification). *In re LTV Steel* Post-Petition Environmental Costs (2000-2002, $5M+ administrative expense claims elevated for post-petition permit violations and emergency response actions, representing 60% probability that ongoing operations trigger administrative priority under § 503(b)).
