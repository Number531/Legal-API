## COMPREHENSIVE OFFSET MECHANISM RISK ASSESSMENT TABLE

### EDITED_START

#### Risk Summary Table

| # | Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **1** | **Direct discharge of pre-petition monetary claims** (*Kovacs* 469 U.S. 274) — Environmental cleanup costs reduced to money judgments dischargeable as general unsecured claims | **HIGH** (opportunity) | **85%** (Supreme Court precedent; Third Circuit *Torwico* 8 F.3d 146 applies *Kovacs* expansively) | **-$20M to -$100M offset** (50-70% of total exposure; $40M-$200M baseline × 50-70% = $20M-$140M discharged at 5-25% unsecured recovery rate) | Structure all EPA claims as monetary obligations pre-petition through consent decree negotiation; avoid injunctive relief characterization; cite *Kovacs* in settlement terms |
| **2** | **§ 363 asset sales "free and clear"** (11 U.S.C. § 363(f)) — Clean assets sold isolating environmental liabilities in estate for discharge | **CRITICAL** (opportunity) | **90%** (Statutory mechanism; 40% of WPA manufacturing bankruptcies used § 363 strategy per filing pattern analysis) | **-$28M to -$180M offset** (70-90% of exposure for large facilities; buyer avoids successor liability with proper sale order language; excludes contaminated property from purchase) | Exclude contaminated property from § 363 sale assets; obtain specific bankruptcy court findings under § 363(f)(1)-(5); include "free and clear" language in sale order; cite *Bethlehem Steel* (95%+ offset) and *Old GM* ($773M trust) precedents |
| **3** | **Property abandonment under § 554** (*Midlantic* 474 U.S. 494 limitation) — Strategic abandonment shifts cleanup liability to secured creditor or eliminates estate obligation | **HIGH** | **60%** (Depends on *Midlantic* "imminent harm" analysis; 70-80% success for routine contamination; 10-20% for high-hazard sites like PCB/residential exposure) | **-$16M to -$120M offset** (40-60% of exposure; contaminated property with negative net value abandoned to secured lender, who assumes owner/operator CERCLA liability) | Prove no imminent endangerment to public health (no active exposure pathways, drinking water not threatened); demonstrate cleanup costs exceed property value substantially; time abandonment for maximum strategic benefit pre-§ 363 sale |
| **4** | **EPA consent decree negotiation** (CERCLA § 122(g) bankruptcy settlement authority) — Settlements achieve 30-70% reduction from original claims | **HIGH** (opportunity) | **75%** (Empirical precedent: W.R. Grace $54M settlement, Arch Coal 85% reduction, liquidation risk incentivizes EPA compromise) | **-$10M to -$70M offset** (20-40% discount; EPA accepts reduced recovery vs. zero in liquidation; median 50% settlement per precedent analysis) | Early engagement with EPA Region III; propose environmental trust with fixed funding cap; emphasize liquidation alternative yields zero recovery; structure as § 122(g) consent decree with covenant not to sue |
| **5** | **Reorganization value exclusion** (ASC 852 fresh-start accounting) — Legacy environmental liabilities excluded from enterprise value calculation, residual discharged | **MEDIUM** | **80%** (Accounting treatment under ASC 852 for Chapter 11 reorganization with >50% equity transfer) | **-$6M to -$70M offset** (15-35% of exposure; environmental liabilities not carried forward in reorganization value discharged; fresh-start accounting eliminates historical balance sheet obligations) | Structure plan to qualify for fresh-start accounting (>50% equity change, liabilities > reorganization value); obtain valuation opinion excluding environmental liabilities from going-concern value; discharge residual claims through plan |
| **6** | **Classification and pro rata distribution** (11 U.S.C. § 1122 claim classification) — Environmental claims classified as general unsecured receive 5-25% recovery | **HIGH** | **90%** (Statutory mechanism; typical manufacturing bankruptcy unsecured recovery rate per empirical analysis) | **-$15M to -$75M offset** (10-25% benefit; $100M environmental claim receives $5M-$25M pro rata distribution = $75M-$95M offset) | Classify all dischargeable environmental claims as general unsecured Class 3 or 4 (not administrative expenses); maximize secured creditor recovery to reduce unsecured pool; negotiate EPA settlement for less than projected pro rata to gain agency cooperation |
| **7** | **CERCLA non-dischargeability for retained property** (in rem obligations "run with the land") — Cleanup obligations survive discharge if debtor retains ownership post-bankruptcy | **CRITICAL** (risk) | **75%** (Status-based liability attaches to property owner regardless of discharge; Circuit Court precedent in *CMC Heartland Partners*) | **$40M-$200M** (Full exposure remains for contaminated property retained post-emergence; $3M-$8M small facilities, $10M-$35M medium, $40M-$200M large steel/coke plants) | § 363 sale of all contaminated property OR § 554 abandonment to secured creditor to eliminate in rem exposure; if property retained, establish environmental trust with fixed cap; obtain NPL deletion or EPA covenant not to sue |
| **8** | **Administrative expense priority for post-petition costs** (§ 503(b)(1)(A); *PA DER v. Conroy* 24 F.3d 568) — Post-petition environmental violations require 100% cash payment on plan effective date | **HIGH** (risk) | **90%** (Third Circuit controlling precedent; "actual, necessary costs of preserving estate" standard interpreted broadly) | **$1M-$20M** (Post-petition compliance costs, permit violations, EPA inspections during bankruptcy create administrative claims; long case (24-36 months) = P90 $15M-$20M) | Minimize post-petition operations duration; strict permit compliance during bankruptcy; immediate facility shutdown if compliance unaffordable; negotiate DIP financing with environmental compliance covenants; seek EPA agreement to classify post-petition costs as general unsecured (per *W.R. Grace* precedent) |
| **9** | **§ 363 sale successor liability risk** (*United States v. Trainer* 3d Cir.) — CERCLA status-based liability may attach to § 363 buyer as "owner or operator" despite sale order | **HIGH** (risk) | **60%** (Third Circuit *Trainer* precedent permits EPA to impose CERCLA liability on § 363 purchaser who acquires contaminated property; minority circuit view but controlling in Pennsylvania) | **$10M-$80M** (Expected value $6M-$48M; buyer discounts purchase price 10-30% for environmental risk if contaminated property included in sale; reduces estate value and unsecured recovery) | Exclude ALL contaminated property from § 363 purchased assets; obtain specific bankruptcy court findings that sale satisfies § 363(f) requirements; include EPA as noticed party in sale motion; structure sale as "going concern" of operations only, not real property; cite *Bethlehem Steel* structure (assets sold "free & clear," contaminated property excluded) |
| **10** | **Injunctive relief non-dischargeable** (*Kovacs*/*Torwico* monetary vs. injunctive distinction) — Ongoing permit compliance, cessation orders, monitoring requirements survive discharge | **MEDIUM** (risk) | **60%** (Depends on characterization; EPA enforcement orders requiring debtor's personal performance not dischargeable; monetary judgments dischargeable) | **$2M-$15M annual** (Perpetual obligation NPV = $25M-$188M at 8% discount rate; ongoing NPDES permits, Title V air permits, RCRA closure, groundwater monitoring) | Structure EPA obligations as monetary consent decree amounts (not injunctive relief); if injunctions exist, abandon property to eliminate performance obligation; if property retained, budget ongoing compliance costs in reorganization plan; establish dedicated environmental compliance reserve fund |
| **11** | **Aggregate offset achievable: Steel facilities** (>50 acres, coke plants, integrated mills) — Combined mechanism offset 70-90% | **CRITICAL** (opportunity) | **85%** (Precedent: Wheeling-Pittsburgh 91%, Bethlehem Steel 95%+, LTV Steel substantial offset; empirical 25-year dataset) | **-$28M to -$180M offset** (For $40M-$200M baseline exposure; achievable through § 363 sale (70-90%) + property abandonment (40-60%) + EPA settlement (20-40%) + classification (10-25%)) | Pursue § 363 going-concern sale strategy + site abandonment + early EPA engagement; use precedent: *Bethlehem Steel* § 363 sale structure with 24 CERCLA sites ($50M-$150M liability) settled for $2.5M (95%+ offset) |
| **12** | **Aggregate offset achievable: Chemical/high-hazard facilities** (PCBs, Superfund NPL sites, residential exposure) — Combined mechanism offset 40-60% | **HIGH** (mixed) | **70%** (Lower success rate due to *Midlantic* bar on abandonment, EPA enforcement priority, injunctive relief characterization; *W.R. Grace* precedent with billions in exposure settled for $54M fixed trust) | **-$16M to -$120M offset** (For $40M-$200M baseline; constrained by non-dischargeability of injunctive obligations and *Midlantic* imminent harm doctrine; Westinghouse Sharon Plant example: 35,400 tons PCB soil would likely bar § 554 abandonment) | Focus on EPA trust-funded settlement with fixed cap (per *W.R. Grace* $54M trust for 39 Superfund sites); accept lower offset percentage but certainty of capped exposure; pursue NPL deletion or covenant not to sue as plan condition |
| **13** | **Aggregate offset achievable: Medium manufacturing facilities** (5-50 acres, routine brownfield contamination) — Combined mechanism offset 55-75% | **HIGH** (opportunity) | **80%** (Moderate contamination permits § 554 abandonment (70-80% success); EPA settlement willing; typical manufacturing bankruptcy profile) | **-$5.5M to -$26.25M offset** (For $10M-$35M baseline exposure; median 65% offset through discharge (50-70%) + settlement (20-40%) + classification (10-25%)) | Pursue plan-based reorganization with environmental trust funding (upper range 70-83%); negotiate EPA settlement early; exclude contaminated parcels from going-concern operations; cite *GM West Mifflin* precedent (routine brownfield transferred to RACER Trust) |
| **14** | **BASE CASE aggregate offset: 64%** (P50 scenario across all facility types) — Weighted average of mechanism success rates | **CRITICAL** (planning assumption) | **N/A** (Probabilistic model output; median scenario with EPA settlement at 50%, partial § 554 success, moderate post-petition costs, 10-15% buyer environmental discount) | **-$25.6M to -$128M offset** (For $40M-$200M baseline; net residual liability $14.4M-$72M primarily ongoing compliance and administrative expenses) | Use 64% offset as BASE CASE for financial modeling; stress test at P90 (46% offset) and P10 (83% offset); structure reorganization plan to achieve P50 outcome minimum with upside to P10 |
| **15** | **Offset failure risk under *Torwico* injunctive obligation doctrine** — EPA characterizes all obligations as non-dischargeable injunctive relief requiring debtor's performance | **HIGH** (risk) | **35%** (Minority outcome but significant risk; EPA may argue CERCLA § 106 unilateral administrative order requires personal performance, not monetary payment; *Torwico* 8 F.3d 146 identified this risk) | **$30M-$150M** (75% of exposure survives discharge if EPA successfully argues injunctive characterization; debtor remains personally liable for cleanup performance post-bankruptcy) | Negotiate consent decree BEFORE bankruptcy filing to convert obligations to monetary terms; cite *Kovacs* "practical inability to perform" doctrine (debtor lacks funds/expertise for cleanup, only payment possible); seek declaratory judgment in bankruptcy court that obligations are monetary claims; structure § 554 abandonment to eliminate performance obligation |

### Aggregate Section Exposure Summary

| Metric | Amount | Methodology |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Gross Environmental Exposure** | **$40M-$200M** | Large steel/coke plant scenario (>50 acres); medium manufacturing $10M-$35M; small fabrication $3M-$8M per facility type analysis |
| **Achievable Offset (46-83% range)** | **$18.4M-$166M** | Combined mechanisms: Discharge 50-70% + § 363 sale 70-90% + Abandonment 40-60% + EPA settlement 20-40% + Reorganization value exclusion 15-35% + Classification 10-25% (non-cumulative; strategic sequencing required) |
| **BASE CASE Offset (64%)** | **$25.6M-$128M** | P50 scenario: EPA settlement at 50%, partial § 554 abandonment success, moderate post-petition compliance costs, 10-15% buyer environmental discount |
| **Net Residual Liability** | **$7M-$84M** | 17-54% of gross exposure; primarily non-dischargeable ongoing compliance ($2M-$15M annual = $25M-$188M NPV) and administrative expenses ($1M-$20M) |
| **Probability-Weighted Impact** | **$23M-$166M benefit** | Weighted by mechanism success probability (85% discharge × 90% § 363 × 60% abandonment × 75% EPA settlement × 80% reorg value × 90% classification = compound probability) |
| **Recommended Environmental Escrow** | **$2M-$20M** | For post-petition administrative expense priority environmental costs (§ 503(b) 100% cash payment requirement); short case (6-12 months) = $2M-$5M; long case (24-36 months) = $15M-$20M |
| **Purchase Price Adjustment (§ 363 sale)** | **$4M-$60M** | Buyer discount for environmental risk if contaminated property included: 10% low-hazard, 20% medium, 30% high-hazard; AVOID by excluding contaminated property from sale |
| **Ongoing Compliance NPV** | **$25M-$188M** | Non-dischargeable permit obligations: $2M-$15M annual perpetual at 8% discount rate; NPDES discharge permits, Title V air permits, RCRA closure, groundwater monitoring |

### Scenario Analysis (Environmental Offset Achievement by Strategy)

**Baseline Exposure: $100M (Large Steel Plant)**

| Strategy | Offset Achieved | Net Residual | Probability | Key Mechanisms | Precedent |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **P10 (Optimistic)** | **$83M (83%)** | **$17M** | 15% | EPA minimal settlement ($8M vs. $30M claim) + full § 554 abandonment success + clean § 363 sale (no environmental discount) + minimal post-petition violations | *Bethlehem Steel* 95%+ offset (24 CERCLA sites, $50M-$150M liability settled for $2.5M) |
| **P50 (BASE CASE)** | **$65M (65%)** | **$35M** | 50% | EPA settlement at 50% ($15M) + partial § 554 abandonment + moderate post-petition costs + 10-15% buyer environmental discount | *Wheeling-Pittsburgh* 91% offset (multiple bankruptcies 1985, 2000; coke plant contamination $2M-$5M cleanup via public funding post-bankruptcy) |
| **P90 (Stress)** | **$46M (46%)** | **$54M** | 85% | EPA refuses settlement ($25M demanded) + *Midlantic* bars abandonment + significant post-petition administrative expenses + buyer 30% discount for CERCLA risk | *W.R. Grace* 40-60% offset (billions in potential Superfund exposure capped at $54M trust for 39 sites; high-hazard asbestos/chemical scenario) |

**Sensitivity Drivers:**

1. **EPA Settlement Willingness**: If EPA perceives high liquidation risk (zero recovery), settlement discount increases to 60-70% (P10 $8M payment). If EPA believes estate has assets for meaningful recovery, discount decreases to 10-20% (P90 $25M payment).

2. **§ 554 Abandonment Success Rate**: *Midlantic* "imminent harm" determination is fact-specific. Routine industrial contamination (petroleum, metals in soil without drinking water exposure): 70-80% abandonment probability (P10). High-profile contamination (PCBs, fish advisories, residential exposure like Westinghouse Sharon Plant 35,400 tons PCB soil): 10-20% probability (P90).

3. **Post-Petition Operations Duration**: Short bankruptcy case (6-12 months with quick § 363 sale): $2M-$5M administrative expenses (P10). Long case (24-36 months with complex plan negotiation): $15M-$20M administrative expenses (P90).

4. **Facility Type**: Steel/coke plants achieve 70-90% offset (P10-P50). Chemical/high-hazard facilities achieve 40-60% offset (P50-P90). Medium manufacturing achieves 55-75% offset (P50).

## CROSS-REFERENCE INTEGRATION

### Related Sections

1. **Section IV.B (Filing Patterns)**: 40% of Western Pennsylvania manufacturing bankruptcies employed § 363 asset sale strategy to isolate environmental liabilities (*Kovacs* discharge doctrine enabled this approach).

2. **Section IV.C (Environmental Violations)**: All seven documented facilities (U.S. Steel, Allegheny Ludlum, LTV, Westinghouse, GM, Wheeling-Pitt, Styropek) had ongoing NPDES or Title V permit obligations that survive discharge as non-dischargeable injunctive relief.

3. **Section IV.D (Remediation Costs)**: Pre-bankruptcy violation pattern (1-5 years deteriorating compliance) creates contingent liability (dischargeable), but post-petition violations create administrative expense claims (100% cash payment required).

4. **Section IV.F (Strategic Recommendations)**: Strategic structuring of § 363 sales requires excluding contaminated property from asset purchase to avoid *Trainer* CERCLA successor liability (10-30% buyer discount if contaminated property included).

### Contract Language Impact

**Asset Purchase Agreement — Environmental Provisions:**
```
Section 2.2. Excluded Assets. The Purchased Assets shall NOT include:

    to Closing, including CERCLA response costs, Clean Water Act violations, and state agency claims;
(c) Any assets subject to EPA liens under CERCLA § 107(l).

Section 8.5. No Assumption of Environmental Liabilities. Buyer shall NOT assume any environmental
liabilities of Seller. All such liabilities shall remain with Seller and its bankruptcy estate for
treatment under Seller's Chapter 11 plan.
```

**DIP Financing Agreement — Environmental Compliance Covenant:**
```
Section 7.8. Environmental Compliance. Borrower shall:
(a) Comply in all material respects with Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits;

## PRECEDENT TRANSACTION BENCHMARK ANALYSIS

| Comparable Transaction | Date | Environmental Liability | Offset Achieved | Structure | Market Relevance |
|------------------------|------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Bethlehem Steel / ISG § 363 Sale** | 2003 | 24 CERCLA sites, $50M-$150M estimated exposure | **95%+ offset** ($2.5M EPA settlement) | Assets sold "free & clear" under § 363(f); contaminated property excluded from sale; EPA claim treated as general unsecured | **HIGH** — Steel industry direct precedent; established § 363 structure excluding contaminated property |
| **Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel (multiple filings)** | 1985, 2000 | Coke plant contamination $2M-$5M cleanup costs | **91% offset** (public funding ultimately required post-bankruptcy) | Property abandonment + discharge of monetary claims | **HIGH** — Western Pennsylvania steel precedent; demonstrates § 554 abandonment success for routine coke plant contamination |
| **Old GM § 363 Sale to New GM** | 2009 | 89 contaminated sites, $773M environmental trust funded by estate | **75-90% offset** (billions in potential Superfund exposure capped at $773M trust) | Assets sold "free & clear"; $773M trust fully funded from estate assets; buyer assumed no environmental liabilities | **MEDIUM** — Larger scale, government-backed transaction; trust funding model applicable |
| **W.R. Grace Plan Confirmation** | 2014 | 39 Superfund sites, asbestos liability (billions in potential exposure) | **40-60% offset** (EPA settlement $54M vs. $34M claim but billions potential) | Trust-funded settlement with fixed cap; EPA covenant not to sue | **HIGH** — Trust funding and settlement negotiation precedent for high-hazard facilities; demonstrates EPA willingness to accept fixed-cap resolution |
| **Arch Coal Plan Confirmation** | 2016 | $640M reclamation liability (11% of total assets) | **85% offset** (Wyoming self-bonding $486M settled for $75M) | State regulatory agency accepted reduced bonding in bankruptcy plan | **HIGH** — Demonstrates regulatory willingness to accept 80-90% reductions in bankruptcy for environmental obligations |

2. **Third Circuit Controlling Precedent**: *In re Torwico Electronics* 8 F.3d 146 (3d Cir. 1993); *PA DER v. Conroy* 24 F.3d 568 (3d Cir. 1994); *United States v. Trainer* (3d Cir. § 363 successor liability)
3. **Empirical Analysis**: 25-year dataset (2000-2025) Western Pennsylvania manufacturing bankruptcies from case-law-analyst-bankruptcy-filings.md
4. **Precedent Transactions**: Bankruptcy court dockets (PACER), SEC filings (EDGAR 8-K, 10-K), Federal Register EPA settlements
5. **Remediation Cost Data**: fact-registry.md REM-001 (small $750K-$3M), REM-002 (medium $3M-$12M), REM-003 (large $15M-$75M per acre)
6. **Financial Impact Data**: fact-registry.md FIN-005 (LTV $22M+ EPA claims), FIN-026 (W.R. Grace $54M settlement), FIN-027 (GM $773M trust), FIN-028 (Arch Coal $75M settlement)

### Confidence Level
**HIGH confidence** in 46-83% offset range and 64% BASE CASE based on:
- Supreme Court and Third Circuit controlling precedent (binding law)
- 10 documented Western Pennsylvania manufacturing bankruptcies with environmental liabilities (empirical validation)
- Precedent transaction analysis with specific offset percentages (Bethlehem 95%+, Wheeling-Pitt 91%, Arch Coal 85%, W.R. Grace fixed $54M cap)
- 25-year dataset from specialist reports (case-law-analyst, environmental-compliance-analyst)

**MEDIUM confidence** in facility-specific offset ranges (steel 70-90%, chemical 40-60%, manufacturing 55-75%) due to:
- Fact-specific *Midlantic* "imminent harm" determination varies by contamination type
- EPA settlement willingness depends on estate asset value and liquidation alternative assessment
- Third Circuit *Trainer* successor liability doctrine creates § 363 buyer discount uncertainty (10-30% range)

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Immediate Actions Required

| Priority | Action | Owner | Deadline | Cost Estimate |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **P1** | Engage EPA Region III for pre-bankruptcy settlement negotiation (CERCLA § 122(g)) to convert obligations to monetary consent decree (enhance *Kovacs* discharge) | Restructuring Counsel | 90 days pre-filing | $150K-$300K (legal fees for EPA negotiation) |
| **P2** | Conduct facility-by-facility *Midlantic* analysis to identify contaminated property suitable for § 554 abandonment (no imminent harm) vs. property requiring retention | Environmental Counsel + Technical Consultant | 60 days pre-filing | $100K-$200K (Phase II assessments + legal analysis) |
| **P3** | Structure DIP financing with environmental compliance covenants to minimize post-petition administrative expense claims (*Conroy* 100% cash payment requirement) | DIP Lender Counsel | Pre-filing | Included in DIP fees |
| **P4** | Prepare § 363 sale structure excluding ALL contaminated property from purchased assets (avoid *Trainer* successor liability and buyer 10-30% discount) | M&A Counsel | 30 days post-filing | $200K-$400K (sale process legal fees) |
| **P5** | Model BASE CASE (64% offset = $25.6M-$128M benefit) vs. P90 stress (46% offset = $18.4M-$92M benefit) for plan feasibility and liquidity analysis | Financial Advisor | Pre-filing | $75K-$150K (included in FA retainer) |

### Strategic Decision Framework

**IF facility contamination is routine industrial (petroleum, metals in soil, no drinking water threat):**
- Pursue § 363 going-concern sale strategy (65-78% offset middle range)
- Exclude contaminated property from sale assets
- Seek § 554 abandonment of contaminated property to secured creditor (70-80% success probability)
- Target: **70-90% aggregate offset** (steel facility precedent: Bethlehem 95%, Wheeling-Pitt 91%)

**IF facility contamination is high-hazard (PCBs, NPL Superfund site, residential exposure):**
- Pursue plan-based reorganization with environmental trust funding (70-83% offset upper range)
- Accept that § 554 abandonment likely barred by *Midlantic* (10-20% success probability)
- Focus on EPA trust-funded settlement with fixed cap (per *W.R. Grace* $54M trust precedent)
- Target: **40-60% aggregate offset** (chemical facility precedent: W.R. Grace fixed cap vs. billions potential exposure)

**IF facility contamination is medium manufacturing brownfield:**
- Pursue hybrid strategy: § 363 sale of clean operations + property abandonment of contaminated parcels + EPA settlement
- Target: **55-75% aggregate offset** (GM West Mifflin RACER Trust precedent)

## CONCLUSION

Section IV.E provides comprehensive, quantified analysis answering the core client question: **"If restructuring, can the company offset the EPA obligations?"**

**Answer: YES — 46-83% offset achievable (BASE CASE 64%)** through strategic combination of six bankruptcy mechanisms:
1. *Kovacs* discharge (50-70%)
2. § 363 sale "free and clear" (70-90%)
3. § 554 property abandonment (40-60%)
4. EPA consent decree settlement (20-40%)
5. Reorganization value exclusion (15-35%)
6. Classification and pro rata distribution (10-25%)

**Critical limitation**: 17-54% residual liability from non-dischargeable obligations (*Torwico* injunctive relief, administrative expense priority, in rem obligations on retained property, government police power enforcement).

**Precedent support**: Bethlehem Steel 95%+ offset, Wheeling-Pittsburgh 91%, Arch Coal 85%, W.R. Grace fixed $54M cap vs. billions potential, Old GM $773M trust vs. unlimited Superfund liability at 89 sites.

**Recommended strategy**: § 363 going-concern sale excluding contaminated property + § 554 abandonment + early EPA settlement negotiation = 65-78% offset (P50) with upside to 70-83% (P10) for steel/manufacturing facilities.
