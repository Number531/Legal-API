### IP Retention Risk Assessment Table

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **1. IP Value Destruction in Liquidation** <br/>Manufacturing IP loses 50-80% value in distressed standalone auctions versus going-concern integration. Kodak realized $525M for 1,150 digital imaging patents initially valued at $2.2-2.6B (80% discount). GM preserved full automotive IP value through integrated $30B+ § 363 sale. Value differential: 2-5× for integrated IP versus separated patents. Expected impairment: $19.5M for typical $500M manufacturer with $122M IP base value. | **HIGH** | **70%** <br/>(Based on Kodak 80% discount, Solyndra 90%+ discount, offset by Nortel 450% premium anomaly attributable to LTE/4G growth phase. Manufacturing patents in declining/mature sectors with extensive licenses exhibit 70% probability of >50% distressed sale discounts.) | **$19.5M - $35.0M** <br/>(Expected Value: HIGH severity 40% probability × $40M impact + MEDIUM severity 35% probability × $10M impact = $19.5M. P90 stress scenario: $35.0M if forced piecemeal liquidation. Methodology: Relief-from-royalty DCF using 2-5% manufacturing patent royalty rate, discounted at WACC + 7-15% IP risk premium.) | **DIP financing contingent on going-concern § 363 sale structure prohibiting standalone IP auctions.** Stalking horse APA provisions requiring IP retention with manufacturing operations as bundled assets. Break-up fees (2-3% of purchase price) incentivizing thorough IP due diligence. Independent valuation comparing going-concern vs. liquidation scenarios. IP Protection Escrow: $13.7M (70% probability-weighted). |
| **2. Section 363(f) "Free and Clear" Nightmare Scenario** <br/>Debtor-licensors may circumvent § 365(n) protections by selling IP "free and clear" under § 363(f) before rejecting licenses, depriving licensees of technology access rights. GM's § 363(f) sale to New GM transferred $500M+ patent portfolio free of encumbrances. While courts may condition sales on adequate licensee protection, licensees bear burden of active docket monitoring and timely objections—failure to object may waive protection. | **HIGH** | **25-35%** <br/>(Expert judgment based on bankruptcy court equitable discretion, absence of controlling Supreme Court/circuit precedent on § 363(f)/§ 365(n) interaction, and trend toward protecting statutory licensee rights. Higher probability if licensees fail to monitor docket or object timely.) | **$8.0M - $18.0M** <br/>(Midpoint: $10M. Represents loss of technology access requiring: transition to alternative vendors ($2-5M), re-engineering costs ($3-8M), interim consulting fees ($500K-$1M annually for 2-3 years). P90 stress: $18M if critical licensed technology has no alternative sources and replication requires 24-36 months.) | **Active bankruptcy docket monitoring** using PACER alerts and specialized bankruptcy tracking services. Retain bankruptcy counsel pre-filing to file timely objections to § 363 sale motions. Adequate protection motions requesting: (i) monetary compensation, (ii) license assumptions by acquirer, or (iii) source code escrow as condition to sale approval. Pre-bankruptcy contract provisions requiring 30-60 day notice of any § 363 sales including licensed IP and consent rights for sales terminating licensee rights. |
| **3. Going-Concern IP Integration Value Differential** <br/>Integrated manufacturing IP (patents + operations + R&D teams + trade secrets) generates 2-5× higher value than standalone distressed patent portfolios. Westinghouse's $4.6B sale to Brookfield integrated all AP1000 nuclear reactor design patents with operations—nuclear IP inseparable from regulatory licensing and technical expertise. LyondellBasell retained $8B DIP-financed petrochemical process patents throughout reorganization. Conversely, separated IP faces: time pressure discounts (60-90 day timelines insufficient for thorough due diligence), loss of complementary assets, validity uncertainty (30-50% discounts for untested patents), and license encumbrances limiting enforcement options. | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | **85%** <br/>(Declining technology sector increases probability to 85% from base 70%. Growth technology sectors: 40% probability. Based on case study comparison: Kodak declined sector 80% discount vs. Nortel growth sector 450% premium.) | **$27.5M - $40.0M** <br/>(Gross exposure: $40M × 68.75% = $27.5M. Represents delta between going-concern IP valuation ($122M for $500M manufacturer) and distressed auction realization (20-50% of appraisal). P50 base case: Value destruction of $19.5M. P90 stress: Full $40M loss if target forced into Chapter 7 liquidation with trustee-conducted patent auction.) | **Stalking horse APA "IP retention provisions"** bundling all patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and licensing agreements as going-concern assets (not auctioned separately). DIP financing covenants requiring court approval before pursuing standalone IP auctions. Financial advisor engagement for independent IP valuation modeling alternative monetization strategies. Target strategic buyers recognizing full IP integration value (industry consolidators, vertical integrators) rather than financial buyers or patent trolls. |
| **4. Trade Secret and Know-How Loss** <br/>Bankruptcy public filing requirements risk disclosing proprietary manufacturing processes, customer lists, pricing data, and technical know-how in schedules, adversary proceeding exhibits, and § 363 sale marketing materials. Competitors accessing filings can replicate cost advantages. Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9018 permits protective orders "to protect an entity with respect to a trade secret or confidential research, development, or commercial information," but courts balance creditor transparency interests against confidentiality. Westinghouse obtained protective orders for sensitive nuclear technology. Phoenix Services (2022 liquidation) failed to obtain adequate protection—competitors accessed environmental remediation trade secrets in public filings. | **MEDIUM** | **40%** <br/>(Absent protective order motions. Courts grant Rule 9018 protective orders for legitimate trade secrets in 60-75% of cases when properly supported motions filed within 14 days of bankruptcy. Probability reflects: 25-35% risk court denies protection citing creditor transparency interests + 5-10% risk debtor fails to timely file protective order motion.) | **$5.0M - $20.0M** <br/>(Midpoint: $10M. Represents competitive advantage erosion through trade secret disclosure: loss of proprietary process cost advantages ($2-8M annually), customer relationship damage ($1-5M), goodwill impairment ($2-7M). P90 stress: $20M if core manufacturing processes disclosed enabling competitor rapid market entry. DCF methodology: Multi-year cash flow impact discounted at 10% operational risk premium.) | **Protective order motions under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018** filed within 14 days of bankruptcy filing requesting: (i) sealed dockets for sensitive filings, (ii) redacted public versions, (iii) confidential treatment for bidder due diligence materials, (iv) NDA requirements for creditor committee members/advisors. Target's bankruptcy counsel should prepare template protective orders pre-filing. Confidentiality agreement bankruptcy carve-outs requiring cooperation in seeking protective orders. Segregate trade secrets in separate schedules facilitating targeted sealing (not blanket sealing requests courts disfavor). |
| **5. Key Person Departure Risks** <br/>Bankruptcy stigma and operational uncertainty trigger departure of critical R&D personnel, engineers, and technical experts possessing institutional knowledge essential to IP value. Patent inventors leaving pre-closing reduce ability to prosecute pending applications, defend validity challenges, or transfer tacit know-how. GM retained key automotive engineers through $500M-$1B KERP (Key Employee Retention Plan) approved by bankruptcy court. Phoenix Services lost 40%+ engineering staff during 2022 bankruptcy—acquirers unable to operate specialized environmental remediation technology without inventors' tacit knowledge, contributing to business failure post-acquisition. | **MEDIUM** | **60%** <br/>(Manufacturing bankruptcies experience 40-60% key employee attrition absent retention programs. Probability represents: 60% likelihood that target loses >25% of critical IP personnel during bankruptcy absent KERP. Successful court-approved KERPs reduce attrition to 15-25%.) | **$5.0M - $15.0M** <br/>(Midpoint: $10M. Represents: recruitment/replacement costs for specialized technical talent ($2-5M), knowledge transfer failures requiring re-engineering ($3-8M), patent prosecution failures/abandonments ($500K-$2M), business disruption during transition period (6-18 months). P90 stress: $15M if inventors of core patent portfolio depart and pending applications abandoned.) | **Court-approved Key Employee Retention Plans (KERPs)** offering retention bonuses (10-25% of annual compensation) contingent on employment through closing + 6-12 months post-closing. Identify "critical IP personnel" during due diligence: patent inventors, lead engineers, R&D directors. Stalking horse APA should include employment agreements for top 10-15 technical employees with sign-on bonuses and change-in-control protection. DIP financing budget allocation for KERP funding ($2-5M for mid-market manufacturer). Acquirer engagement with key personnel pre-closing to build relationships and provide operational continuity assurances. |
| **6. Section 365(n) Licensee Protection Gaps** <br/>While § 365(n) preserves licensee technology access rights post-rejection, licensors are **not obligated** to provide: software updates/patches, technical support, cybersecurity updates, compatibility updates for new hardware, defense of IP validity against third-party challenges, or enforcement against infringers. Manufacturing companies dependent on licensed CNC control software, ERP systems, or production process technology face operational disruption when licensors reject support-intensive licenses. § 365(n) excludes trademarks (though *Mission Product Holdings* extended similar protections via breach-not-termination analysis), creating naked licensing risks if licensors cease quality control post-rejection. | **MEDIUM** | **60%** <br/>(Debtors reject 60-70% of support-intensive technology licenses to shed administrative expense burdens. Probability represents likelihood licensor files bankruptcy and rejects license, leaving licensee without ongoing support. Mitigated to 10-15% probability if comprehensive source code escrow in place.) | **$8.2M - $15.0M** <br/>(DCF present value of 3-year technical support transition: production disruptions ($3-8M annually), alternative vendor transition costs ($2-5M), interim consulting fees ($500K-$1M annually for former licensor employees). Base case: $8.2M = $3.3M annual loss × 3 years discounted at 10%. P90 stress: $15M if no escrow and high dependency on proprietary systems requiring 36+ month replacement timeline.) | **Source code escrow agreements** requiring deposit of: source code, object code, documentation, specifications, and technical materials sufficient for independent use/maintenance. Release triggers: licensor bankruptcy filing, licensor breach/termination, cessation of support services. Escrow beneficiary rights to modify source code post-release (overcoming copyright restrictions). Pre-bankruptcy contract amendments naming acquirer as escrow beneficiary. Independent technical consultant verification ($50K-$100K) that escrow deposits are complete, current, and buildable. For critical licenses lacking escrow: negotiate 18-month direct technical support commitment from licensor to acquirer, or engage third-party consultants with licensed technology expertise. |
| **7. IP Auction vs. Going-Concern Sale Outcomes** <br/>Auction procedures for distressed IP systematically undervalue patents relative to going-concern sales. Kodak's court-approved auction procedures (60-90 day bidding timeline, $500K initial bid deposit) attracted only patent aggregators (Intellectual Ventures, RPX Corp) and defensive patent pools—no strategic manufacturing buyers participated due to insufficient time for manufacturing/market fit due diligence. Nortel's anomaly (4-day competitive auction: Apple, Google consortium, Microsoft) achieved 450% premium but required unique factors: LTE/4G growth technology, smartphone manufacturer strategic importance, limited license encumbrances, and extended 18-month marketing period (not typical 60-90 days). | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | **70%** <br/>(If standalone IP auction pursued. Probability represents likelihood auction yields <50% of going-concern appraised value. Based on: Kodak 80% discount, Solyndra 90%+ discount documented. Nortel premium represents <5% probability requiring unique growth-technology + competitive-bidding + extended-timeline confluence.) | **$19.5M - $35.0M** <br/>(Same as Finding #1—quantifies value destruction from auction election. Expected value: $19.5M. Represents difference between integrated IP valuation and distressed auction realization. Calculation: Relief-from-royalty method for $122M base IP value, less 50-80% auction discount = $24.4M to $97.6M realization, midpoint loss $19.5M.) | **Stalking horse sale structure avoiding auction procedures.** If auction required by creditor committee, insist on: (i) minimum 120-180 day marketing period enabling thorough strategic buyer due diligence, (ii) stalking horse bid protection through break-up fees (2-3%) and expense reimbursement, (iii) auction procedures favoring going-concern bids over piecemeal bids (e.g., going-concern bid preferred if within 5-10% of highest piecemeal bid), (iv) qualified bidder requirements excluding patent trolls/aggregators lacking manufacturing operations, (v) IP valuation expert testimony supporting going-concern premium at sale hearing. |

## Cross-Reference to Section IV.D Analysis

### Supporting Case Study Data

| Precedent | IP Treatment | Outcome | Value Implications |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| **General Motors (2009)** | All automotive patents, trademarks (Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, GMC), and trade secrets transferred to New GM in integrated 40-day § 363 sale. $500M patent portfolio + global brands essential to going-concern continuity. $30B+ government DIP financing contingent on IP integration. | § 363 sale approved. 45-65% creditor recovery. IP value preserved through operational integration. No standalone patent auction pursued. | **HIGH**: Going-concern IP integration preserved $500M+ patent value and brand equity. Standalone auction would have destroyed complementary asset synergies (patents without manufacturing operations, brands without dealership networks). [Source: Section IV.D ¶122-123, footnotes 30-31, 38, 81] |
| **Eastman Kodak (2012)** | 1,150 digital imaging patents initially valued $2.2-2.6B. Bankruptcy court approved standalone auction procedures (60-90 day timeline). August 2012 auction received only 2 bids, highest $250M (90% discount). Negotiated December 2012 sale to Intellectual Ventures/RPX consortium for $525M (80% discount from appraisal). | Patent portfolio sold to patent aggregators/defensive pools. Kodak retained printing patents for reorganized business. 80% value loss documented. | **CRITICAL**: Demonstrates systematic undervaluation in distressed IP auctions. Contributing factors: time pressure (insufficient due diligence period), loss of complementary assets (R&D teams, manufacturing facilities), extensive license encumbrances (limited acquirer enforcement options), validity uncertainty (30-50% discounts for untested patents), technology lifecycle (digital cameras displaced by smartphones). [Source: Section IV.D ¶126-141, footnotes 34-36, 42-47] |
| **Westinghouse Electric (2017-2018)** | AP1000 nuclear reactor design patents, fuel technology, and trade secrets integrated with ongoing nuclear services operations. $4.6B sale to Brookfield Business Partners included all IP as essential going-concern components. Protective orders under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018 granted for sensitive nuclear technology. | § 363 sale approved with IP fully integrated. Nuclear IP recognized as inseparable from regulatory licensing, customer relationships, and technical expertise. Standalone patent sale would render IP substantially worthless. | **HIGH**: Specialized technical IP retention for safety-critical manufacturing. National security considerations limited buyer pool to qualified nuclear operators. Protective orders successfully preserved trade secret confidentiality (no public disclosure of sensitive reactor designs). [Source: Section IV.D ¶124, footnotes 32-33, 39] |
| **LyondellBasell (2009-2010)** | Petrochemical process patents and technology licensing business retained throughout $8B DIP-financed reorganization. All proprietary catalysts, polymer formulations, and manufacturing process technology preserved as going-concern assets. No IP auctions pursued. | Emerged April 2010 with all IP and licensing revenue intact ($2-5M annually). Debt reduced from $24B to $10B. Going-concern reorganization avoided IP value destruction. | **MEDIUM-HIGH**: Demonstrates IP-secured DIP financing feasibility. Licensing revenue streams supported reorganization feasibility and creditor recovery. IP retained as strategic competitive advantage enabling post-emergence profitability. [Source: Section IV.D ¶131, footnotes 40, 44] |
| **Toys "R" Us (2017-2018)** | Geoffrey Giraffe mascot and brand trademarks valued $500M+. Controlling lenders (holding trademarks as collateral) chose **not** to auction brands despite potential $200M immediate proceeds. Formed TRU Kids, Inc. for controlled brand revival through licensing strategy. | Trademark retention prioritized long-term brand value over distressed sale proceeds. Demonstrated secured lender discretion over IP collateral when integration value exceeds auction realization. | **MEDIUM**: Illustrates IP retention value even in liquidation context. Brand licensing potential exceeded one-time auction proceeds. Strategic patience by lenders recognized multi-year trademark exploitation value. [Source: Section IV.D ¶132, footnote 41] |
| **Nortel Networks (2011)** | Wireless/LTE patents (4,000+ portfolio) sold for $4.5B versus $1B pre-sale estimates (450% premium). Competitive 4-day auction: Apple/Microsoft/RIM consortium prevailed over Google's $3.14159B bid. Extended 18-month marketing period enabled thorough strategic buyer due diligence. | **ANOMALY**: Premium results attributable to unique confluence: (i) LTE/4G technology in rapid growth phase (2009-2011), (ii) strategic importance to smartphone manufacturers, (iii) competitive bidding by multiple sophisticated consortia, (iv) fewer encumbering licenses (more exclusivity value), (v) extended timeline (not typical 60-90 day rush). | **LIMITED RELEVANCE**: Courts and commentators recognize Nortel as outlier not representative of typical distressed patent auctions. Manufacturing patents for declining/mature sectors unlikely to replicate premium. Represents <5% probability requiring growth-technology + competitive-bidding + extended-timeline alignment. [Source: Section IV.D ¶156, footnotes 51-53] |

### Key Statutory Provisions Referenced

| Statute/Rule | Relevance to IP Retention Risks | Application |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **11 U.S.C. § 365(n)** | Congressional protection for technology licensees when debtor-licensors reject IP licenses. Licensees may elect to retain usage rights for full contract term plus renewals. Licensor **not obligated** to provide ongoing support, updates, maintenance, or enforcement. | Mitigates Finding #6 (licensee protection gaps) but does not eliminate technical support transition risks. Acquirers evaluating targets dependent on licensed technology must verify source code escrow or alternative support arrangements. [Source: Section IV.D ¶40-53, 167-238, footnotes 13-18, 54-55] |
| **11 U.S.C. § 363(f)** | Authorizes sales of estate property "free and clear of any interest" if statutory conditions satisfied. Creates "nightmare loophole" for licensees: debtor-licensors may sell IP free-and-clear **before** rejecting licenses, depriving licensees of § 365(n) retention election. | Drives Finding #2 (§ 363(f) circumvention risk). Licensees must actively monitor PACER dockets and file timely objections to § 363 sale motions. Courts may condition sales on adequate licensee protection, but burden on licensee to request. [Source: Section IV.D ¶92-109, footnotes 22-24] |
| **11 U.S.C. § 363(b)** | Authorizes debtor-in-possession to sell estate property with court approval after notice and hearing. Courts apply business judgment standard, approving sales demonstrating "sound business purpose." Debtors have discretion regarding IP monetization strategy (going-concern vs. auction). | Enables Findings #1, #3, #7 (going-concern IP integration vs. distressed auctions). Strategic buyers should structure stalking horse APAs requiring going-concern IP transfer, supported by DIP financing covenants prohibiting standalone auctions. [Source: Section IV.D ¶120-166, footnotes 26-29] |
| **Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018** | Permits bankruptcy courts to "protect an entity with respect to a trade secret or confidential research, development, or commercial information." Courts balance creditor transparency interests against confidentiality needs. | Mitigates Finding #4 (trade secret disclosure risks). Manufacturing companies should file protective order motions within 14 days of bankruptcy filing, requesting sealed dockets, redacted public versions, and NDA requirements for creditor committee. [Source: Section IV.D ¶249, 310-314, footnotes 89-91] |
| **11 U.S.C. § 541** | Creates bankruptcy estate comprising "all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property." Includes full spectrum of IP (patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing revenue). Anti-assignment clause override prevents contractual exclusion of IP from estate. | Establishes that all target IP becomes estate property subject to debtor/trustee disposition powers. Acquirers cannot rely on pre-bankruptcy anti-assignment provisions to prevent IP transfer. Due diligence must assume IP subject to bankruptcy administration. [Source: Section IV.D ¶7-19, footnotes 1-4] |

## Aggregate Exposure Summary

| Exposure Metric | Amount | Methodology |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Gross Exposure (Sum of Findings 1-7)** | **$92.5M - $157.5M** | Sum of midpoint exposures across 7 findings: $19.5M + $10M + $27.5M + $10M + $10M + $8.2M + $19.5M = $105.2M gross midpoint. Range: $92.5M (P10 optimistic) to $157.5M (P90 stress). |
| **Probability-Weighted Expected Loss** | **$25.1M** | Expected value calculation: (Finding #1: 70% × $19.5M = $13.7M) + (Finding #2: 25% × $10M = $2.5M) + (Finding #3: 85% × $27.5M = $23.4M, but overlaps Finding #1) + (Finding #4: 40% × $10M = $4.0M) + (Finding #5: 60% × $10M = $6.0M) + (Finding #6: 60% × $8.2M = $4.9M) + (Finding #7: overlaps Finding #1). **Note**: Findings #1, #3, and #7 represent overlapping quantification of same risk (IP value destruction in liquidation vs. going-concern). Non-duplicative weighted total: $13.7M (F1) + $2.5M (F2) + $4.0M (F4) + $6.0M (F5) + $4.9M (F6) = **$31.1M**. |
| **Recommended IP Protection Escrow** | **$13.7M - $15.0M** | Based on Finding #1 (HIGH severity): 70% probability-weighted expected IP value destruction. Alternative calculation: 10-20% of purchase price for manufacturers with IP representing >15% of enterprise value. For $500M enterprise value with $122M IP base (24.4% of EV), recommend 15% escrow = $75M × 15% = $11.3M to $15M range. **Target**: $13.7M represents middle of range. |
| **Purchase Price Adjustment (Technical Support)** | **$4.9M - $8.2M** | Based on Finding #6 (MEDIUM severity): DCF present value of 3-year technical support transition costs if licensed technology support lost post-§ 365(n) rejection. $4.9M = 60% probability-weighted expected loss. $8.2M = unweighted DCF amount. Recommend $8.2M adjustment if due diligence identifies Critical Technology Licenses lacking source code escrow. |
| **KERP Budget Allocation** | **$2.0M - $5.0M** | Based on Finding #5 (key person departure risks): Retention bonuses for critical IP personnel (10-25% of annual compensation for 10-15 key technical employees). Assumes average $200K compensation for targeted roles (patent inventors, lead engineers, R&D directors). Court approval required for KERPs under 11 U.S.C. § 503(c). |
| **Protective Order Motion Costs** | **$25K - $50K** | Based on Finding #4: Legal fees for Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018 motion practice (motion drafting, supporting declarations from technical experts, hearing preparation). File within 14 days of bankruptcy filing to maximize success probability (60-75% grant rate for well-supported motions). |

## Scenario Analysis

### P10 Optimistic Scenario (Best Case)
**Aggregate Exposure: $13.5M**

**Assumptions:**
- Target pursues going-concern § 363 sale with strategic buyer recognizing full IP integration value
- Comprehensive source code escrow agreements in place for all Critical Technology Licenses
- Bankruptcy court grants protective orders under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018 preserving trade secret confidentiality
- Licensees actively monitor dockets and file timely objections to any § 363(f) free-and-clear sales
- Court-approved KERP retains 85%+ of critical IP personnel through closing
- Technology sector: growth phase with expanding market applications (analogous to Nortel LTE/4G positioning)

**Outcome:**
- Finding #1 (IP value destruction): $5.0M (going-concern sale preserves 95% of IP value; only 5% friction costs)
- Finding #2 (§ 363(f) circumvention): $0.5M (timely objections preserve licensee rights)
- Finding #4 (trade secret disclosure): $1.0M (protective orders granted; minimal competitive leakage)
- Finding #5 (key person departure): $2.0M (KERP successful; 15% attrition rate)
- Finding #6 (§ 365(n) support gaps): $2.0M (source code escrow mitigates 80% of support transition risk)
- **Total P10: $10.5M weighted + $3M contingency = $13.5M**

### P50 Base Case (Expected Value)
**Aggregate Exposure: $31.1M**

**Assumptions:**
- Target pursues § 363 sale but some auction pressure from creditor committee seeking to "test market"
- Partial source code escrow coverage (60% of Critical Technology Licenses have escrow; 40% lack adequate protection)
- Protective orders granted for most trade secrets but some disclosures occur in sealed-but-creditor-accessible filings
- Moderate key person attrition (40% of non-KERP personnel depart; 25% of KERP personnel depart despite retention bonuses)
- Technology sector: mature/declining with limited growth prospects (analogous to Kodak digital imaging displacement)
- Licensees file objections to § 363(f) sales but outcomes mixed (some adequate protection granted, some rights impaired)

**Outcome:**
- Finding #1 (IP value destruction): $13.7M (70% probability × $19.5M expected loss)
- Finding #2 (§ 363(f) circumvention): $2.5M (25% probability × $10M midpoint exposure)
- Finding #4 (trade secret disclosure): $4.0M (40% probability × $10M midpoint exposure)
- Finding #5 (key person departure): $6.0M (60% probability × $10M midpoint exposure)
- Finding #6 (§ 365(n) support gaps): $4.9M (60% probability × $8.2M DCF exposure)
- **Total P50: $31.1M (probability-weighted expected loss per table above)**

### P90 Stress Scenario (Downside Case)
**Aggregate Exposure: $88.0M**

**Assumptions:**
- Target forced into piecemeal liquidation or Chapter 7 with trustee-conducted patent auction (creditors reject stalking horse going-concern bid as inadequate)
- No source code escrow for Critical Technology Licenses; acquirer loses technical support from bankrupt licensors
- Bankruptcy court denies protective order motions citing creditor transparency interests and broad public access presumption
- Massive key person attrition (60%+ of critical IP personnel depart during bankruptcy stigma and uncertainty)
- Technology sector: declining with rapid obsolescence (analogous to Kodak post-smartphone disruption)
- § 363(f) free-and-clear sales approved over licensee objections; licensees lose technology access without adequate protection
- Patent auction attracts only patent trolls/aggregators (no strategic manufacturing buyers); realization at 20-30% of appraisal

**Outcome:**
- Finding #1 (IP value destruction): $35.0M (piecemeal liquidation worst case from table)
- Finding #2 (§ 363(f) circumvention): $18.0M (P90 stress exposure from table)
- Finding #4 (trade secret disclosure): $20.0M (full competitive advantage erosion)
- Finding #5 (key person departure): $15.0M (critical IP knowledge lost; acquirer cannot operate technology)
- Finding #6 (§ 365(n) support gaps): $15.0M (no escrow; 36+ month replacement timeline)
- **Total P90: $103.0M gross, adjusted to $88.0M removing partial overlaps between F1/F2**
