---

## REMAINING GAP ANALYSIS

### PRIMARY GAP: Risk Assessment Tables (Dimension 8: 0/8 points)

**Issue**: 0 of 6 sections contain standardized 5-column risk tables

**Required Format**:
```
| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
```

**Current State**:
- Risk information IS PRESENT in narrative form
- Aggregate risk table exists in Section II (7-column format)
- Individual section tables NOT formatted per specifications

**Impact**:
- **Substantive Analysis**: ✅ Complete (all risks quantified and discussed)
- **Presentation Format**: ⚠️ Gap (reduces executive accessibility)
- **Legal Soundness**: ✅ Not impaired

**Recommendation**: Disclose as limitation ("Risk quantification provided in narrative format and aggregate summary table; standardized section tables not generated")

**Time to Remediate**: 90 minutes (15 min/section × 6 sections)

---

## CERTIFICATION OPTIONS

### OPTION A: Deliver As-Is ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Pros**:
- 89.8% quality score meets professional standards
- All substantive analysis complete
- Timeline: Immediate delivery
- Cost: $0 additional

**Cons**:
- Requires limitations disclosure
- Risk tables gap reduces presentation polish

**Disclosure Required**:
1. Risk tables in narrative vs. tabular format
2. Pincite coverage at 30% (major cases covered)
3. Draft provisions addressed in narrative (3 need standalone formatting)

---

### OPTION B: Wave 6 Polish

**Target**: Address HIGH priority gap (risk tables)
**Time**: 90-120 minutes
**Expected Score**: 92-93%
**Outcome**: Minimal limitations disclosure

---

### OPTION C: Comprehensive Enhancement

**Target**: Address all 8 remaining issues
**Time**: 250 minutes (4.2 hours)
**Expected Score**: 94-95%
**Outcome**: Full certification (no limitations)
**⚠️ Note**: Diminishing returns vs. time investment

---

## QUALITY TIER ASSESSMENT

**Current Tier**: **TIER 2 - Strong Associate Work Product**

### Characteristics Met:
- ✅ Sophisticated legal analysis (circuit splits, defense availability, timing requirements)
- ✅ Real database provenance (EPA facility IDs, bankruptcy docket numbers, filing dates)
- ✅ Cross-reference architecture (32-entry matrix with cascading chains)
- ✅ Quantified exposure with methodology disclosed
- ✅ Current case law (within 18 months)
- ✅ Objective counter-analysis throughout

### Gaps from TIER 3 (Senior Associate / Partner Quality):
- ⚠️ Risk tables not in standardized format (presentational gap)
- ⚠️ Pincite coverage at 30% vs. 90%+ gold standard
- ⚠️ 3 draft provisions need standalone formatting

**Conclusion**: Document is strong Tier 2 work product. Gaps are refinements, not deficiencies.
