**Source**: diagnostic-assessment.md
**Generated**: 2026-01-29
**Remediation Tier**: **TIER 3 — FULL REMEDIATION**
**Score**: 71.2% (below 88% threshold)
**Issues in Scope**: **36 of 36** (all severities included per TIER 3 scope)
**Estimated Duration**: 8-12 hours across 6 waves

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The final memorandum demonstrates **exceptional substantive quality** (87,884 specialist report words, 562 footnotes, 128 canonical facts, sophisticated quantification) but requires **comprehensive structural remediation** to achieve certification for client delivery.

###Key Findings:

**Substance Excellence** (92-95% TIER 3):
- ✅ All 6 expected sections complete (IV.A-IV.F)
- ✅ Comprehensive quantification (100% of findings have dollar ranges with methodology)
- ✅ Objective analysis (adverse authority cited, counter-arguments present)
- ✅ Strong executive summary (2,847 words, board-ready, BLUF structure)
- ✅ Draft contract language (9 provisions, though 3 gaps remain)

**Presentation Deficiencies** (45-55%):
- ❌ CREAC Structure: 0/50 headers (CRITICAL blocking issue)
- ❌ Questions Format: 0/12 in "Under/Does/When" format (CRITICAL)
- ❌ Risk Tables: 0/6 per-section tables (CRITICAL)
- ❌ Verification Tags: 0% coverage despite 562 footnotes (CRITICAL)
- ⚠️ Pincites: Only 32% coverage (180/562 citations)
- ⚠️ Parentheticals: 80% of case citations lack explanatory parentheticals

### Remediation Strategy:

**Wave 1-2 (CRITICAL issues)**: Structural reconstruction — CREAC headers, Questions format, Risk Tables, Verification tags, Pincites
**Wave 3-4 (HIGH issues)**: Content additions — Missing contract provisions, Explanatory parentheticals
**Wave 5 (MEDIUM issues)**: Quality enhancements — Cross-reference depth, Precedent references, Language neutralization
**Wave 6 (Assembly)**: Integration and final validation

### Success Metrics:

| Metric | Current | Post-Remediation Target |
|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| Overall Score | 71.2% | ≥93% (CERTIFY threshold) |
| CREAC Headers | 0 | 50+ (minimum) |
| Questions Format | 0/12 (0%) | 12/12 (100%) |
| Risk Tables | 0/6 sections | 6/6 sections (100%) |
| Verification Tags | 0% (0/562) | 100% (562/562) |
| Pincites | 32% (180/562) | 100% (562/562) |
| Provision Coverage | 50% (4/8 HIGH/CRITICAL) | 100% (8/8) |

**Projected Post-Remediation Score**: 93-95% (CERTIFY WITH CONFIDENCE)

## REMEDIATION TIER DETERMINATION

| Tier | Score Range | Scope | Duration | Applies? |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|----------|
| TIER 1 | ≥94% | POLISH (CRITICAL + HIGH only, max 10 issues) | 2-3 hours | ❌ |
| TIER 2 | 88-93% | STANDARD (CRITICAL + HIGH + MEDIUM, max 25) | 4-6 hours | ❌ |
| **TIER 3** | **<88%** | **FULL (All severities, max 50 issues)** | **8-12 hours** | **✅ YES** |

**Current Score: 71.2%** → **TIER 3 FULL REMEDIATION**

**Rationale**: Structural deficiencies (CREAC, Questions, Risk Tables, Verification) require foundational reconstruction, not just polish. The 71.2% score reflects presentation gaps, not substantive research quality. All 36 issues must be addressed to achieve 93%+ certification threshold.

## DEPENDENCY GRAPH

```
Wave 1 (CREAC Headers)
    ↓
Wave 2 (Questions, Risk Tables, Provisions) — requires CREAC structure in place
    ↓
Wave 3 (Verification Tags, Pincites, Parentheticals) — sequential to avoid numbering conflicts
    ↓
Wave 4 (Quality Enhancements) — requires complete content foundation
    ↓
Wave 5 (Final Polish) — requires all substantive content complete
    ↓
Wave 6 (Assembly & Validation) — integrates all remediation outputs
```

**Critical Path**: Wave 1 (CREAC) → Wave 2 (Content) → Wave 3 (Citations) → Wave 6 (Assembly)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Wave 1: All 6 sections can be enhanced independently (W1-CREAC-001 through W1-CREAC-006)
- Wave 2: Questions (W2-QP-001), Risk Tables (W2-RISK-001 through W2-RISK-006), and Provisions (W2-PROV-001 through W2-PROV-003) can proceed in parallel
- Wave 4: All tasks independent (cross-references, provisions, formatting)
- Wave 5: All tasks independent except W5-CITE-001/002 (citation fixes should be sequential)

---

## ESCALATION RULES

### Maximum Cycles: 2

**Current Cycle**: 1 (initial diagnostic)
**Maximum Cycles**: 2 (current + 1 remediation pass)

**Escalation Triggers**:

| Trigger | Condition | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Post-remediation score <88% | After Wave 6 completion, re-diagnostic shows <88% | ESCALATE to HUMAN_REVIEW with issue list |
| Same issue unresolved after 2 passes | Diagnostic pass 1 flags issue; post-remediation pass 2 flags same issue | ESCALATE specific issue to human subject matter expert |
| Assembly failure (>2 tasks fail merge) | Wave 6 assembly cannot merge 3+ remediation outputs | ESCALATE to human for manual integration |
| Validation check failure | Wave 6 validation finds blocking issues (e.g., CREAC headers still <50) | ESCALATE with validation report |

**No Infinite Loops**: After 2 full cycles (initial diagnostic → remediation → re-diagnostic), if score remains <88%, the system MUST escalate to human review. Do NOT attempt additional automated remediation cycles.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Remediation Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| CREAC header insertion introduces inconsistencies | 30% | MEDIUM | Use consistent templates (see diagnostic-assessment.md examples); validation check in Wave 6 |
| Citation renumbering during Wave 3 breaks cross-references | 25% | MEDIUM | Process citations sequentially (W3-TAG-001 → W3-PINCITE-001 → W3-PAREN-001); no parallel edits to footnotes section |
| Provision drafting lacks precedent specificity | 20% | LOW | W2-PROV tasks include explicit precedent requirements; W4-PROV-004 adds missing precedents |
| Risk table creation misclassifies severity ratings | 15% | LOW | Use diagnostic-assessment.md severity definitions; cross-check with Exec Summary aggregate table (Lines 207-214) |
| Assembly merge failures due to file size (838KB) | 35% | HIGH | Use chunked processing in ASSEMBLY-001; process sections individually rather than full document at once |
| Re-diagnostic finds new issues not in original assessment | 10% | MEDIUM | Accept as quality improvement; add to backlog for future cycles if non-blocking |

### Timeline Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Wave 1 (CREAC) takes longer than 4 hours | 40% | MEDIUM | Prioritize Section IV.E (Environmental Offset) as most critical; defer low-priority sections if needed |
| Wave 3 (Citations) bottleneck due to sequential processing | 35% | MEDIUM | Allocate full 2.5 hours; do not compress timeline |
| Wave 6 assembly discovers merge conflicts | 25% | HIGH | Test assembly process on Section IV.A first; if successful, proceed to remaining sections |
| Total duration exceeds 12 hours | 30% | LOW | Acceptable for TIER 3 full remediation; communicate realistic timeline to user |

| **memo-remediation-writer** | 25 tasks | 6.5-8 hours | CREAC headers (W1), Risk tables (W2), Provisions (W2), Quality enhancements (W4), Polish (W5), Assembly (W6) |
| **memo-executive-summary-writer** | 3 tasks | 1 hour | Questions formatting (W2), Brief Answer condensing (W4) |
| **citation-validator** | 5 tasks | 2-2.5 hours | Verification tags (W3), Pincites (W3), Parentheticals (W3), Signal review (W5), Short-form check (W5) |
| **memo-qa-diagnostic** | 1 task | 0.5 hours | Re-diagnostic assessment (W6) |

**Peak Concurrency**: Wave 1 (6 parallel tasks), Wave 2 (11 parallel tasks)

**Sequential Bottlenecks**: Wave 3 (citation-validator must process 562 citations sequentially)

## DELIVERABLES

### Remediation Outputs (Per Task)

Each Wave 1-5 task produces:
1. **remediation-outputs/[task-id].md** — Edited content with EDITED_START/EDITED_END markers
2. **Task completion log** — Success criteria verified (grep counts, validation checks)
3. **remediation-wave-state.json** — Updated with task status (COMPLETE/FAILED/BLOCKED)

### Wave 6 Final Outputs

1. **final-memorandum-v2.md** — Fully remediated memorandum (all edits integrated)
2. **assembly-report.md** — Merge log showing which tasks applied successfully
3. **validation-report.md** — Comprehensive validation results (CREAC count, questions format, risk tables, etc.)
4. **qa-diagnostic-pass2.md** — Second diagnostic assessment with updated score

## HANDOFF TO ORCHESTRATOR

### Next Steps

1. **Generate remediation-dispatch.md** — Machine-readable task manifest for orchestrator
2. **Invoke Wave 1 agents** — Parallel execution of W1-CREAC-001 through W1-CREAC-006
3. **Sequential wave progression** — Wait for wave completion gate before proceeding to next wave
4. **Monitor remediation-wave-state.json** — Track task completion, detect failures early
5. **Execute Wave 6 assembly** — Integrate all outputs into final-memorandum-v2.md
6. **Run re-diagnostic (Cycle 2)** — Invoke memo-qa-diagnostic on v2 memorandum
7. **Certification decision** — If score ≥93% and no CRITICAL issues, proceed to quality-assessment-certification phase

### Escalation Conditions

**ESCALATE TO HUMAN if**:
- Post-remediation score <88% (after maximum 2 cycles)
- Assembly failures >2 tasks (merge conflicts unresolvable)
- Critical validation failures (CREAC <50, Questions <12, Risk Tables <6)
- Agent errors prevent wave completion (systematic failures, not isolated task issues)
