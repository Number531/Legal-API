# DELIVERY DECISION

**Decision**: **CERTIFY_WITH_LIMITATIONS**

**Certification Timestamp**: 2026-01-29T20:30:00Z
**Session ID**: 2026-01-29-1738200293
**Document**: final-memorandum-v2.md

## RATIONALE

The memorandum achieves an **89.8% quality score** with **zero CRITICAL issues** remaining, placing it in the certification-with-limitations range (88-92%). All core legal questions are answered with comprehensive research (562 footnotes, 96.5% verification coverage), rigorous quantitative analysis (all risks quantified with disclosed methodology), and professional structure (35 CREAC headers, 12 properly formatted Questions Presented). The single HIGH-priority remaining issue (standardized risk tables) is presentational, not analytical—risk information is present in aggregate table and narrative form but not formatted as per-section 5-column tables. The memorandum meets professional delivery standards for M&A due diligence with disclosed limitations that do not impair substantive utility for transaction decision-making.

## REMAINING LIMITATIONS (To Disclose to Client)

### 1. Risk Assessment Tables (Priority: HIGH)
- **Issue**: 0 of 6 sections have standardized 5-column risk tables (Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation)
- **Mitigation**: Risk information present in Section II aggregate table and narrative format throughout Sections IV.A-IV.F
- **Impact**: Presentational gap; does not impair substantive analysis
- **Remediation Time**: 90 minutes if client requires tabular format

### 2. Pincite Coverage (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: 30% pincite coverage (167 of 562 citations) vs. 90% gold standard target
- **Mitigation**: All controlling precedent (Supreme Court, Third Circuit) has pincites; secondary authorities lack specific page references
- **Impact**: Meets minimum professional standards; falls short of premium citation practice
- **Remediation Time**: 45 minutes for top 100 citations if court filing or regulatory submission required

### 3. Draft Contract Language Formatting (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: 3 provisions for HIGH findings discussed in narrative but not formatted as standalone contract language sections
- **Mitigation**: All deal terms identified (dollar amounts, durations, precedent) in narrative discussion
- **Impact**: Suitable for strategic decision-making; extraction needed if copying into definitive agreements
- **Remediation Time**: 60 minutes to format 3 provisions as standalone sections
