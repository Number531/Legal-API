## XIV. METHODOLOGY NOTES

**Fact Extraction Process:**
1. Started with 45 pre-extracted facts from orchestrator-state.md
2. Used Grep to extract executive summaries from all 5 specialist reports
3. Cross-referenced financial metrics, dates, and quantitative data
4. Enriched facts with line numbers, confidence levels, and verification methods
5. Organized into 10 categories for comprehensive coverage
6. Mapped facts to 6 expected memo sections

**Verification Standards:**
- HIGH confidence: Verified through government database + 2+ independent sources, OR cross-verified in 2+ specialist reports
- MEDIUM confidence: Single authoritative specialist report OR multiple secondary sources
- LOW confidence: Inference or assumption (none in this registry)

**Conflict Resolution Priority:**
1. Primary legal documents (court filings, statutory text)
2. SEC filings with CIK/Accession numbers
3. Public database records (EPA, USPTO)
4. Specialist reports with named sources
5. Industry estimates/benchmarks

**Completeness Validation:**
- All specialist reports exceeded minimum fact extraction thresholds (2.25-3.50× threshold)
- No sparse reports identified
- Overall completeness score: 284% (well above 90% threshold)
