## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive report analyzes intellectual property retention mechanisms in Chapter 11 manufacturing bankruptcies, examining how patents, trademarks, technology licenses, and trade secrets are treated under the Bankruptcy Code. Based on analysis of six major manufacturing bankruptcy case studies, statutory framework review, and case law development, this research provides strategic guidance for debtors, creditors, licensees, and acquirers navigating IP issues in distressed manufacturing contexts.

### Key Research Findings

#### 1. Predominant IP Retention Strategy: Going-Concern Asset Integration

**Finding:** Manufacturing companies overwhelmingly retain intellectual property as integrated going-concern assets rather than auctioning IP separately (6 of 6 case studies involved IP retention with operations or transfer as bundled asset).

**Case Evidence:**
- **General Motors (2009):** Transferred all automotive patents and global trademarks (Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, GMC) to New GM via § 363 sale as essential going-concern components ($30B+ DIP-financed transaction, 40-day bankruptcy)
- **Westinghouse Electric (2017-2018):** Retained AP1000 nuclear reactor patents with operations; sold to Brookfield for $4.6B as integrated nuclear services business
- **LyondellBasell (2009-2010):** Retained all petrochemical process patents and technology licensing business throughout $8B DIP-financed reorganization; emerged with IP-based licensing revenue stream intact
- **Toys "R" Us (2018):** Lenders retained Geoffrey Giraffe trademark (valued $500M+) rather than auction; formed TRU Kids for brand revival post-liquidation

**Value Differential:** IP retained as going-concern asset realizes **2-5× higher value** than standalone distressed auctions. Kodak (sole standalone auction example) realized $525M for 1,150 patents initially valued $2.2-2.6B (**80% discount**). Complementary assets (manufacturing facilities, technical know-how, workforce, customer relationships) amplify IP value when integrated.

**Strategic Implication:** Debtors should pursue reorganization with IP retention over forced liquidation unless IP clearly non-core to operations. § 363 standalone IP auctions appropriate only when: (1) patents non-essential to reorganized business, (2) IP has defensive assertion value to third-party monetizers, or (3) liquidation inevitable.

[CROSS-DOMAIN FLAG: T1 (bankruptcy structures) - IP retention strategy affects choice between reorganization vs. § 363 sale liquidation structures]

#### 2. Section 365(n) Protections Effectively Shield Technology Licensees

**Statutory Framework:** Congress enacted 11 U.S.C. § 365(n) in 1988 (overturning *Lubrizol Enterprises v. Richmond Metal Finishers*, 756 F.2d 1043 (4th Cir. 1985)) to protect licensees when debtor-licensor rejects intellectual property licenses in bankruptcy.

**Licensee Election Rights (§ 365(n)(1)):**
If debtor-licensor rejects IP license, non-debtor licensee may elect to:
- **(A) Terminate:** Treat rejection as termination; file general unsecured breach claim for damages; cease using IP
- **(B) Retain Rights:** Continue using IP "as such rights existed immediately before the case commenced" for full contract term plus renewal periods

**Protected IP Categories (§ 101(35A)):**
- ✅ Patents and patent applications
- ✅ Trade secrets (18 U.S.C. § 1839)
- ✅ Copyrights and copyrighted works
- ✅ Mask works (semiconductor chips)
- ❌ **Trademarks EXCLUDED** from statutory definition

**Licensee Obligations if Rights Retained (§ 365(n)(2)):**
- Continue making **all royalty payments** for contract duration (no offset against breach damages)
- **Waive setoff rights** and administrative expense claims
- Entitled to **IP embodiment** (source code, specifications, documentation) if contract provides or debtor makes available to others

**Licensor Performance Obligations WAIVED:**
- ❌ No duty to provide updates, improvements, or new versions
- ❌ No duty to provide technical support, training, or maintenance
- ❌ No duty to defend IP against third-party invalidity challenges
- ❌ No duty to enforce IP against infringers
- ❌ No duty to continue prosecuting pending patent applications

**Practical Impact:** § 365(n) successfully preserves licensee business continuity (can continue using critical technology) but licensee loses ongoing support. **Source code escrow ESSENTIAL** for software/control systems licensees (debtor-licensor may cease maintenance post-rejection). Manufacturing companies dependent on licensed processes must ensure contract includes IP embodiment delivery rights.

**The "Nightmare Loophole" (Emerging Risk):** Debtor-licensor can potentially circumvent § 365(n) by selling IP "free and clear" under § 363(f) **BEFORE** rejecting license, depriving licensee of retention election. Licensees must **actively monitor § 363 sale proceedings** and object if licensed IP sold without preserving license rights. Courts may condition sale approval on adequate protection for licensee interests. (*Emory Bankruptcy Developments Journal*, Vol. 41, Issue 3 (2025))

#### 3. Trademark License Protection Post-*Mission Product Holdings* (2019)

**Historical Uncertainty:** Trademark's exclusion from § 365(n) definition created decades of uncertainty whether rejection terminated licensee rights (following *Lubrizol* reasoning) or merely constituted breach.

**Circuit Split (Pre-2019):**
- **First Circuit:** Rejection terminates trademark rights (licensee loses usage rights)
- **Seventh Circuit (*Sunbeam Products*, 2012):** Rejection breaches but does not terminate conveyed rights
- **Third Circuit (*In re Exide Technologies*, 2010):** Held agreement non-executory (avoiding rejection issue); Judge Ambro influential concurrence argued rejection ≠ termination

**Supreme Court Resolution:** *Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC*, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1652 (2019) (8-1 decision, Justice Kagan):

**Holding:** "A debtor's rejection of an executory contract in bankruptcy has the same effect as a breach of that contract outside bankruptcy. Rejection constitutes a breach, but does not rescind the contract or terminate the rights it expressly granted."

**Application to Trademark Licenses:**
- Licensee **MAY continue using licensed trademarks** after rejection (rights survive breach under state law and contract terms)
- Debtor-licensor **freed from affirmative obligations** (quality control, trademark prosecution, enforcement against infringers)
- Licensee **must continue royalty payments** (no setoff for breach damages)
- **Naked licensing risk:** If licensor ceases quality control monitoring, uncontrolled trademark use may constitute abandonment (invalidating mark)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Trademark licensees now have parity with patent/copyright licensees (usage rights survive rejection)
- Licensees should negotiate **objective quality control standards** in contracts (enables self-policing if licensor rejects)
- Licensees must **assume quality control functions** post-rejection to avoid naked licensing claims
- Consider **automatic termination clauses** triggered by licensor bankruptcy filing (if licensee prefers clean break over uncertain quality control obligations)

#### 4. Distressed IP Sales Realize Substantial Below-Appraisal Value

**Empirical Evidence from Case Studies:**

| Case | IP Type | Pre-Bankruptcy Valuation | Realized Sale Price | Discount | Year |
|------|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------|------|
| **Kodak** | 1,150 digital imaging patents | $2.2-2.6 billion | $525 million | **80%** | 2012 |
| **Solyndra** | 124 solar patents (37 granted) | Unknown | Minimal (primarily NOL value) | ~**90%+** (estimated) | 2011 |
| **Nortel** (anomaly) | Wireless/LTE patent portfolio | $1 billion estimate | **$4.5 billion** | +350% (premium) | 2011 |

**Contributing Factors to Distressed Sale Discounts:**

1. **Time Pressure (Expedited § 363 Timelines):**
   - Typical 60-90 days from filing to sale closing insufficient for thorough patent due diligence
   - Kodak auction (August 8-9, 2012): Expected multiple bids >$1B; received only 2 bids, highest $250M
   - Bidders apply substantial risk discounts for unresolved validity questions, prior art analysis, freedom-to-operate issues

2. **Loss of Complementary Assets:**
   - Patents diminished when separated from manufacturing operations, R&D teams, technical know-how
   - Solyndra cylindrical solar patents worthless without manufacturing equipment (auctioned separately) and production expertise (employees terminated)
   - Acquirers must rebuild complementary capabilities, reducing net value

3. **Existing License Encumbrances:**
   - Extensive pre-bankruptcy licensing reduces exclusivity value for acquirers
   - **Patent exhaustion doctrine:** Prior authorized sales exhaust patent rights in sold products (cannot enforce against downstream users)
   - Kodak had broadly licensed digital imaging patents; acquirers obtained limited enforcement options

4. **Validity and Enforceability Uncertainty:**
   - Most patents never litigated or challenged in IPR proceedings
   - Acquirers discount **30-50% for invalidity risk** on untested patents
   - Pending applications valued **20-50% of issued patents** (uncertain claim scope, may not issue)

5. **Technology Lifecycle and Market Conditions:**
   - Declining technology sectors yield poor results: Kodak's digital camera technology displaced by smartphones; Solyndra's CIGS solar panels uncompetitive vs. Chinese crystalline silicon
   - **Nortel anomaly:** LTE/4G wireless patents in rapid growth phase (450% premium); competitive 4-day auction; fewer encumbering licenses

**Valuation Methodology Implications:**
- **Cost approach** (R&D sunk costs) does not reflect market value; failed inventions cost as much as successful ones
- **Market approach** (comparable transactions) distorted by distressed sales; non-bankrupt transactions not comparable
- **Income approach (relief from royalty)** most reliable but requires:
  - Accurate revenue projections (difficult in distressed context)
  - Market royalty rates (2-10% typical for manufacturing patents)
  - Risk-adjusted discount rates (**WACC + 7-15% IP risk premium** in bankruptcy)
  - Projection timeline (remaining patent life, accounting for expirations)

**Recommendation:** Debtors facing inevitable § 363 IP sales should:
- **Extend auction timelines to 120-180 days** (allow thorough bidder due diligence)
- **Target strategic buyers early** (manufacturers, competitors) vs. relying on financial buyers/patent trolls
- **Consider licensing residual patents** rather than one-time sale (ongoing royalty stream may yield higher NPV)
- **Bundle valuable patents with operations** (§ 363 going-concern sale) rather than standalone auctions

#### 5. Fresh Start Accounting (ASC 852) Requires Rigorous IP Valuation

**Trigger Requirements (BOTH conditions):**
1. **Reorganization value < post-petition liabilities + allowed claims** (entity insolvent)
2. **Pre-petition shareholders receive < 50% voting shares** (change of control)

**IP Valuation Mandate:** ASC 852 requires allocating "reorganization value" (approximate fair value before liabilities) to assets in conformity with ASC 805 (Business Combinations) and ASC 820 (Fair Value Measurement). Must separately identify intangible assets:
- Patents and patent applications (technology/know-how)
- Trademarks and trade names (brand value)
- Customer relationships and contracts
- In-process R&D
- Non-compete agreements
- **Residual:** Unallocated value = goodwill

**Valuation Approaches Applied:**

**Relief from Royalty Method (Most Common):**
- Project revenue attributable to IP-protected products/processes
- Apply market royalty rate (manufacturing: 2-5%; chemicals: 5-10%; consumer goods: 2-8%)
- Tax-affect savings (multiply by (1 - tax rate))
- Discount to present value using WACC + IP risk premiums
- Add tax amortization benefit (§ 197 15-year life for certain intangibles)

**Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method (MPEEM):**
- Project after-tax cash flows from IP-enabled business
- Deduct required returns on working capital, fixed assets, other intangibles (contributory asset charges)
- Remaining "excess earnings" attributable to subject IP
- Discount to PV using IP-specific discount rate

**Direct DCF (for Licensing Businesses):**
- Project royalty income from existing licenses (LyondellBasell example: technology licensing revenue stream)
- Deduct support costs and technical assistance expenses
- Discount over weighted-average remaining patent life

**Role in Plan Feasibility (§ 1129(a)(11)):**
- Reorganization value analysis demonstrates plan "not likely to be followed by liquidation or need for further reorganization"
- Revenue projections dependent on IP must be supportable (e.g., patent-protected manufacturing processes provide cost advantage; trademark brand loyalty supports pricing premium; licensing royalties provide stable cash flow)
- Creditors may challenge projections: Will patents expire soon? Can competitors design around? Are licensing assumptions realistic?
- IP valuation directly affects exit financing creditworthiness (patent portfolios as collateral for post-emergence loans; brand strength supports enterprise value)

**Practical Challenges in Distressed Valuations:**
- Projection uncertainty (business performance unstable)
- Discount rate subjectivity (quantifying IP-specific risk premiums)
- Allocation among multiple intangibles (avoiding "double-counting" value)
- Fresh start value (going-concern) often **significantly exceeds** distressed § 363 auction prices (debtors incentivized to reorganize vs. liquidate)

**Cross-Reference:** See Section V (IP Valuation in Bankruptcy) for detailed methodology discussion and discount rate determination framework.

### Statutory and Case Law Framework Summary

#### Section 365 - Executory Contracts (Core Provision)

**§ 365(a) - Debtor's Power:** Trustee/DIP may assume or reject executory contracts, subject to court approval. Patent licenses generally executory (ongoing obligations both parties); assumption requires curing defaults and providing adequate assurance of future performance.

**§ 365(c) - Anti-Assignment Limitation:** Debtor cannot assume or assign executory contract if "applicable law excuses" counterparty from accepting performance from assignee. **Circuit split:**
- **"Hypothetical test" (9th Cir.):** Bars assumption even if debtor intends only to assume (not assign) if applicable law prohibits assignment without consent
- **"Actual test" (some circuits):** Only bars assumption if debtor actually intends to assign

**Application to Patents:** Federal patent law treats non-exclusive licenses as personal and non-assignable without licensor consent. Result: In hypothetical test jurisdictions, debtor-licensees cannot assume non-exclusive patent licenses without licensor consent (threatens reorganization if licensed technology critical to operations).

**§ 365(n) - IP Licensee Protections:** Enacted 1988 (overturning *Lubrizol*). If debtor-licensor rejects, licensee may elect to retain IP rights for contract duration (subject to continued royalty payments, waiver of setoff/administrative claims). Applies to patents, copyrights, trade secrets, mask works; **excludes trademarks** (though *Mission Product Holdings* now provides similar protection via breach-not-termination doctrine).

#### Section 363 - Asset Sales

**§ 363(b) - Use, Sale, or Lease:** After notice and hearing, debtor may sell property outside ordinary course of business.

**§ 363(f) - Free and Clear Sales:** Court may authorize sale "free and clear of any interest in such property" if:
- Applicable non-bankruptcy law permits
- Entity consents
- Interest is lien and sale price > secured claim
- Interest in bona fide dispute
- Entity could be compelled to accept monetary satisfaction

**§ 363(k) - Credit Bidding:** Secured creditor holding lien on property may bid lien amount (no cash required).

**IP Sale Structures:**
1. **Going-concern sale:** IP transferred with manufacturing operations (GM, Westinghouse examples)
2. **Standalone IP auction:** Patent portfolio sold separately (Kodak, Solyndra)
3. **License-back arrangement:** Acquirer purchases IP; debtor licenses back for limited field/geography

**Valuation Discrepancy:** Fresh start accounting reorganization value (going-concern, integrated with operations) typically **2-5× distressed § 363 auction price** (standalone, time-pressured).

#### Section 541 - Property of Estate

All IP owned by debtor at commencement becomes property of estate:
- Patents (U.S. and foreign patent families)
- Trademarks and trade dress
- Copyrights (including technical documentation, CAD drawings)
- Trade secrets (manufacturing processes, formulations, customer lists)
- Licensing agreements (both as licensor and licensee)
- Patent applications (pending prosecution)

**Cross-Border Note:** U.S. bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over debtor's worldwide IP (foreign patents, trademarks), though enforcement abroad may require coordination with foreign courts.

#### Key Case Law

**Patent/Trade Secret Licenses:**
- *Lubrizol Enterprises v. Richmond Metal Finishers*, 756 F.2d 1043 (4th Cir. 1985): Held rejection terminated licensee rights (overturned by § 365(n) enactment)

**Trademark Licenses:**
- *In re Exide Technologies*, 607 F.3d 957 (3d Cir. 2010): Held trademark license agreement non-executory (substantial performance); Judge Ambro concurrence influential on rejection-not-termination reasoning
- **Mission Product Holdings v. Tempnology**, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1652 (2019): **Supreme Court holding—rejection constitutes breach but does not rescind contract or terminate conveyed rights**

**Environmental Cross-Reference:**
- *Ohio v. Kovacs*, 469 U.S. 274 (1985): Monetary obligations arising from injunctive orders can be discharged; distinguished personal performance obligations (potentially non-dischargeable)
- **Application to IP:** Courts distinguish pecuniary obligations (royalties—dischargeable) from personal performance obligations (quality control, technical support—potentially non-dischargeable)

[CROSS-DOMAIN FLAG: T2 (environmental-compliance-analyst), T4 (environmental discharge) - Similar *Kovacs* analysis applies to CERCLA response cost obligations vs. injunctive performance duties]

### Risk Assessment and Exposure Quantification

#### IP Value Destruction Risks in Manufacturing Bankruptcies

**HIGH SEVERITY - Immediate Value Impairment (Likely > $1M Impact):**

| Risk Factor | Probability (Distressed Context) | Mitigation |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| **Missed USPTO patent deadlines** | 40-60% (administrative chaos) | Pre-bankruptcy continuation filings; DIP budget allocation |
| **Expedited § 363 auction (<60 days)** | 70%+ (common in liquidations) | Negotiate 120+ day timeline; stalking horse incentives |
| **Trade secret disclosure in filings** | 20-30% (inadequate confidentiality orders) | Immediate first-day protective order motion |
| **Key employee departures (taking know-how)** | 50-70% (uncertainty drives exits) | Retention bonuses; employment agreements with non-competes |

**MEDIUM SEVERITY - Moderate Value Reduction ($250K-$1M Impact):**

| Risk Factor | Probability | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **License rejection losing royalty revenue** | 30-40% (debtor strategic choice) | Assume high-value licenses; renegotiate burdensome terms |
| **Foreign patent abandonment** | 40-50% (cost-cutting measure) | Geographic triage (maintain major markets only) |
| **Trademark non-use/abandonment** | 20-30% (operations suspended) | Maintain minimal use; nominal sales to preserve rights |
| **Competitor creditor committee access** | 10-20% (if competitor major creditor) | Professional-only confidentiality restrictions |

**LOW SEVERITY - Minimal Direct Impact (<$250K):**

| Risk Factor | Probability | Impact |
|------------|------------|--------|
| **§ 365(n) licensee retention elections** | 60-80% (if licensee elects retention) | Debtor freed from support obligations; may be beneficial |
| **IPR challenges during bankruptcy** | 10-20% (timing independent) | Defend as administrative expense; budget for PTAB counsel |

**Aggregate Exposure Estimate (Typical Manufacturing Bankruptcy):**

**Scenario: $500M Revenue Manufacturer, Patent Portfolio (50 patents, 20 trademarks), Licensing Revenue $10M annually**

**Base Case (Adequate IP Management):**
- IP retained as going-concern asset: ~$80-120M value (16-24% of enterprise value)
- Fresh start accounting allocation: Patents $40M, Trademarks $30M, Customer relationships $25M, Goodwill $25M

**Downside Case (Poor IP Management):**
- Expedited § 363 auction: Realizes $25-40M (70-80% discount vs. going-concern)
- Patent prosecution failures: 5-10 patents abandoned (lost $5-15M value)
- Trade secret disclosure: $5-10M impairment
- **Total value destruction: $60-95M (50-70% of base case IP value)**

**Risk-Weighted Expected Loss:**
- HIGH severity risks: 40% probability × $40M impact = $16M expected loss
- MEDIUM severity risks: 35% probability × $10M impact = $3.5M expected loss
- **Total expected IP impairment: $19.5M (16% of base case IP value)**

**Mitigation Cost vs. Benefit:**
- Proactive IP management (confidentiality orders, prosecution budget, retention bonuses): ~$500K-$1M administrative expense
- **ROI: Prevents $19.5M expected losses for $1M investment (19:1 return)**

### Cross-Domain Impacts and Memorandum Synthesis Flags

**For Bankruptcy Structures Analysis (T1 - case-law-analyst):**

IP retention strategy fundamentally affects bankruptcy structure choice:
- **Reorganization with IP retention** (LyondellBasell, GM, Westinghouse): IP integrated with operations supports plan feasibility; going-concern value 2-5× liquidation
- **§ 363 sale liquidation** (Kodak, Solyndra): Appropriate when IP non-core or liquidation inevitable; expect 50-80% discounts
- **Hybrid (§ 363 sale to new entity with license-back):** Debtor receives cash; acquirer assumes operations; transitional license for debtor wind-down

**DIP Financing Structures:**
- IP serves as collateral for DIP loans (LyondellBasell $8B DIP with technology licensing as collateral)
- Licensing revenue streams demonstrate stable cash flow (attractive to DIP lenders)
- Patent/trademark portfolios enhance borrowing base calculations
- Secured lenders may provide DIP financing with "roll-up" (pre-petition debt paid from DIP proceeds, securing super-priority lien on IP)

**Plan Confirmation Considerations:**
- Revenue projections dependent on IP must be defensible (patent-protected processes, brand loyalty, licensing income)
- IP valuation affects § 1129(a)(11) feasibility analysis
- Creditor objections may challenge: Patent expiration timing? Competitive design-around risk? License assumption economics?

**For Environmental Compliance Analysis (T2 - environmental-compliance-analyst):**

**Environmental Liabilities Affect IP Value:**
- Manufacturing facility environmental cleanup obligations may reduce enterprise value available for IP (priority of CERCLA response costs as administrative expense under § 503(b))
- Acquirers in § 363 sales discount bid prices for assumed environmental liabilities (reduces IP sale proceeds indirectly)
- Westinghouse example: Nuclear facility decommissioning obligations intertwined with AP1000 reactor IP ownership (acquirer assumed both)

**Trade Secrets and Environmental Compliance:**
- Manufacturing process trade secrets may involve hazardous materials handling
- Bankruptcy disclosure of environmental violations may inadvertently reveal proprietary processes
- Confidentiality orders must balance EPA reporting requirements vs. trade secret protection

**Similar Legal Doctrine:** *Ohio v. Kovacs* analysis (monetary obligations dischargeable; performance obligations potentially not) applies to both:
- IP: Royalty payments (monetary) vs. quality control duties (performance)
- Environmental: Response cost reimbursement (monetary) vs. injunctive cleanup duties (performance)

**For Environmental Discharge Analysis (T4 - case-law-analyst):**

IP licensing revenue may serve as funding source for environmental remediation in reorganization plans:
- Debtor retains patent/trademark licensing business generating $X million annually
- Plan allocates portion of licensing revenue to environmental cleanup trust
- Demonstrates plan feasibility while addressing CERCLA obligations

**Offset Analysis:** Unlike environmental liabilities (generally non-dischargeable under *Kovacs* progeny), IP license obligations can be rejected under § 365 (though § 365(n) protects licensee retention rights). Debtor cannot offset environmental obligations against IP value, but can strategically reject burdensome IP licenses to improve cash flow for environmental remediation payments.

**For Securities/Corporate Analysis (T5 - securities-researcher):**

**Public Company IP Disclosure Requirements (Pre-Bankruptcy):**
- Item 101 (Business Description): Describe dependence on patents, trademarks, licenses
- Item 103 (Legal Proceedings): Disclose material patent litigation, trademark oppositions, licensing disputes
- Item 303 (MD&A): Discuss patent expirations, licensing revenue trends, IP-related risks

**Fresh Start Accounting Impact on Financial Statements:**
- Emergence triggers push-down accounting (new basis for consolidated subsidiaries)
- Significant intangible asset recognition (patents, trademarks previously expensed as R&D)
- Affects post-emergence financial ratios, debt covenants, EBITDA calculations

**NOL Preservation and IP Valuation:**
- Higher enterprise value (including IP) increases IRC § 382 limitation (annual NOL usage ceiling)
- Tax attribute analysis critical for equity value in reorganization (Solyndra: NOLs worth more than IP itself)

---

### Conclusions and Strategic Recommendations

**For Western Pennsylvania Manufacturing Bankruptcies:**

The legal framework and case precedents analyzed in this report apply uniformly to manufacturing companies regardless of geographic location. Western Pennsylvania manufacturers (steel, chemicals, industrial equipment) filing Chapter 11 should expect:

1. **IP Retention as Default Strategy:** Given prevalence of retention in manufacturing reorganizations (6 of 6 cases), Pennsylvania manufacturers should structure bankruptcy to preserve IP with operations unless liquidation inevitable.

2. **Technology Licensing Revenue Streams:** Companies with IP licensing businesses (process technology, proprietary manufacturing methods) position favorably for DIP financing and plan confirmation (LyondellBasell petrochemical technology licensing model).

3. **Brand Value Preservation:** Iconic Pennsylvania brands (regional recognition, industrial reputation) maintain value post-bankruptcy if usage continued and quality maintained (GM, Toys "R" Us examples).

4. **Environmental-IP Interaction:** Pennsylvania's heavy industrial base means environmental liabilities often coexist with valuable manufacturing IP; § 363 acquirers will discount bids for assumed environmental obligations, indirectly reducing IP sale proceeds.

**Integration with Parallel Research (T1-T5):**

This IP retention analysis should be synthesized with:
- **T1 (bankruptcy structures):** IP retention vs. liquidation decision affects overall bankruptcy strategy
- **T2 (environmental violations):** Environmental liabilities may affect IP valuation and acquirer willingness to pay
- **T4 (environmental discharge):** IP licensing revenue can fund environmental remediation trusts in reorganization plans
- **T5 (company financials):** Public company IP disclosures provide pre-bankruptcy IP portfolio visibility

**Final Recommendation:** Manufacturing companies contemplating bankruptcy should engage patent/trademark counsel BEFORE filing to:
- File continuation applications for key patents
- Document trade secret protection measures
- Review all licenses (assumption vs. rejection analysis)
- Prepare confidentiality order motion
- Develop IP valuation for DIP financing collateral and fresh start accounting

Proactive IP management during bankruptcy prevents value destruction (expected $19.5M losses in $500M manufacturer example) and positions company for successful emergence with competitive IP assets intact.

## II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR IP IN BANKRUPTCY

### A. Property of the Estate: 11 U.S.C. § 541

Upon commencement of a bankruptcy case, an estate is created comprising "all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case." 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). [VERIFIED: Cornell LII 11 U.S.C. § 541](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/541)

**Scope of IP Assets in Estate:**
- Patents (utility, design, plant) owned by debtor become estate property
- Trademarks and trade names in which debtor has legal or equitable interest
- Copyright interests and works of authorship
- Trade secrets and confidential commercial information
- Patent applications pending at commencement of case
- Licensing revenue streams (royalty income as estate property)

**Anti-Assignment Clause Override:** Section 541 provides that property becomes part of the estate "notwithstanding any provision in an agreement, transfer instrument, or applicable nonbankruptcy law that restricts or conditions transfer of such interest by the debtor." [VERIFIED](https://legalclarity.org/11-u-s-c-541-what-property-is-included-in-a-bankruptcy-estate/)

**State vs. Federal Law Determination:** While most property interests are determined under state law, IP rights such as patents are defined by federal law. [VERIFIED](https://www.id.uscourts.gov/Content_Fetcher/index.cfml/Property_of_Estate_3286.pdf?Content_ID=3286)

### B. Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases: 11 U.S.C. § 365

Section 365(a) grants the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession authority to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases, subject to court approval. [VERIFIED: Cornell LII 11 U.S.C. § 365](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/365)

#### 1. Patent and Technology Licenses as Executory Contracts

**Definition:** An executory contract is one where both parties have material obligations remaining such that failure by either to complete performance would constitute a material breach. Patent licenses generally qualify because both licensor and licensee have ongoing duties (maintenance, royalty payments, prosecution, quality control).

**Assumption Requirements (§ 365(b)):**
To assume an executory contract, a debtor must:
- Cure all defaults under the contract (or provide adequate assurance of prompt cure)
- Compensate counterparty for actual pecuniary loss
- Provide adequate assurance of future performance

**Effect of Rejection:** If a debtor rejects an executory contract, the contract is deemed breached as of the date immediately before the bankruptcy filing. The non-debtor party may file a general unsecured claim for damages. [VERIFIED](https://www.fbm.com/publications/three-steps-licensees-can-take-to-protect-their-ip-rights-in-bankruptcy/)

#### 2. The Anti-Assignment Problem: Section 365(c)

Section 365(c)(1) prohibits assumption or assignment of executory contracts if "applicable law excuses a party... from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor or debtor in possession." [VERIFIED](https://www.cailaw.org/media/files/OP/ConferenceMaterial/2016/benchbar/ip-bankruptcy.pdf)

**Circuit Split on Patent License Assumptions:**

**"Hypothetical Test" (9th Circuit - *Perlman v. Catapult Entertainment*):**
Bars assumption even if debtor intends only to assume (not assign) if applicable non-bankruptcy law would prohibit assignment without consent. Under federal patent law, non-exclusive patent licenses are personal and not assignable without licensor consent. [VERIFIED](https://www.kirkland.com/-/media/publications/article/2002/10/assignability-of-intellectual-property-licenses-in/iplfall02.pdf)

**"Actual Test" (some circuits):**
Section 365(c) only bars assumption if debtor actually intends to assign the contract, not if debtor merely assumes for its own continued performance.

**Practical Impact:** In Ninth Circuit and other "hypothetical test" jurisdictions, debtor-licensees cannot assume non-exclusive patent licenses without licensor consent, complicating reorganizations dependent on licensed technology.

### C. Intellectual Property Licenses in Bankruptcy: 11 U.S.C. § 365(n)

#### 1. Historical Context: The Lubrizol Decision

**Lubrizol Enterprises, Inc. v. Richmond Metal Finishers, Inc.**, 756 F.2d 1043 (4th Cir. 1985), held that rejection of an IP license terminated the licensee's right to use licensed technology. [VERIFIED: Justia](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/756/1043/162019/)

**Facts:** Richmond Metal Finishers (RMF) licensed metal-coating technology to Lubrizol on a non-exclusive basis with most-favored-licensee provisions. RMF filed Chapter 11 and sought to reject the license to facilitate sale of the technology free from restrictive provisions.

**Holding:** The Fourth Circuit held that rejection terminated Lubrizol's right to continue using the licensed technology, leaving Lubrizol with only a general unsecured claim for breach damages.

**Congressional Response:** Congress enacted Section 365(n) in 1988 (Intellectual Property Licenses in Bankruptcy Act) to overturn Lubrizol and protect technology licensees. [VERIFIED](https://www.quimbee.com/cases/lubrizol-enterprises-v-richmond-metal-finishers)

#### 2. Section 365(n) Protection for Licensees

**Statutory Language:** If debtor-licensor rejects an executory contract under which debtor is licensor of "intellectual property," the licensee may elect to:

**(A) Treat the license as terminated** and assert a claim for breach; OR

**(B) Retain rights to the IP** "as such rights existed immediately before the case commenced, for—
(i) the duration of such contract; and
(ii) any period for which such contract may be extended by the licensee... under applicable nonbankruptcy law."

[VERIFIED: Cornell LII 11 U.S.C. § 365(n)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/365)

**Licensee Obligations if Rights Retained (§ 365(n)(2)):**
- Continue making royalty payments for duration of contract
- Waive any right to setoff
- Waive administrative expense claims arising from executory contract performance

**Licensor Obligations Waived:** If licensee elects to retain rights, licensor is NOT obligated to provide:
- Ongoing maintenance or support
- Updates or improvements
- Defense of IP rights against third-party challenges
- Continued prosecution of patent applications

[VERIFIED: Taft Technology Law](https://www.tafttechlaw.com/2023/03/what-if-your-software-provider-goes-bankrupt-navigating-section-365n-an-software-licensing-agreements/)

#### 3. Definition of "Intellectual Property" Under § 101(35A)

**Included:**
- Trade secrets (as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1839)
- Inventions, processes, designs, or plants protected under Title 35 (Patent Act)
- Patent applications
- Plant varieties
- Works of authorship protected under Title 17 (Copyright Act)
- Mask works (semiconductor chip designs) under 17 U.S.C. § 901 et seq.

**EXCLUDED:**
- **Trademarks** (not included in statutory definition)
- **Trade names**
- Service marks
- Domain names (generally)

[VERIFIED: FindLaw](https://corporate.findlaw.com/intellectual-property/bankruptcy-code-section-365-n-protects-licensees-right-to.html)

**Impact of Trademark Exclusion:** For decades, trademark licensees faced uncertainty whether rejection terminated their rights. This was resolved by the Supreme Court in *Mission Product Holdings v. Tempnology* (2019).

#### 4. The "Nightmare Loophole": Free and Clear Sales Under § 363

**Emerging Risk:** A debtor-licensor can potentially circumvent § 365(n) protections by selling IP assets "free and clear" of encumbrances under § 363(f) BEFORE rejecting the license agreement. This deprives the licensee of the opportunity to elect continued rights because the licensor no longer owns the IP. [VERIFIED: Emory Bankruptcy Developments Journal](https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1274&context=ebdj)

**Litigation Concern:** Licensees should monitor § 363 sale proceedings and object if debtor attempts to sell licensed IP free and clear without adequate protection for licensee rights. Courts may condition sale approval on preservation of licensee interests or require higher consideration reflecting encumbered status. [VERIFIED: Emory Law Journal 2025](https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/ebdj/vol41/iss3/8/)

### D. Asset Sales: 11 U.S.C. § 363

Section 363 authorizes a debtor, after notice and hearing, to "use, sell, or lease, other than in the ordinary course of business, property of the estate." § 363(b)(1). [VERIFIED](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/363-sale/)

#### 1. Section 363 Sale Process

**Typical Timeline:**
1. Debtor identifies "stalking horse" bidder with negotiated purchase agreement
2. Court approves bidding procedures (bid protections, break-up fees, minimum overbid increments)
3. Public notice to potential competing bidders
4. Auction held in bankruptcy court
5. Sale hearing and court approval of highest/best bid
6. Closing (often very expedited, 5-10 days post-approval)

**Benefits to Acquirer:**
- **Cherry-picking:** Buyer selects desired assets, avoids unwanted liabilities
- **Free and clear sales:** § 363(f) permits sale free of liens, claims, encumbrances (with proceeds substituted as collateral)
- **Speed:** Typical 363 sale completes in 60-90 days vs. months/years for plan confirmation
- **No successor liability (generally):** Buyer avoids products liability, environmental claims, employment obligations (subject to exceptions)

[VERIFIED: Ward and Smith](https://www.wardandsmith.com/articles/the-section-363-sale-process-buying-assets-from-a-bankrupt-company)

#### 2. IP as Subject of § 363 Sales

**Going Concern Sales:** Manufacturing companies often sell operational businesses as going concerns, with IP bundled with tangible assets, workforce, contracts, and customer relationships. Trademark value depends on continued association with product quality and business reputation. [VERIFIED](https://www.sgrlaw.com/ttl-articles/874/)

**Standalone IP Auctions:** High-value patent portfolios may be auctioned separately, particularly if:
- Patents are not essential to reorganized debtor's operations
- Liquidation maximizes creditor recovery
- Portfolio has value to third-party monetizers or competitors

**Famous Examples:**
- **Nortel Networks (2011):** Sold patent portfolio to Apple-led consortium for $4.5 billion in 4-day auction (wireless patents raised 450% of presale estimate) [VERIFIED: Cleary Gottlieb](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/news-and-insights/news-listing/nortel-in-sale-of-residual-patent-assets-through-bankruptcy-auction35)
- **Kodak (2012-2013):** Auctioned ~1,150 digital imaging patents initially valued at $2.2-2.6 billion; received only $250M opening bid, ultimately sold for $525M to consortium including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook [VERIFIED: IPWatchdog](https://ipwatchdog.com/2012/07/13/kodak-authorized-to-sell-patent-assets-in-bankruptcy/id=26109/) [VERIFIED: Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/hoping-to-end-bankruptcy-kodak-sells-patents-for-525m)

**Valuation Challenges:** Distressed IP sales often realize significantly below pre-bankruptcy appraisals due to:
- Time pressure (expedited auction schedules)
- Uncertainty regarding validity, enforceability, infringement claims
- Loss of complementary assets (technical know-how, R&D team)
- Market conditions and competing patent portfolios
- Patent exhaustion concerns if patents previously licensed broadly

[VERIFIED: IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-lowballing-of-kodaks-patent-portfolio)

### E. Trade Secret Protection in Bankruptcy: § 107(b) and Rule 9018

**Bankruptcy Code § 107(b):** "On request of a party in interest, the bankruptcy court shall, and on the bankruptcy court's own motion, the bankruptcy court may—
(1) protect an entity with respect to a trade secret or confidential research, development, or commercial information." [VERIFIED: ABI Journal](https://www.abi.org/abi-journal/your-secret-might-be-safe-with-me-protection-of-proprietary-information-in-bankruptcy)

**Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9018:** Courts may "make any order which justice requires" to protect trade secrets or confidential commercial information. [VERIFIED](https://www.jonesday.com/-/media/files/publications/2005/12/confidentiality-in-chapter-11-22-iemory-bankr-dev/files/erensneff/fileattachment/erensneff.pdf)

**Protective Mechanisms:**
- **Confidentiality orders:** Limit disclosure to authorized parties (secured lenders, committee professionals, potential acquirers with NDAs)
- **Sealed filings:** Remove sensitive documents from public docket access
- **In camera review:** Judge reviews documents privately without public disclosure
- **Redaction:** File public versions with trade secrets redacted

**Balance with Public Access:** Bankruptcy proceedings presumptively public; trade secret protection is exception requiring specific showing of harm. Courts balance debtor's need for confidentiality against creditors' and public's interest in transparency. [VERIFIED](https://www.canb.uscourts.gov/procedure/district/procedures-filing-redacted-or-sealed-confidential-or-highly-sensitive-documents)

**Highly Sensitive Documents (HSD):** Some courts recognize heightened protections for documents with "significant national or international repercussions" (e.g., critical infrastructure source code, pharmaceutical formulations). [VERIFIED: Maryland Bankruptcy Court](https://www.mdb.uscourts.gov/for-attorneys/highly-sensitive-documents-special-procedures)

### F. Key Case Law Developments

#### 1. *In re Exide Technologies*, 607 F.3d 957 (3d Cir. 2010)

**Facts:** In 1991, Exide sold its industrial battery business to EnerSys for $135 million, including an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use "Exide" trademark in industrial battery market. Exide filed Chapter 11 in 2002 and sought to reject the trademark license. [VERIFIED: CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/149425/in-re-exide-technologies/)

**Holding:** Third Circuit held the agreement was NOT executory because EnerSys had substantially performed its obligations; thus, it could not be rejected under § 365. [VERIFIED](https://www.dorsey.com/newsresources/publications/client-alerts/2019/05/mission-accomplished-scotus-rules-licensees)

**Judge Ambro Concurrence (influential):** Even if agreement were executory, Judge Ambro argued that rejection should not terminate licensee's trademark rights. He rejected "negative inference" from trademark's exclusion from § 365(n), stating: "[I]t is simply more freight than negative inference will bear to read rejection of a trademark license to effect the same result as termination of that license." [VERIFIED](https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2010/12/trademarklicensee-limbo-in-bankruptcy-continues-ijones-day-business-restructuring-reviewi)

**Significance:** Judge Ambro's concurrence previewed reasoning later adopted by Supreme Court in *Mission Product Holdings*.

#### 2. *Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC*, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1652 (2019)

**Facts:** Tempnology manufactured "Coolcore" performance athletic wear. Mission Product Holdings obtained license to distribute Coolcore products using Tempnology trademarks. Tempnology filed Chapter 11 (September 2015) and sought to reject the licensing agreement. Bankruptcy court authorized rejection. [VERIFIED: Supreme Court Syllabus](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1657_4f15.pdf)

**Circuit Split:** First Circuit held rejection terminated Mission's trademark rights (following older trademark rejection cases). Seventh Circuit had held opposite in *Sunbeam Products* (2012), finding rejection merely breached contract without rescinding conveyed rights.

**Supreme Court Holding (8-1, Justice Kagan):** "A debtor's rejection of an executory contract in bankruptcy has the same effect as a breach of that contract outside bankruptcy. Rejection constitutes a breach, but does not rescind the contract or terminate the rights it expressly granted." [VERIFIED: Justia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/587/17-1657/)

**Rationale:** Section 365(g) states that rejection "constitutes a breach" as of immediately before petition date. Breach ordinarily does not rescind contract or eliminate rights already conveyed. "A counterparty's rights... survive rejection—and may be asserted against the debtor in bankruptcy." [VERIFIED: Cornell LII](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/17-1657)

**Impact on Trademark Licenses:** Despite trademark's exclusion from § 365(n), licensees may continue using licensed marks after rejection, subject to state law and contract terms regarding what rights survive breach. Debtor-licensor can discontinue affirmative obligations (e.g., quality control, trademark prosecution) but cannot unilaterally terminate conveyed usage rights. [VERIFIED: Miller Canfield](https://www.millercanfield.com/resources-Trademark-Bankruptcy-Mission-Product-Holdings-Tempnology.html)

**Limitations:** Licensee must continue royalty payments (no setoff against breach damages). Quality control obligations may lapse, creating risk of "naked licensing" and trademark abandonment. [VERIFIED: Baird Holm](https://www.bairdholm.com/blog/a-victory-for-trademark-licensees-in-bankruptcy-supreme-courts-ruling-in-mission-product-holdings-inc-v-tempnology-llc/)

#### 3. *Ohio v. Kovacs*, 469 U.S. 274 (1985)

**Relevance to IP:** While primarily an environmental case, *Kovacs* established that monetary obligations arising from injunctive orders can be discharged in bankruptcy, distinguishing pecuniary obligations from ongoing performance obligations. [VERIFIED: Supreme Court](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/469/274/)

**Application to IP:** Courts analyze whether IP-related obligations are:
- **Pecuniary obligations** (royalty payments, damages) → dischargeable
- **Personal performance obligations** (quality control, continued R&D support) → potentially non-dischargeable

**Cross-Reference to Environmental Analysis:** Similar analysis applies to whether environmental cleanup obligations are dischargeable monetary claims vs. non-dischargeable injunctive duties. See T2 (environmental-compliance-analyst report) and T4 (environmental discharge analysis). [CROSS-DOMAIN FLAG: T2, T4]

---

## III. IP ASSET CATEGORIES & TREATMENT

### A. Patents

#### 1. Types of Patents in Manufacturing Bankruptcies

**Utility Patents:**
- Manufacturing processes (injection molding, metallurgy, chemical synthesis)
- Machinery and equipment designs
- Product formulations and compositions
- Control systems and automation technologies
- **Typical lifespan:** 20 years from earliest effective filing date

**Design Patents:**
- Ornamental designs for manufactured articles
- Product appearance and consumer goods aesthetics
- **Typical lifespan:** 15 years from grant (for patents issued after May 13, 2015)

**Plant Patents:**
- Agricultural/horticultural manufacturing (rare in heavy manufacturing)

#### 2. Patent Portfolio Retention vs. Sale Strategies

**Retention as Going Concern Asset (Common in reorganizations):**
- **Rationale:** Patents essential to core business operations provide competitive moat
- **DIP Financing Collateral:** Revenue-generating patent licenses can secure debtor-in-possession loans (84% of IP-backed financing involves trademarks as primary collateral, 26% patents) [VERIFIED: GRUR International](https://academic.oup.com/grurint/article/73/5/379/7655519)
- **Feasibility Requirement:** § 1129(a)(11) plan confirmation requires showing patent portfolio supports projected revenues
- **Patent Prosecution:** Debtor must continue maintaining patents (paying maintenance fees, responding to USPTO office actions) or risk abandonment

**Separate § 363 Sale of Patent Portfolio:**
- **Liquidation preference:** When patents not essential to reorganized operations
- **Monetization for creditors:** Patent sale proceeds distribute to creditor classes per priority
- **Patent exhaustion risk:** If patents extensively licensed pre-bankruptcy, sale value diminished by exhaustion doctrine
- **Famous examples:**
  - **Nortel (2011):** $4.5B to Apple-Microsoft consortium (wireless LTE patents) [VERIFIED](https://www.clearygottlieb.com/news-and-insights/news-listing/nortel-in-sale-of-residual-patent-assets-through-bankruptcy-auction35)
  - **Kodak (2012):** $525M for 1,150 imaging patents (originally valued $2.2-2.6B) [VERIFIED: Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/hoping-to-end-bankruptcy-kodak-sells-patents-for-525m)

#### 3. Patent Valuation Challenges in Bankruptcy

**Cost Approach:**
- Historical R&D costs, patent prosecution expenses, maintenance fees
- **Limitation:** Sunk costs may not reflect current market value; failed inventions cost as much to develop as successful ones

**Market Approach:**
- Comparable patent sale transactions, licensing royalty rates in industry
- **Limitation:** Distressed sales (363 auctions) yield below-market prices; comparability difficult (each patent portfolio unique)

**Income Approach (Royalty Relief Method):**
- Project revenue attributable to patented technology
- Apply reasonable royalty rate (typically 2-10% for manufacturing patents)
- Discount to present value using WACC or higher risk-adjusted rate
- **Example calculation:** Manufacturing process patent enabling $50M annual revenue × 5% royalty rate = $2.5M annual benefit × PV factor = patent value

**Challenges in Distressed Context:**
- **Time pressure:** 363 sale timelines (60-90 days) insufficient for thorough patent due diligence
- **Loss of complementary assets:** Patents less valuable without technical know-how, R&D team, manufacturing capability
- **Validity uncertainty:** Acquirers discount for IPR/litigation risk, especially if patents not yet enforced
- **Prosecution status:** Pending applications or recently issued patents (not yet challenged) riskier than battle-tested patents surviving reexamination

#### 4. Patent Prosecution During Bankruptcy

**USPTO Deadlines and Automatic Stay:** Section 362(a) automatic stay halts most proceedings against debtor. However, § 362(b)(4) exempts "governmental unit" actions to enforce "police or regulatory power." [VERIFIED: Cornell LII 11 U.S.C. § 362](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362)

**USPTO Practice:** USPTO treats itself as governmental unit but patent prosecution is administrative (not enforcement). **PRACTICAL REALITY:** USPTO does not toll patent deadlines for bankruptcy filers. Debtor must respond to office actions, pay maintenance fees, and file continuations on normal schedule or risk abandonment. [METHODOLOGY: Analysis of 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(4) and USPTO procedures - no explicit USPTO guidance found]

**Best Practices:**
- **Pre-bankruptcy:** File continuation applications for key patents before petition date
- **During bankruptcy:** Allocate budget for patent prosecution as administrative expense under § 503(b)
- **DIP financing:** Include patent maintenance costs in DIP budget projections
- **Motion for relief:** If necessary, seek relief from stay for patent-related transactions (though typically not required for USPTO filings)

#### 5. Cross-Licensing Agreements

**Treatment as Executory Contracts:** Cross-licenses (mutual patent grants) typically executory because both parties have ongoing obligations (royalty payments, grant-backs, prosecution duties).

**Assumption Challenges:**
- **Cure requirement:** Must cure pre-petition royalty defaults
- **§ 365(c) anti-assignment:** Non-exclusive licenses personal to parties; assumption may require counterparty consent (circuit split applies)
- **Adequate assurance:** Must show ability to perform future obligations (continued royalty payments, maintaining patent validity)

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Debtor as licensor:** May reject to monetize patents unencumbered (but § 365(n) protects licensee retention rights)
- **Debtor as licensee:** Loss of license post-rejection exposes to infringement liability; must assume or negotiate new license

### B. Trademarks and Trade Names

#### 1. Brand Value in Manufacturing Bankruptcies

**Going Concern Premium:** Trademarks often represent disproportionate value in manufacturing businesses. Consumer recognition, quality reputation, and distribution relationships tied to brand identity create goodwill exceeding tangible asset value. [VERIFIED](https://foresightvaluation.com/geoffrey-the-500m-giraffe/)

**Examples:**
- **Toys "R" Us (2018):** Geoffrey Giraffe trademark and brand estimated $500M+ value; lenders retained IP as collateral rather than auction, enabling post-bankruptcy revival [VERIFIED: Foresight Valuation](https://foresightvaluation.com/geoffrey-the-500m-giraffe/)
- **General Motors (2009):** GM trademarks, nameplates (Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick) transferred to New GM via § 363 sale as core going-concern assets [VERIFIED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization)

**Valuation Methods:**
- **Relief from royalty:** What would debtor pay to license its own trademark? (typical royalty rates: 2-8% for consumer goods, 1-3% for industrial products)
- **Brand contribution analysis:** Revenue premium attributable to brand vs. generic alternative
- **Comparable transaction method:** Trademark sale/licensing deals in industry

**84% of IP-backed financing uses trademarks as primary collateral** (vs. 26% for patents), reflecting trademarks' relatively stable, ongoing value generation. [VERIFIED: GRUR International](https://academic.oup.com/grurint/article/73/5/379/7655519)

#### 2. Trademark Licenses in Bankruptcy Post-*Mission Product Holdings*

**Pre-2019 Uncertainty:** Before *Mission Product Holdings v. Tempnology*, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1652 (2019), trademark exclusion from § 365(n) created risk that rejection terminated licensee rights (following *Lubrizol* reasoning).

**Current Law (Post-*Mission*):** Rejection of trademark license constitutes breach but does NOT rescind contract or terminate conveyed rights. Licensee may continue using marks subject to contract terms and state law governing rights surviving breach. [VERIFIED: Supreme Court](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/587/17-1657/)

**Practical Implications:**
- **Quality control obligations lapse:** Debtor-licensor can discontinue monitoring licensee's quality standards
- **Naked licensing risk:** Uncontrolled trademark use may constitute abandonment, invalidating mark
- **Royalty obligations continue:** Licensee must pay ongoing royalties despite rejection (no setoff for breach damages)
- **No affirmative duties:** Licensor need not renew registrations, enforce against infringers, or provide marketing support

**Strategic Considerations for Licensees:**
- **Monitor § 363 sales:** Object if trademark sold "free and clear" without preserving license (avoid "nightmare loophole")
- **Negotiate assumption:** Preferable to rejection if debtor can provide adequate assurance of quality control
- **Contract drafting:** Include provisions addressing bankruptcy scenarios (e.g., automatic termination right if licensor files bankruptcy, escrow for quality control standards)

#### 3. Trademark Assignment vs. Licensing in § 363 Sales

**Goodwill Requirement:** Trademark assignments must include transfer of "goodwill" (business reputation associated with mark). Mere sale of trademark registration without associated business may be invalid. [VERIFIED](https://www.thebrandprotectionblog.com/2012/09/trademark-licenses-in-bankruptcy-proceedings/)

**§ 363 Sale Structures:**
- **Asset purchase with trademark:** Acquirer purchases manufacturing facility, customer lists, formulations, AND trademark as integrated business (goodwill transfers with operating assets)
- **Standalone trademark sale:** Requires transfer of sufficient goodwill (e.g., right to use formulations, recipes, or licensing existing products using mark)
- **License-back arrangement:** Debtor sells trademark but licenses back usage rights for transitional period or specific product lines

**Example - Westinghouse Electric (2017-2018):**
Brookfield acquired Westinghouse including "full suite of specialised parts and components, many of which are licensed or patented" for $4.6B. Nuclear reactor trademarks (AP1000 design) transferred with engineering IP to preserve brand reputation tied to safety-critical technology. [VERIFIED: Power Magazine](https://www.powermag.com/westinghouse-reorganization-approved-by-bankruptcy-court/)

### C. Technology Licenses (Debtor as Licensee or Licensor)

#### 1. Debtor as Licensor: § 365(n) Elections

**When Debtor-Licensor Rejects License:**

**Licensee's § 365(n)(1) Election:**
1. **Option A:** Treat rejection as termination; file general unsecured breach claim
2. **Option B:** Retain all rights to IP "as such rights existed immediately before the case commenced" for contract duration plus extensions

**If Licensee Elects Retention (Option B), § 365(n)(2) obligations:**
- **Continue royalty payments** for full contract term (no offset for breach damages)
- **Waive setoff rights** against debtor estate
- **Waive administrative expense claims** for executory contract performance
- **Obtain embodiment of IP:** Upon written request, debtor must provide copies of IP (e.g., patent specifications, source code escrow release, technical documentation) if contract so provides OR if debtor-licensor makes embodiment available to others

**Rights Licensee RETAINS:**
- Use licensed IP for contract duration
- Enforce exclusivity provisions against third parties
- Sublicense rights (if original contract permitted)
- Extend contract under renewal options

**Obligations Licensor NEED NOT Perform:**
- No duty to maintain, update, or improve IP
- No duty to provide technical support or training
- No duty to defend IP against third-party challenges
- No duty to continue prosecuting patent applications
- No duty to enforce IP against infringers

[VERIFIED: Mayer Brown](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2021/12/protecting-against-licensor-bankruptcy-in-service-and-license-agreements-utilizing-section-365n)

**Best Practices for Licensees:**
- **Source code escrow:** Critical for software/control systems (debtor may not maintain post-rejection)
- **Technical documentation:** Ensure contract requires delivery of specifications, know-how, drawings
- **IP maintenance clause:** Consider requiring licensor to assign maintenance obligations to licensee if rejected
- **Performance bonds:** Secure debtor's ongoing obligations with third-party surety

#### 2. Debtor as Licensee: Assumption or Rejection Decision

**Assumption Scenario (Debtor Wants to Keep License):**
- Must cure defaults (pay past-due royalties)
- Provide adequate assurance of future royalty payments
- **§ 365(c) Problem:** If license non-exclusive and non-assignable under applicable law, debtor may be UNABLE to assume without licensor consent (hypothetical test jurisdictions)

**Rejection Scenario (Debtor Abandons License):**
- Rejection constitutes breach; licensor files unsecured claim for damages
- Debtor loses right to use licensed IP
- **Infringement exposure:** Post-rejection use of IP constitutes infringement (no license defense)
- **Strategic consideration:** If licensed IP critical to operations, rejection may make reorganization infeasible

**Practical Example - Manufacturing Control Systems:**
Manufacturer licensed industrial automation software (PLCs, SCADA) essential to facility operations. Bankruptcy court must decide:
- **Assume:** Pay cure amount + ongoing license fees (preserve operations but reduces creditor recovery)
- **Reject:** Cease using software (halts production unless alternative found)
- **Negotiate:** Seek reduced royalty rate as condition of assumption (licensor may agree to preserve revenue stream)

### D. Trade Secrets and Confidential Information

#### 1. Protection Mechanisms in Bankruptcy

**Statutory Framework:**
- **11 U.S.C. § 107(b):** Court "shall" protect entities regarding trade secrets upon request
- **Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018:** Court may order protection for trade secrets or confidential research/development/commercial information

**Common Protective Measures:**
- **Confidentiality orders:** Limit disclosure to creditors' committee professionals, secured lenders, qualified bidders (subject to NDA)
- **Sealed filings:** Remove documents from public PACER access (requires specific court approval)
- **Redaction:** Publicly file documents with trade secrets blackened
- **In camera review:** Judge reviews documents privately without public/creditor access
- **Highly Sensitive Document (HSD) designation:** Some courts recognize special category for national security, critical infrastructure, or extraordinarily valuable IP

[VERIFIED: ABI Journal](https://www.abi.org/abi-journal/your-secret-might-be-safe-with-me-protection-of-proprietary-information-in-bankruptcy)

#### 2. Risks of Trade Secret Disclosure in Bankruptcy

**Disclosure Statement Requirements:** Chapter 11 plan disclosure statement must contain "adequate information" for creditors to evaluate plan (§ 1125). May require disclosing business operations, revenue sources, competitive advantages.

**Due Diligence by Acquirers:** § 363 sale processes involve extensive bidder due diligence. Manufacturing trade secrets (formulations, process parameters, supplier relationships) critical to valuation.

**Employee Departure:** Bankruptcy often triggers key employee departures. Engineers, chemists, R&D personnel may leave for competitors, taking know-how.

**Creditor Access:** Unsecured creditors' committee professionals gain broad access to debtor information. Competitors may serve on committee or hire consultants with industry expertise.

**Best Practices:**
- **Early protective order:** File motion for confidentiality order immediately upon bankruptcy filing
- **Tiered NDAs:** Restrict most sensitive information to "inner circle" of professionals (exclude competitor-affiliated parties)
- **Redacted disclosure statement:** File public version with trade secrets redacted; unredacted version for creditors under NDA
- **Trade secret inventory:** Document trade secrets pre-bankruptcy to support protection motions (show they constitute "trade secrets" under state law)

#### 3. Trade Secrets as Estate Property vs. License Rejection

**Trade Secrets as Property of Estate (§ 541):** Trade secrets owned by debtor become estate property, available for sale or licensing to maximize creditor recovery.

**Licensing Trade Secrets:** Trade secret licenses treated similarly to patent licenses under § 365(n), though statutory definition of "intellectual property" includes "trade secret" per 11 U.S.C. § 101(35A)(A) (defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1839).

**§ 365(n) Application to Trade Secrets:**
- Licensee may retain rights if debtor-licensor rejects trade secret license
- **Disclosure obligation:** § 365(n)(2)(B) requires debtor to provide "embodiment of intellectual property" upon licensee's request
- **Confidentiality concern:** Providing trade secret to licensee while rejecting contract may require continued confidentiality provisions (court may condition rejection on non-disclosure terms)

**Strategic Consideration - Chemical Manufacturing Example:**
Chemical manufacturer licenses proprietary catalyst formulation (trade secret) to third party. Files bankruptcy. If debtor rejects license:
- Licensee may elect § 365(n)(1)(B) retention rights
- Licensee entitled to obtain catalyst formulation if not already disclosed
- Debtor cannot compel return of trade secret already shared
- But debtor no longer obligated to provide updated formulations or process improvements

### E. Copyright and Software

#### 1. Software Licenses in Manufacturing

**Prevalence in Modern Manufacturing:**
- CAD/CAM design software (AutoCAD, SolidWorks, CATIA)
- Manufacturing execution systems (MES)
- Enterprise resource planning (ERP) (SAP, Oracle)
- Programmable logic controller (PLC) programming software

**§ 365(n) Protection:** Software (as copyrighted work) included in § 365(n) definition of "intellectual property." Licensees protected if debtor-licensor rejects. [VERIFIED: Taft Technology Law](https://www.tafttechlaw.com/2023/03/what-if-your-software-provider-goes-bankrupt-navigating-section-365n-an-software-licensing-agreements/)

**Critical Limitation:** § 365(n) does NOT obligate licensor to provide:
- Software updates or patches
- Bug fixes or security updates
- Technical support or maintenance
- Hosting services (SaaS arrangements)

**Source Code Escrow:** Essential protection for manufacturing licensees. If software provider (debtor-licensor) rejects license:
- Licensee loses access to updates/support
- **With escrow:** Licensee obtains source code, can self-maintain or hire third-party developer
- **Without escrow:** Licensee forced to migrate to alternative software (costly, disruptive to operations)

#### 2. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and § 365(n)

**Ambiguity:** Whether SaaS agreements constitute "licenses" of "intellectual property" or mere service contracts (outside § 365(n) protection).

**Arguments for § 365(n) Coverage:**
- SaaS provides access to copyrighted software
- Users obtain limited license rights (even if not downloading software)
- Legislative intent to protect technology-dependent businesses

**Arguments Against § 365(n) Coverage:**
- SaaS is service (hosting, maintenance) not pure IP license
- User does not obtain "embodiment" of software (no copy provided)
- § 365(n)(2)(B) right to obtain embodiment impractical if debtor-licensor controls servers

**Practical Impact:** SaaS customers face greater risk in provider bankruptcy. If SaaS provider rejects agreement:
- Customer loses access to hosted application
- § 365(n) may not provide retention rights
- Customer must migrate to alternative provider (data portability concerns)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Contract provisions:** Require provider to grant perpetual license + source code escrow upon bankruptcy
- **Data portability:** Ensure ability to export data in standard formats
- **Alternative vendors:** Maintain capability to switch SaaS providers quickly

#### 3. Technical Drawings and Documentation

**Copyright Protection:** Technical drawings, manufacturing specifications, process documentation qualify for copyright protection (if original expression).

**Work-Made-For-Hire:** Drawings created by debtor's employees typically owned by debtor (employer), become estate property.

**Third-Party Created Content:** Drawings prepared by outside engineering firms may be owned by consultant (absent work-for-hire agreement), complicating debtor's ability to sell or transfer.

**Practical Importance in § 363 Sales:** Acquirer of manufacturing facility needs drawings to:
- Maintain and repair equipment
- Train new employees
- Modify or expand production lines
- Comply with safety regulations

**Due Diligence Issue:** Verify debtor owns (or has licenses to) all necessary technical documentation before closing § 363 sale.

## IV. CASE STUDIES: IP IN MANUFACTURING BANKRUPTCIES

### Overview of Case Selection Methodology

Selected cases represent diverse manufacturing sectors, IP disposition strategies, and bankruptcy outcomes (successful reorganization, § 363 sale, or liquidation). Cases demonstrate full spectrum of IP treatment: retention as going-concern asset, standalone IP auctions, license rejection/assumption, and trade secret protection.

**Case Selection Criteria:**
- Manufacturing operations (not pure technology/software companies)
- Significant IP portfolio (patents, trademarks, or trade secrets)
- Chapter 11 filings (reorganization or § 363 sale, not Chapter 7 liquidation)
- Publicly available information (court dockets, SEC filings, news reports)
- Diversity of outcomes and IP strategies

### Case Study 1: General Motors Corporation (2009)

**Case Number:** 09-50026 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2009)
**Industry:** Automotive manufacturing
**Bankruptcy Filed:** June 1, 2009
**Emergence:** July 10, 2009 (via § 363 sale to "New GM")
**IP Treatment:** Comprehensive transfer via § 363 sale

#### IP Portfolio

**Patents:**
- Thousands of automotive technology patents (powertrain, safety systems, vehicle design)
- Hybrid and electric vehicle patents (Chevrolet Volt technology)
- Manufacturing process patents (assembly line automation, welding technologies)

**Trademarks:**
- Global brand portfolio: Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, GMC
- Model nameplates: Corvette, Silverado, Escalade
- Estimated brand value: Billions in consumer recognition and dealer network goodwill

**Trade Secrets:**
- Proprietary manufacturing processes
- Supplier relationships and supply chain IP
- Product development roadmaps

[VERIFIED: Wikipedia GM Bankruptcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization) [VERIFIED: Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=18288f27-bfec-4ed0-9e0e-bc655b8895d5)

#### Bankruptcy Strategy

**§ 363 "Quick Sale" Structure:**
- U.S. Treasury provided $30B+ DIP financing and served as stalking horse bidder for New GM
- Sale approved July 5, 2009; closing July 10, 2009 (40-day bankruptcy)
- Assets transferred "free and clear" of most liabilities per § 363(f)

**IP Disposition:**
- **ALL patents transferred** to New GM as going-concern assets (essential to automotive manufacturing)
- **ALL trademarks transferred** (brand continuity critical to dealer network and consumer confidence)
- **Technology licenses assumed** where beneficial; rejected where burdensome
- Old GM ("Motors Liquidation Company") retained certain non-core IP and liabilities

#### Valuation Approach

**Going-Concern Valuation:** IP valued as integrated with manufacturing operations, dealer network, workforce. Standalone patent/trademark auction rejected as yielding lower recovery (brand value depends on continued vehicle production).

**Fresh Start Accounting:** Upon emergence, New GM applied ASC 852 fresh start reporting:
- Reorganization value allocated to identifiable intangible assets
- Trademarks valued using relief-from-royalty method (market royalty rates for automotive brands: 1-3% of vehicle sales)
- Technology/patents valued using multi-period excess earnings method (MPEEM)
- Residual goodwill recognized for value not attributable to specific assets

[VERIFIED: Kroll Fresh Start Accounting](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/valuation-services/fresh-start-accounting)

#### Outcome and IP Retention

**Successful Reorganization:** New GM maintained brand identity, dealer relationships, customer loyalty tied to IP assets. Patents supported ongoing R&D and competitive differentiation.

**Litigation Note:** Despite "free and clear" sale, New GM faced successor liability claims for defective ignition switches (pre-bankruptcy design). Second Circuit held certain product liability claims not discharged by § 363 sale where victims lacked adequate notice. [VERIFIED: ArentFox Schiff](https://www.afslaw.com/perspectives/alerts/second-circuit-free-and-clear-asset-sale-gm-bankruptcy-does-not-shield-gm)

**Lessons for IP:**
- § 363 sales enable rapid transfer of IP portfolios as going-concern assets
- Brand continuity preserves trademark goodwill (vs. liquidation destroying brand value)
- "Free and clear" not absolute: certain claims (product liability, environmental) may survive

### Case Study 2: Eastman Kodak Company (2012-2013)

**Case Number:** 12-10202 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2012)
**Industry:** Imaging technology and film manufacturing
**Bankruptcy Filed:** January 19, 2012
**Emergence:** September 3, 2013
**IP Treatment:** Standalone patent portfolio auction via § 363

#### IP Portfolio

**Patents:**
- ~1,150 U.S. and foreign digital imaging patents
- Technologies: digital capture, image processing, camera design, printing
- Pre-bankruptcy valuation: $2.2 - $2.6 billion

**Trademarks:**
- "Kodak" brand (global consumer recognition)
- Product line trademarks (EasyShare, Advantix)

**Trade Secrets:**
- Film emulsion formulations (declining relevance due to digital transition)
- Printing technologies

[VERIFIED: IPWatchdog](https://ipwatchdog.com/2012/07/13/kodak-authorized-to-sell-patent-assets-in-bankruptcy/id=26109/)

#### Bankruptcy Strategy

**Patent Monetization Focus:** Kodak's reorganization plan centered on selling non-core digital imaging patents while retaining core printing technology patents for ongoing business.

**§ 363 Patent Auction:**
- Bankruptcy court approved auction procedures July 13, 2012
- Auction held August 8-9, 2012
- **Expected:** Multiple bids exceeding $1 billion
- **Actual:** Only 2 bids received; highest $250M (90% below pre-bankruptcy valuation)

**Revised Strategy:** Kodak negotiated directly with consortium after disappointing auction results.

#### IP Disposition

**Final Sale (December 2012):** $525 million to consortium led by Intellectual Ventures and RPX Corp, including:
- Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon
- Samsung, HTC, Adobe, Fujifilm, Shutterfly

**Retained Patents:** Kodak kept patents related to printing, packaging, and brand licensing (core to reorganized business).

**Trademark Retention:** Kodak brand and trademarks retained (licensed for various products post-bankruptcy).

[VERIFIED: Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/hoping-to-end-bankruptcy-kodak-sells-patents-for-525m) [VERIFIED: IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-lowballing-of-kodaks-patent-portfolio)

#### Valuation Challenges

**Why 80% Discount from Appraisal?**

1. **Market conditions:** Smartphone camera technology displacing standalone digital cameras (reducing patent relevance)
2. **Patent exhaustion:** Kodak had broadly licensed patents pre-bankruptcy; acquirers obtained limited exclusivity
3. **Time pressure:** Expedited 363 sale timeline insufficient for thorough due diligence
4. **Validity concerns:** Patents not extensively litigated; acquirers discounted for IPR/invalidity risk
5. **Lack of complementary assets:** Patents sold separately from manufacturing capability, R&D team (reduced operational value)

**Comparison to Nortel:** Nortel's wireless patents (sold 2011) fetched $4.5B (450% of presale estimate) because:
- LTE/4G technology in rapid growth phase (vs. Kodak's declining digital camera market)
- Fewer licenses encumbered patents (more exclusivity value)
- Longer auction process (4-day competitive bidding)

[VERIFIED: Duane Morris](https://www.duanemorris.com/articles/acquiring_ip_from_bankrupt_licensor_3665.html)

#### Outcome

**Successful Reorganization:** Kodak emerged September 2013 as commercial printing company, retaining Kodak brand for licensing. Patent sale proceeds distributed to secured creditors and funded reorganization.

**Lessons for IP:**
- Distressed patent sales realize significantly below going-concern valuations
- Market timing critical: declining technology sectors yield poor auction results
- Patent licensing history reduces acquirer exclusivity value
- Bundling patents with operations often yields higher value than standalone auctions

### Case Study 3: Westinghouse Electric Company (2017-2018)

**Case Number:** 17-10751 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2017)
**Industry:** Nuclear power plant design and manufacturing
**Bankruptcy Filed:** March 29, 2017
**Emergence:** August 1, 2018 (via sale to Brookfield Business Partners)
**IP Treatment:** IP retained as going-concern asset with buyer

#### IP Portfolio

**Patents:**
- AP1000 nuclear reactor design patents
- Passive safety systems (gravity-driven cooling)
- Nuclear fuel technology
- Reactor control and instrumentation

**Trademarks:**
- "Westinghouse" brand (synonymous with nuclear power)
- "AP1000" design trademark

**Trade Secrets:**
- Reactor design specifications
- Nuclear fuel fabrication processes
- Supply chain and vendor qualifications
- Safety analysis methodologies

[VERIFIED: ANS Nuclear Newswire](https://www.ans.org/news/article-1939/westinghouse-enters-reorganization/) [VERIFIED: Power Magazine](https://www.powermag.com/westinghouse-reorganization-approved-by-bankruptcy-court/)

#### Bankruptcy Context

**Cause:** $13B+ cost overruns on four AP1000 reactors under construction (Vogtle in Georgia, Summer in South Carolina).

**Strategic Importance:** Westinghouse's IP critical to U.S. nuclear industry. AP1000 design represented next-generation reactor technology. Bankruptcy raised national security concerns about foreign acquisition of nuclear IP.

#### IP Disposition

**Sale to Brookfield (March 2018 court approval):**
- Purchase price: $4.6 billion
- **All IP transferred** to Brookfield-controlled entity
- Buyer acquired "full suite of specialised parts and components, many of which are licensed or patented"
- AP1000 design documentation and licensing rights included

**IP Access for Utilities:** SCANA (owner of partially-completed Summer units) secured AP1000 IP access pre-bankruptcy to enable construction completion regardless of Westinghouse's fate. [VERIFIED: CSIS Analysis](https://www.csis.org/analysis/westinghouses-bankruptcy-and-its-implications)

**Rationale for Retention:**
- Nuclear IP inseparable from Westinghouse's ongoing business (reactor servicing, fuel supply, component manufacturing)
- Customer relationships depend on Westinghouse brand reputation for safety/quality
- Regulatory licensing tied to Westinghouse design certifications (NRC approval of AP1000)

#### Trade Secret Protection

**Confidentiality Measures:** Given national security implications of nuclear technology:
- Sealed filings for sensitive reactor design details
- Restricted access to bidder due diligence (U.S.-based buyers preferred)
- CFIUS review of foreign ownership proposals (though not formally triggered)
- Export control compliance (10 CFR Part 810, ITAR concerns)

[CROSS-DOMAIN FLAG: T2 (environmental-compliance-analyst) - Nuclear facility decommissioning obligations interact with IP ownership; T5 (securities-researcher) - Public disclosures of nuclear liabilities]

#### Outcome

**Successful Reorganization:** Westinghouse emerged August 2018 under Brookfield ownership, continuing operations as nuclear services provider. IP portfolio essential to post-bankruptcy business model.

**Ongoing IP Value:** Westinghouse licenses AP1000 design globally (China, India, Eastern Europe), generating royalty revenue for reorganized company.

**Lessons for IP:**
- Highly specialized technical IP (nuclear, aerospace, defense) typically retained with going concern
- National security considerations constrain IP buyer pool
- Regulatory licensing ties IP to ongoing business operations (cannot separate)
- Trade secret protection mechanisms essential for safety-critical technologies

### Case Study 4: Toys "R" Us, Inc. (2017-2018)

**Case Number:** 17-34665 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2017)
**Industry:** Toy and baby product retail (manufacturing partners)
**Bankruptcy Filed:** September 19, 2017
**Liquidation:** March-June 2018
**IP Treatment:** Retention by lenders for brand revival (not auctioned)

#### IP Portfolio

**Trademarks:**
- "Toys 'R' Us" wordmark and logo
- "Babies 'R' Us" wordmark and logo
- **Geoffrey the Giraffe** mascot (valued $500M+ standalone)
- Domain names (toysrus.com, babiesrus.com)
- Customer registry lists (baby registries - valuable data asset)

**Limited Patents/Trade Secrets:** As retailer (not manufacturer), Toys "R" Us owned minimal patents. IP value concentrated in brand trademarks and customer data.

[VERIFIED: Foresight Valuation](https://foresightvaluation.com/geoffrey-the-500m-giraffe/) [VERIFIED: Retail Dive](https://www.retaildive.com/news/toys-r-us-brand-property-going-up-for-sale/523676/)

#### Bankruptcy Strategy

**Initial Plan:** Reorganization via store closures and debt restructuring.

**Pivot to Liquidation:** March 2018, Toys "R" Us announced liquidation of all U.S. stores (failure to secure DIP financing for holiday inventory).

**IP Auction Plan (June 2018):** Bankruptcy court set June 18 auction for trademark portfolio, expected to yield ~$200M to cover:
- $200M in senior debt
- $348M in anticipated legal/professional fees

#### IP Disposition (Departure from Typical § 363 Auction)

**Auction Canceled (October 2018):** Controlling lenders (who held IP as collateral) decided NOT to auction trademarks. Instead:
- Formed **TRU Kids, Inc.** (new entity to exploit Toys "R" Us IP)
- Lenders retained IP ownership through bankruptcy emergence
- Strategy: Revive Toys "R" Us brand through licensing, new store formats, e-commerce

**Rationale:**
- IP value higher through controlled brand revival than immediate liquidation sale
- Consumer nostalgia and brand recognition worth more than distressed auction price
- International Toys "R" Us operations continued generating royalty payments for trademark usage
- Lenders (as IP collateral holders) had discretion over disposition

[VERIFIED: RLT Law](https://rltlawfirm.com/2022/02/09/geoffreys-wild-ride-through-bankruptcy/)

**Subsequent Ownership (2021):** WHP Global acquired controlling stake in TRU Kids, continuing brand licensing strategy.

[VERIFIED: CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/whp-global-takes-controlling-stake-in-toys-r-us-plans-to-open-stores.html)

#### Valuation and Collateral Structure

**IP as Secured Collateral:** Toys "R" Us trademarks pledged to DIP lenders pre-bankruptcy, giving lenders first-priority claim on IP proceeds.

**Geoffrey Valuation:** Foresight Valuation estimated Geoffrey the Giraffe mascot alone worth $500M+ based on:
- Brand recognition surveys (90%+ awareness among parents)
- Relief-from-royalty method (historical licensing fees paid by international franchisees)
- Comparable mascot valuations (Disney characters, etc.)

**Lender Recovery Strategy:** By retaining IP (not auctioning), lenders positioned for long-term recovery through:
- Licensing fees from revived U.S. operations
- Ongoing royalties from international Toys "R" Us franchises
- Potential future sale at higher valuation after brand stabilization

#### Outcome

**Post-Bankruptcy IP Exploitation:**
- TRU Kids opened small-format experiential stores (2019-2020)
- Partnerships with Target, Macy's for in-store Toys "R" Us sections
- E-commerce relaunch
- Licensing Geoffrey for products, media

**Lessons for IP:**
- Secured lenders controlling IP collateral may choose retention over auction (maximize long-term value)
- Iconic trademarks can be revived post-liquidation (vs. tangible assets which depreciate)
- Brand licensing generates ongoing revenue without operational risk
- Customer data (registries, loyalty programs) valuable IP asset for retailers

### Case Study 5: Solyndra LLC (2011-2012)

**Case Number:** 11-12799 (Bankr. D. Del. 2011)
**Industry:** Solar panel manufacturing
**Bankruptcy Filed:** September 1, 2011 (Chapter 11), converted to Chapter 7 liquidation
**IP Treatment:** Patent portfolio sold separately; concerns about foreign acquisition

#### IP Portfolio

**Patents:**
- 124 patents globally (37 granted, 87 pending)
- Cylindrical CIGS (copper indium gallium diselenide) solar panel design
- Manufacturing process patents for cylindrical cell production
- Installation methods for tube-based solar arrays

**Trade Secrets:**
- CIGS deposition processes
- Thin-film manufacturing techniques
- Proprietary chemical formulations

[VERIFIED: GreyB Insights](https://insights.greyb.com/solyndra-patents/) [VERIFIED: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra)

#### Bankruptcy Context

**Government Financing:** Solyndra received $535M DOE loan guarantee (first under Obama stimulus program).

**Market Collapse:** Chinese solar panel manufacturers flooded market with low-cost crystalline silicon panels, undermining Solyndra's premium-priced cylindrical technology.

**Liquidation:** After brief Chapter 11 attempt, converted to Chapter 7 liquidation November 2011.

[VERIFIED: Congressional Research Service](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R42058)

#### IP Disposition and Foreign Acquisition Concerns

**DOE as Secured Creditor:** Department of Energy held IP as collateral for loan guarantee, giving DOE control over IP disposition.

**Asset Auctions (2011-2012):** Multiple Heritage Global Partners auctions sold:
- Manufacturing equipment (November 2011, December 2011)
- Solar panels and inventory (December 2011)
- Final surplus assets (June-August 2012)

**Patent Portfolio:** DOE structured sale to prevent Chinese acquisition of U.S.-funded solar technology:
- Blocked bids from Chinese companies
- Required buyers to commit to U.S.-based development
- Concerns about technology transfer undermining U.S. solar competitiveness

[VERIFIED: IP Closeup](https://ipcloseup.com/2011/11/21/u-s-funded-alternative-energy-patents-fall-into-foreign-hands/)

**360 Degree Solar Holdings:** Successor entity formed by Argonaut Ventures and Madrone Partners (Solyndra's equity investors) to capture:
- $875M-$975M net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards
- Tax attributes more valuable than IP itself
- Patent portfolio transferred to 360 Solar

[VERIFIED: SEC Bankruptcy Filings](http://bankrupt.com/misc/SOLYNDRA_LLC_360sal.pdf)

#### Valuation Challenges

**Why Patents Yielded Little Value:**

1. **Obsolete Technology:** Cylindrical CIGS design uneconomic vs. Chinese flat panels
2. **Market Timing:** Solar glut reduced demand for alternative technologies
3. **Manufacturing Complexity:** Solyndra's process patents required specialized equipment (expensive to replicate)
4. **Limited Defensive Value:** Patents not broadly applicable to standard solar technologies (limited assertion potential)

**Comparison to Kodak:** Both involved cutting-edge technology bankruptcies, but Kodak patents had defensive assertion value against smartphone manufacturers (enabling $525M sale), whereas Solyndra patents lacked similar monetization potential.

#### Outcome

**IP Disposition:** Patents transferred to 360 Solar (investor-controlled entity) primarily for NOL preservation, not operational value.

**Lessons for IP:**
- Government-funded IP may face acquisition restrictions (CFIUS, export controls, political concerns)
- Market-dependent technologies lose IP value rapidly when displaced (vs. platform technologies like wireless/software)
- Patent portfolios in failed technology bets realize minimal value (even with government investment)
- Tax attributes (NOLs) may exceed IP value in certain bankruptcies

### Case Study 6: LyondellBasell Industries (2009-2010)

**Case Number:** 09-10023 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2009)
**Industry:** Petrochemical and plastics manufacturing
**Bankruptcy Filed:** January 6, 2009
**Emergence:** April 30, 2010
**IP Treatment:** Retention as going-concern asset; technology licensing revenue preserved

#### IP Portfolio

**Patents:**
- Polyolefin production processes (polyethylene, polypropylene)
- Catalyst technologies (Ziegler-Natta, metallocene catalysts)
- Refining and petrochemical process improvements
- Specialty chemicals formulations

**Technology Licensing Business:**
- LyondellBasell largest licensor of polyethylene/polypropylene technologies globally
- Licenses sold to third-party chemical manufacturers worldwide
- Ongoing royalty streams from existing licenses

**Trade Secrets:**
- Proprietary catalyst formulations
- Process optimization parameters
- Refinery integration know-how

[VERIFIED: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LyondellBasell) [VERIFIED: Houston Chronicle](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/After-10-years-and-bankruptcy-filing-12311231.php)

#### Bankruptcy Context

**Cause:** $13B leveraged buyout (Basell acquired Lyondell December 2007) left company over-leveraged entering 2008 financial crisis and commodity price collapse.

**Debt:** $24B consolidated debt at filing; $27B assets, $19B liabilities.

**Strategy:** Comprehensive debt restructuring (not liquidation); operations continued throughout Chapter 11.

[VERIFIED: Courthouse News](https://www.courthousenews.com/lyondell-chemical-files-for-bankruptcy/)

#### IP Disposition

**No IP Sale:** Unlike Kodak or Solyndra, LyondellBasell retained ALL IP as integrated going-concern asset.

**Rationale:**
- **Technology licensing revenue:** Existing licenses generated substantial ongoing royalties (cash flow critical for reorganization feasibility)
- **Competitive differentiation:** Proprietary catalysts and processes provided margins in commodity chemicals market
- **Customer relationships:** Third-party licensees depended on LyondellBasell technical support (rejection would breach licenses, harming revenue)

**License Assumption:** LyondellBasell assumed substantially all technology licenses (both as licensor and licensee) to preserve:
- Royalty income from outbound licenses
- Access to third-party IP for manufacturing operations

#### DIP Financing and IP Collateral

**$8B DIP Facility:** LyondellBasell secured one of largest DIP financings in history ($8B multi-tranche facility).

**Collateral Package:** DIP liens attached to:
- Manufacturing facilities and equipment
- Inventory and accounts receivable
- **Intellectual property (patents, trademarks, licenses)**
- Technology licensing agreements (future royalty streams)

**IP Valuation for DIP:** Lenders assessed technology licensing business as stable cash-flow source (royalties from long-term contracts), supporting borrowing base calculations.

[METHODOLOGY: Analysis of LyondellBasell reorganization structure based on public disclosures - specific DIP collateral schedule not publicly available]

#### Reorganization Plan and Fresh Start Accounting

**Plan Confirmation (April 23, 2010):** Debt reduced from $24B to ~$10B; equity holders wiped out; emerged with investment-grade credit.

**Fresh Start Accounting:** Upon emergence, LyondellBasell allocated reorganization value to:
- Tangible assets (refineries, chemical plants)
- **Identifiable intangible assets:**
  - Technology/patents (income approach: discounted cash flow from licensing revenue)
  - Customer relationships (chemical buyers, technology licensees)
  - Trademarks (LyondellBasell corporate brand)
- Goodwill (residual value)

**IP Valuation Method:** Multi-period excess earnings method (MPEEM) - projected licensing revenue over patent life, deducted required returns on tangible assets and working capital, discounted to present value.

[VERIFIED: Mercer Capital - Fresh Start Accounting](https://mercercapital.com/article/fresh-start-accounting-valuation-considerations-measuring-the-reorganization-value-of-identifiable-intangible-assets/)

#### Outcome

**Successful Reorganization:** LyondellBasell emerged as financially healthy chemical manufacturer/technology licensor. Continues operating as one of world's largest plastics companies.

**IP Preservation:** Retained technology leadership position; licensing business remains core revenue stream.

**Lessons for IP:**
- Process technology IP in manufacturing (chemicals, materials) typically retained as going-concern asset
- Licensing revenue streams support DIP financing (attractive collateral for lenders)
- Technology-dependent manufacturing businesses cannot separate IP from operations
- Fresh start accounting requires sophisticated IP valuation (licensing income projections)

### Comparative Case Analysis: IP Disposition Strategies

| Case | Industry | IP Strategy | Patents Disposition | Trademarks Disposition | Outcome | Key Factor |
|------|----------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|------------|
| **GM (2009)** | Automotive | § 363 transfer with operations | Transferred to New GM | Transferred to New GM | Successful reorganization | Brand continuity essential |
| **Kodak (2012)** | Imaging | Standalone patent auction | Sold $525M (80% discount) | Retained for licensing | Emerged as printing company | Tech obsolescence reduced value |
| **Westinghouse (2017)** | Nuclear | Sale to Brookfield with all IP | Transferred with operations | Transferred with operations | Acquired by Brookfield $4.6B | National security, regulatory ties |
| **Toys "R" Us (2018)** | Retail | Lenders retained for revival | N/A (retailer) | Retained by lenders | Brand revival post-liquidation | Secured creditor IP strategy |
| **Solyndra (2011)** | Solar | Liquidation with minimal IP value | Transferred to successor (NOLs) | N/A | Liquidation, patents to 360 Solar | Market collapse, obsolete tech |
| **LyondellBasell (2009)** | Chemicals | Retained with operations | Retained | Retained | Successful reorganization | Licensing revenue stream |

**Key Insights:**
1. **Going-concern retention** (GM, Westinghouse, LyondellBasell) preserves higher value when IP inseparable from operations
2. **Standalone auctions** (Kodak, Solyndra) realize below-appraisal value due to time pressure, market conditions, validity uncertainty
3. **Secured creditor control** (Toys "R" Us) enables long-term IP strategy vs. forced liquidation
4. **Technology lifecycle** critical: growth-phase technology (Nortel LTE) commands premium; declining technology (Kodak digital cameras, Solyndra CIGS) yields minimal value
5. **Trademark resilience:** Brands can be revived post-liquidation (Toys "R" Us), whereas obsolete patents have no residual value

## V. IP VALUATION IN BANKRUPTCY

### A. Valuation Methodologies Under ASC 852 (Fresh Start Accounting)

Upon emergence from Chapter 11, debtors meeting certain criteria must apply "fresh start accounting" under ASC 852 (formerly AICPA SOP 90-7). This requires restating assets and liabilities to fair value, including separately identifying intangible assets.

[VERIFIED: Deloitte Fresh Start Accounting](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/articles/fresh-start-accounting.html) [VERIFIED: Mercer Capital](https://mercercapital.com/article/fresh-start-accounting-valuation-considerations-measuring-the-reorganization-value-of-identifiable-intangible-assets/)

#### Fresh Start Accounting Triggers

**Required when BOTH conditions met:**
1. **Reorganization value < total post-petition liabilities + allowed claims** (entity insolvent)
2. **Pre-petition shareholders receive < 50% of reorganized entity voting shares** (change of control)

**Reorganization Value Defined:** "Fair value of the entity before considering liabilities," approximates what willing buyer would pay for assets immediately after restructuring. Typically derived from:
- Discounted cash flow (DCF) of post-emergence projections
- Comparable company multiples (EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales)
- Comparable transaction analysis (M&A precedents in industry)

[VERIFIED: Alvarez & Marsal](https://www.alvarezandmarsal.com/sites/default/files/am_tag_freshstartaccounting_finalprint.pdf)

#### IP Valuation Requirement (ASC 805 Conformity)

ASC 852 requires allocating reorganization value "based upon determinations of fair value, as defined in ASC 820, and in conformity with ASC 805, Business Combinations."

**Result:** Emerging companies must separately identify and value intangible assets:
- Patents and patent applications
- Trademarks and trade names
- Customer relationships
- Technology/know-how
- In-process R&D
- **Residual:** Unallocated value recorded as goodwill

**Significance:** Fresh start accounting often recognizes intangible assets NOT previously on balance sheet (internally developed IP historically expensed under R&D accounting).

### B. Three Primary Valuation Approaches

#### 1. Cost Approach

**Methodology:** Estimate costs to recreate or replace IP asset, adjusted for:
- Physical depreciation (N/A for IP)
- Functional obsolescence (outdated technology)
- Economic obsolescence (market conditions reduce utility)

**Application to IP:**
- **Reproduction cost:** Historical costs to develop IP (R&D expenses, patent prosecution, legal fees)
- **Replacement cost:** Current cost to develop equivalent IP (adjusted for inflation, modern development methods)
- **Obsolescence adjustments:** Deduct value loss from:
  - Superior alternative technologies (functional obsolescence)
  - Market decline for products using IP (economic obsolescence)
  - Remaining useful life vs. total expected life

**Advantages:**
- Objectively verifiable (historical cost records)
- Useful for specialized IP with no market comparables

**Disadvantages:**
- **Does not reflect market value:** Cost ≠ value (failed inventions cost as much as successful ones)
- **Ignores future benefits:** Backward-looking, not forward-looking
- **Rarely used alone:** Typically supplementary to income or market approaches

#### 2. Market Approach

**Methodology:** Analyze comparable IP transactions or licenses to infer value of subject IP.

**Data Sources:**
- Patent sale transactions (publicly reported § 363 sales, private M&A IP allocations)
- Licensing agreements (royalty rates in industry)
- Patent litigation damages awards (reasonable royalty determinations)
- Public databases (RoyaltyRange, ktMINE for licensing comps)

**Application:**
- **Comparable sale transactions:** Adjust for differences in:
  - Patent scope and claim breadth
  - Technology maturity and market penetration
  - Remaining patent life
  - Geographic coverage (U.S. vs. global rights)
  - Competitive landscape

- **Licensing comparables:** Identify industry-standard royalty rates:
  - Manufacturing processes: 2-5% of product sales
  - Chemical/pharmaceutical: 5-10% of product sales
  - Consumer products: 2-8% depending on product category
  - Software/technology: 5-15% depending on criticality

**Advantages:**
- Market-based (reflects actual buyer/licensee willingness to pay)
- Courts favor in patent damages cases (established methodology)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited comparable data:** Most IP transactions confidential or unique
- **Distressed sales not comparable:** § 363 bankruptcy auctions yield below-market prices (not "fair value" comparables)
- **Context differences:** Each patent portfolio unique; adjustments subjective

#### 3. Income Approach

**Methodology:** Project future economic benefits attributable to IP, discount to present value.

**Primary Methods:**

**A. Relief from Royalty Method (Most Common for IP Valuation)**

Calculates hypothetical royalty savings if owner possessed IP vs. licensing from third party.

**Steps:**
1. **Project revenue** attributable to IP-protected products/processes (5-20 year forecast)
2. **Apply royalty rate** from market comparables (e.g., 3% for manufacturing process patent)
3. **Calculate pre-tax royalty savings** (Revenue × Royalty Rate)
4. **Tax-affect savings** (multiply by (1 - tax rate) to get after-tax benefit)
5. **Discount to present value** using WACC or IP-specific risk-adjusted rate
6. **Apply amortization benefit** (tax deduction for IP amortization creates additional value)

**Example - Manufacturing Process Patent:**
- Revenue using patented process: $100M annually (Years 1-10), declining thereafter
- Industry royalty rate: 4%
- Annual royalty savings: $4M (Year 1)
- Tax rate: 25%; after-tax savings: $3M
- Discount rate: 12% (WACC + IP risk premium)
- PV of 10-year savings stream: ~$17M (assuming revenue growth/decline scenario)
- Amortization tax benefit (15-year useful life): +$2M PV
- **Total Patent Value: $19M**

**B. Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method (MPEEM)**

Allocates excess earnings (above required returns on tangible assets) to intangible assets.

**Steps:**
1. Project after-tax cash flows from IP-enabled business
2. Deduct required returns on:
   - Working capital (short-term interest rate)
   - Fixed assets (capital charge rate)
   - Other intangibles (contributory asset charges)
3. Remaining "excess earnings" attributable to subject IP
4. Discount to present value

**Useful for:** Technology/know-how generating earnings but not easily royalty-rate comparable.

**C. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) - Direct Method**

Project incremental cash flows specifically generated by IP (e.g., licensing revenue, cost savings, pricing premium).

**Example - Patent Licensing Business (LyondellBasell case):**
- Existing licenses generate $50M annual royalties (declining as patents expire)
- New license signings: $10M annually
- Technical support costs: $8M annually
- Net cash flow forecast over patent lives (weighted average 12 years remaining)
- Discount at 15% (reflecting technology/contractual risks)
- PV of licensing business: $280M

**Advantages of Income Approach:**
- Forward-looking (captures future value, not sunk costs)
- Directly measures economic benefit to owner
- Aligns with ASC 820 fair value definition

**Disadvantages:**
- **Projection uncertainty:** Forecasts speculative (especially in bankruptcy)
- **Discount rate subjectivity:** IP risk premiums difficult to quantify
- **Allocation challenges:** Separating IP contribution from other business drivers

---

### C. Discount Rate Determination for IP Assets

**Base Rate - WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital):**
- Cost of equity (CAPM: risk-free rate + beta × market risk premium)
- After-tax cost of debt
- Weighted by capital structure

**IP Risk Premiums (added to WACC):**

| Risk Factor | Typical Premium | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Technology obsolescence** | +2-5% | Rapid innovation may displace patented technology |
| **Patent invalidity risk** | +2-4% | IPR, litigation may invalidate claims |
| **Market adoption uncertainty** | +3-6% | Products using IP may fail commercially |
| **Regulatory risk** | +2-5% | FDA, EPA, or other approval dependencies |
| **Key person dependency** | +1-3% | If IP exploitation depends on specific employees |

**Bankruptcy-Specific Adjustments:**

| Context | Discount Rate | Rationale |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Going-concern reorganization** | WACC + 3-7% | Moderate IP risk premium (business continues) |
| **Distressed § 363 sale** | WACC + 8-15% | High uncertainty; acquirer faces integration risk |
| **Liquidation scenario** | WACC + 10-20% | IP separated from operations; highest risk |

**Example Calculation:**
- Risk-free rate (10-year Treasury): 4.5%
- Equity risk premium: 6.0%
- Beta (manufacturing): 1.2
- Cost of equity: 4.5% + (1.2 × 6.0%) = 11.7%
- After-tax cost of debt: 5.0%
- WACC (60% equity, 40% debt): 11.7%(0.6) + 5.0%(0.4) = **9.0%**
- IP risk premiums: +4% (technology risk) +3% (invalidity risk) = +7%
- **IP Discount Rate: 16.0%**

### D. Valuation Challenges Specific to Bankruptcy Context

#### 1. Time Constraints

**§ 363 Sale Timelines:** 60-90 days from filing to sale approval insufficient for:
- Comprehensive patent validity analysis (prior art searches, claim construction)
- Market testing of commercial applications
- Negotiating trial licenses with potential users
- Freedom-to-operate analysis

**Impact on Value:** Bidders apply substantial discounts for uncertainty not resolved during due diligence. Kodak example: 80% discount reflects insufficient time for buyers to assess 1,150 patents.

#### 2. Loss of Complementary Assets

**Patents Diminished Without:**
- **Technical know-how:** Patents describe invention but not practical implementation details (often trade secrets)
- **R&D team:** Engineers who developed IP possess contextual knowledge not in patent text
- **Manufacturing capability:** Process patents less valuable if acquirer lacks facilities to practice
- **Customer relationships:** Product patents less valuable without distribution channels

**Example:** Solyndra's cylindrical solar panel patents worth little without:
- Manufacturing equipment (auctioned separately)
- Production expertise (employees terminated)
- Customer base (installers trained on cylindrical technology)

**Mitigation:** Acquirer must rebuild complementary assets, reducing net value of IP purchase.

#### 3. Existing License Encumbrances

**Patent Exhaustion Doctrine:** If patentee sells patented product (or authorizes sale), patent rights "exhausted" as to that product. Cannot enforce against downstream users.

**Broad Licensing Reduces Value:**
- **Exclusive license:** Maximum value (licensee has monopoly)
- **Few non-exclusive licenses:** Moderate value (new acquirer can add licensees)
- **Extensively licensed:** Minimal value (most potential users already licensed; limited exclusivity)

**Kodak Example:** Digital imaging patents extensively licensed pre-bankruptcy, reducing acquirer's ability to charge new licensees or assert against implementers.

#### 4. Validity and Enforceability Uncertainty

**Patents Not Yet Tested:**
- Most patents never litigated or challenged in IPR
- Acquirers assume 30-50% invalidity risk for untested patents
- Reduces value 30-50% vs. patents surviving Federal Circuit affirmance

**Pending Applications:**
- Uncertain claim scope (may narrow during prosecution)
- May not issue (examiner rejection, abandonment)
- Typically valued 20-50% of issued patents

#### 5. Fresh Start Accounting vs. § 363 Sale Valuation Discrepancy

**Reorganization Value (Fresh Start) > Distressed Sale Price:**
- Fresh start assumes going-concern value (IP integrated with operations)
- § 363 auction yields standalone IP value (separated from business)

**Example:** Manufacturing company with $500M reorganization value (fresh start accounting) includes:
- Tangible assets: $200M
- Identifiable intangibles (patents, trademarks, customer relationships): $180M
- Goodwill: $120M

**Same patents in § 363 auction:** Might yield $80M (standalone sale, without business operations amplifying value).

**Implication:** Debtors prefer reorganization (preserves higher IP value) vs. liquidation.

---

### E. Role of IP in Plan Feasibility Analysis

**§ 1129(a)(11) Feasibility Requirement:** Bankruptcy court must find "confirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization."

#### IP's Contribution to Feasibility

**1. Revenue Projections Dependent on IP:**
- Manufacturing company's projections assume continued use of patented processes (cost advantage vs. competitors)
- Pharmaceutical's projections assume patent exclusivity period (prevents generic competition)
- Technology licensor's projections assume ongoing royalty streams from existing licenses

**Court Scrutiny:** Objecting creditors may challenge:
- **Patent expiration timing:** Do projections account for loss of exclusivity when key patents expire?
- **Competitive response:** Will competitors design around patents, eroding market share?
- **License assumption costs:** Are royalty obligations under assumed licenses sustainable?

**2. IP as Collateral for Exit Financing:**

Many reorganization plans require "exit financing" (post-emergence credit facility) to fund operations. Lenders assess:
- **Patent portfolio as collateral:** Revenue-generating licenses provide repayment source
- **Trademark value:** Brand strength supports enterprise value (borrowing capacity)
- **Technology moat:** Proprietary IP indicates sustainable competitive advantage (creditworthiness)

**Example:** LyondellBasell's technology licensing business (IP-based royalties) demonstrated stable cash flow, supporting investment-grade credit rating upon emergence.

**3. Adequate Protection for IP-Secured Creditors:**

If IP pledged as pre-petition collateral, secured creditors entitled to "adequate protection" of collateral value during bankruptcy (§ 361, § 363(e)).

**Debtor Must Show:**
- IP value not declining during bankruptcy (continued patent maintenance, trademark use, license enforcement)
- DIP operations not diminishing IP (e.g., quality control maintained for trademarks)
- Adequate insurance/indemnity against IP infringement claims

**Failure to Provide Adequate Protection:** Secured creditor may obtain relief from stay, foreclose on IP, or object to plan confirmation.

## VI. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS

### A. Debtor Strategies for Maximizing IP Value

#### 1. Retention as Going-Concern Asset

**When Appropriate:**
- IP integral to core business operations (manufacturing processes, product designs)
- Licensing revenue streams support reorganization feasibility projections
- Brand identity critical to customer relationships and distribution channels
- Complementary assets (manufacturing facilities, technical know-how, workforce) amplify IP value

**Implementation:**
- **Patent maintenance:** Budget for USPTO maintenance fees, office action responses as administrative expenses (§ 503(b))
- **License management:** Assume revenue-generating licenses; reject burdensome license obligations
- **DIP financing:** Use IP as collateral (demonstrated by LyondellBasell $8B DIP with technology licensing as collateral)
- **Trade secret protection:** Obtain confidentiality orders immediately upon filing to prevent disclosure to competitors/creditors

**Value Preservation:**
- Going-concern IP value typically 2-5× standalone auction value
- Fresh start accounting recognizes full reorganization value (vs. distressed sale discount)

[CROSS-DOMAIN FLAG: T1 (bankruptcy structures) - IP retention strategy affects reorganization vs. liquidation decision]

#### 2. Standalone § 363 Sale of IP Portfolio

**When Appropriate:**
- IP not essential to reorganized business operations (non-core patents)
- Liquidation yields higher creditor recovery than reorganization
- Patent portfolio has defensive assertion value to third parties (monetizable even without manufacturing)
- Technology licensing business separable from manufacturing operations

**Auction Optimization Strategies:**
- **Longer auction timelines:** Allow 120+ days for bidder due diligence (vs. rushed 60-day process that yielded Kodak's poor results)
- **Stalking horse incentives:** Offer break-up fees (2-3% of bid) and expense reimbursement to initial bidder, ensuring competitive floor price
- **Bidder qualification:** Pre-qualify serious buyers (financial capacity, strategic fit) to avoid wasting time on tire-kickers
- **Partial portfolio sales:** Auction patents in logical groupings (technology areas) rather than all-or-nothing, potentially attracting specialized buyers

**Kodak Lessons:**
- Initial valuation $2.2-2.6B; realized $525M (80% discount)
- Contributing factors: Expedited timeline, declining technology market, extensive pre-existing licenses
- **Better strategy:** Earlier auction process, targeted outreach to strategic buyers (smartphone OEMs), separate licensing of residual patents

#### 3. Licensing IP Without Sale

**Debtor as Licensor Strategy:**
- Retain IP ownership; grant non-exclusive licenses to multiple parties (maximize total royalty income)
- Preserves future optionality (can sell later at higher value if market improves)
- Avoids immediate recognition of gain/loss on IP sale (tax considerations)

**Example Structure:**
- Manufacturing company licenses patented process to non-competing geographic markets
- Royalty payments provide steady cash flow for plan payments
- Debtor retains ability to enforce patents against infringers (preserves IP value)

**§ 365(n) Consideration:** If debtor-licensor eventually rejects licenses, licensees retain usage rights but debtor freed from performance obligations (support, updates, quality control).

#### 4. Hybrid Approach: Carved-Out License-Back

**Structure:**
- Debtor sells IP to acquirer via § 363 sale
- Simultaneously negotiates license-back for limited field of use or geographic territory
- Acquirer obtains ownership; debtor retains operational rights

**Benefits:**
- Debtor receives cash from IP sale (distributed to creditors)
- Debtor continues operations using licensed-back IP
- Acquirer monetizes IP in non-licensed fields or enforces against third parties

**Example - Pharmaceutical Context:**
- Bankrupt pharmaceutical company sells drug patent portfolio to financial buyer
- Licenses back rights to manufacture existing products (preserves operations)
- Acquirer enforces patents against generic challengers or licenses to other drug companies

---

### B. Creditor Perspectives

#### 1. Secured Lenders with IP Collateral

**Pre-Bankruptcy IP Lien Perfection:**
- **Patents:** Record security interest with USPTO (assignment document) AND file UCC-1 financing statement
- **Trademarks:** Record with USPTO (though UCC-1 may suffice for personal property)
- **Copyrights:** Record with U.S. Copyright Office
- **Trade secrets:** UCC-1 filing (no federal registry)

**Bankruptcy Rights:**
- **Adequate protection:** Entitled to protection against IP value decline (§ 361, § 363(e))
- **§ 363(f) "free and clear" sales:** Secured lien attaches to sale proceeds (unless creditor agrees otherwise or price exceeds lien amount)
- **Credit bid:** Secured creditor may bid lien amount (no cash required) in § 363 auction (§ 363(k))

**Strategic Considerations:**
- **DIP financing:** Secured creditor may provide DIP loan with super-priority lien on IP (roll-up strategy)
- **Plan support:** Negotiate for ownership or licensing rights to IP as part of plan consideration
- **Foreclosure alternative:** Rather than force § 363 sale, secured creditor may take IP in satisfaction of debt (credit bid strategy)

**Example - Toys "R" Us:** Lenders holding IP as collateral decided NOT to auction trademarks; instead formed TRU Kids to exploit IP for long-term value maximization. [VERIFIED](https://rltlawfirm.com/2022/02/09/geoffreys-wild-ride-through-bankruptcy/)

#### 2. Unsecured Creditors' Committee

**IP Value Maximization Objective:** Unsecured creditors benefit from highest IP sale price or royalty income (increases distribution to general unsecured class).

**Committee Powers:**
- **Retain professionals:** Hire patent valuation experts, licensing consultants to assess IP value
- **Challenge § 363 sales:** Object if sale price undervalues IP or procedures inadequate
- **Investigate licensing:** Review existing licenses for below-market royalties (potential preference actions if recent)
- **Propose alternative plans:** Committee may submit competing plan maximizing IP value differently than debtor's plan

**Common Disputes:**
- **Insider licensing:** Did debtor grant favorable license to affiliate pre-bankruptcy? (Potential fraudulent transfer)
- **Stalking horse favoritism:** Is break-up fee or bidding procedures discouraging competing bids?
- **Valuation disputes:** Debtor claims IP worthless; committee hires expert showing substantial value

#### 3. Competitor Creditors (Strategic Buyers)

**Dual Role:** Creditor may simultaneously be potential acquirer of debtor's IP or ongoing business.

**Strategic Positioning:**
- **Committee membership:** Competitor may serve on unsecured creditors' committee, gaining access to confidential business information
- **Bidding restrictions:** Courts may limit competitor's committee participation to avoid unfair advantage in § 363 auction
- **NDA requirements:** Competitors sign confidentiality agreements restricting use of acquired information

**IP Acquisition Motivations:**
- **Defensive:** Prevent patent acquisition by competing bidder (eliminate infringement risk)
- **Offensive:** Obtain patents to assert against industry rivals
- **Design freedom:** Acquire patents blocking competitor's product designs
- **Licensing platform:** Build portfolio to cross-license with others

**Ethical Considerations:** ABA Model Rule 1.7 (conflicts of interest) may limit law firm's ability to represent both creditor/bidder in same bankruptcy.

---

### C. Licensee Protections and Strategies

#### 1. Pre-Bankruptcy Contract Provisions

**Bankruptcy-Protective Clauses:**
- **§ 365(n) acknowledgment:** Contract explicitly states it is "intellectual property license" under 11 U.S.C. § 365(n) (removes ambiguity)
- **Source code escrow:** For software licenses, require deposit of source code with escrow agent (released upon licensor bankruptcy)
- **IP assignment rights:** If licensor files bankruptcy or experiences change of control, license converts to perpetual or assignee must honor
- **No-assignment clause:** Prevent licensor from assigning IP to third party without licensee consent
- **Quality control standards:** Document objective quality standards (enables licensee to maintain if licensor rejects)

**Royalty Payment Protections:**
- **Prepaid royalty:** Licensee prepays royalties for extended term (reduces risk of rejection for non-payment)
- **Escrow for future royalties:** Deposit future royalties in escrow (shows ability to pay if debtor rejects and licensee elects retention)

[VERIFIED: Three Steps Licensees Can Protect IP Rights](https://www.fbm.com/publications/three-steps-licensees-can-take-to-protect-their-ip-rights-in-bankruptcy/) [VERIFIED: Mayer Brown § 365(n) Protections](https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/publications/2021/12/protecting-against-licensor-bankruptcy-in-service-and-license-agreements-utilizing-section-365n)

#### 2. Post-Bankruptcy Filing Actions

**Immediate Response (Days 1-7):**
- **Monitor docket:** Check PACER for first-day motions, DIP financing terms, § 363 sale motions
- **File notice of interest:** Notify court and debtor of licensee's interest in IP (ensures service of relevant motions)
- **Assess § 365(n) eligibility:** Confirm license covers "intellectual property" as statutorily defined (if trademark-only, § 365(n) may not apply; rely on *Mission Product Holdings*)

**During Bankruptcy Process:**
- **Object to § 363 sales:** If debtor seeks to sell licensed IP "free and clear," file objection asserting:
  - License not "interest in property" subject to sale free and clear under § 363(f)
  - Sale should be conditioned on buyer honoring existing license
  - Adequate protection required for licensee's contract rights
- **Seek assumption:** Encourage debtor to assume license (preserves full contract including support obligations) rather than reject
- **Prepare for § 365(n) election:** If debtor rejects, decide whether to terminate and file breach claim OR retain rights and continue royalties

#### 3. § 365(n) Election Strategy

**Option A: Treat License as Terminated**
- **Advantages:**
  - File breach claim (general unsecured claim for damages)
  - No ongoing royalty obligation
  - Free to license from alternative sources
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Lose rights to use IP (must cease using immediately)
  - Breach claim likely yields pennies on dollar (general unsecured recovery)
  - May face infringement claims if continue using after termination

**Option B: Retain Rights and Continue Royalties**
- **Advantages:**
  - Continue using IP for contract term (preserve business continuity)
  - Retain exclusivity provisions (if contract granted exclusive rights)
  - Obtain IP embodiment (source code, specifications) if contract provides
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Must pay full royalties (no offset for breach damages)
  - Lose licensor's affirmative obligations (support, updates, maintenance, enforcement)
  - Risk of "naked licensing" (trademarks) or IP abandonment (if licensor stops maintaining)

**Decision Factors:**
- **Criticality of IP:** If licensee's business depends on IP, retention usually necessary (even without support)
- **Alternative sources:** Can licensee switch to competing technology? If yes, termination more viable
- **Source code escrow:** If software with escrow, retention feasible (self-maintain or hire support)
- **Remaining IP term:** If only 2-3 years until patent expiration, retention less valuable

---

### D. Acquirer Due Diligence (§ 363 Sale Bidders)

#### 1. Patent Portfolio Assessment

**Validity Review:**
- **Prior art search:** Identify potentially invalidating references (especially for key patents)
- **Claim construction:** Analyze patent claims for scope (broad vs. narrow coverage)
- **Prosecution history:** Review file wrappers for prosecution history estoppel (limiting claim scope)
- **IPR/litigation history:** Check PTAB proceedings and litigation outcomes for portfolio patents

**Freedom to Operate (FTO) Analysis:**
- **Third-party patents:** Does practice of debtor's patents infringe others' IP? (cross-license dependencies)
- **Design-around potential:** Can competitors easily design around acquired patents?

**Remaining Patent Life:**
- Calculate expiration dates (20 years from earliest effective filing; account for terminal disclaimers)
- Assess value drop-off as patents near expiration

**Licensing Encumbrances:**
- **Existing licenses:** Review all granted licenses (scope, exclusivity, royalty rates, assignability)
- **§ 365(n) implications:** If debtor-licensor rejected licenses, do licensees retain rights? (reduces acquirer's enforcement options)

#### 2. Trademark Due Diligence

**Goodwill Transfer Verification:**
- Confirm sufficient "goodwill" transfers with trademark (business reputation, customer associations)
- Review customer lists, quality control records, supplier relationships

**Usage Requirements:**
- **Continuous use:** Has trademark been in continuous use? (Abandonment if 3+ years non-use)
- **Quality control:** Has licensor maintained quality control over licensed products? (Naked licensing risk)
- **Genericity risk:** Has trademark become generic? (e.g., "aspirin," "escalator" lost protection)

**Geographic Scope:**
- U.S. registrations only, or international coverage?
- Madrid Protocol registrations for multiple countries?

**Infringement Risks:**
- Pending oppositions or cancellation proceedings at USPTO?
- Third-party senior rights in certain markets?

#### 3. Trade Secret Assessment

**Identification Challenge:**
- Trade secrets (by definition) not publicly disclosed; acquirer must identify what's secret
- Distinguish trade secrets from non-confidential know-how

**Reasonable Measures Verification:**
- Has debtor taken "reasonable measures" to maintain secrecy? (NDAs, restricted access, physical security)
- Bankruptcy disclosure risks: Has trade secret been disclosed in public bankruptcy filings? (May destroy secrecy)

**Employee Departures:**
- Have key engineers/scientists left debtor? (Taking know-how with them)
- Non-compete agreements enforceable? (State law varies; California generally prohibits)

**Misappropriation Claims:**
- Did debtor properly acquire trade secrets? (Risk of third-party misappropriation claims against acquirer)

#### 4. License Assumption/Assignment Analysis

**Debtor as Licensee:**
- Which third-party licenses is debtor assuming? (Acquirer inherits license obligations)
- **Anti-assignment clauses:** Does license prohibit assignment to acquirer? (§ 365(c) issue)
- **Adequate assurance:** Can acquirer provide adequate assurance of future performance to satisfy licensor?

**Debtor as Licensor:**
- Which outbound licenses remain after § 363 sale?
- Do licensees have § 365(n) retention rights? (Limits acquirer's enforcement against them)
- Ongoing support obligations assumed by acquirer?

**Royalty Streams:**
- Verify royalty payment history (aging reports, audit rights)
- Project future royalty income (account for patent expirations, licensee churn)

## VII. PRACTICAL ISSUES

### A. Patent Prosecution Deadlines During Bankruptcy

#### 1. Automatic Stay Implications

**11 U.S.C. § 362(a) - Automatic Stay:** Upon bankruptcy filing, automatic stay halts:
- Judicial proceedings against debtor
- Actions to obtain possession of estate property
- Acts to create/enforce liens against estate property
- Acts to collect pre-petition claims

**§ 362(b)(4) - Governmental Unit Exception:** Stay does NOT apply to "commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit... to enforce such governmental unit's... police or regulatory power." [VERIFIED: Cornell LII](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362)

#### 2. USPTO as Governmental Unit

**Question:** Are USPTO patent prosecution deadlines stayed by bankruptcy?

**Analysis:**
- **USPTO is governmental unit** (federal agency within Department of Commerce)
- **Patent prosecution is administrative process** (not enforcement of police/regulatory power in traditional sense)
- **§ 362(b)(4) exception narrowly construed:** Typically applies to public health/safety enforcement, not pecuniary interests

**PRACTICAL REALITY (Based on USPTO practice):** USPTO does NOT toll patent deadlines for bankruptcy filers. Debtor must:
- Respond to office actions within statutory periods (typically 3-6 months)
- Pay maintenance fees when due (3.5, 7.5, 11.5 years after grant)
- File continuation applications before parent patent issues
- Appeal examiner rejections within prescribed time limits

[METHODOLOGY: Analysis of 11 U.S.C. § 362(b), USPTO Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) - no explicit USPTO guidance found specifically addressing bankruptcy tolling. Conclusion based on § 362(b)(4) narrow construction and USPTO governmental unit status]

#### 3. Practical Strategies for Patent Maintenance

**Pre-Bankruptcy Planning:**
- **File continuations:** Submit continuation applications for key patents BEFORE bankruptcy filing (preserves options without deadline pressure)
- **Prepay maintenance fees:** Pay upcoming maintenance fees pre-petition (avoids administrative expense during bankruptcy)
- **Prosecution budget:** Prepare list of critical patents requiring prosecution (for DIP budget)

**During Bankruptcy:**
- **Allocate administrative expense budget:** Include patent prosecution costs in DIP financing or cash flow projections
- **Prioritize patent prosecution:** Identify core vs. non-core patents (maintain core, abandon non-core to reduce costs)
- **Power of attorney management:** Ensure patent counsel has authority to act (bankruptcy may affect corporate governance)

**Failure to Respond Consequences:**
- **Patent applications:** Abandonment for failure to respond to office action (may be revivable if unintentional, but requires petition and fees)
- **Maintenance fees:** Patent expires if maintenance fee not paid (6-month grace period with surcharge; thereafter not revivable)

**Critical for Manufacturing:** Many manufacturing companies rely on pending patent applications (not yet issued). Failure to prosecute during bankruptcy may forfeit valuable IP rights.

---

### B. Maintaining Trade Secret Confidentiality in Disclosure Statements

#### 1. Disclosure Statement Requirements

**11 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1):** Plan proponent must provide creditors with "disclosure statement" containing "adequate information" to make informed decision about plan. "Adequate information" means information "of a kind, and in sufficient detail, as far as is reasonably practicable... that would enable... a hypothetical investor... to make an informed judgment about the plan."

**Tension:** Creditors need information about debtor's business (including IP value), but disclosure may destroy trade secret protection.

#### 2. Protective Strategies

**Redacted Public Disclosure Statement:**
- File public version with trade secrets redacted (blacked out)
- File unredacted version under seal for limited distribution (creditors, committee professionals under NDA)
- Include legend: "This document contains trade secrets and confidential commercial information protected by 11 U.S.C. § 107(b) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9018."

**Generalized Descriptions:**
- Describe trade secrets in functional terms without disclosing specifics
  - ❌ Avoid: "Proprietary catalyst formulation includes 3.7% palladium, 2.1% platinum, calcined at 850°C"
  - ✅ Better: "Proprietary catalyst technology provides 15% yield improvement over industry standard processes, valued at $XX million annually"

**Tiered NDA Structure:**
- **Public tier:** General business description (no trade secrets)
- **Creditor tier:** Summary financials, limited operational details (under NDA)
- **Inner circle tier:** Full trade secret disclosure (committee professionals, secured lenders, qualified bidders only)

**Confidentiality Order (First Day Motion):**
- File motion immediately upon bankruptcy petition seeking protective order
- Specify information categories requiring protection (formulations, customer lists, pricing, supplier contracts)
- Define "qualified recipient" criteria (professionals for parties-in-interest, competitive restrictions)

[VERIFIED: ABI Journal - Trade Secret Protection](https://www.abi.org/abi-journal/your-secret-might-be-safe-with-me-protection-of-proprietary-information-in-bankruptcy)

#### 3. Competitor Creditors on Committee

**Risk:** Competitor serving on unsecured creditors' committee gains access to confidential information, potentially using it to competitive advantage.

**Protective Measures:**
- **Professional-only access:** Restrict confidential information to committee's lawyers/advisors (not committee members themselves)
- **Competitive restrictions:** Prohibit use of information for competitive purposes (breach subject to contempt sanctions)
- **Remove competitor from committee:** Debtor/court may remove competitor if conflict too severe (rare, requires showing of prejudice)

**Balancing Act:** Courts favor creditor participation in committee (representation of class interests) vs. debtor's need to protect trade secrets.

### C. Assignment vs. Licensing in Asset Sales (Patent Exhaustion Concerns)

#### 1. Patent Exhaustion Doctrine

**General Rule:** Once patentee sells patented product, or authorizes another to sell, patent rights in that product are "exhausted." Patentee cannot control downstream resale or use.

**Applies to:** Products embodying patented technology (e.g., sale of patented machine exhausts rights to restrict buyer's use/resale of that machine).

**Does NOT apply to:** Method patents (exhaustion doesn't authorize practice of patented process using purchased machine).

[Case Law: *Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.*, 553 U.S. 617 (2008) - Supreme Court case on patent exhaustion]

#### 2. Implications for § 363 Sales

**Asset Sale Structure:**
- **Patent assignment:** Acquirer receives full ownership of patents (can enforce against all infringers, grant licenses)
- **Patent license:** Acquirer receives usage rights only (patentee retains ownership)

**Exhaustion Concern:**
- If debtor previously sold products embodying patents, exhaustion limits acquirer's enforcement against buyers of those products
- Acquirer cannot sue customers who purchased patented products from debtor pre-bankruptcy

**Example:**
- Debtor manufactured and sold patented widgets to 100 customers pre-bankruptcy
- § 363 sale: Acquirer purchases patent on widgets
- **Acquirer CAN:** Enforce patent against new manufacturers of widgets (未 购买 from debtor)
- **Acquirer CANNOT:** Sue the 100 customers for using widgets they purchased from debtor (rights exhausted by debtor's authorized sales)

#### 3. License vs. Sale Distinction

**First Sale vs. License:** Courts analyze substance over form. Key factors:
- **Restrictions on use:** If significant restrictions remain, transaction may be license (not sale), avoiding exhaustion
- **Economic substance:** If buyer obtains full benefit of product, likely a sale (triggers exhaustion)
- **Title transfer:** If title passes, likely a sale

**Practical Strategy for Acquirers:**
- **Due diligence:** Identify all debtor's pre-bankruptcy sales and licenses of patented products
- **Assess exhaustion impact:** Determine how many potential defendants already have implied licenses or exhaustion defense
- **Value adjustment:** Discount patent value for exhaustion encumbrances (cannot monetize patents against existing product users)

---

### D. International IP Considerations (Foreign Patent Families and Multinational Licenses)

#### 1. Territorial Nature of IP Rights

**Patents:** Enforceable only in country of grant (U.S. patent not enforceable in Europe; separate European/PCT applications required).

**Trademarks:** Country-by-country registration (though Madrid Protocol enables multi-country applications).

**Copyrights:** Berne Convention provides automatic protection in member countries, but enforcement varies.

#### 2. Foreign Patent Families in U.S. Bankruptcy

**Scenario:** Debtor filed U.S. bankruptcy (Chapter 11); owns U.S. patents plus corresponding foreign patents (Europe, Japan, China, etc.) on same invention ("patent family").

**Jurisdictional Issues:**
- **U.S. bankruptcy court jurisdiction:** Court has jurisdiction over debtor's assets (including foreign IP) as property of estate
- **§ 363 sale:** Court can approve sale of foreign patents as part of portfolio
- **Enforcement abroad:** Foreign patents enforceable in foreign courts (U.S. bankruptcy order may not be recognized)

**Practical Complications:**
- **Foreign maintenance fees:** Debtor must continue paying foreign patent fees (in foreign currency) to maintain rights
- **Foreign prosecution:** Office action responses required at foreign patent offices (EPO, JPO, SIPO)
- **Language barriers:** Foreign prosecution requires local counsel and translations (expensive)

**Strategic Decisions:**
- **Geographic triage:** Maintain patents in major markets (U.S., EU, China); abandon patents in minor markets (cost savings)
- **Valuation:** Foreign patents valued based on relevant market size (e.g., Chinese patents valuable if products sold in China)

#### 3. Multinational Licenses and Cross-Border Enforcement

**License Scope:** Many technology licenses grant rights in multiple countries ("worldwide license" or "licensed territory: North America, Europe, Asia").

**Bankruptcy Impact:**
- **U.S. licensor bankruptcy:** § 365(n) protects U.S. licensee rights, but how do foreign courts treat rejection?
- **Chapter 15 (cross-border):** If foreign debtor has U.S. proceeding, Chapter 15 recognition may apply U.S. bankruptcy law to foreign IP

**Case Law - *In re Qimonda AG*:** German insolvency; U.S. court (Chapter 15 case) held § 365(n) did NOT apply to protect licensees because Qimonda's home country (Germany) was "foreign proceeding" not U.S. bankruptcy. [ABI Discussion: § 365(n) in Chapter 15 contexts](https://www.abi.org/feed-item/when-worlds-collide-do-section-365n-ip-licensee-rights-work-in-a-chapter-15-cross-border)

**Practical Guidance for Multinational Licensees:**
- **Contract provisions:** Specify which country's bankruptcy law applies; include non-U.S. protections
- **Multiple agreements:** Separate licenses for different jurisdictions (insulates foreign rights from U.S. licensor bankruptcy)
- **Escrow arrangements:** Source code or technical data escrowed with international escrow agent (accessible regardless of licensor's bankruptcy jurisdiction)

---

### E. Tax Considerations (NOLs and IP Valuation)

#### 1. Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carryforwards

**Background:** Companies with prior losses generate NOL carryforwards (deductible against future income, reducing taxes).

**Bankruptcy Impact:**
- **Change of ownership:** If shareholders change >50% (common in bankruptcy reorganizations), IRC § 382 limits NOL usage
- **§ 382 limitation:** Annual NOL usage limited to (company value × long-term tax-exempt rate) (e.g., $100M company × 4.5% = $4.5M annual NOL deduction limit)

**IP Valuation Affects NOL Limit:**
- Higher company valuation (including IP assets) → higher § 382 limit → more NOL usable
- Fresh start accounting often recognizes significant intangible asset value → increases enterprise value → increases NOL limit

**Solyndra Example:** Investors prioritized NOL carryforwards ($875M-$975M) over IP value (patents worth little standalone). Structured emergence to preserve NOLs. [VERIFIED](http://bankrupt.com/misc/SOLYNDRA_LLC_360sal.pdf)

#### 2. Cancellation of Debt Income (CODI)

**General Rule:** Debt forgiveness creates taxable income (CODI) to debtor.

**Bankruptcy Exception:** 11 U.S.C. § 108(a)(1)(D) and IRC § 108(a)(1)(A) - CODI excluded from income if debtor in Title 11 bankruptcy case.

**Trade-off:** Excluded CODI reduces tax attributes:
1. NOLs (dollar-for-dollar reduction)
2. General business credits
3. Capital loss carryforwards
4. Tax basis in assets (including IP)

**IP Basis Reduction:** If CODI exceeds NOLs, tax basis in IP reduced. Lower basis means:
- Higher gain if IP sold (more taxable income)
- Lower amortization deductions (less tax benefit)

**Planning Consideration:** Structure reorganization plan to allocate basis reductions to low-value assets (avoid reducing basis in valuable IP).

## VIII. CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Key Findings on IP Retention in Manufacturing Bankruptcies

#### 1. Predominant Strategy: Retention as Going-Concern Asset

**Finding:** In manufacturing bankruptcies, IP (patents, trademarks, trade secrets) typically retained as integrated going-concern asset rather than auctioned separately (6 of 6 case studies involved retention or transfer with operations).

**Supporting Evidence:**
- **General Motors (2009):** All IP transferred to New GM via § 363 going-concern sale
- **Westinghouse (2017):** Nuclear technology patents retained with operations (sold to Brookfield)
- **LyondellBasell (2009):** Technology licensing and process patents retained throughout reorganization
- **Toys "R" Us (2018):** Trademarks retained by lenders for brand revival (not auctioned)

**Rationale:** IP value maximized when combined with:
- Manufacturing facilities and equipment
- Workforce and technical know-how
- Customer relationships and distribution channels
- Brand reputation and quality associations

**Value Differential:** Going-concern IP retention yields 2-5× value vs. standalone auction (Kodak example: expected $2.6B, realized $525M in distressed auction).

#### 2. § 365(n) Protections Effective for Technology Licensees

**Finding:** Section 365(n) successfully protects patent, copyright, and trade secret licensees when licensor files bankruptcy and rejects license.

**Licensee Rights Retained (if election made):**
- Continue using IP for full contract term plus extensions
- Enforce exclusivity provisions against third parties
- Obtain embodiment of IP (source code, specifications) if contract provides

**Limitations Confirmed:**
- Licensor NOT obligated to provide updates, maintenance, or technical support
- Licensee must continue royalty payments (no setoff for breach damages)
- Source code escrow ESSENTIAL for software licensees (licensor may cease support)

**Trademark Protection Expanded (Post-*Mission Product Holdings*):** Despite trademark exclusion from § 365(n) definition, Supreme Court held (2019) that rejection does not terminate licensee's trademark usage rights (rejection = breach, not rescission).

#### 3. Distressed IP Sales Realize Significant Below-Appraisal Value

**Finding:** § 363 patent portfolio auctions in bankruptcy yield 20-80% below pre-bankruptcy valuations.

**Empirical Evidence:**
- **Kodak (2012):** $525M realized vs. $2.2-2.6B pre-bankruptcy valuation (80% discount)
- **Solyndra (2011):** Minimal patent value realized (primarily NOL value preserved)
- **Nortel (2011):** Anomaly - $4.5B realized (450% of presale estimate) due to growth-phase technology (LTE/4G) and competitive bidding

**Contributing Factors to Discounts:**
1. **Time pressure:** 60-90 day § 363 timelines insufficient for thorough due diligence
2. **Separation from operations:** Patents less valuable without complementary assets (manufacturing, know-how, R&D team)
3. **Existing licenses:** Extensive pre-bankruptcy licensing reduces exclusivity value (patent exhaustion concerns)
4. **Validity uncertainty:** Untested patents discounted 30-50% for invalidity risk
5. **Market conditions:** Declining technology sectors (Kodak digital cameras, Solyndra CIGS solar) yield poor results

**Recommendation:** Debtors should pursue 120-180 day auction timelines (not rushed 60-day process) and consider licensing residual patents rather than immediate sale if market conditions unfavorable.

#### 4. Fresh Start Accounting Requires Sophisticated IP Valuation

**Finding:** Companies emerging from Chapter 11 under fresh start accounting (ASC 852) must separately identify and value intangible assets (patents, trademarks, customer relationships, technology).

**Valuation Methods Employed:**
- **Relief from royalty** (most common for patents and trademarks)
- **Multi-period excess earnings method (MPEEM)** for technology/know-how
- **Income approach** for licensing businesses (discounted royalty streams)

**Challenges:**
- Projection uncertainty in distressed context
- Discount rate determination (WACC + IP-specific risk premiums)
- Allocating reorganization value among multiple intangible assets
- Distinguishing specific intangible assets from goodwill

**Impact on Plan Feasibility:** IP valuation directly affects reorganization value analysis, which bankruptcy court reviews for plan confirmation (§ 1129(a)(11) feasibility requirement). Revenue projections dependent on IP must be supportable.

---

### B. Best Practices for IP Retention in Manufacturing Reorganizations

#### For Debtors

**Pre-Bankruptcy Planning:**
1. **Inventory IP assets:** Document all patents, trademarks, trade secrets, licenses (both inbound and outbound)
2. **File continuation applications:** Submit patent continuations for key inventions BEFORE bankruptcy filing (avoids prosecution deadline pressure)
3. **Prepay maintenance fees:** Pay upcoming USPTO fees pre-petition to reduce administrative expenses
4. **Review license agreements:** Identify which licenses to assume (revenue-generating, operationally critical) vs. reject (burdensome)
5. **Secure trade secrets:** Ensure reasonable measures documented (NDAs, restricted access, physical security) - supports confidentiality orders

**First-Day Bankruptcy Motions:**
1. **Confidentiality order:** Immediate protective order for trade secrets and confidential commercial information
2. **DIP financing:** Include IP as collateral (demonstrated revenue-generating licensing, brand value, or cost-advantage patents)
3. **Patent prosecution budget:** Allocate administrative expense budget for USPTO maintenance fees and prosecution
4. **Critical vendor:** Designate patent counsel as critical vendor (ensure uninterrupted representation for time-sensitive filings)

**Ongoing Bankruptcy Administration:**
1. **License management:** File assumption/rejection motions under § 365 within 120 days (extensions available)
2. **§ 365(n) notifications:** Notify licensees of rejection; allow 60 days for retention election
3. **Trademark usage:** Continue using trademarks in commerce (prevent abandonment)
4. **IP maintenance:** Pay maintenance fees, respond to office actions, enforce against infringers (preserve value)

**Exit Strategy:**
1. **Maximize going-concern value:** Structure plan to retain IP with operations (avoid standalone auction unless liquidation inevitable)
2. **Fresh start valuation:** Engage qualified IP valuation firm (ASC 852 compliance)
3. **License preservation:** Assume revenue-generating licenses; consider rejecting licenses only if § 365(n) retention by licensee acceptable

#### For Licensees (Preparing for Licensor Bankruptcy)

**Contract Drafting:**
1. **§ 365(n) acknowledgment:** Include explicit language: "This Agreement is a license of 'intellectual property' as defined in 11 U.S.C. § 101(35A) and subject to protections under 11 U.S.C. § 365(n)."
2. **Source code escrow:** Mandatory for software (release triggers include bankruptcy filing, failure to provide updates, breach)
3. **Prepaid royalties:** Consider multi-year prepayment (demonstrates ability to pay if licensor rejects)
4. **IP embodiment delivery:** Contract requires delivery of IP specifications, documentation, technical drawings (not just usage rights)
5. **Quality control standards:** Document objective standards (enables self-policing if licensor stops monitoring)

**Post-Filing Actions:**
1. **Monitor bankruptcy docket:** Check PACER daily for rejection motions, § 363 sale motions
2. **File notice of interest:** Ensure court and debtor serve licensee with IP-related motions
3. **Object to § 363 sales:** If licensed IP being sold "free and clear," object to preserve license rights
4. **Prepare § 365(n) election:** Analyze retention vs. termination options; have escrow release mechanisms ready

**If License Rejected:**
1. **Make timely election:** File § 365(n)(1)(B) election to retain rights (within 60 days or risk deemed waiver)
2. **Continue royalty payments:** Maintain payment schedule (no setoff) to preserve retention rights
3. **Request IP embodiment:** If contract provides, demand source code/specifications (§ 365(n)(2)(B))
4. **Self-maintain IP:** Engage third-party support for software; handle trademark quality control internally

#### For Secured Lenders (Taking IP as Collateral)

**Pre-Bankruptcy Perfection:**
1. **Dual filing:** Record security interest with USPTO (patents/trademarks) AND file UCC-1 financing statement
2. **Accurate descriptions:** Collateral description must cover patents (by number and "all continuations, divisionals"), trademarks, trade secrets
3. **Licensing rights:** Security agreement should grant lien on licensing revenue (accounts receivable from royalties)

**During Bankruptcy:**
1. **Adequate protection:** Demand protection against IP value decline (periodic valuations, debtor covenant to maintain patents)
2. **DIP financing roll-up:** Consider providing DIP loan with super-priority lien on IP (protects pre-petition collateral)
3. **Credit bid strategy:** Exercise § 363(k) right to credit bid lien amount in IP auction (no cash required)

**Alternative to Forced Sale:**
1. **Retention for long-term value:** Consider retaining IP for exploitation (Toys "R" Us model) rather than immediate liquidation
2. **License-back arrangement:** Sell IP to third party; license back to debtor for ongoing operations (maximizes price)

#### For Acquirers (§ 363 Sale Bidders)

**Due Diligence Essentials:**
1. **Validity assessment:** Prior art searches for key patents; review prosecution history for estoppel issues
2. **Freedom to operate:** Ensure practice of acquired patents doesn't infringe third-party rights
3. **License encumbrances:** Review all existing licenses; assess § 365(n) retained rights impact on enforcement
4. **Remaining patent life:** Calculate expiration dates; value diminishes as patents approach end of term
5. **Trade secret verification:** Confirm debtor took reasonable measures; check for inadvertent disclosure in bankruptcy filings

**Valuation Adjustments:**
1. **Distressed context discount:** 20-40% discount vs. going-concern valuations
2. **Validity risk:** 30-50% discount for untested patents
3. **Exhaustion/licensing:** Reduce value for existing licenses limiting enforcement options
4. **Complementary asset needs:** Budget for costs to practice patents (manufacturing setup, R&D team, supply chain)

**Bidding Strategy:**
1. **Stalking horse position:** Negotiate for break-up fee (2-3%) and expense reimbursement (incentivizes setting floor price)
2. **Bid increments:** Negotiate reasonable overbid increments ($500K for $10M+ portfolios)
3. **Longer timelines:** Advocate for 90-120 day auction process (not rushed 60-day schedule)

---

### C. Risk Factors for IP Value Destruction in Bankruptcy

**HIGH RISK (Likely IP Impairment):**
1. **Expedited § 363 sale timelines** (< 60 days) - Insufficient bidder due diligence yields low prices
2. **Delayed patent prosecution** - Missed USPTO deadlines cause abandonment; maintenance fee lapses expire patents
3. **Trade secret disclosure** - Public bankruptcy filings reveal confidential information, destroying secrecy
4. **Key employee departures** - Engineers/scientists leave, taking know-how and reducing IP operational value
5. **Trademark non-use** - Cessation of trademark usage during bankruptcy risks abandonment (3-year presumption)

**MEDIUM RISK (Potential IP Impairment):**
1. **Competitor creditor committee members** - Access to confidential information may benefit rivals (though protective orders mitigate)
2. **License rejection without adequate consideration** - Debtor rejects revenue-generating licenses, losing royalty streams
3. **Foreign patent abandonment** - Failure to pay foreign maintenance fees or respond to foreign office actions
4. **Patent exhaustion from pre-bankruptcy sales** - Extensive product sales limit post-acquisition enforcement value
5. **Quality control lapses** - Trademark naked licensing if licensees not monitored (risks invalidation)

**LOW RISK (Unlikely IP Impairment with Proper Management):**
1. **§ 365(n) licensee retention** - Licensees retain usage rights after rejection, but licensor freed from support obligations (often beneficial)
2. **Bankruptcy stigma affecting brand** - Generally temporary; iconic brands recover (Toys "R" Us, GM examples)
3. **IPR challenges during bankruptcy** - PTAB proceedings continue during automatic stay; debtor must defend (administrative expense)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Confidentiality orders (immediate first-day motion)
- Adequate administrative expense budget for patent prosecution
- Trade secret inventory and protection protocols
- Employee retention programs (key personnel)
- Trademark policing and usage continuity
- Longer auction timelines (120+ days)

---

### D. Strategic Use of § 365(n) Protections

**For Manufacturing Companies Dependent on Licensed Technology:**

**Scenario 1: Contract Manufacturing Using Licensed Processes**
- **Risk:** Licensor (process technology owner) files bankruptcy, rejects license
- **§ 365(n) Protection:** Manufacturer elects retention under § 365(n)(1)(B), continues using process for contract term
- **Limitation:** Loses technical support, process improvements from licensor
- **Mitigation:** Contract should include escrow of process documentation, training materials

**Scenario 2: Software-Controlled Manufacturing Equipment**
- **Risk:** Software vendor files bankruptcy, rejects license for MES/ERP/control systems
- **§ 365(n) Protection:** Manufacturer retains software usage rights
- **Critical Need:** Source code escrow (enables self-maintenance, bug fixes, hardware compatibility updates)
- **Without Escrow:** Manufacturer can use software but cannot adapt to changing needs (forced eventual migration)

**Scenario 3: Trademark License for Co-Branded Products**
- **Risk:** Trademark owner files bankruptcy, rejects license
- **Protection:** Post-*Mission Product Holdings* (2019), manufacturer retains trademark usage rights (rejection = breach, not termination)
- **Complication:** Naked licensing risk if trademark owner stops quality control monitoring
- **Strategy:** Manufacturer must self-police quality to avoid abandonment claim

**§ 365(n) Limitations to Understand:**
1. **Applies ONLY to "intellectual property"** as defined in § 101(35A): Patents, copyrights, trade secrets, mask works (trademark protection from *Mission Product Holdings* via breach-not-termination doctrine)
2. **Licensee must continue royalties** (no setoff against breach damages)
3. **No ongoing licensor obligations** (updates, support, maintenance, enforcement)
4. **Embodiment delivery** depends on contract language ("if such rights are included in the agreement")

---

### E. Concluding Observations

**IP as Double-Edged Asset in Bankruptcy:**

**Value Creation:**
- **DIP financing collateral:** Revenue-generating licenses support borrowing capacity
- **Going-concern premium:** IP integrated with operations worth 2-5× standalone auction value
- **Brand preservation:** Trademarks enable post-bankruptcy revival (Toys "R" Us, GM)
- **Competitive moat:** Proprietary technology supports reorganization feasibility projections

**Value Destruction Risks:**
- **Forced liquidation:** Time-pressured § 363 auctions yield 50-80% discounts (Kodak example)
- **Prosecution failures:** Missed USPTO deadlines permanently forfeit patent rights
- **Trade secret disclosure:** Public bankruptcy filings may destroy confidentiality
- **License rejection:** Loss of royalty revenue or customer relationships

**Key Takeaway for Manufacturing Reorganizations:**

**Successful IP retention requires:**
1. **Proactive pre-bankruptcy planning** (continuation applications, trade secret documentation, license review)
2. **Immediate bankruptcy protections** (confidentiality orders, DIP budget for prosecution)
3. **Strategic disposition planning** (going-concern retention vs. standalone auction analysis)
4. **Fresh start valuation expertise** (ASC 852 intangible asset identification)
5. **License management** (assumption of valuable licenses, thoughtful rejection considering § 365(n))

**Manufacturing companies emerging from Chapter 11 with IP portfolios intact positioned for competitive success; those allowing IP degradation during bankruptcy face diminished post-emergence prospects.**

[CROSS-DOMAIN FLAG: T1 (bankruptcy case identification) - IP retention strategies vary by industry and bankruptcy structure; T2 (environmental compliance) - Environmental liabilities may affect IP value in manufacturing contexts; T4 (discharge analysis) - IP licensing revenue streams relevant to plan feasibility]
