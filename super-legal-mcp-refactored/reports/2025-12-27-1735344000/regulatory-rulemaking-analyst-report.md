## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

The proposed $2.8 billion acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines, Inc. (FAA Certificate SWRA372A) by Global Aviation Holdings LLC (GAH) presents a **COMPLEX, MULTI-AGENCY, MULTI-JURISDICTION** regulatory approval challenge requiring 150-210 days under baseline scenarios, with material risk of extension to 210-300 days if complications arise. The transaction's foreign ownership structure—Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) holding 30% equity/15% voting plus European fund 10% equity/5% voting, totaling 40% foreign equity and 20% foreign voting—creates heightened regulatory scrutiny under DOT's "actual control" doctrine, which examines governance rights beyond mere percentage ownership.

The **critical path regulatory approvals** include: (1) FAA Part 119 air carrier certificate transfer with validation of ETOPS 120, CAT II, and international operations authorizations; (2) DOT foreign ownership citizenship determination under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15); (3) international route authority continuations from Mexico AFAC and Transport Canada; (4) implicit FAA confirmation of $256M-$400M slot portfolio at LaGuardia and Reagan National airports; and (5) resolution of two pending enforcement matters (FAA emergency equipment violation, DOT tarmac delay investigation) totaling $265K-$625K exposure.

The **single highest regulatory risk** is DOT's "actual control" analysis, with 60-70% probability that DOT will require governance restructuring (board restrictions, veto eliminations, voting trust) to approve the transaction despite statutory compliance with 25% foreign voting and 49% foreign equity limits. This finding is based on GAO-19-540R's documentation that DOT examines totality of circumstances including board appointment rights, veto authority, management selection mechanisms, and operational control—and that foreign ownership below statutory thresholds can still constitute impermissible control. The seminal Northwest Airlines/KLM (1989) precedent demonstrates that even with U.S.-Netherlands Open Skies agreement facilitating 49% foreign equity, DOT required elimination of financial advisory committee appointments, board voting restrictions on competitive/international matters, and placement of equity above 25% in voting trust.

**Base Case Timeline: 150-210 days** (55% probability) assumes DOT requires minor governance modifications and FAA conducts standard certificate transfer review. **Adverse Scenario: 210-300 days** (20% probability) if DOT requires material restructuring or ETOPS/CAT II re-authorization validation flights needed. **Deal-Killer Scenario: <5% probability** limited to DOT determination that CPPIB has effective control requiring investor exit, or FAA discovery of systemic safety issues.

The **$256M-$400M airport slot portfolio** at LaGuardia (32 pairs) and Reagan National (24 pairs) represents 9-14% of purchase price and is critical to maintaining United/Delta/American capacity purchase agreements generating 92% of SkyWest's $1.85B revenue. Industry precedent indicates 70-80% probability of automatic slot continuation with operating certificate, but regulatory ambiguity exists if FAA re-issues (vs. amends) certificate. **Slot forfeiture risk is low but consequences are catastrophic**—loss of substantial slots would constitute Material Adverse Effect and potentially terminate deal.

**International route authorities** covering Mexico (12 cities), Canada (8 cities), and Caribbean (6 destinations) generating $170M+ annual revenue (9% of total) face 35-45% probability of approval delays due to 40% foreign equity structure potentially triggering bilateral agreement scrutiny. Mexico's Agencia Federal de Aviación Civil (AFAC) and Transport Canada both require prior authorization before change of control under non-transferability provisions, with typical 30-90 day timelines that could extend if foreign ownership concerns arise.

**Pending enforcement matters**—FAA emergency equipment violation ($25K proposed penalty) and DOT tarmac delay investigation (July 15, 2024 incident, 3h22m, 72 passengers, estimated $100K-$300K penalty)—pose minor financial risk but require proactive settlement and corrective action documentation to avoid delaying certificate transfer fitness determination. Both matters should be disclosed in FAA/DOT filings with evidence of remediation; $1M escrow in purchase agreement recommended.

### Key Takeaways

**1. DOT Foreign Ownership "Actual Control" Review is Primary Gating Factor (60-70% probability of restructuring required)**
- CPPIB's 30% equity position as single largest investor exceeds typical passive threshold
- DOT examines board appointments, veto rights, management selection, operational control beyond percentages
- Northwest/KLM precedent: Even with Open Skies agreement, DOT required governance restrictions for 49% foreign equity
- **Action Required:** Immediate full review of CPPIB governance documents; pre-filing DOT consultation; prepare restructuring options (voting trust, board limitations, veto eliminations)
- **Timeline Impact:** 60-120 days if restructuring negotiated post-filing vs. 30-60 days if proactively addressed
- **Cost:** $500K-$1.5M (legal/regulatory advisory for restructuring); potential CPPIB renegotiation of economics

**2. FAA Certificate Transfer Requires 120-180 Day Process with ETOPS/CAT II/International Ops Validation**
- 14 C.F.R. § 119.35 mandates 90-day advance application minimum
- Additional 30-90 days for management personnel vetting, OpSpecs amendment, potential proving runs
- All five Part 119.65 management positions must be U.S. citizens (Director of Safety, Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, Director of Maintenance, Chief Inspector)
- ETOPS 120 authorization for extended-range twin-engine ops and CAT II low-visibility approaches must be validated for operational continuity
- **Action Required:** FAA Flight Standards pre-filing consultation 90-120 days pre-closing; comprehensive transition plan per FAA Order 8900.1; management retention strategy
- **Timeline Impact:** 150-180 days baseline; +30-60 days if extensive proving runs required
- **Cost:** $1M-$3M per month in delayed closing holding costs

**3. International Route Authorities ($170M+ Revenue) Require Proactive Multi-Jurisdiction Strategy**
- Mexico AFAC: 30-60 days for permit continuation; bilateral agreement requires "substantial ownership and effective control" by U.S. Party
- Transport Canada: 45-90 days for FAOC amendment; Section 58 Canada Transportation Act non-transferability provision
- 40% foreign equity may trigger heightened scrutiny under bilateral agreements despite U.S. carrier designation
- **Action Required:** Concurrent informal consultations with Mexico AFAC and Transport Canada starting T-90 days; formal applications T-60 days
- **Risk:** 35-45% probability of delays; route suspensions possible if approvals not obtained pre-closing
- **Mitigation:** Temporary operational arrangements; revenue guarantee provisions in purchase agreement

**4. Airport Slot Portfolio ($256M-$400M) Likely Continues Automatically But Requires Confirmation Strategy**
- LaGuardia 32 slot pairs + Reagan National 24 slot pairs = 56 total pairs worth $256M-$400M (9-14% of deal value)
- Industry precedent: United/Continental, Southwest/AirTran, Alaska/Virgin America slots continued with operating certificate
- Regulatory ambiguity: 14 C.F.R. § 93.221 transfer confirmation requirement vs. automatic continuation with certificate
- Use-or-lose rule: 80% utilization over 2-month period (14 C.F.R. § 93.227); any transition gap risks forfeiture
- **Action Required:** Pre-filing consultation with FAA Slot Administration Office; prophylactic use-or-lose waiver request; operational continuity plan
- **Probability Assessment:** 70-80% automatic continuation; 15-25% confirmation required (30-60 day delay); <5% partial forfeiture
- **Purchase Agreement:** Dollar-for-dollar price adjustment for any forfeiture (up to $400M cap)

**5. Pending Enforcement Matters Require Immediate Settlement to Avoid Fitness Determination Complications**
- FAA Emergency Equipment (FAA-2024-1158): $25K proposed penalty; probable settlement $15K-$25K
- DOT Tarmac Delay (DOT-OST-2024-0089): July 15, 2024, 3h22m, 72 pax; precedent analysis $100K-$300K
- Combined exposure: $265K-$625K (settlements + legal costs)
- **Action Required:** Immediate parallel settlement negotiations; unified corrective action plan; proactive disclosure in FAA/DOT filings
- **Timeline Impact:** 30-45 days if FAA requests proof of corrective action before certificate approval; settlement likely completed by Q1 2025
- **Purchase Agreement:** $1M escrow for final settlement amounts

### Risk Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Overall Regulatory Approval Probability:**
- **Approval with no/minor modifications:** 55-65% (Base Case: 150-210 days, $2M-$4M costs)
- **Approval with material restructuring:** 25-35% (Adverse: 210-300 days, $5M-$10M costs)
- **Denial/Deal Termination:** <5% (limited to CPPIB effective control determination or systemic safety issues)

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. CPPIB governance rights are limited OR proactive restructuring negotiated pre-filing
2. FAA determines certificate amendment (not re-issuance) preserving slot/authorization continuity
3. International regulators accept 40% foreign equity with U.S. operational control documentation
4. No discovery of additional unreported enforcement violations during FAA/DOT review

**Deal-Breaker Thresholds:**
- DOT requires CPPIB equity reduction and CPPIB refuses
- >25% of LGA/DCA slot portfolio forfeited
- Mexico or Canada deny majority of route authorities
- FAA certificate transfer exceeds 270 days (financing/outside date expiration)

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. FAA Part 119 Air Carrier Certificate Change of Control Requirements

#### 1. Statutory and Regulatory Framework

**Primary Authority:** 14 C.F.R. Part 119, Subpart C governs certification requirements for air carriers and commercial operators conducting operations under 14 C.F.R. Part 121 (scheduled air carriers like SkyWest).¹

**Certificate Application Requirements (14 C.F.R. § 119.35):**
- Applicants must submit applications to the Administrator at least **90 days before the date of intended operation**²
- Applications must be in a form and manner prescribed by the Administrator
- Must include comprehensive information about proposed operations

**Change of Control Notification Requirements (14 C.F.R. § 119.36(d)):**
- Each certificate holder must notify the Administrator **within 10 days** after certain ownership or control changes occur³
- This notification requirement applies to changes in:
  - Substantial ownership interests
  - Management control
  - Corporate structure affecting operational control

**Management Personnel Requirements (14 C.F.R. § 119.65):**
For Part 121 operations, certificate holders must have qualified personnel serving full-time in the following positions:⁴
1. **Director of Safety** - Overall safety management
2. **Director of Operations** - Operational oversight and control
3. **Chief Pilot** - Required for each category of aircraft used (multi-category requirement added 2023)⁵
4. **Director of Maintenance** - Maintenance program oversight
5. **Chief Inspector** - Quality assurance and inspection

**Management Personnel Qualifications (14 C.F.R. § 119.67):**
Each required management position must meet specific qualification requirements including:
- Appropriate experience in aviation operations
- Knowledge of relevant FAA regulations
- Demonstrated competence in their area of responsibility
- Ability to exercise operational control authority

**Notification of Management Changes:**
Certificate holders must notify the responsible Flight Standards office within 10 days of:⁶
- Any change in personnel occupying required management positions
- Any vacancy in required management positions
- Changes affecting the qualifications of management personnel

#### 2. FAA Order 8900.1 - Certificate Transfer Procedures

**Governing Authority:** FAA Order 8900.1, Flight Standards Information Management System (FSIMS), provides detailed procedures for certificate transfers, mergers, and acquisitions.⁷

**Key Procedural Requirements:**

**Transition Plan Submission:**⁸
- Certificate holders must submit a comprehensive transition plan "as soon as possible"
- Plan submitted to Joint Transition Team (JTT) or Supervising Authority office
- Must include Schedule of Events (SOE) with detailed timeline
- Should address all aspects of operational transition

**Proving Tests and Validation Flights:**⁹
- Required under FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 29, Sections 1-8
- Proving tests begin only after all Phase 4 Gate requirements met
- For Part 121 operations, proving tests essentially constitute "full-scale simulation of revenue operations"
- Purpose: Demonstrate ability to operate independently, safely, and in compliance with applicable CFRs
- Minimum requirements vary based on aircraft type and operation complexity

**Amendment Applications Requiring Extended Review (14 C.F.R. § 119.49(a)):**¹⁰
Applications must be submitted at least **90 days before proposed effective date** for:
- Mergers
- Acquisitions of airline operational assets requiring additional showing of safety
- Changes in kind of operation
- Resumption of operations following bankruptcy
- Initial introduction of aircraft not previously proven for air carrier use

**2024 Certification Process Changes:**¹¹
Effective January 24, 2024, FAA implemented new initial certification process requiring:
- 30 calendar days for FAA review of formal application before scheduling application meeting
- Enhanced applicant readiness requirements
- More structured pre-application phase

#### 3. Operations Specifications (OpSpecs) Continuity vs. Re-Issuance

**Nature of Operations Specifications:**¹²
- OpSpecs are the "blueprint" approved by FAA for each Part 121/135 airline
- Prescribe authorizations, limitations, and procedures for each kind of operation
- No person may operate as direct air carrier without valid OpSpecs
- OpSpecs issued under 14 C.F.R. § 119.49

**OpSpecs Content Requirements (14 C.F.R. § 119.49):**¹³
Operations specifications must contain:
- Specific location and address of certificate holder's principal base of operations
- Other business names under which carrier conducts operations
- Reference to economic authority (DOT certificate)
- Type of aircraft, registration markings, and serial numbers
- Authorized kinds of operations (domestic, flag, supplemental, commuter, on-demand)
- Geographic areas of operations
- Airport authorizations and limitations
- Special authorizations (ETOPS, CAT II/III, international operations)
- Management personnel names and duties

**Change of Control Impact on OpSpecs:**
- OpSpecs are certificate-specific and tied to named certificate holder
- Change of control typically requires **amendment or re-issuance** of OpSpecs in name of new controlling entity
- All specialized authorizations (ETOPS 120, CAT II, international) must be validated for continuity
- Process may involve:
  - Validation flights for specialized operations
  - Management personnel re-qualification review
  - Updated maintenance program approval
  - Renewed airport authorizations

**Certificate Continuity Standard:**¹⁴
- Administrator may determine certificate holder's continued eligibility on any regulatory grounds
- Air Carrier Certificate issued under Part 119 remains effective until surrendered or revoked
- Certificate does not automatically transfer with asset sale

#### 4. ETOPS 120 Authorization Transfer Requirements

**ETOPS Regulatory Framework:**¹⁵
14 C.F.R. Part 121, Appendix P governs Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards (ETOPS)

**ETOPS 120 Authorization Requirements:**¹⁶
- Airplane-engine combination must be type-design-approved for ETOPS of at least 120 minutes
- Certificate holder must operate in accordance with ETOPS authority contained in OpSpecs
- Compliance with maintenance program requirements of 14 C.F.R. § 121.374 mandatory
- Minimum Equipment List (MEL) requirements specific to 120-minute ETOPS

**Initial ETOPS Approval Prerequisites:**¹⁷
- Minimum **12 months experience** conducting international operations (excluding Canada/Mexico) with multi-engine turbine-powered aircraft
- New ETOPS approval limited to maximum **120-minute diversion time**
- To increase to 180 minutes requires **at least one year of ETOPS 120 experience**

**Proving Test Requirements:**¹⁸
- Initial airplane proving tests require at least **100 hours of proving tests** acceptable to Administrator
- Proving tests required for aircraft not previously proven for use in the specific kind of operation
- ETOPS validation flights demonstrate operational readiness

**Transfer Implications for SkyWest Acquisition:**
- SkyWest's existing ETOPS 120 authorization tied to current certificate
- Acquirer (GAH) will need to demonstrate:
  - Management team competence in ETOPS operations
  - Maintenance program adequacy
  - Operational control systems for ETOPS compliance
  - May require validation flights even if using same aircraft types
  - Timeline adds to overall certificate transfer process

**Advisory Circular AC 120-42B:**¹⁹
FAA Advisory Circular 120-42B provides additional guidance on ETOPS and Polar Operations, including:
- Operational validation procedures
- Maintenance program requirements
- Training standards for flight crews
- Required documentation

#### 5. CAT II Approach Authorization Transfer

**CAT II Operations Defined:**²⁰
Category II (CAT II) approach operations allow aircraft to land in lower visibility conditions than standard approaches, critical for:
- All-weather operations reliability
- Major hub airport operations during inclement weather
- Schedule integrity
- Operational efficiency

**Regulatory Requirements:**
CAT II authorizations require:
- Aircraft equipment certification
- Flight crew training and qualification
- Maintenance program approval
- Operations manual procedures
- Ground equipment verification
- Continuing analysis and surveillance programs

**Transfer Considerations:**
- CAT II authorizations are OpSpecs-specific
- Require demonstration of:
  - Pilot training program adequacy
  - Aircraft equipment maintenance
  - Quality control procedures
- May require check flights or validation by FAA inspectors
- Essential for SkyWest's United/Delta/American hub operations

#### 6. International Operations Authorizations (14 C.F.R. Part 129)

**Part 129 Foreign Operations Authority:**²¹
14 C.F.R. Part 129 governs operations of U.S. air carriers in foreign air commerce, including operations to Mexico, Canada, and Caribbean destinations

**SkyWest International Route Structure:**
- **Mexico:** 12 cities under U.S.-Mexico Open Skies Agreement
- **Canada:** 8 cities under U.S.-Canada transborder agreement
- **Caribbean:** 6 destinations (Bahamas, Jamaica, Cayman Islands)

**Bilateral Air Service Agreement Compliance:**

**U.S.-Mexico Air Transport Agreement:**²²
- Signed December 18, 2015; effective August 21, 2016
- Allows unlimited market access between any U.S. and Mexican cities
- **Substantial ownership and effective control** requirement: Designated airline must be substantially owned and effectively controlled by designating Party or its nationals²³
- Either Party may revoke operating authorizations if ownership/control requirements not met²⁴

**Change of Control Implications:**
- Bilateral agreements require airlines to maintain "substantial ownership and effective control" by nationals of designating country
- Change to PE-backed acquirer with 40% foreign equity/20% foreign voting potentially triggers scrutiny
- Mexico's Agencia Federal de Aviación Civil (AFAC) must approve continuation of operating rights²⁵

**Mexican Regulatory Requirements:**²⁶
- AFAC advises Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SICT) on air transportation matters
- Issues air operator certificates, concessions, permits, and authorizations
- **Merger/Acquisition Impact:** Parties holding AFAC permits/concessions need prior authorization before merger execution to prevent forfeiture of rights²⁷
- Mexican Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE) may require competition review²⁸

**Transport Canada Foreign Air Operator Certificate (FAOC):**²⁹
- All foreign air operators flying to Canada require FAOC showing compliance with federal aviation regulations
- **Non-Transferability:** License for air service operations is non-transferable under Section 58 of Canada Transportation Act³⁰
- **Merger Procedures:** Each company must continue operating under current Transport Canada approvals until new/amended Air Operator Certificate issued³¹
- Must provide transition plan addressing all Transport Canada Safety and Security responsibilities³²
- Additional authorizations required from other federal agencies³³

**Caribbean Operations:**
- Operations to Bahamas, Jamaica, Cayman Islands governed by respective bilateral agreements
- Each jurisdiction has sovereignty over landing rights
- Change of control may require notification or re-approval depending on bilateral agreement terms

**Timeline for International Authorization Transfers:**
- **Typical Range:** 30-45 days per jurisdiction (industry standard)
- **Mexico AFAC:** 30-60 days for permit continuation approval
- **Transport Canada:** 45-90 days for FAOC amendment/re-issuance
- **Caribbean nations:** 15-45 days depending on jurisdiction
- **Cumulative Risk:** Sequential approvals could extend timeline 90-180 days
- **Contingency:** Some operations may require temporary suspension during approval process

#### 7. Industry Standard Timeline for Certificate Transfer: 90-120 Days

**Baseline Timeline Analysis:**

Based on regulatory requirements and industry practice, the **90-120 day timeline** for FAA certificate transfer in acquisition context derives from:

1. **Statutory Minimum (14 C.F.R. § 119.35):** 90 days advance application requirement²
2. **FAA Review and Processing:** 30-60 days for substantive review of management fitness, operational control, transition plan³⁴
3. **Management Personnel Vetting:** 15-30 days for background checks, qualification verification
4. **OpSpecs Amendment/Reissuance:** 30-45 days for validation of specialized authorizations
5. **Proving Flights (if required):** 14-30 days depending on scope
6. **DOT Economic Authority Review (parallel):** 60-90 days for fitness determination under 14 C.F.R. Part 204

**Factors Extending Timeline Beyond 120 Days:**

- **Foreign Ownership Complexity:** DOT "actual control" review for 40% foreign equity structure: +30-60 days
- **ETOPS/Specialized Operations:** Validation flights for ETOPS 120: +15-30 days
- **International Authorizations:** Mexico AFAC, Transport Canada approvals: +45-90 days
- **Pending Enforcement Actions:** Resolution of FAA-2024-1158, DOT-OST-2024-0089: +30-60 days
- **Private Equity Structure:** Enhanced scrutiny of governance documents, veto rights, board composition: +15-45 days

**Realistic Timeline for SkyWest Acquisition:**
- **Minimum:** 120 days (optimistic, no complications)
- **Probable:** 150-180 days (accounting for foreign ownership review, international authorizations)
- **Extended Scenario:** 210-270 days (if DOT determines "actual control" issue requires restructuring, or enforcement matters delay approval)

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. FAA management fitness determination
2. DOT foreign ownership actual control review (see Section IV.B)
3. International regulator approvals (Mexico, Canada)
4. Resolution of pending enforcement matters (see Section IV.E)
5. Slot transfer approvals at LGA/DCA (see Section IV.D)

### B. DOT Foreign Ownership Compliance and "Actual Control" Doctrine

#### 1. Statutory Foreign Ownership Limits (49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15))

**"Citizen of the United States" Definition:**³⁵

For purposes of U.S. air carrier certification, 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15) defines a "citizen of the United States" for a corporation or association as an entity that meets ALL of the following requirements:

1. **Organized under U.S. or state law**
2. **President and at least two-thirds (66.67%) of board of directors and managing officers are U.S. citizens**
3. **At least 75% of voting interest owned or controlled by U.S. citizens**
4. **Under the "actual control" of U.S. citizens**

**Critical Distinction - Voting vs. Total Equity:**³⁶
- **Voting Interest Limit:** Maximum **25% foreign voting** interest permitted
- **Total Equity Limit:** Maximum **49% foreign total equity** (voting + non-voting) permitted
- **Open Skies Flexibility:** 49% foreign total equity generally permitted only when foreign investors are from Open Skies agreement countries OR investments are "clearly passive and diffuse"³⁷

**Global Aviation Holdings (GAH) Ownership Structure - Compliance Analysis:**

| Investor | Equity % | Voting % | Citizenship | Compliant? |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| CPPIB (Canada Pension Plan Investment Board) | 30% | 15% | Canadian | ✓ (individually) |
| European institutional fund | 10% | 5% | European | ✓ (individually) |
| **Total Foreign** | **40%** | **20%** | **Non-U.S.** | **⚠️ SCRUTINY RISK** |
| U.S. PE sponsors/investors | 60% | 80% | U.S. | ✓ |

**Statutory Compliance:**
- **Voting Interest:** 20% foreign voting is **COMPLIANT** (below 25% threshold) ✓
- **Total Equity:** 40% foreign equity is **COMPLIANT** (below 49% threshold) ✓

**However:** Statutory compliance **does not guarantee** DOT approval due to "actual control" doctrine.

#### 2. DOT "Actual Control" Doctrine - Beyond Percentage Ownership

**Doctrinal Evolution:**³⁸

The "actual control" requirement was part of CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board) and DOT administrative precedent and was **codified in 2003** following issuance of a letter from DOT's Office of Inspector General.³⁹

**Key Principle:**⁴⁰
DOT interprets "actual control" to mean determining whether foreign interests have the **ability to exercise substantial influence** over the airline **beyond the numerical requirements** of the law.

**Critical Finding from GAO-19-540R (June 2019):**⁴¹
> "DOT officials noted that based on their analysis, foreign ownership of an airline's voting stock could be **less than 25 percent but could still be found to have actual control**. Conversely, foreign ownership—including both voting and non-voting shares—could be nearly 50 percent but have little influence, according to the guidance, when the foreign investors have been nationals of countries with which the United States has open skies aviation bilateral agreements or when DOT determined that the foreign investments were **clearly passive and diffuse, with no suggestion of foreign control**."

**Case-by-Case Analysis Standard:**⁴²

DOT determines actual control through a **totality of the circumstances** analysis examining multiple factors, not just ownership percentages.

#### 3. Factors DOT Examines in "Actual Control" Determinations

**Documented Factors from GAO Reports and DOT Precedents:**⁴³

DOT examines several factors when determining the issue of control, including:

1. **Voting rights** held by U.S. and non-U.S. citizens
2. **Significant contracts** between airline and business partners (especially foreign partners)
3. **Terms of debt instruments** or bankruptcy agreements
4. **Board composition** and decision-making authority
5. **Board appointment rights** - who has power to appoint directors
6. **Veto rights** over key business decisions
7. **Management appointment authority** - who controls hiring/firing of key executives
8. **Day-to-day operational control** mechanisms
9. **Special board committees** with foreign representation
10. **Consent rights** for major corporate actions
11. **Whether foreign investors are from Open Skies countries** (U.S.-Canada and U.S.-European Open Skies agreements)

**DOT Analysis Focus:**⁴⁴
During analysis, DOT determines whether a foreign entity's influence over any of these factors **shifts the actual, day-to-day control** of the airline from U.S. citizens to foreign citizens.

#### 4. Key Precedent: Northwest Airlines/KLM (1989)

**The Seminal "Actual Control" Case:**⁴⁵

In its review of the proposed transaction involving Northwest Airlines and KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines), DOT objected to the proposed deal's structure and issued a **consent order**, with Northwest and Wings Holdings agreeing to:

1. **Place KLM's interest above 25% of total equity in a voting trust**
2. **Terminate KLM's right to appoint a financial advisory committee**
3. **Disqualify KLM's board member from participating in all decisions on competitive and international aviation matters**

**DOT's Key Statement:**⁴⁶
> "The DOT order stated that appointment of foreign representatives to **key positions** on Wings' board, **especially the position of chairman**, would be 'cause for us to review the citizenship of the affected air carrier.'"

**Outcome After Restructuring:**⁴⁷
After the structural changes, DOT permitted:
- KLM to own **49% of total equity** in Wings Holdings
- **Increased representation on Wings' board** (with limitations on competitive/international matters)
- This was facilitated by U.S.-Netherlands **Open Skies bilateral aviation agreement**

**Key Takeaway:**
Even with Open Skies agreement, DOT required elimination of:
- Financial advisory committee appointment rights
- Participation in competitive decisions
- Full board voting rights on international matters

#### 5. Recent DOT Reviews (2010-2019)

**DOT Ongoing Oversight:**⁴⁸

According to GAO-19-540R, DOT initiated citizenship reviews for major carriers:

- **United Airlines (2010):** During merger with Continental
- **Southwest Airlines (2011):** During merger with Air Tran
- **American Airlines (2017):** Periodic review of ownership structure
- **Delta Air Lines (2019):** After reporting substantial change in ownership

**Significance:**
DOT conducts **ongoing monitoring** and can initiate review at any time upon:
- Change of control transactions
- Substantial changes in ownership reported by carrier
- Periodic compliance audits
- Concerns raised about foreign influence

#### 6. Application to Global Aviation Holdings Structure

**Risk Factors for "Actual Control" Scrutiny:**

| Risk Factor | GAH Structure | DOT Concern Level |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Single Foreign Investor with 30% Equity** | CPPIB holds 30% equity | **HIGH** - Largest single investor with potentially outsized influence |
| **Combined Foreign Equity at 40%** | CPPIB 30% + European 10% = 40% | **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Approaching 49% threshold; aggregate influence concern |
| **Foreign Voting at 20%** | CPPIB 15% + European 5% = 20% | **MEDIUM** - Below 25% but significant bloc |
| **Canadian Investor (Open Skies)** | CPPIB is Canadian Crown corporation | **MITIGATING** - Canada Open Skies agreement provides flexibility |
| **PE Fund Structure** | Multiple PE sponsors with GAH | **MEDIUM** - DOT may scrutinize governance rights of all investors |

**Critical Questions DOT Will Examine:**

1. **Board Composition:**
   - How many board seats does CPPIB have right to appoint?
   - Does CPPIB have board observer rights?
   - Can CPPIB appoint to special committees (audit, compensation, investment)?

2. **Veto Rights/Consent Requirements:**
   - Does CPPIB have veto over major corporate actions (M&A, capex, borrowing)?
   - Are there supermajority voting requirements that give CPPIB effective veto?
   - Can CPPIB block sale or refinancing?

3. **Management Appointment:**
   - Does CPPIB have role in selecting/removing CEO, CFO, COO?
   - Are there contractual provisions giving CPPIB consultation rights on management?

4. **Information Rights:**
   - Does CPPIB have enhanced information rights beyond typical minority investor?
   - Are there reporting requirements specific to CPPIB?

5. **Operational Decisions:**
   - Can CPPIB influence route decisions, aircraft acquisitions, labor negotiations?
   - Are there provisions requiring CPPIB consent for major contracts?

6. **Exit Rights:**
   - Does CPPIB have drag-along or tag-along rights that could force sale?
   - Can CPPIB trigger put rights requiring company buyback?

#### 7. Required Submissions to DOT for Fitness Determination

**14 C.F.R. Part 204 - Fitness Data Requirements:**⁴⁹

For substantial change in ownership or control, certificate holders must file with DOT Office of International Aviation:

1. **Detailed description of ownership structure** - all investors with 10%+ equity
2. **Complete governance documents:**
   - Limited partnership agreement (if applicable)
   - Limited liability company operating agreement
   - Shareholders agreement
   - Investor rights agreements
   - Board composition and voting rules
3. **Organizational chart** showing all entities in ownership chain
4. **Identity and citizenship** of all persons with 10%+ ownership or control
5. **Description of all agreements** between airline and any foreign entity
6. **Explanation of how U.S. citizens maintain actual control** despite foreign investment
7. **List of all board members** with citizenship status
8. **Description of management structure** and appointment mechanisms

**DOT Review Timeline:**⁵⁰
- **Typical Review:** 60-90 days for fitness determination
- **Complex Foreign Ownership:** 90-120 days with potential for additional information requests
- **Restructuring Required:** 120-180+ days if DOT determines structure needs modification

#### 8. Probable DOT Requirements for Approval

**Based on Northwest/KLM precedent and DOT practice, likely required:**

**Minimum Requirements:**
1. **Voting Trust or Equivalent** for CPPIB equity above certain threshold
2. **Board Limitations:**
   - CPPIB board representatives (if any) excluded from voting on:
     - Competitive strategy decisions
     - International route decisions
     - Code-share and alliance matters
     - Government regulatory interactions
   - U.S. citizens must constitute board majority with independent voting authority
3. **Elimination of Veto Rights** over operational decisions
4. **Management Control:**
   - All five required management positions (§ 119.65) must be U.S. citizens
   - U.S. PE sponsors must have unilateral authority to appoint/remove management
5. **Contractual Restrictions:**
   - Limitation on CPPIB information rights to standard minority investor protections
   - Prohibition on CPPIB involvement in day-to-day operations

**Enhanced Requirements (if DOT has concerns):**
1. **Reduction of CPPIB equity stake** below 25%
2. **Conversion of portion of CPPIB equity to non-voting** preferred stock
3. **Independent U.S. citizen board chairman** with tie-breaking authority
4. **Annual citizenship compliance certifications** to DOT
5. **Restriction on CPPIB exit rights** that could force change of control

#### 9. Citizenship Compliance Risk Analysis

**Probability Assessment:**

| Outcome | Probability | Basis |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **DOT approves structure as-is** | **15-25%** | METHODOLOGY: CPPIB 30% equity significantly above typical passive investor threshold; single largest investor creates heightened scrutiny despite Open Skies agreement |
| **DOT requires governance modifications** | **60-70%** | METHODOLOGY: Northwest/KLM precedent; GAO-19-540R case-by-case approach; likely requires board/veto right restrictions |
| **DOT requires equity restructuring** | **10-15%** | METHODOLOGY: If governance documents show CPPIB has extensive control rights that cannot be adequately restricted |
| **DOT denies citizen status** | **<5%** | METHODOLOGY: Unlikely if transaction parties willing to restructure; would require egregious control by foreign investors |

**Timeline Impact:**
- **Standard Review:** 60-90 days
- **With Governance Modifications:** 90-120 days (negotiation of revised agreements)
- **With Equity Restructuring:** 120-180 days (requires capital structure changes, investor negotiations)

**Financial Impact of Restructuring:**
- **Voting Trust Costs:** $50,000-$150,000 for establishment and ongoing administration
- **Legal/Regulatory Costs:** $500,000-$1,500,000 for DOT fitness proceeding and document negotiations
- **Investor Relations Impact:** CPPIB may require additional returns or governance protections as condition of accepting restrictions
- **Delayed Closing Costs:** $1-3 million per month in holding costs if restructuring extends closing timeline

### C. Airport Slot Regulations at LaGuardia and Reagan National

#### 1. Regulatory Framework - 14 C.F.R. Part 93, Subparts K and S

**High Density Traffic Airports:**⁵¹
14 C.F.R. Part 93, Subpart K designates LaGuardia (LGA) and Reagan National (DCA) as "high density traffic airports" requiring reservation ("slot") for each IFR takeoff or landing.

**LaGuardia Operations (Subpart K + FAA Order):**⁵²
- LaGuardia governed by 14 C.F.R. Part 93, Subpart K and FAA Orders Limiting Operations
- Current Order Limiting Operations effective through October 26, 2024 (extended periodically)
- **SkyWest Holdings:** 32 slot pairs valued at $160M-$256M ($5M-$8M per pair market value)

**Reagan National Operations (Subpart S):**⁵³
- Governed by 14 C.F.R. Part 93, Subpart S (High Density Traffic Airports Rule)
- **SkyWest Holdings:** 24 slot pairs valued at $96M-$144M ($4M-$6M per pair market value)
- **Perimeter Rule:** Flights beyond 1,250 miles restricted (limited exceptions)

**Combined Slot Portfolio Value:** $256M-$400M (15-17% of $2.8B deal value)

#### 2. Use-or-Lose Requirement - 14 C.F.R. § 93.227

**80% Utilization Mandate:**⁵⁴
> "Any slot not utilized 80 percent of the time over a 2-month period shall be recalled by the FAA."

**Compliance Reporting:**⁵⁵
- Certificate holders must forward list of all slots held with details of actual operations
- Reporting required within 14 days after each 2-month period
- Must show which carrier actually operated slot for each day

**Waiver Authority:**⁵⁶
FAA may waive 80% requirement for:
- "Highly unusual and unpredictable" conditions beyond carrier's control
- Condition must exist for 9+ consecutive days
- Recent waivers: COVID-19 pandemic, ATC staffing shortages, runway construction

#### 3. Slot Transfer Requirements - 14 C.F.R. § 93.221

**Buy-Sell-Lease Authority:**⁵⁷
> "Effective April 1, 1986, slots may be bought, sold or leased for any consideration and any time period and they may be traded in any combination for slots at the same airport or any other high density traffic airport."

**FAA Confirmation Requirement:**⁵⁸
> "All transfers of slots between operators are subject to prior FAA confirmation in accordance with the applicable rules."

**Transfer Conditions:**⁵⁹
1. Slot transferred must come from transferor's then-current FAA-approved base
2. Written evidence of each transferor's consent required
3. **Recipient may not use slot until written confirmation received from FAA**

#### 4. Change of Control vs. Buy-Sell Transactions

**Critical Distinction:**

**Buy-Sell Transaction:**
- Individual slot sales between unrelated parties
- Requires FAA confirmation per § 93.221
- Typical timeline: 15-30 days for FAA administrative processing

**Change of Control (Acquisition):**
- All slots transfer with operating certificate
- Slots remain with certificate holder (SkyWest Regional Airlines, Inc.)
- **Key Question:** Does FAA treat as automatic continuation or require re-authorization?

**Regulatory Ambiguity:**
The regulations do not explicitly address whether change of corporate control triggers:
- (A) Automatic slot continuity with certificate, OR
- (B) Deemed "transfer" requiring FAA confirmation

**Industry Practice:**
Based on precedent M&A transactions (United/Continental, Southwest/AirTran, Alaska/Virgin America):
- FAA generally treats slots as continuing with operating certificate
- No separate slot transfer application required if:
  - Same FAA certificate number continues
  - Operating certificate remains valid
  - No gap in operations

**Risk Factors for SkyWest Transaction:**
1. **Certificate Re-Issuance:** If FAA re-issues certificate (vs. amending), slots may require re-authorization
2. **Foreign Ownership Scrutiny:** If DOT citizenship determination delayed, slot continuation may be held pending resolution
3. **Proving Run Gap:** Any gap between old certificate surrender and new certificate issuance could trigger 80% use requirement failure

#### 5. Slot Valuation and Deal Economics

**Market Value Analysis:**

| Airport | Slot Pairs | Value per Pair | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| LaGuardia (LGA) | 32 | $5M - $8M | $160M | $256M |
| Reagan National (DCA) | 24 | $4M - $6M | $96M | $144M |
| **Total** | **56** | — | **$256M** | **$400M** |

**Percentage of Deal Value:**
- Low Estimate: $256M / $2.8B = **9.1% of purchase price**
- High Estimate: $400M / $2.8B = **14.3% of purchase price**

**Strategic Importance:**
- LGA/DCA slots enable United/Delta/American hub feed operations
- Critical to maintaining $1.85B capacity purchase agreements (92% of revenue)
- Loss of slots would fundamentally impair business model

**Slot Loss Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Probability | Value at Risk | Impact |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Automatic continuation with certificate** | **70-80%** | $0 | No disruption [METHODOLOGY: Standard M&A practice] |
| **FAA requires confirmation, approves** | **15-25%** | $0 | 30-60 day delay [METHODOLOGY: Administrative processing time] |
| **Use-or-lose failure during transition** | **3-5%** | $12M-$40M | Partial forfeiture [METHODOLOGY: Historical waiver grant rate] |
| **FAA denies slot continuation** | **<1%** | $256M-$400M | Deal termination [METHODOLOGY: No precedent for denial in airline M&A] |

#### 6. Timeline and Approval Process

**If FAA Requires Slot Transfer Confirmation:**
1. **Application Submission:** Concurrent with certificate transfer application
2. **FAA Administrative Review:** 15-30 days
3. **Written Confirmation:** Required before slot usage by new operator
4. **Cumulative Impact on Deal Timeline:** +15-45 days

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Pre-Filing Consultation:** Engage FAA Slot Administration Office early (30-60 days pre-closing)
2. **Operational Continuity Plan:** Document no-gap operations under existing certificate
3. **Use-or-Lose Waiver Request:** File prophylactic waiver request citing transaction-related "unpredictable conditions"
4. **Schedule Flexibility:** Build 30-60 day buffer into closing conditions for slot confirmation

### D. Pending FAA and DOT Enforcement Matters

#### 1. FAA Emergency Equipment Violation (Docket FAA-2024-1158)

**Regulatory Basis:** 14 C.F.R. § 121.339 (Emergency Equipment for Extended Over-Water Operations)⁶⁰

**Violation Alleged:**
- Notice of Proposed Civil Penalty: **$25,000**
- Specific regulation: Emergency equipment inspection and serviceability requirements
- Likely scenario: Emergency raft, flotation device, or locator beacon deficiency on ETOPS-authorized aircraft

**Enforcement Timeline:**⁶¹
1. **Notice of Proposed Civil Penalty issued:** Date TBD (Docket FAA-2024-1158)
2. **30-Day Answer Period:** Respondent may submit written answer or request informal conference
3. **Settlement Negotiations:** 60-90 days typical for penalties under $50,000
4. **ALJ Hearing (if contested):** 120-180 days
5. **Probable Resolution:** Settlement within 90-120 days of NPRM

**Penalty Range Analysis:**

Based on 14 C.F.R. § 13.16 (Civil Penalties) and FAA enforcement precedents:⁶²
- **Minimum Penalty:** $10,000-$15,000 (mitigated for corrective action, no passenger impact, first offense)
- **Proposed Penalty:** $25,000 (mid-range, suggests moderate severity)
- **Maximum Penalty:** $50,000-$100,000 (aggravated by pattern, passenger safety impact, or recalcitrance)

**Settlement Probability:**
- **Settlement at or below proposed amount:** 75-85% [METHODOLOGY: FAA Enforcement Reports 2020-2024 show majority of sub-$50K penalties settle]
- **Likely Settlement Range:** $15,000-$25,000
- **Contest through ALJ hearing:** 10-15% [METHODOLOGY: Resource-intensive for low-value penalty]

**Impact on Certificate Transfer:**

| Impact Type | Probability | Analysis |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **No impact on timing** | **60-70%** | If settled before or concurrent with certificate application [METHODOLOGY: $25K penalty not material to fitness determination] |
| **Minor delay (30-45 days)** | **25-35%** | FAA may request proof of corrective action before certificate approval [METHODOLOGY: Enforcement resolution standard condition] |
| **Material delay (60+ days)** | **<5%** | Only if penalty reveals systemic safety issues requiring comprehensive remediation [METHODOLOGY: Single equipment violation unlikely to trigger] |

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate Settlement:** Negotiate prompt resolution for $15,000-$20,000
2. **Corrective Action Documentation:** Submit comprehensive corrective action plan to FAA
3. **Certificate Application Disclosure:** Proactively disclose pending enforcement in fitness filing
4. **Timeline Buffer:** Add 30-45 days to closing timeline as contingency

#### 2. DOT Tarmac Delay Investigation (Docket DOT-OST-2024-0089)

**Regulatory Basis:** 14 C.F.R. § 259.4 (Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays)⁶³

**Incident Details:**
- **Date:** July 15, 2024
- **Route:** Denver (DEN) to Boise (BOI)
- **Delay Duration:** 3 hours 22 minutes (exceeded 3-hour domestic limit by 22 minutes)
- **Passengers Affected:** 72

**Three-Hour Rule:**⁶⁴
> "For all domestic flights, each covered U.S. air carrier shall provide a passenger on a flight experiencing a tarmac delay at a U.S. airport the opportunity to deplane before the tarmac delay exceeds three hours in duration."

**Per-Passenger Penalty Structure:**⁶⁵
DOT Enforcement Office position: **Separate violation for each passenger** forced to remain onboard beyond time limit
- **Maximum Statutory Penalty:** $32,140 per violation (adjusted for inflation 2024)
- **72 Passengers × $32,140** = **$2,314,080 maximum theoretical exposure**

**Precedent-Based Penalty Analysis:**

| Carrier | Year | Duration | Passengers | Penalty | Per-Pax Penalty |
|---------|------|----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **United Airlines** | 2019 | 3h48m | 78 | $125,000 | $1,603 |
| **ExpressJet** | 2016 | 4h17m | 65 | $200,000 | $3,077 |
| **American Airlines** | 2019 | Multiple | 5,821 (43 flights) | $4,100,000 | $704 |
| **Volaris** | 2022 | 4h35m | 167 | $300,000 | $1,796 |

**SkyWest Penalty Estimate:**

**Base Calculation:**
- 72 passengers × 22 minutes over limit × precedent range $1,600-$3,000 per passenger
- **Low Estimate:** $115,000 (United Airlines precedent: $1,603/pax)
- **Mid Estimate:** $200,000 (ExpressJet precedent: $3,077/pax)
- **High Estimate:** $500,000 (if DOT views as egregious or part of pattern)

**Mitigating Factors:**⁶⁶
1. **Weather-Related:** If delay caused by force majeure weather, penalties reduced 30-50%
2. **Corrective Action:** Prompt remediation reduces penalties 20-30%
3. **Compliance History:** Clean record supports lower end of range
4. **Single Incident:** Not pattern of violations (unlike American $4.1M penalty for 43 flights)

**Aggravating Factors:**
1. **July 2024 Timing:** Summer travel season heightens passenger impact
2. **Regional Jet:** Smaller aircraft, more discomfort for extended delay
3. **Media Attention:** Public complaints can increase DOT enforcement priority

**Probable Settlement Range:** $100,000-$300,000
[METHODOLOGY: Midpoint between United ($125K) and ExpressJet ($200K) precedents, adjusted for single-incident nature]

**Timeline for Resolution:**
1. **DOT Investigation:** 60-90 days (docket opened, gathering evidence)
2. **Notice of Enforcement Action:** 90-120 days from incident (December 2024-January 2025)
3. **Settlement Negotiations:** 60-120 days
4. **Consent Order Issuance:** 180-270 days total from incident (January-March 2025)

**Impact on Certificate Transfer:**

| Impact Type | Probability | Analysis |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **No impact - settled before closing** | **45-55%** | If investigation resolved by Q1 2025 [METHODOLOGY: Typical 6-9 month investigation-to-consent-order timeline] |
| **Minor delay - pending resolution** | **35-45%** | DOT/FAA may coordinate review; fitness determination may await tarmac delay resolution [METHODOLOGY: Regulatory coordination] |
| **Material delay - pattern concerns** | **<5%** | Only if DOT investigation reveals multiple unreported incidents [METHODOLOGY: Single incident unlikely to block M&A absent systemic issues] |

**Financial Exposure Summary:**
- **FAA Emergency Equipment:** $15,000-$25,000 (probable settlement)
- **DOT Tarmac Delay:** $100,000-$300,000 (probable settlement)
- **Combined Enforcement Exposure:** $115,000-$325,000
- **Legal/Regulatory Defense Costs:** $150,000-$300,000
- **Total Estimated Cost:** $265,000-$625,000

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. **Parallel Settlement Strategy:** Pursue simultaneous resolution of both matters
2. **Comprehensive Remediation:** Submit unified corrective action plan addressing both violations
3. **DOT/FAA Coordination:** Request inter-agency coordination to avoid duplicative review
4. **Acquisition Disclosure:** Full transparency in DOT fitness filing and FAA certificate application
5. **Escrow/Holdback:** Consider $500K-$1M escrow for enforcement liabilities in purchase agreement

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Regulatory Approval Pathway

The Global Aviation Holdings acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines faces a **COMPLEX, MULTI-AGENCY, MULTI-JURISDICTION** regulatory approval process with the following characteristics:

**Baseline Approval Timeline: 150-210 days**

| Regulatory Body | Review | Probable Timeline | Critical Issue |
|----------------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **FAA** | Certificate transfer, ETOPS/CAT II validation | 120-180 days | Management fitness, proving runs |
| **DOT** | Foreign ownership citizenship determination | 90-150 days | CPPIB "actual control" analysis |
| **Mexico AFAC** | Permit continuation | 30-60 days | Bilateral agreement compliance |
| **Transport Canada** | FAOC amendment | 45-90 days | Non-transferability of license |
| **FAA Slot Admin** | LGA/DCA slot confirmation (if required) | 15-45 days | Use-or-lose compliance during transition |

**Critical Path:** DOT foreign ownership review (90-150 days) running parallel to FAA certificate transfer (120-180 days)

### B. Key Findings and Risk Assessment

**FINDING 1: DOT Foreign Ownership "Actual Control" is Primary Regulatory Risk**

- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Probability of Requiring Restructuring:** 60-70%
- **Financial Exposure:** $500K-$1.5M (legal/advisory); 60-120 day timeline extension
- **Basis:** CPPIB single foreign investor holding 30% equity exceeds typical passive investor threshold; Northwest/KLM precedent demonstrates DOT scrutiny even with Open Skies countries; totality-of-circumstances analysis requires full governance document review
- **Recommendation:** Immediate review of all CPPIB governance rights; pre-filing consultation with DOT Office of International Aviation; prepare governance restructuring options (voting trust, board limitations, veto elimination)

**FINDING 2: FAA Certificate Transfer Timeline Extends Beyond Statutory 90-Day Minimum**

- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Realistic Timeline:** 150-180 days (baseline) to 210-270 days (if complications)
- **Financial Exposure:** $1M-$3M per month in delayed closing costs
- **Basis:** Multi-factor process including management personnel vetting, OpSpecs amendment for ETOPS 120/CAT II/international ops, potential proving runs, parallel DOT fitness review
- **Recommendation:** Build 180-day regulatory approval timeline into purchase agreement Outside Date; initiate FAA pre-application consultation 90-120 days pre-signing

**FINDING 3: International Route Authorities at Material Risk Without Proactive Engagement**

- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Revenue at Risk:** $170M+ annually (9% of total revenue)
- **Probability of Delay:** 35-45%
- **Basis:** Mexico AFAC and Transport Canada both require prior authorization before change of control; licenses are non-transferable; 40% foreign equity may trigger heightened scrutiny under bilateral agreements
- **Recommendation:** Concurrent with U.S. regulatory filings, initiate informal consultations with Mexico AFAC and Transport Canada; consider temporary operational arrangements if approval delays threaten route continuity

**FINDING 4: Airport Slot Portfolio ($256M-$400M) Generally Protected Under Industry Practice**

- **Risk Level:** LOW (automatic continuation probable)
- **Probability of Loss:** <5% (partial); <1% (substantial)
- **Deal Economics Impact:** Slots represent 9-14% of purchase price; critical to United/Delta/American CPA hub feed
- **Basis:** Precedent airline M&A transactions treat slots as continuing with operating certificate; no separate transfer application required if certificate continuity maintained
- **Caution:** Certificate re-issuance (vs. amendment) could create ambiguity; DOT citizenship determination delay could suspend slot use pending resolution
- **Recommendation:** Pre-filing consultation with FAA Slot Administration Office; prophylactic use-or-lose waiver request; operational continuity plan to avoid any gap

**FINDING 5: Pending Enforcement Matters Pose Minor Financial Risk, Minimal Timeline Impact**

- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Financial Exposure:** $265K-$625K (settlements + legal costs)
- **Timeline Impact:** 30-45 days if FAA requests proof of corrective action
- **Basis:** $25K emergency equipment penalty and $100K-$300K tarmac delay penalty are immaterial to $2.8B transaction; single incidents unlikely to reveal systemic safety issues
- **Recommendation:** Immediate settlement negotiations for both matters; unified corrective action plan; proactive disclosure in FAA/DOT filings; $1M escrow in purchase agreement for enforcement liabilities

### C. Strategic Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: Restructure CPPIB Governance Rights Pre-Filing (Critical)**

**Actions:**
1. Obtain full set of CPPIB governance documents
2. Map all provisions DOT could construe as "actual control":
   - Board appointment rights → Limit to observer only OR exclude from competitive/international decisions
   - Veto rights over M&A, capex, management → Eliminate or convert to information rights only
   - Supermajority voting → Ensure U.S. investors retain unilateral control over operational decisions
3. Negotiate revised investor rights agreement with CPPIB before DOT filing
4. Consider voting trust structure for equity above 25% threshold (Northwest/KLM precedent)

**Timeline:** 60-90 days pre-filing to allow negotiation and documentation

**Cost-Benefit:** $500K-$1M upfront legal/advisory costs to restructure vs. $1.5M+ and 60-120 day delay if DOT mandates restructuring post-filing

**Recommendation 2: Comprehensive Pre-Filing Regulatory Strategy (90-120 Days Pre-Closing)**

**FAA Strategy:**
1. **T-120 days:** Informal consultation with FAA Flight Standards District Office
2. **T-90 days:** Formal certificate transfer application under 14 C.F.R. § 119.35
3. Include in application:
   - Comprehensive transition plan (FAA Order 8900.1)
   - Management personnel designations and qualifications
   - OpSpecs continuity memo for ETOPS 120, CAT II, international ops
   - Proving run plan (if FAA deems necessary)
4. **T-60 days:** Concurrent slot administration consultation
5. **T-30 days:** Finalize proving run schedules

**DOT Strategy:**
1. **T-90 days:** Fitness determination filing under 14 C.F.R. Part 204
2. Include comprehensive "actual control" analysis:
   - Organizational charts showing U.S. citizen control
   - All governance documents (LP agreement, investor rights, bylaws)
   - Management bios demonstrating U.S. citizen leadership
   - Explanation of CPPIB governance restrictions
3. **T-60 days:** Anticipate DOT information requests; prepare supplemental submissions
4. **T-30 days:** Negotiate any required governance modifications

**International Strategy:**
1. **T-90 days:** Informal consultations with Mexico AFAC and Transport Canada
2. **T-60 days:** Formal applications for permit/FAOC continuations
3. **T-30 days:** Follow-up on approvals; contingency planning for any delays

**Recommendation 3: Purchase Agreement Provisions to Allocate Regulatory Risk**

**Closing Conditions:**
- FAA certificate transfer approved **without material restrictions**
- DOT citizenship determination issued **without equity restructuring requirement**
- Mexico AFAC and Transport Canada approvals obtained **for all current routes**
- No more than **10% of LGA/DCA slots forfeited**

**Outside Date:**
- **Initial:** 180 days from signing
- **Automatic Extension:** +90 days if only regulatory approvals pending and buyer in compliance
- **Termination Rights:** Either party if 270 days exceeded

**Purchase Price Adjustment:**
- **Slot Forfeiture:** Dollar-for-dollar reduction (up to $400M cap)
- **Route Authority Denial:** 2x annual revenue from denied routes (present value calculation)

**Reverse Termination Fee:**
- **CPPIB Restructuring Failure:** If DOT requires CPPIB equity restructuring and CPPIB refuses to accept, buyer pays $[X]M reverse termination fee
- **Foreign Ownership Denial:** If DOT denies citizenship due to buyer's ownership structure (not seller's condition), buyer pays $[X]M reverse termination fee

**Cooperation Covenant:**
- Buyer and Seller covenant to cooperate fully in obtaining regulatory approvals
- Seller to maintain operations, slots, and route authorities during pendency
- Buyer to use "reasonable best efforts" to restructure governance if DOT requires

**Recommendation 4: Enforcement Matter Resolution (Immediate)**

**FAA Emergency Equipment Violation (FAA-2024-1158):**
- Initiate settlement discussions immediately
- Target: $15,000-$20,000 settlement with comprehensive corrective action plan
- Timeline: Resolve within 60-90 days
- Certificate Application Impact: Disclose with proof of corrective action

**DOT Tarmac Delay Investigation (DOT-OST-2024-0089):**
- Proactive engagement with DOT Aviation Consumer Protection
- Target: $100,000-$200,000 settlement (weather mitigation, single incident)
- Timeline: Resolve by Q1 2025 (pre-closing probable)
- DOT Fitness Filing Impact: Disclose with corrective action and compliance history

**Unified Remediation:**
- Single corrective action plan addressing both matters
- Demonstrate comprehensive safety culture and compliance commitment
- $1M escrow in purchase agreement for final settlement amounts

### D. Cross-Domain Flagging for Memorandum Synthesis

**Regulatory → Commercial Contracts:**
- United/Delta/American CPAs likely require FAA/DOT approval as closing condition
- CPA consent provisions may contain foreign ownership change triggers
- Route authority delays (Mexico/Canada) could breach CPA service level obligations
- **Recommendation for Contracts Specialist:** Review all three CPAs for regulatory approval conditions and foreign ownership provisions

**Regulatory → Employment/Labor:**
- All five Part 119.65 management positions (Director of Safety, Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, Director of Maintenance, Chief Inspector) must be U.S. citizens
- Management retention during 150-210 day approval process critical
- CPPIB cannot have role in selecting/removing key management
- **Recommendation for Employment Specialist:** Management retention agreements with regulatory approval as condition; confirm citizenship status of key personnel

**Regulatory → Securities/Disclosure:**
- DOT fitness determination requires disclosure of all 10%+ investors
- Foreign ownership structure must be disclosed in FAA certificate application
- Pending enforcement matters must be disclosed
- **Recommendation for Securities Specialist:** Public disclosure of CPPIB structure if GAH later seeks public offering

**Regulatory → Valuation:**
- Slot portfolio valuation ($256M-$400M) contingent on FAA confirmation
- International route authority denials would impair $170M+ annual revenue (9% of total)
- 60-180 day approval delay creates time value of money impact
- **Recommendation for Valuation Specialist:** Risk-adjust purchase price for probability-weighted regulatory outcomes; present value discount for extended approval timeline

**Regulatory → Corporate Governance:**
- CPPIB board appointment rights, veto rights, management selection rights all subject to DOT "actual control" scrutiny
- May require voting trust, board restrictions, consent eliminations
- **Recommendation for Corporate Specialist:** Governance document review; restructuring options analysis

### E. Outstanding Questions Requiring Further Investigation

1. **What specific governance rights does CPPIB have in the GAH Limited Partnership Agreement and Investor Rights Agreement?**
   - Board appointment: How many seats? Observer rights? Committee appointments?
   - Veto rights: Which corporate actions require CPPIB consent?

### F. Probability-Weighted Timeline Scenarios

**Optimistic Scenario (20% Probability):**
- CPPIB governance rights are minimal; DOT approves structure as-is
- FAA determines certificate amendment (not re-issuance); no proving runs required
- International regulators approve within 30-45 days
- Enforcement matters settled pre-filing
- **Total Timeline:** 120-150 days
- **Cost:** $1M-$2M (legal/regulatory fees)

**Base Case Scenario (55% Probability):**
- DOT requires minor governance modifications (board restrictions, veto elimination)
- FAA requires management personnel re-qualification review and limited proving runs
- International approvals take 60-90 days
- One enforcement matter still pending at closing (escrow resolution)
- **Total Timeline:** 150-210 days
- **Cost:** $2M-$4M (legal/regulatory + holding costs)

**Adverse Scenario (20% Probability):**
- DOT requires material governance restructuring (voting trust, CPPIB equity reduction)
- FAA requires comprehensive proving runs for ETOPS 120 and CAT II re-authorization
- Mexico or Canada delays permit approval due to foreign ownership concerns
- Enforcement matters reveal additional unreported violations
- **Total Timeline:** 210-300 days
- **Cost:** $5M-$10M (legal/regulatory + restructuring + extended holding costs)

**Deal-Killer Scenario (5% Probability):**
- DOT determines CPPIB has effective control; requires CPPIB exit from transaction
- FAA uncovers systemic safety issues during certificate transfer review
- Substantial slot forfeiture (>25% of LGA/DCA portfolio)
- **Total Timeline:** Deal termination
- **Cost:** $50M-$150M (breakup fee + opportunity cost)
