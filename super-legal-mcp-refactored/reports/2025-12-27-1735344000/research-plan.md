## ANTICIPATED CROSS-REFERENCE PATTERNS

Based on legal domains identified, these cross-domain connections are EXPECTED:

| Pattern | Source Domain | Target Domain | Legal Doctrine | Priority |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | DOT Foreign Ownership | FAA Certification | U.S. citizen control required for both FAA certificate and DOT authority, CPPIB 40% equity creates parallel risk | HIGH |
| 2 | United CPA Change of Control | FAA/DOT Transfer | United consent likely contingent on FAA/DOT approvals, 90-day United notice overlaps with regulatory timelines | HIGH |
| 3 | ALPA Strike Risk | CPA Stability | Pilot strike = complete shutdown, triggers CPA early termination (United <95% completion), cascading revenue loss | HIGH |
| 4 | International Permits | FAA Certificate | Foreign governments review U.S. carrier fitness, FAA certificate suspension blocks international ops | HIGH |
| 5 | Aircraft Lease Expirations | CPA Performance | 45 aircraft lease expirations 2026-2028, if not renewed/replaced, insufficient aircraft to meet CPA block hour commitments | MEDIUM |
| 6 | Maintenance Reserve Shortfall | Aircraft Leases | $29M shortfall, if aircraft returned in poor condition, lessors claim shortfall + return costs, compounds exposure | MEDIUM |
| 7 | JetBlue Slot Dispute | CPA Revenue | Lose 8 LGA slots = reduce 8 daily flights, United CPA revenue impacted, may affect performance metrics | MEDIUM |
| 8 | EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination | Labor Relations | Martinez PWFA case, if EEOC finds violation, emboldens other employees/AFA union, affects labor negotiations | LOW |
| 9 | Tarmac Delay Penalty | CPA Performance | DOT violation affects customer satisfaction scores, United/Delta/American factor into bonus payments, reputation damage | LOW |
| 10 | FAA Enforcement | Insurance/Risk | Regulatory violations affect aviation insurance premiums, some policies have regulatory exclusions | LOW |

**Specialist Instruction:** Flag findings that trigger these patterns in your Executive Summary under "Cross-Domain Impacts" heading.

## RESEARCH QUALITY STANDARDS

### For Each Specialist Report:
- [ ] Executive Summary: 2,000-5,000 words, self-contained
- [ ] All critical issues from checklist addressed (or noted as N/A with reason)
- [ ] Quantified exposure ranges for material findings
- [ ] Cross-domain impacts flagged with target section references
- [ ] Bluebook citations with database provenance (CFR, U.S.C., case reporters)
- [ ] Recommendations: specific, actionable, tied to legal authority

### Citation Density Targets:
| Report Type | Target Citations | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Regulatory | 60-100 | Heavy CFR/statutory |
| Case Law | 40-80 | Focus on holdings |
| Employment | 50-90 | RLA + Title VII + NMB |
| Commercial | 40-80 | Contract + statutory |

---

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| GAH has 60% voting via super-voting shares | User-provided transaction structure | If KKR voting <60%, foreign ownership non-compliance risk |
| United CPA has change of control consent requirement | User-provided Section 12.4 reference | If no consent required, lower closing risk |
| ALPA CBA expires 12/2026 with negotiations in mediation | User-provided negotiation status | If CBA extended or TA reached, strike risk eliminated |
| All 145 aircraft on operating leases | User-provided fleet structure | If any owned, asset transfer complexity |
| SkyWest is still public post-SPAC 2021-2022 | User-provided ownership history | If private, no SEC disclosure obligations |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- GAH operating agreement actual control provisions (CPPIB special rights) - require document review
- United CPA full text (change of control exact language) - require data room access
- ALPA negotiation proposals/counterproposals (wage details) - require labor files
- JetBlue slot lease full text (automatic renewal clause) - require contract review
- Maintenance reserve balances by lessor - require lessor statements

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:**
1. FAA/DOT regulatory approvals (T1) are critical path for closing (90-120 days)
2. United CPA consent (T2) likely contingent on FAA/DOT approvals (parallel but dependent)
3. International permits (T1) can proceed in parallel with FAA/DOT (30-90 days, shorter than domestic)
4. ALPA negotiations (T3) timeline independent of acquisition (CBA expires 12/2026), but strike would block closing

**Potential Issues:**
- If CPPIB has special rights (Board seats >15% voting, veto rights) → DOT actual control finding → Deal termination
- If United withholds consent → Either terminate deal OR restructure (e.g., retain SkyWest management, offer United enhanced terms)
- If FAA questions GAH aviation expertise → Delay 3-6 months for enhanced due diligence, proving runs

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If T1 finds CPPIB actual control risk → HIGH priority, immediate DOT counsel engagement
- If T2 finds United CPA consent not obtainable → Deal-blocking, consider walk-away
- If T3 finds ALPA strike imminent (NMB release + cooling off) → Close before strike or delay closing

**Financial Impact Aggregation (Rule 21):**
Based on critical issues checklist, expect these quantified findings:
- FAA/DOT enforcement: $110K-$525K
- JetBlue slot replacement: $40M-$64M (if dispute lost)
- ALPA wage increase: $17M-$32M annually (ongoing)
- Aircraft lease returns: $90M-$180M (over 3 years)
- Maintenance reserves: $29M shortfall
- EEOC settlement: $50K-$500K

Total quantified exposure: >$150M → Triggers Rule 21 financial-analyst in Phase 3

**Impact on $2.8B Purchase Price:**
- Gross Exposure as % of Purchase Price: **45.7% - 86.1%**
- Probability-Weighted Impact: **22.7% - 42.9%** of purchase price
- **Conclusion:** Material consent leverage from United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, combined with ALPA strike risk and aircraft lease consent costs, represents $635M-$1.2B expected transaction cost.

### CROSS-REFERENCE PATTERNS (Mandatory in Memo)

Critical cross-domain connections requiring explicit treatment in final memorandum:

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. ✅ DOT Foreign Ownership → FAA Certificate: DOT citizenship prerequisite for FAA approval; 60-70% probability governance restructuring adds 60-120 days
2. ✅ United CPA Consent → DOT/FAA Approvals: United likely conditions consent on regulatory approvals; circular dependency requiring phased approach
3. ✅ ALPA Strike → CPA Performance: Pilot strike grounds fleet, breaches United/Delta CPAs, risks $1.85B revenue base
4. ✅ Aircraft Lease Consents → CPA Fleet Requirements: Lessor holdouts reduce fleet below United/Delta minimum commitments

**Regulatory Cross-Impacts:**
5. ✅ FAA/DOT Enforcement → Fitness Review: Pending violations require settlement to avoid delaying certificate transfer
6. ✅ International Routes → Bilateral Agreements: 40% foreign equity triggers Mexico/Canada scrutiny; 30-90 day delays
7. ✅ Airport Slots → FAA Certificate: Slot continuation depends on certificate amendment vs. re-issuance; use-or-lose compliance critical

**Financial/Valuation Cross-Impacts:**
8. ✅ CPA Rate Reductions → EBITDA: 5-10% rate cuts reduce EBITDA 36%-72%; NPV impact $1.03B-$2.05B
9. ✅ Maintenance Reserves → Hidden Costs: $108M/yr reserves (37.5% above base rent); ASC 842 disclosure gaps

**Labor Relations Cross-Impacts:**
10. ✅ RLA Status Quo → Operational Flexibility: GAH cannot modify wages/benefits during indefinite NMB mediation
11. ✅ Single Carrier Determination → Seniority Integration: 85-95% probability NMB finding within 6-18 months
12. ✅ EEOC Martinez → Labor Relations: PWFA violation emboldens AFA-CWA organizing (60-70% campaign probability)

**Pattern Count:** 12 mandatory cross-references requiring "See Section [X]" citations in both source and target sections.

### Gaps Requiring Remediation

**None identified.** All 10 critical issues comprehensively addressed across T1-T4 specialist reports.

### Citation Optimization Notes

- **Total unique authorities:** 452 citations across 4 reports
- **Duplicate rate:** <15% (common statutory authorities cited across multiple reports; expected and appropriate)
- **Recommended footnote target for memorandum:** 250-350 unique citations (eliminate duplicates during synthesis)
- **Citation quality:** Excellent - Bluebook format, database provenance (FAA/DOT docket numbers), paragraph-level consolidation

### Additional Subagents Required

**None.** All transaction-critical legal domains comprehensively researched.

**Optional Enhancement:**
- If client requests financial impact analysis (Rule 21: quantified exposure >$1M), consider spawning **financial-analyst** for Monte Carlo simulation
- Not strictly necessary (commercial report provides NPV calculations), but could enhance board presentation
