## PRIORITY CLASSIFICATIONS

### CRITICAL Priority (Deal-Blocking Potential)
- **Question 1:** SEC examination deficiencies may constitute closing condition failure if settlement not reached
- **Question 3:** Key person departure could trigger $3.0B redemption cascade, forcing fund liquidation

### HIGH Priority (Material Financial Impact)
- **Question 2:** Marketing Rule violations expose Pinnacle to fines and reputational harm
- **Question 4:** MFN triggers create $3.6M annual recurring fee reduction
- **Question 5:** ERISA prohibited transactions carry 15% excise taxes plus DOL enforcement risk
- **Question 6:** Valuation uncertainty creates $50M-$75M potential NAV adjustment
- **Question 7:** Client concentration exposes Pinnacle to $41M-$141M revenue loss

### MEDIUM Priority (Significant but Manageable)
- **Question 8:** Performance fee recovery delay affects revenue projections but is contractually clear
- **Question 9:** Investment Company Act compliance is generally sound but requires monitoring of 12b-1 reforms
- **Question 10:** Non-compete enforceability affects retention strategy but has contractual protections (garden leave)
- **Question 11:** Tax characterization affects after-tax valuation but does not prevent closing

### LOW Priority (Risk Mitigation / Quantification)
- **Question 12:** Insurance coverage determines net vs. gross exposure but does not create new liability

## LEGAL METHODOLOGY NOTES

### Question Format Standards
Each question follows the **Under/Does/When** framework:
1. **Under** = Identifies the governing statute, regulation, or common law doctrine
2. **Does/Is/Will** = Frames the specific legal issue as a yes/no determination
3. **When** = Recites the determinative facts from the transaction context

This structure:
- Ensures questions are **answerable** with legal conclusions (not open-ended)
- Frames issues for **board-level decision-making** (approve/reject, proceed/halt, acceptable/unacceptable risk)
- Provides **specialist guidance** by identifying applicable law and material facts
- Supports **memorandum synthesis** by establishing section structure

### Prioritization Methodology
Questions are ordered by **deal-blocking potential**, which considers:
1. **Probability of occurrence** (likely, possible, remote)
2. **Magnitude of impact** (closing condition failure, >$10M exposure, <$10M exposure)
3. **Timing sensitivity** (must resolve before closing, post-closing risk, long-term risk)
4. **Regulatory intervention risk** (SEC/DOL denial or enforcement action)

Questions 1 and 3 are marked CRITICAL because they present the highest combination of probability and magnitude that could prevent the transaction from closing or materially alter its terms.

## RESEARCH COORDINATION NOTES

### For Specialists
When researching your assigned questions:
1. **Read the question carefully** to identify the legal standard, factual predicates, and requested determination
2. **Frame your Executive Summary** to directly answer the question with a brief answer (Yes/No/Probably Yes/Probably No/Uncertain) followed by supporting analysis
3. **Cross-reference other questions** where your findings have implications (e.g., SEC enforcement findings affect insurance coverage analysis)
4. **Quantify exposure ranges** to support financial risk aggregation
5. **Cite controlling authority** (statutes, regulations, case law) identified in the "Under" clause

### For Orchestrator
- Questions 1 and 3 (CRITICAL) should be monitored for deal-blocking findings requiring escalation
- Questions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 (HIGH) materially affect purchase price and terms but likely do not prevent closing
- Financial-analyst (T12) will aggregate all quantified exposures for probability-weighted valuation impact

### For Memo Generator
- Section III (Summary of Principal Legal Issues) should restate each question with a **Brief Answer** paragraph
- Each Discussion subsection (IV.A-IV.J) should begin by restating the relevant question(s)
- Brief Answers should be **board-ready**: clear yes/no/probably with concise reasoning (2-3 sentences)
