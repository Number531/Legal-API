## RESEARCH QUALITY STANDARDS

### For Each Specialist Report:
- [ ] Executive Summary: 2,000-5,000 words, self-contained
- [ ] All critical issues from checklist addressed (or noted as N/A with reason)
- [ ] Quantified exposure ranges for material findings
- [ ] Cross-domain impacts flagged with target section references
- [ ] Bluebook citations with database provenance (CFR, U.S.C., case reporters, SEC releases)
- [ ] Recommendations: specific, actionable, tied to legal authority

### Citation Density Targets:
| Report Type | Target Citations | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Securities | 80-120 | Heavy Advisers Act, Investment Company Act, SEC releases |
| ERISA | 50-80 | ERISA sections, DOL regs, case law |
| Case Law | 60-100 | Court opinions, Bluebook citations, holdings |
| Tax | 40-70 | IRC, Treasury Regs, Revenue Rulings |
| Commercial | 30-50 | Contract provisions, UCC, state law |

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Stock purchase structure | User prompt silent on structure | Asset purchase would require different tax analysis (Section 338, state transfer taxes) |
| No pending litigation against Pinnacle | Not disclosed in prompt | Material litigation would require separate litigation report |
| Form ADV filings current/accurate | Standard assumption | If filings deficient, additional SEC exposure |
| Client contracts standard institutional terms | Industry practice | Non-standard terms could create change of control issues |
| State Street Bank custody standard terms | Qualified custodian presumption | Non-standard terms could affect custody rule compliance |
| No foreign operations/clients | Prompt focuses on U.S. clients | Foreign operations would trigger FATCA, transfer pricing, nexus issues |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual insurance policy terms/limits (will assume industry-standard $10M E&O, $10M D&O, $10M fiduciary)
- Specific client contract change of control provisions (will analyze standard institutional terms)
- Pinnacle's exact SEC settlement negotiations status (will provide settlement strategy framework)
- Investment performance detailed attribution (will use aggregate benchmark data provided)

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:** Financial risk aggregation (T12) depends on T1-T11 completion to quantify all exposures.

**Potential Issues:**
- If SEC settlement negotiations advanced beyond Wells stage, may require real-time update from Pinnacle's counsel
- If key person departure imminent, $3.0B redemption exposure requires immediate closing condition
- If State Pension Plan A termination notice received, material adverse change consideration

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Any specialist finds >$50M single exposure → flag immediately
- Any deal-blocking regulatory condition discovered → escalate
- Any material misrepresentation in Form ADV vs. actual practices → stop and investigate

**Parallel Execution Optimization:**
- T1-T11 can execute fully in parallel (no dependencies)
- T12 sequential after T1-T11 (requires all quantified findings)
- Maximum efficiency: Invoke all 11 in single batch

**Questions Presented Generation:**
After research-plan.md complete, invoke research-plan-refiner in INITIAL mode to generate 8-12 Questions Presented in Under/Does/When format.

**RESEARCH PLAN STATUS:** READY FOR EXECUTION
**NEXT STEP:** Generate Questions Presented, then spawn T1-T11 specialists in parallel (Phase 1)
