### C. October 2023 SEC Examination Deficiencies

In October 2023, the SEC's Division of Examinations conducted a routine examination of Pinnacle Investment Management and identified deficiencies across five regulatory categories. The examination findings have not yet resulted in formal enforcement action, but SEC staff has indicated intent to recommend civil penalties pending Wells notice response. The deficiencies are summarized below:

#### 1. **Custody Rule 206(4)-2 Violations: No Surprise Examination (2021-2022)**

**Violation:** Pinnacle failed to arrange for annual surprise examinations of hedge fund assets for fiscal years 2021 and 2022, as required by Rule 206(4)-2(a)(4) under the Investment Advisers Act.³

**Background:** Rule 206(4)-2 requires that advisers with custody of client funds or securities undergo an annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant registered with the PCAOB, conducted at random dates, to verify the existence of client assets.⁴ The accountant must file Form ADV-E with the SEC after the examination.⁵ Advisers managing pooled investment vehicles may satisfy this requirement through an annual fund-level audit delivered to investors within 120 days of year-end.⁶

**Pinnacle's Failure:** Pinnacle manages two hedge funds (Opportunity Fund $4.8B, Credit Opportunities Fund $1.5B) structured as limited partnerships. For fiscal years 2021 and 2022, Pinnacle failed to engage an independent accountant to conduct surprise examinations. While the funds underwent annual PCAOB-audited financial statement audits (delivered to limited partners within 120 days), the audits did not qualify as surprise examinations under Rule 206(4)-2(a)(4) because they were conducted at scheduled year-end dates rather than random intervals.⁷

**SEC Staff Position:** The failure constitutes a willful violation of Rule 206(4)-2, exposing Pinnacle to civil penalties.

**Estimated Fine:** $50,000-$100,000 based on precedent analysis (discussed below in Section IV.D).

#### 2. **Valuation Deficiencies: Inadequate Documentation for $180M Illiquid Positions**

**Violation:** Pinnacle failed to maintain adequate written documentation supporting fair value determinations for $180M of illiquid securities held in the Credit Opportunities Fund, violating Rule 2a-5 (good faith valuation requirement) and the firm's fiduciary duty under Section 206.⁸

**Illiquid Holdings:**
- **DIP Loans:** $85M debtor-in-possession financing in bankruptcy proceedings
- **Distressed Debt:** $95M corporate bonds trading OTC with stale pricing

**Deficiency:** Pinnacle's DCF models used to value these positions lacked:
- Documented assumptions for discount rates (range: 12%-18%, no justification for rate selection)
- Sensitivity analysis for recovery scenarios (60%-80% recovery assumed, no stress testing)
- Independent pricing corroboration (no third-party valuation services engaged, single broker quote relied upon for $42M position)
- Valuation committee minutes (monthly meetings referenced in compliance manual but no documentation for 8 of 12 months in 2023)

**SEC Staff Position:** Fair value determinations must be made in good faith and supported by documented methodologies. Failure to maintain adequate documentation exposes Pinnacle to potential claims of overvaluation, inflated performance fees, and misrepresentation to limited partners.

**Estimated Fine:** $30,000-$50,000 based on precedent (Macquarie 2024: $70M penalty for overvaluing 4,900 CMOs, though Macquarie's case involved quantified investor harm).⁹

**Remediation Cost:** Pinnacle subsequently engaged Houlihan Lokey and Duff & Phelps as independent pricing services at $300,000 annually (ongoing expense).

#### 3. **Cross-Trading Disclosure Failures: Inadequate Form ADV Item 12 Disclosure**

**Violation:** Pinnacle executed eight cross-trades between client accounts in 2023 but failed to adequately disclose the practice and associated conflicts of interest in Form ADV Part 2A Item 12 (Brokerage Practices), violating Section 206(2) and Rule 206(4)-7 (compliance program deficiency).¹⁰

**Cross-Trade Structure:**
- **Parties:** Institutional separate account clients (Client A selling, Client B buying)
- **Securities:** U.S. Treasury bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds
- **Pricing:** Pinnacle obtained independent broker quotes to establish fair market value
- **No Commission:** Pinnacle did not charge commissions on the cross-trades (only standard advisory fees)

**Form ADV Deficiency:** Pinnacle's Form ADV Part 2A Item 12 contained boilerplate language: "We may engage in cross-trades between client accounts when it is in the best interest of both clients." The disclosure failed to:
- Identify the specific conflicts of interest (Pinnacle's incentive to favor one client over another, potential unfair pricing benefiting one side)
- Describe the pricing methodology (independent broker quotes, fair market value determination process)
- Explain client consent procedures (whether transaction-by-transaction consent was obtained under Section 206(3))¹¹

**Legal Framework:** Section 206(3) of the Advisers Act prohibits an adviser, acting as broker for a person other than the advisory client, from knowingly effecting any sale or purchase of securities for the client's account without (1) disclosing to the client in writing before completion of the transaction the capacity in which the adviser is acting, and (2) obtaining the client's written consent.¹² For internal cross-trades where the adviser receives no commission (only advisory fees), transaction-by-transaction consent under Section 206(3) is not technically required, but the adviser must maintain policies and procedures addressing how pricing is established, approvals required, and disclosure to clients about the practice and potential conflicts.¹³

Rule 206(3)-2 provides a safe harbor for agency cross transactions (where the adviser acts as broker and receives commissions) if the adviser obtains prospective written consent from clients after full disclosure of conflicts, provides written confirmations at or before completion of each transaction, and provides annual written summaries of all agency cross transactions.¹⁴

**SEC Staff Position:** Pinnacle's Form ADV disclosure was inadequate to satisfy the firm's fiduciary duty under Section 206(2) to make full and fair disclosure of all material conflicts of interest. Even though the cross-trades did not technically require transaction-by-transaction consent under Section 206(3) (no commission charged), the firm's failure to describe the practice and conflicts in Form ADV Item 12 constitutes a material omission.

**Estimated Fine:** $40,000-$60,000 based on precedent (Palmer Square Capital Management: $450,000 penalty for hundreds of illegal cross-trades 2014-2016; Lone Star Value Management: $100,000 penalty for cross-trades without disclosure/consent).¹⁵ Pinnacle's violation is less severe (8 trades, no commission, proper pricing), but disclosure deficiency remains material.

#### 4. **Allocation Policy Deficiency: Vague IPO/Limited Opportunity Disclosure**

**Violation:** Pinnacle's Form ADV Part 2A Item 12 contained vague language regarding allocation of investment opportunities among clients, failing to describe specific allocation methodologies for IPOs and other limited-availability securities, violating the firm's fiduciary duty and Rule 206(4)-7 (compliance program inadequacy).¹⁶

**Form ADV Language:** "We allocate investment opportunities among clients in a manner that is fair and equitable, taking into account client investment objectives, restrictions, and account size."

**SEC Staff Position:** This boilerplate language is insufficiently specific to allow clients to understand how Pinnacle allocates limited opportunities. The firm failed to disclose:
- Whether allocation is pro rata based on AUM, rotational, or based on other factors
- Whether certain clients receive priority (e.g., hedge funds vs. separate accounts)
- How IPO allocations are determined when demand exceeds supply
- Compliance pre-approval procedures for allocation decisions

**Incident Cited by SEC:** In March 2023, Pinnacle received an allocation of 50,000 shares in a technology IPO. The firm allocated 100% of shares to the Opportunity Fund (hedge fund), with zero allocation to institutional separate accounts employing similar growth strategies. No documentation existed explaining the rationale for this allocation decision, and no compliance pre-approval was obtained.

**Legal Framework:** Under Section 206(2), advisers owe clients a fiduciary duty to treat them fairly and not favor one client over another without adequate disclosure and client consent.¹⁷ Allocation of investment opportunities—particularly IPOs, hot issues, and limited-availability securities—presents material conflicts of interest requiring explicit disclosure in Form ADV.¹⁸

**Estimated Fine:** $20,000-$30,000 based on precedent (allocation deficiency typically bundled with other compliance program failures; SEC has imposed $10,000-$50,000 penalties for inadequate policies/procedures).

**Remediation:** Pinnacle subsequently adopted a written allocation policy in July 2024 establishing:
- Pro rata allocation based on AUM for limited opportunities
- Rotational allocation if pro rata not feasible
- Compliance pre-approval required for all allocations of IPOs, private placements, or securities with less than $10M available for allocation
- Quarterly reporting to CCO on allocation decisions

#### 5. **Compliance Program Rule 206(4)-7: Inadequate Annual Review**

**Violation:** Pinnacle failed to adequately document its annual compliance program review for fiscal year 2023, violating Rule 206(4)-7(b) as amended in 2023.¹⁹

**Background:** Rule 206(4)-7 requires each registered investment adviser to (1) adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act, (2) review those policies and procedures annually for adequacy and effectiveness, and (3) designate a CCO responsible for administering the program.²⁰ In August 2023, the SEC adopted an amendment requiring advisers to document the annual review in writing.²¹ The written documentation must be made available to the SEC upon request and is not protected by attorney-client privilege.²²

**Pinnacle's Failure:** For the annual review conducted in March 2024 (covering calendar year 2023), Pinnacle's CCO prepared a one-page memorandum to the CEO stating: "Annual compliance review completed. No material deficiencies identified. Policies and procedures remain adequate." The memo provided no analysis of:
- Testing performed during the review
- Areas of heightened risk identified
- Specific policies reviewed
- Effectiveness assessment methodology
- Recommendations for policy updates

The SEC examination staff characterized this documentation as a "check-the-box" exercise failing to satisfy the rule's requirement for meaningful review and documentation.

**Estimated Fine:** $10,000-$10,000 (low end of range given remedial nature of violation; SEC has imposed $10,000-$25,000 penalties for inadequate annual reviews).²³

**Remediation:** Pinnacle's CCO subsequently prepared a comprehensive 45-page annual review report for calendar year 2024 (completed January 2025), including:
- Detailed testing procedures for each policy area
- Identification of control weaknesses (custody, valuation, cross-trading, allocation)
- Corrective actions implemented
- Effectiveness metrics (e.g., percentage of trades reviewed by compliance, discrepancy rates)
- Board presentation in February 2025

### D. Marketing Rule 206(4)-1 Violations

In addition to the October 2023 examination deficiencies, SEC staff identified two violations of the Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1), which became effective November 4, 2022:²⁴

#### 1. **Testimonial Conflicts: Undisclosed Fee Reductions**

**Violation:** Pinnacle's website and marketing materials featured testimonials from four institutional clients praising the firm's investment performance and client service. Two of the four testimonial providers received preferential fee reductions (0.35% vs. standard 0.42% for comparable accounts) that were not disclosed in the testimonial, violating Rule 206(4)-1(b)(1) and (2).²⁵

**Marketing Rule Requirements:** Rule 206(4)-1(b) permits testimonials and endorsements if the adviser:
- Discloses clearly and prominently whether the person providing the testimonial is a client and whether compensated (directly or indirectly)²⁶
- Describes any material conflicts of interest resulting from the relationship between the adviser and the person providing the testimonial²⁷
- Provides written disclosure of material terms of compensation²⁸

**Pinnacle's Deficiency:** The testimonials included a footnote: "Client testimonials are provided voluntarily without compensation." This disclosure was misleading because two of the four clients received preferential fee reductions—a form of indirect compensation or benefit—that was not disclosed.²⁹ The reduced fees (0.35% vs. 0.42% = 7 basis points, equivalent to $2.45M annually on $350M combined AUM) constitute a material conflict of interest because:
- The fee reduction incentivizes clients to provide favorable testimonials
- Other clients and prospects viewing the testimonials are unaware that testimonial providers receive preferential pricing
- The reduced fees may influence the objectivity of the testimonials

**Estimated Fine:** $25,000-$50,000 based on Marketing Rule enforcement precedents (discussed in Section IV.D).³⁰

**Remediation:** Pinnacle removed all client testimonials from its website in December 2024 pending revision of disclosure language to comply with Rule 206(4)-1(b).

#### 2. **Performance Advertising: Survivorship Bias (Composite Exclusions)**

**Violation:** Pinnacle's Form ADV Part 2A and marketing materials advertised the "Large Cap Growth Composite" with a 10-year annualized return of 15.8%, significantly outperforming the Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark (14.2%). SEC staff discovered that Pinnacle excluded three closed accounts from the composite calculation, resulting in survivorship bias that inflated the reported performance by approximately 25 basis points (actual composite return should have been 15.55%).³¹

**Background:** Survivorship bias occurs when performance composites exclude accounts that were closed or terminated, typically because those accounts underperformed. This practice inflates reported returns because poorly performing accounts are removed from the calculation, leaving only the "survivors."³²

**Marketing Rule Requirements:** Rule 206(4)-1(a)(1) prohibits advertisements that include any untrue statement of material fact or are otherwise false or misleading.³³ Rule 206(4)-1(d) imposes specific requirements for performance advertising, including:
- Presentation of gross and net-of-fee returns³⁴
- Inclusion of all accounts in composites meeting stated criteria (no cherry-picking)³⁵
- Disclosure of material facts necessary to make the presentation not misleading³⁶

**Pinnacle's Deficiency:** The three excluded accounts were closed in 2018 ($45M), 2020 ($62M), and 2022 ($88M) after sustained underperformance relative to the benchmark (-180 bps, -220 bps, and -140 bps annualized, respectively). Pinnacle's compliance policies required inclusion of all large-cap growth accounts in the composite, regardless of closure status, for the periods during which the accounts were managed. The exclusion of these accounts violated both the firm's internal policies and the Marketing Rule's prohibition on false or misleading advertisements.

**Performance Impact:**
- **Reported return:** 15.8% (10-year annualized)
- **Corrected return:** 15.55% (including closed accounts)
- **Inflation:** 25 basis points
- **Benchmark return:** 14.2% (Russell 1000 Growth)
- **Reported outperformance:** 160 bps
- **Actual outperformance:** 135 bps

While the corrected composite still significantly outperformed the benchmark, the 25 bps inflation is material because:
- Performance advertising is a primary driver of new client acquisition
- Institutional investors rely heavily on track record comparisons
- Even small performance differences can influence asset allocation decisions in competitive bids

**Estimated Fine:** $25,000-$50,000 (Marketing Rule performance advertising violations typically result in $25,000-$100,000 penalties depending on severity and duration; Pinnacle's violation affected 3-4 years of marketing materials).³⁷

**Remediation:** Pinnacle recalculated all composites to include closed accounts (completed June 2024), updated Form ADV Part 2A with corrected performance figures, and distributed corrected performance reports to all current and prospective clients. The firm also enhanced compliance procedures to require quarterly audits of composite calculations by an independent third party (implemented August 2024).

---

### E. Additional Form ADV Deficiencies: Revenue Sharing Disclosure Gap

SEC examination staff also identified a disclosure deficiency related to revenue sharing arrangements:

**Issue:** Pinnacle receives $8.5 million annually from 450 broker-dealers and registered investment advisers in the form of 12b-1 fees (from mutual fund share classes) and marketing support payments (from distribution agreements). These payments are disclosed in the mutual funds' Statements of Additional Information (SAI) and in Form ADV Part 1A (Item 5.E and Item 14.B), but the disclosure is not sufficiently prominent in Form ADV Part 2A to allow retail investors and prospective clients to understand the conflict.³⁸

**Form ADV Part 2A Disclosure (Item 14.A):** "We may receive compensation from third parties in connection with the distribution of our mutual funds. Such arrangements are disclosed in the funds' prospectus and SAI."

**Deficiency:** The disclosure fails to:
- Quantify the aggregate amount received ($8.5M annually)
- Identify that the payments come from broker-dealers and RIAs who also recommend the funds to their clients (creating a conflict because these firms have a financial incentive to recommend Pinnacle's funds over competitors)
- Explain the conflict in plain English (Pinnacle has an incentive to maintain these relationships, potentially influencing fund management decisions)

**SEC Staff Position:** The disclosure in the SAI (a document most retail investors do not read) is insufficient. Form ADV Part 2A Item 14 requires clear and prominent disclosure of any economic benefit received from non-clients for providing advice, including the nature of the arrangement and how the conflict is addressed.³⁹

**Recommendation:** Pinnacle should revise Form ADV Part 2A Item 14 to include:
- Dollar amount of revenue sharing ($8.5M annually)
- Number of broker-dealers/RIAs paying compensation (450 firms)
- Explanation of conflict (recipients recommend Pinnacle funds to their clients, creating incentive to maintain payments)
- Mitigation measures (independent board oversight of distribution agreements, annual review of payment reasonableness)

**Fine Exposure:** This deficiency is less likely to result in a separate fine (typically addressed through enhanced disclosure requirements in settlement undertakings), but it contributes to the overall pattern of disclosure inadequacies that increases the aggregate penalty exposure.
