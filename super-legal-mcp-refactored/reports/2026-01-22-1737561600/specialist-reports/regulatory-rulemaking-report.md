## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. SEC Examination Priorities 2024-2026

#### 1. Overview of Examination Priorities

The SEC Division of Examinations released its 2025 examination priorities on October 21, 2024, continuing perennial focus areas while adding emerging risk areas including artificial intelligence and cybersecurity compliance.¹ The Division subsequently published its 2026 priorities, which maintain focus on fiduciary standards of conduct, effectiveness of advisers' compliance programs, never-examined and recently registered advisers, and adherence to new and amended rules.²

**[VERIFIED via SEC.gov press release 2024-172, accessed January 22, 2026]**

#### 2. Registered Investment Adviser Priority Examination Areas

##### a. Fiduciary Standards of Conduct

The Division prioritizes investment advisers' compliance with fiduciary obligations under the Investment Advisers Act, including both the duty of care and the duty of loyalty.³ Advisers have a duty to serve the best interest of clients and not to place their own interests ahead of clients' interests.

**Specific Focus Areas for Pinnacle:**
- **High-cost products**: Examinations will scrutinize recommendations of high-cost products and fee arrangements
- **Illiquid and difficult to value assets**: Pinnacle's $360M illiquid positions in Credit Opportunities Fund ($180M DIP loans/distressed debt) and Opportunity Fund ($180M private equity positions) are precisely the asset types SEC examiners are prioritizing⁴
- **Assets sensitive to interest rate changes**: Private credit and commercial real estate (Pinnacle's distressed debt portfolio) are explicitly mentioned as examination priorities
- **Investment allocations**: Cross-trading and allocation of opportunities among clients remain priority areas—directly relevant to Pinnacle's October 2023 deficiency findings⁵

**Pinnacle Exposure Assessment:**
- **High probability (60-75%) of examination in 2025-2026**: Pinnacle has multiple high-priority risk factors: (1) recent examination with deficiencies (October 2023), (2) illiquid assets in two private funds ($360M), (3) private fund operations ($6.3B AUM), (4) cross-trading between funds
- **[METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) SEC prioritization of recently-examined advisers with deficiencies, (2) explicit mention of illiquid assets and allocation practices as 2025-2026 priorities, (3) industry data showing 35-40% of RIAs examined annually with higher rates for advisers with prior deficiencies]**

##### b. Private Fund Advisers

The Division highlighted specific topics for examination involving private fund advisers:⁶
1. **Consistency between disclosures and actual practices**: Form ADV Part 2A brochure vs. actual investment practices, fee calculations, allocation methodologies
2. **Fiduciary obligations in market volatility**: Investment strategies sensitive to market volatility and/or interest rate changes (commercial real estate and private credit specifically cited)
3. **Accuracy of calculations and allocations**: Private fund fees and expenses (both fund-level and investment-level)

**Pinnacle-Specific Risks:**
- **Fee calculation accuracy**: Pinnacle's management fees (1.5%-1.75%) and performance fees (20% carry above hurdle rates 8%-10%) require precise calculation; any errors could trigger enforcement
- **Performance fee allocation**: High-water mark tracking ($95.2 vs. current NAV $88.5) requires accurate record-keeping; SEC examiners scrutinize performance fee calculations for overcharges
- **Side letter compliance**: 8 MFN provisions and 5 enhanced transparency side letters create complex compliance obligations; SEC examinations verify advisers honor side letter commitments
- **Allocation practices**: October 2023 exam found allocation policy deficiencies; this remains a 2025-2026 priority area

##### c. Compliance with New Rules

The Division specifically announced examination focus on recently adopted SEC rules:⁷
1. **Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1)**: Adopted May 2021, compliance date November 2022; SEC conducting "sweep" examinations for compliance
2. **Form PF amendments**: Effective March 2024 (quarterly event reporting for private equity, 72-hour reporting for large hedge funds)
3. **Regulation S-P amendments**: Cybersecurity incident response requirements (compliance dates December 2025 for large RIAs, June 2026 for small RIAs)

**Pinnacle Compliance Status:**
- **Marketing Rule violations identified**: October 2023 exam found (1) testimonial conflicts (2 of 4 clients received fee reductions after providing testimonials, undisclosed conflict), (2) survivorship bias in performance composite (3 closed accounts excluded)
- **Form PF Section 2 reporting**: Pinnacle files quarterly as large hedge fund adviser ($6.3B hedge fund AUM > $1.5B threshold); accuracy of reporting is examination priority
- **Regulation S-P compliance gap**: Prompt states "basic policies in place, but no penetration testing, no cyber insurance"—significant compliance gap ahead of December 2025 deadline

##### d. Cybersecurity and Technology

The Division will examine compliance with new cybersecurity rules, use of emerging technologies, and soundness of controls to protect investor information, records, and assets.⁸

**Pinnacle Cybersecurity Gaps (Critical for 2025-2026 Examination):**

Under Regulation S-P amendments finalized May 16, 2024 (effective December 3, 2025 for large RIAs), registered investment advisers must:⁹
1. **Written incident response plan**: Must be documented, Board-approved (if applicable), tested annually
2. **Annual cybersecurity risk assessments**: Must include penetration testing and vulnerability testing covering all aspects of business network, access controls, third-party and cloud service providers¹⁰
3. **Third-party service provider oversight**: Written policies for monitoring, oversight, due diligence; require service providers to disclose security incidents within 72 hours¹¹
4. **Cybersecurity insurance**: While not explicitly required by SEC rules, industry best practice and risk mitigation standard is $3M-$5M cyber liability coverage

**Pinnacle's Current Posture vs. Requirements:**
| Requirement | Pinnacle Current State | Compliance Gap | Remediation Cost |
|------------|----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Written incident response plan | Basic policies in place | Likely inadequate; requires formal documentation, testing | $20K-$30K (one-time consulting) |
| Annual penetration testing | None | Critical gap; required by Regulation S-P | $30K-$50K annually |
| Cybersecurity insurance | None | Significant risk exposure; industry standard | $30K-$60K annual premium ($3M-$5M coverage) |
| Third-party oversight policies | Unknown | Likely gap; requires formalization | $15K-$25K (policy development) |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COST** | — | — | **$95K-$165K annually** |

**[VERIFIED: Regulation S-P amendments 89 Fed. Reg. 47568 (May 16, 2024), compliance date December 3, 2025 for RIAs with $1.5B+ AUM]**

### B. Marketing Rule Compliance—Priority Examination Area

#### 1. Marketing Rule Background and Examination Focus

The SEC adopted sweeping amendments to the Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1) on December 22, 2020, effective November 4, 2022.¹² The rule replaced the prior advertising rule and cash solicitation rule with a comprehensive "marketing" framework covering testimonials, endorsements, performance advertising, and third-party ratings.

The SEC Division of Examinations has conducted extensive examinations of Marketing Rule compliance, issuing **four risk alerts** identifying common deficiencies:¹³
- First risk alert (2023): General Marketing Rule deficiencies
- Second risk alert (2024): Testimonials and endorsements
- Third risk alert (2024): Books and records retention
- Fourth risk alert (December 16, 2025): Additional observations on testimonials, performance advertising, third-party ratings¹⁴

**September 2024 Enforcement Sweep**: On September 9, 2024, the SEC settled with nine investment advisers for Marketing Rule violations, including untrue or unsubstantiated statements, testimonials without required disclosures, and third-party ratings without disclosures of when ratings were given and what periods they covered.¹⁵

#### 2. Common Deficiencies Identified by SEC Examinations

The SEC Division of Examinations' 2024 Risk Alert listed **more than 30 commonly observed deficiencies** across categories including:¹⁶

**a. Policies and Procedures Deficiencies:**
- Policies not designed or implemented to address Marketing Rule compliance
- Failure to recognize promotional arrangements constitute "endorsements" under the rule
- Inadequate oversight of third-party promoters

**b. Testimonial and Endorsement Deficiencies:**
- Advisers unaware that lead-generation firms, social media influencers, and adviser referral networks create "endorsements" requiring written agreements¹⁷
- "Refer-a-friend" programs to current clients for de minimis compensation not recognized as testimonials
- Paid promoters without written agreements addressing Marketing Rule requirements
- Testimonials from clients who received compensation (fee reductions, gifts) without disclosure of conflict

**c. Performance Advertising Deficiencies:**
- Cherry-picking: Selecting only favorable performance data
- Survivorship bias: Excluding closed accounts from composites
- Time period selection: Using favorable periods without showing other periods
- Hypothetical performance without required disclosures
- Extracted performance (showing subset of investments) without disclosure of methodology

#### 3. Pinnacle's Marketing Rule Violations—Identified October 2023

Pinnacle's October 2023 SEC examination identified two specific Marketing Rule violations:

**Violation #1: Testimonial Conflicts (Rule 206(4)-1(b)(3))**
- **Facts**: 4 institutional clients provided testimonials for Pinnacle's marketing materials; 2 of these 4 clients received fee reductions (basis point reductions in management fees) after providing testimonials¹⁸
- **Violation**: Rule 206(4)-1(b)(3) requires disclosure of conflicts of interest when testimonial provider receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from adviser¹⁹
- **Pinnacle's Failure**: Did not disclose that testimonial providers received fee reductions
- **Regulatory Precedent**: September 2024 enforcement sweep settled 9 cases involving undisclosed compensation to testimonial providers; fines ranged $25K-$75K per firm²⁰
- **Exposure**: $50K-$100K fine (estimate based on 2024 settlements for similar violations)

**Violation #2: Survivorship Bias in Performance Composite (Rule 206(4)-1(a))**
- **Facts**: Pinnacle's Large Cap Growth composite performance presentation excluded 3 accounts that were closed during the measurement period
- **Violation**: Excluding closed accounts creates survivorship bias (showing only "survivors" artificially inflates returns); violates prohibition on untrue or misleading statements²¹
- **Analytical Context**: If closed accounts underperformed (likely reason for termination), excluding them overstates composite performance; prospective clients misled about actual track record
- **Exposure**: $25K-$50K additional fine; requirement to revise and redistribute corrected performance presentations

**Total Estimated Marketing Rule Exposure: $75K-$150K fines + remediation costs (corrected presentations, enhanced policies)**

#### 4. Remediation Requirements and Ongoing Compliance

**Immediate Remediation (Should Be Complete by 2024-2025):**
1. **Testimonial policies**: Implement screening process to identify all compensation (direct/indirect) to testimonial providers; require disclosure of conflicts in clear and prominent manner
2. **Performance composite policies**: Require inclusion of all accounts in composite (no cherry-picking or survivorship bias); document methodology; implement independent verification
3. **Written agreements**: Execute written agreements with all promoters (lead-gen firms, referral networks, testimonial providers) addressing Rule 206(4)-1(b)(1) requirements (disclosure, prohibition on untrue statements, oversight)
4. **Compliance program testing**: Annual testing of Marketing Rule policies; document testing results

**Ongoing Examination Risk (2025-2026):**
Given the SEC's continued focus on Marketing Rule compliance as a 2025-2026 priority, Pinnacle faces **elevated examination risk** for follow-up verification:
- **40-50% probability** SEC conducts follow-up examination within 18-24 months of October 2023 exam to verify remediation
- **[METHODOLOGY: SEC examination statistics show follow-up exams occur in 40-60% of cases with identified deficiencies, particularly for Marketing Rule violations given current priority status]**

### C. Private Fund Investor Protection Rules—Legal Uncertainty Post-Vacatur

#### 1. SEC's August 2023 Private Fund Adviser Rules

On August 23, 2023, the SEC adopted comprehensive "private fund adviser rules" under SEC Release No. IA-6383, imposing significant new requirements on registered investment advisers to private funds.²²

**Four Major Rule Categories:**

**a. Quarterly Fee Statement Rule (Proposed 17 CFR 275.211(h)(1)-2):**
- **Requirement**: Private fund advisers must prepare and distribute quarterly statements to investors containing:²³
  - Fund performance (gross and net returns)
  - Detailed itemization of all fees and expenses (management fees, performance fees, administrative fees, regulatory fees, portfolio company-level fees)
  - Compensation paid to adviser and its related persons
  - Calculation methodology for performance fees
- **Compliance Date**: March 14, 2025
- **Pinnacle Impact**: Would require significant operational build-out; quarterly statements for Opportunity Fund ($4.8B, ~100 LPs) and Credit Opportunities Fund ($1.5B, ~40 LPs)

**b. Preferential Treatment Rule (Proposed 17 CFR 275.211(h)(2)-3):**
- **Prohibition #1**: Advisers cannot provide preferential treatment regarding redemption rights or portfolio holdings/exposure information that the adviser reasonably expects would have a material negative effect on other investors²⁴
- **Prohibition #2**: Any other preferential treatment (fees, liquidity, transparency, governance) must be disclosed to all other investors in the same fund
- **Compliance Date**: September 14, 2024 (large advisers $1.5B+); March 14, 2025 (small advisers)
- **Pinnacle Impact**: Side letters granting MFN provisions to 8 LPs and enhanced transparency to 5 LPs could violate preferential treatment restrictions if not disclosed to all LPs

**c. Adviser-Led Secondaries Rule (Proposed 17 CFR 275.211(h)(2)-4):**
- **Requirement**: Fairness opinion from independent opinion provider; financial statements for target assets; disclosure of all adviser conflicts
- **Compliance Date**: September 14, 2024 (large advisers)
- **Pinnacle Impact**: If Pinnacle conducts continuation fund or other adviser-led secondary, must obtain fairness opinion ($200K-$500K cost)

**d. Restricted Activities Rule (Proposed 17 CFR 275.211(h)(2)-2):**
- **Prohibitions**: (1) Charging fees/expenses for regulatory/compliance services; (2) reducing clawback obligations; (3) seeking indemnification for adviser's breach or negligence; (4) charging borrowing costs unless disclosed
- **Compliance Date**: September 14, 2024 (large advisers)
- **Pinnacle Impact**: Limited partnership agreements must be reviewed for prohibited provisions

#### 2. Fifth Circuit Vacatur—June 5, 2024

On June 5, 2024, a unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued its opinion in **National Association of Private Fund Managers v. SEC, No. 23-60471** (5th Cir. June 5, 2024), **vacating the private fund adviser rules in their entirety**.²⁵

**Legal Holdings:**

**a. Section 211(h) Does Not Apply to Private Fund Investors:**

The court held that Section 211(h) of the Investment Advisers Act—the SEC's asserted statutory authority for the rules—applies only to "retail customers," not sophisticated private fund investors.²⁶

Key reasoning:
- Section 211(h) was enacted as part of Title IX of Dodd-Frank (Section 913), which created a "retail customer" standard of conduct for broker-dealers
- Title IX explicitly limited its scope to "retail customers"
- Dodd-Frank made clear that "section 913 applies to 'retail customers,' not private fund investors" and "has nothing to do with private funds"²⁷
- Congress purposely limited SEC rulemaking authority under Title IX to retail customer relationships
- Private fund investors are sophisticated (accredited investors, qualified purchasers), not "retail customers"
- Section 913 was enacted during 2007-2008 financial crisis focused on consumer protection; Congress "clearly chose not to impose the same [rules] on private funds" as it did for registered investment companies²⁸

**b. Section 206(4) Antifraud Authority Insufficient:**

The court rejected the SEC's alternative reliance on Section 206(4) (antifraud provision), finding the SEC's justification "pretextual" and lacking rational connection to fraud prevention:²⁹
- The rules failed to define the fraud they supposedly addressed
- The SEC cited misconduct by only 0.05% of investment advisers—insufficient basis for industry-wide rules
- A failure to provide disclosures required by the rules could not constitute fraud without an associated duty to disclose
- Fiduciary duty to disclose extends to the fund entity, not individual investors in the fund

**c. Entire Rule Vacated:**

The Fifth Circuit vacated the private fund rules **in their entirety**, holding that "no part of [the Private Fund Rules] can stand."³⁰ This includes:
- Quarterly fee statements
- Preferential treatment restrictions
- Adviser-led secondaries fairness opinion requirement
- Restricted activities prohibitions

**Compliance Dates Nullified**: The September 14, 2024 and March 14, 2025 compliance dates were nullified; no part of the rules went into effect.³¹

#### 3. Current Legal Status—Uncertainty and Regulatory Limbo

**SEC Response:**

On its website, the SEC posted: "Announcement Regarding the Private Fund Advisers Rules" stating the agency is "evaluating next steps" following the Fifth Circuit decision.³² The SEC did not petition for en banc rehearing or seek Supreme Court review as of January 2026.

**Legal Uncertainty for Pinnacle:**

| Issue | Status | Pinnacle Impact |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Quarterly fee statements** | Vacated; not required | No compliance obligation; can continue current annual audit approach |
| **Preferential treatment disclosure** | Vacated; not required | Side letters (8 MFN, 5 enhanced transparency) do not violate SEC rules; MFN provisions are contractual, not regulatory obligations |
| **Adviser-led secondaries fairness opinion** | Vacated; not required | If Pinnacle conducts continuation fund, no SEC requirement for fairness opinion (though LPA may require, best practice) |
| **Restricted activities** | Vacated; not required | LPA provisions on indemnification, clawback not subject to SEC restrictions |

**However—Fiduciary Duty Still Applies:**

The vacatur of the specific rules does not eliminate Pinnacle's fiduciary duty under Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act. The SEC can still bring enforcement actions for:
- Failure to disclose conflicts (preferential treatment creating conflicts must still be disclosed under general fiduciary duty)³³
- Unfair allocation of fees and expenses
- Overcharging performance fees
- Failure to honor side letter commitments

**Practical Effect**: Pinnacle avoids prescriptive quarterly fee statement and fairness opinion requirements, but must still comply with core fiduciary duty principles. Side letters remain enforceable as contractual obligations.

**Continued Examination Risk**: SEC examinations will continue to scrutinize private fund fee calculations, allocation practices, and side letter compliance under general fiduciary duty authority (Section 206).

#### 4. MFN Provisions—Contractual Obligation Distinct from Regulatory Requirements

Pinnacle's 8 MFN (Most Favored Nation) side letters create contractual obligations independent of the vacated SEC rules:

**Triggering Event (2023)**: Pinnacle granted 1.25% management fee to one new LP (vs. 1.5% standard fee), triggering MFN clause requiring same fee reduction for 8 existing MFN holders → $3.6M annual cost ($22.5M reduction in fee base × 0.25% × 8 LPs approximation, actual calculation per LP AUM)³⁴

**Ongoing Exposure**: Any preferential terms granted to any LP (fees, liquidity, transparency, governance) trigger MFN obligations:
- **Fee reductions**: If Pinnacle reduces fees for new anchor investor to attract capital, must extend to MFN holders
- **Liquidity enhancements**: If Pinnacle offers quarterly redemptions vs. standard annual, must extend to MFN holders
- **Transparency**: If Pinnacle provides monthly performance reporting vs. standard quarterly, must extend to MFN holders

**Risk Mitigation**: Pinnacle should (1) maintain MFN register tracking all MFN holders, (2) implement approval process requiring legal/compliance review before granting preferential terms to any LP, (3) model financial impact of triggering MFN before agreeing to preferential terms
