## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Pinnacle's Illiquid Asset Portfolio Overview

Pinnacle Investment Management manages **$360 million in illiquid Level 3 positions** across two hedge fund vehicles, representing material valuation challenges requiring sophisticated fair value determination frameworks:

**Credit Opportunities Fund ($180M illiquid positions):**
- Three debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans to companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
- Valuation methodology: Discounted cash flow (DCF) models
- Key assumptions: 15% discount rate, 60-80% recovery rates, 5× EBITDA terminal multiples
- Position details:
  - Company A: Anticipated emergence 2026, post-reorganization EBITDA $40M, DCF valuation $85M (cost basis $95M = $10M unrealized loss)
  - Company B: Liquidation scenario, asset sale recovery 65 cents per dollar, mark $42M (cost $55M = $13M unrealized loss)
  - Company C: Debt-to-equity restructuring, equity mark-to-model $53M (highly uncertain, range $20M-$80M)
- Independent pricing: Houlihan Lokey and Duff & Phelps provide quarterly quotes, services average marks, typical variance ±20%
- **SEC deficiency identified**: Inadequate documentation of DCF assumptions, no Chief Compliance Officer approval pre-2024

**Opportunity Fund ($180M illiquid positions):**
- Three pre-IPO private equity positions acquired through PIPE (private investment in public equity) placements
- Valuation methodology: Last financing round marks
- **Critical issue**: Stale pricing - 18 months since last financing round
- Example: If company raised Series D at $2B valuation in 2023, Pinnacle marks proportionate position at $60M
- Comparable public companies: Down 40% since 2023 peak, suggesting Pinnacle's marks may be overstated
- **Potential overvaluation**: $50M-$75M (if independent review requires markdown to reflect comparable public company multiples)
- **NAV impact**: 1-1.5% reduction across fund

**OTC Derivatives ($220M notional):**
- Interest rate swaps: Pay fixed 4.5%, receive SOFR (hedges interest rate risk on leveraged positions)
- Valuation: Level 2 fair value - broker quotes from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, averaged
- Counterparty risk: $8.5M mark-to-market in Pinnacle's favor, $6M collateral posted = $2.5M uncollateralized exposure

### B. Remediation Actions Post-SEC Examination (June 2024)

Following October 2023 SEC examination deficiencies related to valuation practices, Pinnacle implemented:

1. **Valuation Committee Established** (June 2024):
   - 5 members: Chief Financial Officer (chair), Head of Portfolio Management, Head of Risk Management, Chief Compliance Officer, Outside Director
   - Monthly meetings to review all Level 3 positions
   - Document valuation rationale and approve fair value determinations
   - Escalation protocol: Variance >15% from prior quarter or >10% from independent pricing service triggers Board Valuation Committee escalation

2. **Independent Pricing Enhancement**:
   - Contracted Houlihan Lokey and Duff & Phelps for quarterly independent valuations
   - Annual cost: $300,000
   - Services provide independent marks on all Level 3 positions using proprietary models

3. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - All DCF assumptions now formally documented (discount rates, recovery rates, terminal multiples)
   - CCO approval required for all Level 3 valuation methodologies
   - Surprise examination by Deloitte conducted 2023-2024 (custody rule compliance)

### C. Valuation Dispute Risk Profile

**Performance Fee Implications:**
- If NAV was overstated due to stale PIPE marks, performance fees were calculated on inflated NAV
- 20% incentive allocation on overstated returns
- **Clawback exposure**: General partner may be required to return overpaid performance fees to limited partners
- Estimated overpayment: $2M-$4M over 2-year period (20% carry on $50M-$75M overvaluation)

**LP Litigation Risk:**
- If material markdown required ($50M-$75M representing 1-1.5% NAV), limited partners may assert:
  - Breach of fiduciary duty (failure to fair value in good faith)
  - Negligent valuation (reliance on stale 18-month marks without adjustment)
  - Unjust enrichment (overpaid performance fees if NAV was overstated)
- Defense costs: $500K-$1M
- Potential settlement exposure: $1M-$3M

**Probability Assessment:**
- 40-50% likelihood that independent review will require markdown [METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) 18-month stale marks, (2) comparable public companies down 40%, (3) industry practice to adjust marks when public comparables move materially]

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Rule 2a-5 Fair Value Determination Framework

#### 1. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements

**Rule 2a-5 under the Investment Company Act of 1940** establishes comprehensive requirements for determining fair value in good faith.¹ The rule became effective March 8, 2021, with a compliance date of September 8, 2022.²

**Key Requirements:**

**(a) Board Designation of Valuation Designee:**
The fund's board of directors may designate an entity as the "valuation designee" to perform fair value determinations.³ Typically, the investment adviser serves as the valuation designee, subject to board oversight.⁴ Under 17 CFR § 270.2a-5(a)(1), the valuation designee must be:
- The fund's investment adviser (not a sub-adviser), OR
- If no investment adviser exists, an officer or officers of the fund

**Pinnacle Application**: Pinnacle Investment Management serves as the board-designated valuation designee for the Credit Opportunities Fund and Opportunity Fund. This designation was formalized in June 2024 following SEC examination deficiencies.

**(b) Reporting Requirements to Board:**

At least **quarterly**, the valuation designee must provide written reports to the board containing:⁵
1. Any reports or materials requested by the board related to fair value determination
2. A summary or description of material fair value matters that occurred in the prior quarter
3. Material changes to policies and procedures
4. Material valuation determinations requiring board escalation

At least **annually**, the valuation designee must provide written assessment of:⁶
1. The adequacy and effectiveness of the fair value determination process
2. Summary of testing results (backtesting, pricing service corroboration)
3. Assessment of resources allocated (personnel, technology, data sources)
4. Recommendations for enhancements

**Pinnacle Application**: The Valuation Committee (established June 2024) meets monthly and provides quarterly written summaries to the fund boards. The annual assessment was first completed in December 2024, six months after committee establishment.

**(c) Segregation of Duties:**

The valuation designee must **reasonably segregate fair value determinations from portfolio management** such that portfolio managers cannot determine, or effectively determine by exerting substantial influence on, fair values ascribed to portfolio investments.⁷

**Rationale**: This requirement prevents conflicts of interest where portfolio managers, whose compensation may depend on fund performance, could inflate valuations to enhance returns.

**Pinnacle Application**: The Valuation Committee includes the Chief Compliance Officer and an Outside Director, providing independence from portfolio management. However, the Head of Portfolio Management sits on the committee, creating potential conflict. **Best practice** would be to remove the PM from voting authority on valuations of positions they manage.

**(d) Board Oversight Obligations:**

When a valuation designee is appointed, the board must provide **oversight of the valuation designee's performance**, including:⁸
- Review of quarterly and annual reports
- Assessment of adequacy of resources and processes
- Approval of valuation methodologies for different asset classes
- Investigation of material variances or valuation disputes

**Pinnacle Application**: The fund boards receive quarterly reports and conduct annual reviews. Following the October 2023 SEC examination, board oversight was enhanced with the addition of a Board Valuation Committee (distinct from the management Valuation Committee) that reviews escalated items where variance exceeds 15% from prior quarter or 10% from independent pricing services.

#### 2. SEC Enforcement Precedents - Valuation Deficiencies

**Sciens Investment Management (May 2023):**⁹
The SEC charged Sciens Diversified Managers, LLC and its predecessor for **failing to adopt and implement reasonably designed written policies and procedures** concerning valuation of fund portfolio investments.

**Key Facts**:
- Sciens charged management fees quarterly based on NAV determinations
- Funds invested primarily in equity and debt of private companies with no readily available market pricing
- **Deficiency**: Inadequate policies for Level 3 valuations
- **Settlement**: Censure and cease-and-desist order (fine amount not disclosed in public order)

**Pinnacle Parallels**: Prior to June 2024, Pinnacle's DCF assumptions for distressed debt positions were not adequately documented. The absence of CCO approval for valuation methodologies mirrors the Sciens deficiency. Pinnacle's remediation (documented policies, CCO approval, independent pricing) directly addresses the Sciens enforcement priorities.

**Common SEC Examination Findings:**¹⁰
The SEC Division of Examinations has identified recurring valuation deficiencies in private fund examinations:
1. **Valuation practices contrary to written policies** - Funds applying methodologies inconsistent with disclosed policies
2. **Inadequate documentation** - Failure to document rationale for selecting particular comparable companies or discount rates
3. **Lack of written methodologies** - Policies lacking specific methodologies and key inputs for different asset classes
4. **Conflicts of interest** - Portfolio managers exerting influence over valuations without adequate oversight

**Pinnacle Exposure Analysis**: The October 2023 SEC examination identified valuation deficiencies similar to the patterns above. If the SEC pursues enforcement:
- **Expected settlement range**: $30K-$100K for valuation documentation failures
- **Remediation costs**: $1.2M-$1.8M (already substantially incurred through Valuation Committee establishment, independent pricing contracts, policy enhancements)
- **Reputational risk**: Limited, given proactive remediation and no evidence of intentional overstatement

### B. ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement Hierarchy

#### 1. Three-Level Fair Value Hierarchy

**ASC 820** (FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820) establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosure about fair value measurements.¹¹ The standard defines fair value as "the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date."

**Fair Value Hierarchy:**¹²

**Level 1: Quoted Prices in Active Markets**
- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Examples: Publicly traded stocks on NYSE, exchange-traded derivatives
- **Pinnacle**: None of the $360M illiquid positions qualify as Level 1

**Level 2: Observable Inputs Other Than Quoted Prices**
- Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, including:
  - Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
  - Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets
  - Observable inputs other than quoted prices (interest rates, yield curves, credit spreads)
  - Inputs corroborated by market data
- Examples: Corporate bonds valued using credit spreads, interest rate swaps valued using SOFR curve
- **Pinnacle**: OTC derivatives ($220M notional) qualify as Level 2 because they are valued using broker quotes based on observable SOFR curve

**Level 3: Unobservable Inputs**
- Unobservable inputs used when relevant observable inputs are unavailable
- Reflects entity's own assumptions about what market participants would use
- Requires significant management judgment
- Examples: DIP loans in bankruptcy, private equity pre-IPO positions, complex derivatives with no market activity
- **Pinnacle**: $360M in Credit Opportunities Fund distressed debt and Opportunity Fund PIPE positions are Level 3

#### 2. Level 3 Disclosure Requirements

Because Level 3 fair value relies on unobservable inputs, **enhanced disclosure and documentation** are required:¹³

1. **Quantitative Details About Unobservable Inputs**:
   - Discount rates, growth rates, terminal multiples
   - Recovery rate assumptions in bankruptcy scenarios
   - Comparable company selection criteria and adjustments
   - Probability-weighting for scenario analysis

2. **Description of Valuation Process**:
   - How unobservable inputs were developed
   - Whether inputs were derived from market data or entity-specific assumptions
   - Frequency of recalibration and backtesting

3. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Impact on fair value from changes in significant unobservable inputs
   - Range of reasonably possible alternative inputs

**Pinnacle Application**: The June 2024 enhancement of valuation policies requires documentation of all Level 3 inputs. However, the 18-month stale marks on PIPE positions suggest inadequate sensitivity analysis. If comparable public companies declined 40% but Pinnacle did not adjust PIPE marks, this indicates:
- Failure to consider reasonably available observable inputs (public comparables)
- Over-reliance on single data point (last financing round)
- Insufficient sensitivity analysis of market condition changes

#### 3. Prioritization of Inputs - Observable vs. Unobservable

ASC 820 requires that entities **maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs** when determining fair value.¹⁴

**Implication for PIPE Positions**: Even though PIPE positions are private securities (suggesting Level 3), the existence of comparable public companies that trade actively provides Level 2 observable inputs. Best practice requires:
- Identify comparable public companies in same industry, similar size, growth stage
- Apply public company multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E) to private company metrics
- Apply **discount for lack of marketability** (DLOM) typically 20-40% for pre-IPO companies
- Reconcile back to last financing round, explaining variance

**Pinnacle Deficiency**: The apparent failure to adjust 18-month-old PIPE marks despite 40% decline in comparable public companies violates the prioritization principle. A hypothetical calculation:

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Last financing round valuation (18 months ago) | $2.0B |
| Pinnacle's proportionate mark | $60M |
| Comparable public companies median EV/Revenue (current) | 3.0× |
| Private company revenue (estimated) | $500M |
| Implied valuation using public comps | 3.0× × $500M = $1.5B |
| Discount for lack of marketability (30%) | $1.5B × (1 - 0.30) = $1.05B |
| Implied Pinnacle mark using comps | $1.05B / $2.0B × $60M = **$31.5M** |
| **Current mark vs. Comparable-adjusted mark** | $60M vs. $31.5M = **$28.5M overstatement per position** |

If all three PIPE positions are similarly overstated: **3 × $28.5M = $85.5M potential overvaluation**. This exceeds the $50M-$75M estimate, suggesting material NAV impact.

### C. DCF Modeling for Distressed Debt

#### 1. Methodology Framework

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis** for distressed debt requires scenario-based modeling reflecting the binary outcomes common in bankruptcy: emergence as going concern vs. liquidation.¹⁵

**General Approach:**¹⁶
1. Forecast unlevered free cash flows over 3-5 year period (assuming successful reorganization)
2. Apply discount rate reflecting distress risk (typically 15-25% for companies in bankruptcy)
3. Calculate terminal value using exit multiples (4-7× EBITDA depending on industry and restructured capital structure)
4. Discount terminal value and interim cash flows to present value
5. Compare to liquidation scenario (asset sale, recovery rate assumptions)
6. Probability-weight scenarios if appropriate

**Discount Rate Selection:**¹⁷
For distressed companies, the discount rate must reflect **heightened risk**:
- **Range**: 15-25% (compared to 8-12% for healthy companies)
- **Components**: Risk-free rate + equity risk premium + distress premium + company-specific risk
- **Pinnacle's 15% rate**: At low end of range, appropriate only if emergence probability is high and post-reorganization capital structure is conservative

**Beta Adjustment**: The cost of equity beta should be re-estimated using the **updated debt-to-equity ratio** post-reorganization, as leverage typically declines dramatically (debt converted to equity).¹⁸

#### 2. Recovery Rate Analysis - Bankruptcy Scenarios

**Recovery rates** vary dramatically by seniority and bankruptcy outcome:¹⁹

| Instrument | Chapter 11 Reorganization | Chapter 7 Liquidation |
|------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| DIP Financing | 90-100% (super-priority) | 85-95% (first lien on assets) |
| Senior Secured | 70-90% | 50-70% |
| Senior Unsecured | 40-60% | 20-40% |
| Subordinated | 10-30% | 0-10% |

**Pinnacle's DIP Loans**: As debtor-in-possession financing, Pinnacle holds **super-priority claims** under 11 U.S.C. § 364(c)(1), meaning repayment priority over all other creditors except secured creditors to the extent of their collateral.²⁰

**Company A (Emergence Scenario):**
- Post-reorganization EBITDA: $40M
- Terminal multiple: 5× EBITDA = $200M enterprise value
- Less: Post-reorg debt (assume $50M senior secured remains)
- Equity value: $150M
- DIP loan: Repaid in full at par (assume $95M claim)
- **DCF value $85M suggests**: Either (a) present value discount from emergence date, or (b) probability-weighting of emergence vs. liquidation
- **$10M unrealized loss**: Indicates market doubt about full recovery or timing delays

**Company B (Liquidation Scenario):**
- Asset sale recovery: 65 cents per dollar
- Original loan: $55M cost basis
- Recovery: $55M × 0.65 = $35.75M
- **Current mark $42M**: Implies higher recovery rate (76%) or some combination of assets sold and going concern residual
- **$13M unrealized loss**: Reflects distressed exit

**Company C (Debt-to-Equity Restructuring):**
- DIP loan converted to equity in reorganized company
- Equity mark-to-model: $53M
- **High uncertainty range**: $20M-$80M (3× variance)
- **Valuation challenge**: Private company equity post-reorganization with no observable market
- **Appropriate methodology**:
  - Comparable company analysis (public companies in same industry post-bankruptcy)
  - Transaction multiples (recent distressed M&A in sector)
  - Discounted cash flow with scenario analysis
  - **Lack of market data** makes $20M-$80M range reasonable but highlights valuation risk

#### 3. Scenario Discounted Cash Flow (SDCF) Approach

Best practice for distressed debt valuation employs **Scenario DCF (SDCF)**:²¹

**Three Scenarios:**
1. **Base Case** (50-60% probability): Company emerges from Chapter 11, achieves projected EBITDA, debt repaid per plan
2. **Worst Case** (20-30% probability): Chapter 7 liquidation, asset sale at distressed multiples, recovery per liquidation waterfall
3. **Best Case** (10-20% probability): Faster recovery, higher exit multiples, early refinancing of DIP loan

**Probability-Weighted Valuation:**

| Scenario | Probability | DCF Value | Weighted Value |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Best Case | 15% | $100M | $15M |
| Base Case | 60% | $85M | $51M |
| Worst Case | 25% | $50M | $12.5M |
| **Probability-Weighted Fair Value** | | | **$78.5M** |

**Pinnacle's $85M mark** for Company A appears to reflect the base case only, without probability-weighting downside scenarios. This may **overstate fair value** by $6.5M ($85M - $78.5M) per the above illustrative analysis.

#### 4. Independent Pricing Service Role

Pinnacle contracts **Houlihan Lokey and Duff & Phelps** (now Kroll) for independent Level 3 valuations at **$300K annually**.²²

**Independent Pricing Service Methodologies:**²³
- Houlihan Lokey specializes in **Level 3 assets** (mark-to-model), with expertise in private equity, distressed debt, derivatives, and structured products
- Services provide independent DCF models, using proprietary databases of:
  - Bankruptcy recovery rates by industry and seniority
  - Distressed debt trading levels (even if not active market, broker quotes provide reference)
  - Exit multiples for companies emerging from Chapter 11
- **Typical variance**: ±20% from client's internal valuations is common for Level 3 assets given model uncertainty

**Pinnacle's Approach**: Average the marks from Houlihan Lokey and Duff & Phelks. This is **reasonable practice**, but:
- If variance exceeds 20%, should investigate which inputs differ (discount rate, recovery rate, probability-weighting)
- If independent services consistently value lower than internal marks, suggests potential overvaluation bias
- **Escalation threshold**: Variance >10% from pricing service triggers Board Valuation Committee review (appropriate)

**Valuation Committee Monthly Review**: The practice of **monthly meetings** to review all Level 3 positions exceeds regulatory minimums (quarterly) and represents best practice, particularly given SEC deficiency history.²⁴

---

### D. Private Equity PIPE Position Valuation

#### 1. PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) Overview

**PIPE transactions** involve private placements of securities in already-public companies to selected institutional accredited investors.²⁵ In the context of Pinnacle's Opportunity Fund, the term "PIPE" appears to refer to **pre-IPO private equity positions** acquired through private placements, with the anticipation of future IPO liquidity.

**Valuation Challenge**: Private company securities lack observable market prices, requiring mark-to-model approaches.

#### 2. Valuation Methodologies for Private Equity

**Three Common Approaches:**²⁶

**(a) Publicly Traded Comparable Companies Method:**
- Identify public companies in same industry, similar business model, comparable size
- Calculate valuation multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E)
- Apply multiples to private company's metrics
- Adjust for differences (growth rate, profitability, scale)
- Apply discount for lack of marketability (DLOM)

**(b) Transaction Comparables Method:**
- Review recent M&A transactions or financing rounds in sector
- Analyze transaction multiples paid
- Adjust for differences in deal terms, market conditions, timing
- Apply to private company metrics

**(c) Discounted Cash Flow Method:**
- Project future cash flows over 5-10 years
- Apply appropriate discount rate (cost of equity for minority interest)
- Calculate terminal value using exit multiples or perpetuity growth
- Discount to present value

**Pinnacle's Methodology**: Marking PIPE positions at **last financing round** valuation. This is the **transaction comparables approach**, using the most recent capital raise as the fair value indicator.

#### 3. Stale Marks Problem

**Critical Issue**: Pinnacle's PIPE marks are based on financing rounds from **18 months ago**, during which:
- Comparable public companies declined 40%
- Macroeconomic conditions changed (interest rates, inflation, growth expectations)
- Sector-specific headwinds may have emerged

**Stale Marks Analysis:**²⁷
During the COVID-19 pandemic, public markets quickly adjusted valuations in March 2020, but private equity valuations lagged until Q2 financials were released in August-September 2020 (5-6 month lag). During significant market-moving events, private equity managers tend to be **more conservative** with valuations, leading to lower volatility than public markets.

**However**: 18-month lag without adjustment is **excessive** and fails to incorporate observable market information from comparable public companies.

**International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines (IPEV):**²⁸
- Recommend **backtesting** - comparing actual liquidity events (sale, IPO, subsequent financing) to prior fair value estimates to assess valuation accuracy
- Require consideration of **market calibration** - using public market multiples to calibrate private valuations
- Emphasize **consistency** - applying methodology consistently across quarters, with adjustments when market conditions change materially

**Pinnacle's Failure to Adjust**: By maintaining 18-month-old marks despite 40% decline in comparables, Pinnacle:
- Violated the market calibration principle
- Failed to maximize use of observable inputs (ASC 820 requirement)
- Created **material risk** of NAV overstatement

#### 4. Discount for Lack of Marketability (DLOM)

Even if Pinnacle appropriately valued the private companies at last round valuations, an additional **discount for lack of marketability (DLOM)** should apply:²⁹

**DLOM Range**: 20-40% for pre-IPO private equity positions
**Rationale**:
- Cannot sell immediately (no public market)
- Illiquidity premium investors require
- Uncertainty about IPO timing and pricing
- Restrictions on transfer in shareholder agreements

**Pinnacle Analysis**: It is unclear whether Pinnacle applied DLOM when marking to last financing round. If the last round was a primary capital raise (company issuing new shares), the price paid by new investors already reflects arms-length negotiation. However, if market conditions have deteriorated, an **incremental DLOM adjustment** may be warranted.

**Example Calculation**:

| Step | Calculation | Value |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Last round valuation (18 months ago) | | $2.0B |
| Adjustment for comparable public decline | -40% | $1.2B |
| Discount for lack of marketability | -30% | $1.2B × 0.70 = $0.84B |
| Pinnacle proportionate ownership | 3% (assumed) | $0.84B × 3% = **$25.2M** |
| **Current Pinnacle mark** | | **$60M** |
| **Potential overvaluation per position** | | **$34.8M** |

If all three PIPE positions are similarly overvalued: **3 × $34.8M = $104.4M total overstatement**

**Refined Estimate Range**: Given uncertainty in assumptions, reasonable range is **$50M-$100M overvaluation** (consistent with assignment's $50M-$75M estimate, but potentially higher).

---

### E. Valuation Committee Governance

#### 1. Best Practices for Valuation Committee Structure

**Committee Composition:**³⁰
Most firms have a valuation committee responsible for valuation decisions or recommendations, with committee structure designed to enhance **independence and oversight capability**.

**Pinnacle's Committee (June 2024):**
- Chief Financial Officer (chair)
- Head of Portfolio Management
- Head of Risk Management
- Chief Compliance Officer
- Outside Director

**Assessment**:
- ✅ **Strengths**: Includes CCO and outside director (independence), CFO as chair (financial expertise), Risk Management (risk perspective)
- ⚠️ **Concern**: Head of Portfolio Management has direct conflict of interest (compensation linked to fund performance). Best practice would limit PM to **advisory/informational role** without voting authority on positions they manage.

#### 2. Roles and Responsibilities

**Valuation Committee Responsibilities Should Include:**³¹
1. **Policy Development**: Establish and maintain written valuation policies covering methodologies, inputs, frequency, escalation procedures
2. **Methodology Approval**: Approve valuation methodologies for each asset class (public securities, private equity, distressed debt, derivatives, real estate, etc.)
3. **Quarterly Review**: Review all Level 3 positions at least quarterly, approve fair values, document rationale
4. **Variance Investigation**: Investigate material variances from prior quarter, independent pricing services, or model expectations
5. **Conflict Identification**: Identify and manage conflicts of interest in valuation process
6. **Escalation to Board**: Escalate material issues, significant judgments, or disputes to fund board
7. **Annual Assessment**: Assess adequacy of resources, testing results, process effectiveness

**Pinnacle's Practices**: Monthly meetings (exceeds quarterly minimum), documentation of decisions, escalation threshold (>15% prior quarter or >10% from pricing service). These practices are **well-designed** and address SEC deficiency findings.

#### 3. Documentation Requirements

**FCA Findings (UK Regulator - Instructive for U.S. Practice):**³²
- Nearly all firms had governance arrangements for valuations, but **inadequate records of how valuation decisions were reached**
- Recommendations: Clear accountability regime, detailed record-keeping, documentation of:
  - Valuation inputs and sources
  - Rationale for methodology selection
  - Consideration of alternative methodologies
  - Resolution of disagreements among committee members
  - Basis for departures from independent pricing services

**Pinnacle's June 2024 Enhancement**: Implementation of documented DCF assumptions and CCO approval addresses documentation deficiencies. However, **lack of adjustment to PIPE marks** despite public comparable decline suggests:
- Either decisions were made and documented (indicating substantive valuation judgment failure), OR
- Decisions were not made (indicating process failure)

Both scenarios create **regulatory risk** and potential **LP dispute grounds**.

#### 4. Escalation Procedures and Thresholds

**Pinnacle's Escalation Framework:**
- **>15% variance from prior quarter**: Triggers Board Valuation Committee review
- **>10% variance from independent pricing service**: Triggers Board Valuation Committee review

**Assessment**: These thresholds are **reasonable and align with best practices**.³³

**Ad Hoc Valuation Triggers:**³⁴
Best practice includes defined process for ad hoc valuations (between quarterly marks) triggered by:
- Bankruptcy filing or restructuring announcement
- Material adverse development (fraud discovery, key customer loss, regulatory action)
- Merger announcement or financing round
- Public comparable experiencing dramatic decline (>30% in short period)

**Pinnacle Application**: The 40% decline in comparable public companies over 18 months should have triggered ad hoc review of PIPE positions. The absence of such review suggests:
