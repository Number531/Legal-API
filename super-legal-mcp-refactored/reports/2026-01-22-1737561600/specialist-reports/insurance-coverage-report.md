## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Target Company Profile

**Pinnacle Investment Management, Inc.** is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, operating as a registered investment adviser (RIA) since 1996 with the SEC (File No. 801-45678). As of December 2024, Pinnacle manages $42.5 billion in assets across multiple product lines:

- **Mutual Funds**: $12.8 billion AUM across 4 registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940

### B. Known Liability Exposures

**1. SEC Examination Deficiencies (October 2023)**

The SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) identified five categories of deficiencies:
- Custody rule violations (no surprise examination)
- Valuation inadequacies (Level 3 illiquid securities documentation)
- Cross-trading disclosure failures
- Allocation policy deficiencies
- Compliance program inadequacies

**Quantified Exposure:**
- Fines: $150,000 - $250,000 (estimated based on comparable settlements)

**2. ERISA Fiduciary Compliance Risk**

Pinnacle serves as ERISA fiduciary for $17.4 billion in pension plan assets (74% of institutional AUM), including 8 Taft-Hartley union pension plans ($1.9B).

**Quantified Exposure:**
- Prohibited Transaction Excise Tax: $1,500,000 (15% on $10M cross-trade between ERISA plan and hedge fund, if exemption not available)
- DOL Defense Costs: $200,000 - $500,000

**3. Cyber Risk Exposure**

Research plan notes: "Prompt says 'basic policies in place, but no penetration testing, no cyber insurance.'"

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Errors & Omissions (E&O) Professional Liability Insurance

#### 1. Typical E&O Coverage for RIAs

Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance is professional liability insurance designed to protect financial professionals and their firms from claims of negligence or failure to perform professional duties. For registered investment advisers (RIAs), E&O coverage is critical but not federally mandated.¹

**Standard Coverage Includes:**
- Negligence in investment advice
- Unsuitability of investment recommendations
- Breach of fiduciary duty while acting as an investment advisor
- Clerical mistakes and transactional errors
- Failure to supervise employees
- Defense costs for covered claims

**Policy Limits for Pinnacle ($42.5B AUM):**

For asset managers, a common starting point for D&O/E&O limits is 1% of AUM or $1 million (whichever is lower), though this rule of thumb works best only up to $1 billion in AUM.² For a firm with $1 billion in AUM, typical aggregate D&O/E&O policy limits range from $5 million to $10 million.³

**[ASSUMPTION]** Given Pinnacle's $42.5 billion AUM (42× the $1B benchmark), estimated E&O policy limits would be $10 million to $15 million primary coverage, potentially with excess layers to $20 million-$25 million total. This assumption requires verification in data room review.

#### 2. Coverage for SEC Examination Deficiencies

**a. SEC Fines and Penalties - Generally NOT Covered**

**Critical Finding:** While E&O policies may cover defense costs for regulatory investigations, they **generally do NOT cover fines or penalties** imposed by regulatory bodies.⁴ This prohibition is grounded in public policy and is explicitly prohibited in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, **Massachusetts**, New Jersey, **New York**, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, among other states.⁵

The median fine from SEC enforcement actions—which are NOT covered under E&O insurance—is $550,000.⁶ In FY 2024, the SEC recovered $8.194 billion in penalties and disgorgement, higher than the average annual recoveries of $4.853 billion over the five previous fiscal years.⁷

**Pinnacle Exposure:**
- SEC fines: $150,000 - $250,000 **[LIKELY UNINSURED]**
- Net out-of-pocket: $150,000 - $250,000

**Exception - Compensatory Disgorgement May Be Insurable:**

Recent case law provides a nuanced exception. In *J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. v. Vigilant Insurance Co.*, 183 N.E.3d 443 (N.Y. 2021), New York's highest court held that a $140 million SEC payment labeled as "disgorgement" was insurable under a D&O policy because the payment was calculated based on client gains and investor losses, serving a **compensatory purpose rather than a punitive one**, and did not constitute a "penalty imposed by law."⁸

**Legal Standard:** The term "penalty" is "commonly understood to reference a monetary sanction designed to address a public wrong that is sought for purposes of deterrence and punishment rather than to compensate injured parties for their loss."⁹ If an award serves both compensatory and punitive purposes, it is not "punitive" for purposes of insurance coverage and is insurable under New York law.¹⁰

**Application to Pinnacle:** If Pinnacle's SEC settlement includes disgorgement measured by client losses or unjust enrichment (rather than punitive fines), a portion may be insurable depending on:
- Policy jurisdiction (Delaware incorporation, Massachusetts operations, policy issued under NY law)
- Specific policy exclusions language
- SEC settlement structure (disgorgement vs. penalty vs. prejudgment interest)

**b. Defense Costs - Generally Covered**

Entity-level costs from regulatory investigations are increasingly covered under general partnership liability and/or E&O policies.¹¹ However, coverage timing and scope vary significantly:

**Coverage Triggers:**
- **Formal Claims:** Most E&O policies cover defense costs once a formal enforcement action is filed, such as Wells notices or administrative proceedings.¹²
- **Informal Investigations:** During the informal investigation stage (examination, document requests), there is often no insurance coverage because it's considered a regulatory compliance matter rather than a "claim."¹³
- **Wells Notices:** The SEC issues Wells notices indicating they plan to recommend enforcement action. Many policies define Wells notices as covered "claims" triggering defense cost coverage.¹⁴

**Individual vs. Entity Coverage:**
D&O policies typically cover defense costs for individual directors and officers facing SEC investigations. However, they typically do **NOT** cover costs incurred by the **company** responding to the same investigation, and the company's investigation expenses routinely get denied.¹⁵

**Pinnacle SEC Examination Timeline:**
- October 2023: SEC examination conducted
- **[ASSUMPTION]** Wells notice likely issued Q4 2024 or Q1 2025 based on typical 6-12 month SEC examination-to-enforcement timeline
- Defense costs incurred: Estimated $400,000 - $800,000 (outside counsel responding to examination, Wells submission, settlement negotiations)

**Coverage Analysis:**
- **If Wells notice issued:** Defense costs likely covered under E&O policy (subject to SIR/deductible)
- **If still in examination phase:** Defense costs may be excluded as "regulatory compliance" rather than "claim"
- **Critical Issue:** Pinnacle should have reported the October 2023 examination as a "potential claim" or "circumstances that may give rise to a claim" under the claims-made policy's notice of circumstances (NOC) provision to preserve coverage.¹⁶

**c. Remediation Costs - Partial Coverage Possible**

Pinnacle's SEC remediation costs ($1.2M - $1.8M) include:
- Independent pricing services (Houlihan Lokey/Duff & Phelps): $300,000 annually
- Surprise examination (custody rule compliance): $150,000
- Enhanced compliance systems and policies: $750,000 - $1,350,000

**Coverage Analysis:**
- **Direct regulatory compliance costs** (implementing policies to comply with law): Generally NOT covered as "loss" under E&O policies
- **Reasonable costs to mitigate covered loss** (e.g., independent pricing to resolve valuation disputes with clients, prevent future E&O claims): May be covered if characterized as loss mitigation rather than regulatory compliance¹⁷
- **Undertakings to SEC** (independent consultant, compliance enhancements required by settlement): Generally excluded as regulatory penalties

**Estimated Coverage:** $600,000 - $900,000 (50% of remediation costs, assuming independent pricing and some compliance enhancements characterized as loss mitigation)

**Net Pinnacle Exposure:** $600,000 - $900,000 uninsured remediation costs

#### 3. Self-Insured Retention (SIR) / Deductible

**Industry Standard for RIAs of Pinnacle's Size:**

Typical SIR/deductible ranges: $250,000 - $1,000,000 per claim.¹⁸

**Key Distinction:**
- **Deductible:** Satisfied within policy limit; insurer pays claims from "first dollar" and later recoups deductible from insured; defense costs usually covered within policy limit
- **Self-Insured Retention (SIR):** Satisfied outside policy limit; insured pays "first dollars" of loss AND defense costs up to SIR amount; insurer coverage begins only after SIR exhausted¹⁹

**Impact on Pinnacle Exposures:**

**Assuming $500,000 SIR:**
| Exposure Type | Gross Exposure | Insurance Coverage | SIR | Net to Insurance | Pinnacle Pays |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------:|----:|------------------:|--------------:|
| SEC fines | $150K-$250K | $0 (excluded) | N/A | $0 | $150K-$250K |
| Defense costs | $400K-$800K | Covered (if Wells notice) | $500K | $0-$300K | $500K (first $500K via SIR) + $0-$300K excess |
| Remediation (partial) | $600K-$900K | 50% covered | $0 (SIR exhausted) | $300K-$450K | $300K-$450K (uncovered 50%) |

**Revised Net Exposure with $500K SIR:** $950K - $1.5M out-of-pocket

**[CRITICAL DATA ROOM ITEM]:** Verify actual SIR/deductible amount and whether defense costs are within or outside SIR.

#### 4. Claims-Made Policy Considerations

**Most management and professional liability policies—like E&O, D&O, and EPL—are written on a "claims-made" basis,** which means they provide coverage based on when the claim is first made against the policyholder, not when the underlying wrongful act occurred.²⁰

**a. Notice of Circumstances (NOC)**

Most claims-made policies allow for **notice of circumstances (NOC)** to preserve rights under an existing policy should a claim materialize in the future. If the policyholder provides timely notice of circumstances, the insurer will consider any later claim that arises out of the noticed circumstances to have been **first made during the policy period in which the notice was given**.²¹

**Critical Issue for Pinnacle:**

The October 2023 SEC examination represents a "circumstance that may give rise to a claim." Pinnacle should have reported this examination to its E&O carrier **immediately** in October 2023 to preserve coverage under the 2023-2024 policy period, even if no formal claim (Wells notice) had yet been made.

**If Pinnacle failed to report the October 2023 examination:**
- Coverage may be denied under the current policy if the claim is deemed to relate to the October 2023 examination (prior act exclusion)
- This is one of the most common reasons for claim denials under claims-made policies²²

**b. Prior Acts Coverage**

Claims-made policies typically include a "retroactive date." Coverage applies only to wrongful acts occurring after the retroactive date. If Pinnacle's current E&O policy has a retroactive date after October 2023, coverage for SEC examination deficiencies may be excluded as "prior acts."

**[CRITICAL DATA ROOM ITEM]:** Verify:
1. Whether Pinnacle reported October 2023 SEC examination as NOC
2. Retroactive date on current E&O policy
3. Any insurer correspondence regarding coverage for SEC matter

#### 5. Net E&O Coverage Summary for SEC Examination

| Component | Gross Exposure | Likely Coverage | Pinnacle Net Exposure |
|-----------|----------------|----------------:|----------------------:|
| **SEC Fines** | $150K-$250K | **$0** (public policy exclusion) | **$150K-$250K** |
| **Defense Costs** | $400K-$800K | $0-$300K (subject to $500K SIR + coverage if Wells notice issued) | **$500K-$800K** |
| **Remediation** | $1.2M-$1.8M | $300K-$450K (50% partial coverage) | **$900K-$1.35M** |
| **TOTAL** | **$1.75M-$2.85M** | **$300K-$750K** | **$1.55M-$2.4M** |

**Key Assumptions:**
1. E&O policy limits: $10M-$15M (adequate for exposure)
2. SIR: $500,000
3. Wells notice issued triggering defense cost coverage
4. October 2023 exam reported as NOC (preserves coverage)
5. No prior act exclusion issues
6. Policy excludes governmental fines but covers defense costs and partial remediation as loss mitigation
