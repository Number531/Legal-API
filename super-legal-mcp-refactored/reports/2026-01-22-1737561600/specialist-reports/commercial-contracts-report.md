## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Pinnacle Investment Management - Revenue Overview

Pinnacle Investment Management, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, operating as a registered investment adviser (SEC File No. 801-45678) since 1996. The firm manages $42.5B in assets under management across three primary business lines:

| Business Line | AUM | Annual Revenue | % Total Revenue | Fee Structure | Client Count |
|---------------|-----|----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Institutional Separate Accounts** | $23.4B (55%) | $146M | 38% | 0.26%-0.75% tiered | 82 clients |
| **Mutual Funds** | $12.8B (30%) | $127M | 33% | 0.55%-1.05% | 4 funds (8,500 shareholders) |
| **Hedge Funds** | $6.3B (15%) | $112M | 29% | 1.5%-1.75% mgmt + 20% carry | 2 funds (167 LPs) |
| **TOTAL** | **$42.5B** | **$385M** | **100%** | Blended 0.91% | — |

**FY2024 Financial Performance:**
- Total Revenue: $385M
- Management Fees: $362M (94%)
- Performance Fees: $23M (6%) [highly volatile: 2024 $23M, 2023 $8M, 2022 $0]
- EBITDA: $142M (37% margin)
- Employees: 485 (180 investment professionals, 120 client service, 95 operations, 90 corporate)

### B. Transaction Context - Change of Control Implications

Global Asset Partners LLC proposes to acquire 100% of Pinnacle Investment Management, Inc. for $1.8B. The transaction structure (stock purchase assumed) triggers change of control provisions across Pinnacle's commercial contracts:

**Investment Advisers Act Section 202(a)(1) - Assignment Definition:**
> "Assignment" includes any direct or indirect transfer of a majority of the voting securities of an investment adviser.

**Practical Impact:** The stock purchase constitutes an "assignment" of all investment advisory agreements. Under Investment Advisers Act Section 205(a)(2), no assignment is permitted "without the consent of the other party to the contract."

**Investment Company Act Section 15(a)(4) - Automatic Termination:**
> An investment advisory contract shall terminate automatically in the event of its assignment.

**Practical Impact:** All four mutual fund advisory agreements will automatically terminate upon closing unless shareholders approve new contracts.

**Critical Timeline Issue:** Obtaining client consents and shareholder approvals is a condition precedent to closing. Failure to obtain required consents creates deal-blocking risk.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Statutory Framework - Assignment and Consent Requirements

#### 1. Investment Advisers Act - Assignment Definition and Consent Requirement

**Section 202(a)(1) - Definition of "Assignment"** (15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(1))

The Investment Advisers Act defines "assignment" broadly to include:

> "any direct or indirect transfer or hypothecation of an investment advisory contract by the assignor or of a controlling block of the assignor's outstanding voting securities by a security holder of the assignor."¹

**Exception for Partnerships:** If the investment adviser is a partnership, no assignment of an investment advisory contract shall be deemed to result from the death or withdrawal of a minority of the members having only a minority interest, or from the admission of one or more members who will be only a minority and have only a minority interest.²

**Practical Application to Pinnacle Transaction:** The proposed stock purchase by Global Asset Partners LLC of 100% of Pinnacle Investment Management, Inc. constitutes a transfer of a "controlling block" of voting securities, triggering the assignment definition. This is a direct transfer of 100% of the voting stock, clearly exceeding the 25% control presumption found in Section 2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act.³

**Section 205(a)(2) - Consent Requirement** (15 U.S.C. § 80b-5(a)(2))

Section 205(a)(2) prohibits advisers from entering into an investment advisory agreement that:

> "fails to provide, in substance, that no assignment of such contract shall be made by the investment adviser without the consent of the other party to the contract."⁴

**Legal Effect:** The statute does not directly prohibit assignment without consent, but requires that the contract contain a provision prohibiting such assignment.⁵ However, virtually all institutional investment advisory agreements contain this required language, meaning that as a contractual matter, Pinnacle cannot assign any advisory agreements to Global Asset Partners without obtaining client consent.

**Consent Standard - Positive vs. Negative Consent:**

- **Positive Consent:** If the signed investment advisory contract requires the client's written consent to an assignment, the assignment cannot occur until the client physically signs something granting approval. This is the most common standard in institutional separate account agreements.⁶

- **Negative Consent:** If the investment advisory contract does not require written consent, assignment may automatically occur if the client fails to object within a stated period (typically 45-60 days). The SEC has commented that negative consent periods should be at least 45 to 60 days, although 30-day periods are occasionally used in practice.⁷

**Industry Practice for Institutional Clients:** Institutional investment advisory agreements (pension plans, endowments, foundations, insurance companies) typically require affirmative written consent for assignment. Governmental and other institutional investors may take many months to provide formal responses due to internal approval processes (investment committee meetings, board approvals, legal review).⁸

#### 2. Investment Company Act - Automatic Termination Upon Assignment

**Section 15(a) - Advisory Contract Requirements** (15 U.S.C. § 80a-15(a))

The Investment Company Act imposes stricter requirements on mutual fund advisory contracts than the Investment Advisers Act imposes on separate account agreements:

**Initial Approval:** Advisory contracts must be approved by (1) the fund's board of directors, including a majority of independent directors, and (2) a majority of the fund's outstanding voting securities (i.e., shareholder vote).⁹

**Annual Renewal:** Advisory contracts continue in effect for no more than two years from execution, and thereafter only if "such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the board of directors or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities."¹⁰

**Automatic Termination Upon Assignment:** The statute requires that the advisory contract "provide, in substance, for its automatic termination in the event of its assignment."¹¹

**Definition of Assignment:** The Investment Company Act incorporates by reference the Investment Advisers Act definition of assignment at 15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(1), meaning that a change of control of the investment adviser (transfer of more than 25% of voting securities) constitutes an assignment.¹²

**Practical Impact on Pinnacle's Mutual Funds:**

Upon closing of the stock purchase, all four of Pinnacle's mutual fund advisory agreements will automatically terminate by operation of law. The funds cannot continue to be advised by Pinnacle (now owned by Global Asset Partners) without new advisory contracts approved by:

1. **Board Approval:** The mutual fund boards (likely overlapping directors for all four funds) must approve new advisory contracts with the post-acquisition Pinnacle entity. This requires a meeting of the board with a majority of independent directors voting in favor.¹³

2. **Shareholder Approval:** Each fund's shareholders must approve the new advisory contracts by majority vote of outstanding shares. This requires:
   - Preparation of proxy materials describing the transaction, fee comparisons, board rationale (including 15(c) factors)
   - Filing proxy materials with the SEC
   - Mailing proxy materials to all shareholders (8,500 shareholders across four funds)
   - Solicitation of proxies (typically 60-90 day process)
   - Obtaining majority of outstanding shares voting in favor¹⁴

**Quorum and Approval Challenges:** Unlike publicly traded companies that require 50% quorum, the Investment Company Act requires that approvals be obtained by "a majority of the outstanding voting securities," meaning more than 50% of all outstanding shares must vote in favor (not just a majority of shares voting). This is a higher threshold and funds frequently struggle to obtain sufficient participation.¹⁵

**Interim Advisory Contract - Rule 15a-4:** To avoid disruption of advisory services during the shareholder approval process, the SEC permits funds to operate under temporary "interim advisory contracts" for up to 150 days while shareholder approval is pending, provided:
- The interim contract has been approved by the fund's board, including a majority of independent directors
- The compensation under the interim contract is no greater than the compensation under the prior contract
- Shareholders receive proxy materials explaining the change and have an opportunity to vote¹⁶

**Timeline Implication:** The mutual fund shareholder approval process typically takes 60-90 days from signing to closing. This should be a condition precedent to closing in the purchase agreement.

#### 3. Delaware Limited Partnership Law - General Partner Assignment

**Default Rule - Unanimous Consent Required**

Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (DRULPA), the default rule (absent contrary provision in the limited partnership agreement) is:

**Section 17-702 - Assignment of Partnership Interest:** A general partner ceases to be a general partner upon assignment of all of its partnership interests, unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement.¹⁷

**Section 17-704 - Right of Assignee to Become Partner:** An assignee of a partnership interest (including an assignee of a general partner's interest) becomes a limited partner only upon the vote or consent of all partners, unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement.¹⁸

**Practical Application:** If Pinnacle serves as general partner of its two hedge funds (Opportunity Fund and Credit Opportunities Fund), and if the LPAs follow default DRULPA rules, then assignment of the general partner interests would require unanimous consent of all limited partners. This is a very high threshold.

**Contractual Modification - LPA Provisions Control:** DRULPA provides maximum flexibility for parties to modify default rules through the partnership agreement.¹⁹ Industry-standard hedge fund LPAs typically modify the unanimous consent requirement to require:
- **Majority-in-interest consent:** Consent of LPs holding more than 50% of capital commitments or capital accounts
- **Supermajority consent:** Consent of LPs holding 66.67% or 75% of capital
- **Advisory committee consent:** If the fund has a limited partner advisory committee (LPAC), consent of the LPAC in lieu of full LP vote

**Assumption for Pinnacle Analysis:** Absent access to the actual LPAs, this analysis assumes that Pinnacle's hedge fund LPAs require either majority-in-interest or LPAC consent for general partner assignment, not unanimous consent. However, the actual consent threshold must be verified in due diligence.
