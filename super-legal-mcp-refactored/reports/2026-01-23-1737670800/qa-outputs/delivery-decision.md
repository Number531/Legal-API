## REMEDIATION STATUS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Cycles Completed** | 1 |
| **Max Cycles Allowed** | 2 |
| **Cycle 2 Recommended** | No |
| **Remaining Issues Addressable in Cycle 2** | 7 (3 MEDIUM, 4 LOW) |
| **Estimated Cycle 2 Time** | 90 minutes total |
| **Projected Score After Cycle 2** | 93.8-94.5% (full CERTIFY tier) |

---

## NEXT ACTION

**DELIVER_WITH_LIMITATIONS**

### Rationale for Immediate Delivery

1. **Score Adequacy**: 91.8% exceeds 88% minimum by comfortable margin (3.8 points)
2. **Zero Blocking Issues**: All CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues resolved (100% resolution)
3. **Time Efficiency**: Immediate delivery vs. 2-hour delay for marginal improvement (+1.5-2.7 points)
4. **Transaction Timeline**: Q2 2026 closing target favors speed over perfection
5. **Board Readiness**: Memorandum is board-ready with disclosed limitations
6. **Remediation ROI**: 90 minutes of Cycle 2 work for +1.5-2.7 points has diminishing returns

### Alternative Action (Not Selected)

**LOOP_REMEDIATION** (Cycle 2):
- Execute 90-minute remediation to address 3 MEDIUM issues
- Projected score: 93.8-94.5% (full CERTIFY tier, zero limitations)
- Trade-off: 2-hour delay for marginal quality improvement
- **Decision**: NOT RECOMMENDED given adequate current quality and time-sensitive transaction
