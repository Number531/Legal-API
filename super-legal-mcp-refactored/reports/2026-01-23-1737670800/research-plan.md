## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Pinnacle has valid SEC RIA registration File No. 801-45678 | User-provided, verifiable IARD public records | If registration revoked/suspended, deal-blocking (cannot operate as RIA) |
| SEC exam deficiencies October 2023 are accurate list (5 categories custody/valuation/cross-trading/allocation/compliance program) | User-provided, typical SEC exam scope | If additional deficiencies exist, fine exposure increases + remediation costs |
| No current ERISA prohibited transactions | User-provided "no current violations" | If pre-2024 cross-trades violated PT rules, excise tax exposure $1.5M+ retroactive |
| Mutual fund independent directors 6 of 8 meet independence criteria | User-provided, verifiable via Form N-1A/proxy statements | If director independence challenged, 75% requirement not met (fund governance risk) |
| Client AUM and revenue figures accurate as of September 30, 2024 | User-provided $42.5B AUM, $385M revenue FY2024 | If AUM declined post-September, revenue projections overstated (purchase price adjustment) |
| Side letter MFN triggered 2023 for 8 investors $3.6M annual fee reduction | User-provided specific trigger event | If additional MFN triggers occurred, annual reduction exceeds $3.6M |
| Founder/CIO John Doe age 62 no designated successor | User-provided succession planning gap | If succession plan exists, key person risk mitigated |
| Performance fee high-water mark Opportunity Fund $95.2 current NAV $88.5 | User-provided, verifiable fund financial statements | If NAV has recovered post-September, performance fee revenue resumes sooner |
| No cyber insurance policy currently | User-provided "no cyber insurance" | If policy exists, breach cost exposure reduced (but user states absent) |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual insurance policy terms (E&O/D&O/fiduciary limits/deductibles/exclusions not provided, using industry standards $10M limits)
- Specific client names for top 10 institutional separate accounts (State Pension Plan A identified 11% revenue, others anonymized)
- Limited partnership agreement complete text (summarized terms provided, full contract review requires data room access)
- Investment advisory agreement change of control consent provisions (40% by AUM stated, specific clients requiring consent not identified)
- Actual SEC examination deficiency letter (October 2023 summary provided, full deficiency letter with specific findings not attached)

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:** Financial risk aggregation (if findings >$1M) depends on T7 (financial-analyst valuation) + T1/T3 (SEC fines) + T4 (Marketing Rule) + T5 (side letter MFN) + T6 (ERISA PT) completion. Will invoke financial-analyst for risk roll-up after all specialists complete if total quantified exposure >$1M (expected YES based on SEC exam $150K-$250K + remediation $1.2M-$1.8M + side letter MFN $3.6M annually + valuation markdown $50M-$75M + key person $3.0B potential = significant aggregate exposure).

**Potential Issues:**
- If SEC issues Wells Notice pre-closing (enforcement action recommendation), could delay closing 60-90 days for Wells submission + settlement negotiation (include contingency closing condition)
- If State Pension Plan A or other top 10 client terminates pre-closing (5-10% annual probability), revenue-based purchase price adjustment $41M direct loss + potential herding $50M-$100M additional
- If valuation independent review requires markdown >$75M ($360M illiquid × 20% = $72M scenario), affects NAV + performance fees + LP confidence (may trigger redemptions Opportunity Fund)
- If founder/CIO John Doe departs between signing and closing (health/personal/competitive offer), key person provisions trigger $3.0B redemption exposure (include retention agreement + closing condition employment signed)

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If ANY specialist finds deal-blocking regulatory issue (SEC registration revocation, Wells Notice with recommended bar, FINRA expulsion Pinnacle Distributors) → IMMEDIATE escalation Investment Committee do not proceed
- If aggregate quantified exposure >$200M (>11% of $1.8B purchase price) → Escalate for purchase price adjustment negotiation or indemnity/escrow enhancement
- If client terminations pre-closing reduce AUM below $40B (threshold for earnout) → Renegotiate earnout terms or walk-away provision

**Research Completeness Criteria:**
- All 12 regulatory domains researched exhaustively (SEC RIA, Investment Company Act, SEC exam, Marketing Rule, private funds, ERISA, valuation, employment, tax, commercial contracts, insurance, privacy/cyber)
- All 12 critical issues from checklist addressed with quantified exposure ranges
- All material legal authorities cited with Bluebook format + verification tags (Investment Advisers Act, Investment Company Act, ERISA, IRC, state laws Massachusetts, SEC/DOL regulations, case law, Form filings)
- All cross-domain implications traced (10 anticipated patterns from matrix above)
