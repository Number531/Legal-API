## VII. MATERIALITY THRESHOLDS AND GAP PRIORITIZATION

### 7.1 Materiality Assessment (Deal Value: $1.8B)

| Materiality Tier | Threshold | Gaps in This Tier | Override Applied? |
|------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **DEAL_BLOCKING** | >$50M or >10% deal value | 0 | N/A |
| **MATERIAL** | $5M-$50M or 2-10% deal value | 0 | N/A |
| **SIGNIFICANT** | $1M-$5M or 0.5-2% deal value | 0 | N/A |
| **MINOR** | <$1M or <0.5% deal value | 0 | N/A |

**NO GAPS IDENTIFIED — Materiality thresholds not applicable.**

### 7.2 Gap Prioritization (If Gaps Existed)

**Not applicable — zero gaps detected.**

For reference, the prioritization algorithm that would be applied:

`priority_score = (materiality × 0.4) + (gap_type × 0.3) + (downstream × 0.2) + (effort × 0.1)`

**No follow-up research queue required.**
