## CONFLICT DETECTION SUMMARY

### Conflicts Detected: 0 Material Conflicts

After comprehensive review of all 12 specialist reports, **NO material factual conflicts were identified**. All reports present consistent factual information. Key observations:

1. **AUM Figures Consistent**: All reports consistently cite $42.5B total AUM, $4.8B Opportunity Fund, $1.5B Credit Opp Fund, $23.4B institutional separate accounts.

2. **Employee Count Consistent**: All reports consistently cite 485 total employees, 180 investment professionals.

3. **SEC Examination Date Consistent**: October 2023 examination date cited consistently across multiple reports.

4. **Financial Figures Consistent**: Performance fees, revenue figures, and exposure calculations are mathematically consistent across reports.

5. **Regulatory Fine Ranges Consistent**: Fine exposure ranges cited by different specialists align (e.g., custody $50K-$100K, marketing $75K-$125K).

### Minor Variations (Not Conflicts):

1. **Institutional Client Count**: Reports cite "82 institutional clients" (insurance report) and "28 institutional clients requiring consent" (contracts report) - these are NOT conflicting but represent different subsets (total vs. those requiring change of control consent).

2. **Limited Partner Counts**: Opportunity Fund cited as "125 LPs" (private fund report) and "127 LPs" (contracts report) - likely represents timing difference (2 new LPs added between report dates). Using **127 LPs** as canonical (most recent).

3. **Credit Opp LP Count**: Cited as "42 LPs" (insurance report) and "43 LPs" (private fund report) - using **43 LPs** as canonical (most recent).

### Data Quality Assessment

- **HIGH CONFIDENCE FACTS**: 215 (89%)
- **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE FACTS**: 27 (11%)
- **LOW CONFIDENCE FACTS**: 0 (0%)

All facts extracted from primary specialist reports with clear source attribution and line number references for auditability.

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

### Liability Type Classification

Facts involving financial exposures are classified using liability valuation framework:

- **Perpetual**: Recurring annually with no end date → NPV methodology (Annual ÷ Discount Rate)
  - Example: $300K annual independent pricing services → Use 8% WACC if permanent requirement

- **Contingent**: Single event, uncertain outcome → EV methodology (Probability × Magnitude)
  - Example: SEC fines, ERISA excise taxes, PM departure risks

- **Hybrid**: Multi-year program, defined timeline → DCF methodology (Σ CF_t ÷ (1+r)^t)
  - Example: $1.2M-$1.8M SEC remediation costs over 18-24 months

### Confidence Levels

- **HIGH**: Fact directly stated in specialist report with specific citation to primary source (SEC filing, statute, regulatory guidance)
- **MEDIUM**: Fact stated in specialist report but based on assumptions or industry benchmarks
- **LOW**: Fact inferred or estimated with explicit methodology disclosure

### Verification Tags

All facts include source report file name and line number for independent verification. Format: `[report-name].md | [line#]`
