> **Exposure Quantification Methodology**
>
> This memorandum quantifies financial exposures using three standard valuation techniques. **NPV (Net Present Value)** applies to perpetual or multi-year liabilities, such as ongoing revenue reductions, by discounting future cash flows to present value. **EV (Expected Value)** applies to contingent liabilities, such as regulatory fines or one-time markdown events, by multiplying the potential loss by the probability of occurrence. **DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)** applies to hybrid scenarios combining time-series cash flows with uncertainty, such as performance fee calculations affected by valuation changes. All present value calculations use an **8% discount rate**, reflecting the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) typical for asset management firms with Pinnacle's risk profile. This rate represents the opportunity cost of capital and accounts for the time value of money over the exposure period.
