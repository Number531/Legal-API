**Section [X]. Marketing Rule Form ADV Amendment Covenant.**

(a) **Marketing Rule Violation Acknowledgment.** Seller represents and warrants that its current website (pinnacle-investment.com) and marketing materials include eight (8) client testimonials that lack the disclosures required by SEC Investment Adviser Marketing Rule, 17 CFR § 275.206(4)-1(b)(3) (the "**Marketing Rule**"), including:
   (i) Disclosure of any compensation provided to testimonial providers;
   (ii) Disclosure that testimonials may not be representative of other client experiences;
   (iii) Description of any material conflicts of interest on the part of the testimonial provider.

The testimonials appear on the website homepage and "Client Success Stories" page and were added in June 2023. Several testimonials prominently feature performance claims including "20% annual returns" and "outperformed S&P 500 by 500 bps" without the required accompanying disclosures under Rule 206(4)-1(b)(3).

(b) **Pre-Closing Remediation Covenant.** Seller shall, no later than thirty (30) days after execution of this Agreement, elect and complete ONE of the following remediation options:

   **OPTION A: DISCLOSURE ADDITION**

   (i) Add the following disclosure (or substantively equivalent language approved by Buyer in writing) in prominent placement (minimum 12-point font, directly adjacent to each testimonial, not in footer or separate page):

   *"TESTIMONIAL DISCLOSURE: This testimonial was provided by [Client Name], an existing advisory client of Pinnacle Investment Management, Inc. [Client Name] received no compensation (cash or non-cash) for providing this testimonial. This testimonial may not be representative of the experiences of other clients and is not indicative of future performance or success. Past performance does not guarantee future results. [Client Name] is an institutional investor with [$XXX million] in assets under management with Pinnacle; individual retail investors may experience different results due to differences in account size, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon."*

   (ii) Amend Form ADV Part 2A Item 1.B (Advisory Business - Marketing Practices) to add:

   *"The Firm's website includes client testimonials from existing advisory clients. These testimonials were provided voluntarily and no compensation (cash or non-cash) was provided to testimonial providers. Disclosures regarding representativeness, compensation, and client characteristics are provided directly adjacent to each testimonial in compliance with SEC Rule 206(4)-1(b)(3). Institutional client testimonials include disclosure that retail investors may experience different results due to differences in account characteristics."*

   (iii) File the Form ADV amendment with the SEC via the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD) system and obtain SEC acceptance confirmation.

   **OPTION B: TESTIMONIAL REMOVAL**

   (i) Remove all eight (8) testimonials from the website (home page and "Client Success Stories" page) and any printed marketing materials (pitch decks, brochures, presentation materials);

   (ii) Archive the original testimonials as PDF screenshots with date stamps showing original placement and deliver to Buyer for recordkeeping;

   (iii) No Form ADV amendment required if testimonials are no longer used in marketing materials.

(c) **Evidence Delivery - Closing Condition.** Seller shall deliver to Buyer, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date:

   **If Option A selected**:

   (i) Screenshots of the website showing compliant testimonial disclosures in prominent placement adjacent to each testimonial (with visible URL and date stamp);

   (ii) SEC filing confirmation showing Form ADV Part 2A amendment filed via IARD and accepted by the SEC (IARD filing receipt with acceptance date);

   (iii) Legal opinion from independent securities counsel with Investment Advisers Act expertise (satisfactory to Buyer in its reasonable discretion) confirming that: (A) the amended website testimonial disclosures comply with Rule 206(4)-1(b)(3), (B) the Form ADV amendment accurately describes the Firm's testimonial practices, and (C) no further Marketing Rule compliance actions are required with respect to the testimonials.

   **If Option B selected**:

   (i) Screenshots of the website showing testimonials removed from all pages (with visible URL and date stamp);

   (ii) Archived PDF of original testimonials showing original placement and content (for Buyer's recordkeeping and potential enforcement defense);

   (iii) Certificate from Seller's Chief Compliance Officer certifying that all testimonials have been removed from website, social media, and printed marketing materials.

   Delivery of the required evidence pursuant to this Section [X](c) is a condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer may waive this condition in its sole discretion.

(d) **Indemnity for Prior Marketing Rule Violations.** Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any Losses arising from or relating to SEC Enforcement Actions concerning the testimonial disclosure deficiencies described in Section [X](a) for periods prior to the remediation completion date (the date on which Option A disclosure addition or Option B removal is completed and evidence is delivered pursuant to Section [X](c)), including:

   (i) Civil monetary penalties assessed under Investment Advisers Act Section 203(i), 15 U.S.C. § 80b-3(i), arising from violations of Rule 206(4)-1(b)(3) (up to Five Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($510,000) based on tiered penalty structure for first-time violations as set forth in 17 CFR § 201.1004);

   (ii) Disgorgement orders requiring return of advisory fees attributable to clients obtained through non-compliant testimonials;

   (iii) Corrective advertising orders or undertakings required by the SEC;

   (iv) Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in responding to SEC examination inquiries, Wells notices, or enforcement proceedings related to the testimonial disclosure deficiencies.

   **Limitations**: (A) Seller shall have no liability under this Section [X](d) unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the "**Basket**"), after which Seller shall be liable for all Losses from the first dollar (first-dollar liability after Basket); (B) Seller's aggregate liability under this Section [X](d) shall not exceed Five Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($510,000) (the "**Cap**"); (C) the indemnity obligations under this Section [X](d) shall survive the Closing for five (5) years (consistent with the statute of limitations under Investment Advisers Act Section 209(e), 15 U.S.C. § 80b-9(e)).

(e) **No Future Liability.** Seller shall have no liability for testimonial use or Marketing Rule compliance for periods after the remediation completion date, provided that: (i) remediation was completed in accordance with the requirements of Section [X](b), (ii) evidence was timely delivered pursuant to Section [X](c), and (iii) if Option A was selected, the legal opinion confirms compliance with Rule 206(4)-1(b)(3). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer assumes all liability for any modifications to testimonial disclosures, additions of new testimonials, or changes to Form ADV made after the remediation completion date.

(f) **Cross-Reference to Due Diligence Findings.** This covenant addresses the regulatory deficiency identified in Section IV.D.B.2 of Buyer's due diligence memorandum dated [●] (the "Marketing Rule Testimonial Disclosure Deficiency"), which identified High severity regulatory exposure of Five Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($510,000) gross exposure (One Hundred Fifty-Three Thousand Dollars ($153,000) weighted at 30% probability).
