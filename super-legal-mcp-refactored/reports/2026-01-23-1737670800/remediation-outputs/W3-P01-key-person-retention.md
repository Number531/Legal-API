>
> (i) **Position**: Chief Investment Officer, reporting directly to Buyer's Chief Executive Officer;
>
> (ii) **Term**: Three (3) years from the Closing Date (the "Retention Period");
>
> (iii) **Base Compensation**: Annual base salary of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), subject to annual review and increase (but not decrease) at Buyer's discretion;

>   - **Year 2 Payment**: $15,000,000 (30%) on the second anniversary of Closing, conditioned upon Key Person's continued employment through such date;
>   - **Year 3 Payment**: $15,000,000 (30%) on the third anniversary of Closing, conditioned upon Key Person's continued employment through such date;
>
> (v) **Benefits**: Participation in Buyer's executive benefit plans, including health insurance, 401(k), and executive perquisites, on terms no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated Buyer executives;
>
> (vi) **Equity Participation**: Eligibility to participate in Buyer's management equity incentive plan, with initial grant of [X]% to be determined within 90 days of Closing.

> ### (b) Succession Planning
>
> Within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, Key Person shall:
>
> (i) Designate a successor Chief Investment Officer (the "Successor CIO") from among Pinnacle's current senior investment professionals, subject to Buyer's approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld);
>
> (ii) Develop and implement a phased transition plan providing for:
>   - Immediate appointment of Successor CIO to Pinnacle's Investment Committee;
>   - Twelve (12) month shadowing period during which Successor CIO co-chairs Investment Committee meetings with Key Person;
>   - Gradual delegation of investment decision-making authority over the Retention Period;
>
> (iii) Provide mentorship and knowledge transfer to Successor CIO to ensure continuity of Pinnacle's investment philosophy and client relationship management.

> ### (c) Termination Provisions
>
> **For Cause Termination**: Buyer may terminate the Employment Agreement for Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement), resulting in immediate forfeiture of all unvested Retention Earnout payments. "Cause" includes: (A) willful misconduct or gross negligence in the performance of Key Person's duties; (B) conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or crime involving moral turpitude; (C) material breach of fiduciary duty to Pinnacle or its clients; or (D) solicitation of Pinnacle clients on behalf of a competing investment adviser.
>
> **Without Cause Termination**: If Buyer terminates the Employment Agreement without Cause, Key Person shall be entitled to: (A) immediate acceleration and payment of 100% of unvested Retention Earnout ($30,000,000 if termination occurs after Year 1 payment); (B) continued base salary for twelve (12) months following termination; and (C) extension of non-compete period to twenty-four (24) months (in lieu of standard twelve-month period).
>
> **Resignation**: If Key Person voluntarily resigns prior to completion of the Retention Period (other than for Good Reason as defined in the Employment Agreement), Key Person shall forfeit all unvested Retention Earnout payments, and the twelve (12) month non-compete covenant shall apply.
>
> **Death or Disability**: In the event of Key Person's death or Disability (as defined in the Employment Agreement) during the Retention Period, Buyer shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of remaining unvested Retention Earnout to Key Person's estate or designated beneficiary within thirty (30) days of such event. Non-compete covenants shall not apply.

> ### (d) Key Person Escrow
>
> The Parties acknowledge that this Employment Agreement is supported by a separate Key Person Escrow established pursuant to Section [X.Y] of this Agreement. The Key Person Escrow provides for:
>
> (i) **Escrow Amount**: $25,000,000 to be held in escrow for three (3) years from Closing;
>
> (ii) **Purpose**: To secure Buyer against client AUM losses resulting from Key Person's departure (other than termination for Cause);
>
> (iii) **Draw Mechanism**: If Key Person departs during the Retention Period (other than by Buyer termination without Cause or due to death/Disability), Buyer may draw on the escrow quarterly to reimburse actual documented client AUM losses calculated as:
>   - **Lost AUM** × **Average Fee Rate (1.2% for institutional accounts)** × **NPV Multiple (5x)**
>   - Maximum quarterly draw: $6,250,000
>   - Maximum aggregate draw: $25,000,000 (full escrow)
>
> (iv) **Escrow Release**: If Key Person completes the full Retention Period, the Key Person Escrow shall be released to Seller within thirty (30) days of the third anniversary of Closing, less any draws made pursuant to subsection (iii).
>
> (v) **Cross-Reference**: See Section [X.Y] (Escrow Arrangements) for complete Key Person Escrow terms.

> ### (e) Closing Condition
>
> Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing is conditioned upon execution and delivery by Key Person of the Employment Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Failure of Key Person to execute the Employment Agreement shall entitle Buyer to terminate this Agreement without penalty, with return of the Purchase Price deposit and reimbursement of Buyer's documented transaction expenses up to $2,000,000.

> ### (f) Rationale and Precedent
>
> This Key Person retention structure is consistent with RIA M&A market practice for founder-led firms where client relationships are concentrated with a single key principal. Comparable precedent transactions include:
>
> - **AMG Acquisitions**: 3-5 year retention agreements with earnouts of 5-10% of purchase price
> - **Victory Capital RIA Roll-Ups**: Succession planning requirements integrated into employment agreements
> - **Focus Financial**: Key person escrows of 2-3% of purchase price tied to client AUM retention metrics
>
> The $50M retention earnout (2.8% of $1.8B purchase price) and $25M key person escrow (1.4% of purchase price) fall within market norms and are calibrated to the $280M gross exposure ($112M weighted) identified in Section IV.H.B.1 of the due diligence memorandum.
## EDITED_END

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Drafted comprehensive Key Person Retention Agreement provision for John Doe (Founder/CIO) addressing $280M gross key person risk ($112M weighted). Provision includes 3-year employment covenant with $50M earnout (40%/30%/30% vesting), mandatory succession planning within 90 days, complete termination provisions for all scenarios (Cause, Without Cause, Resignation, Death/Disability), and integration with $25M Key Person Escrow. Structure follows RIA M&A market precedent (AMG, Victory Capital, Focus Financial) and makes execution a closing condition. All contractual terms calibrated to due diligence findings in Section IV.H.B.1.

## VERIFICATION
- [x] Employment covenant with 3-year term specified: PASS (Section (a)(ii) establishes 3-year Retention Period)
- [x] $50M earnout with annual vesting schedule (40%/30%/30%): PASS (Section (a)(iv) details $20M/$15M/$15M payments)
- [x] Succession planning requirement included: PASS (Section (b) mandates 90-day successor designation and phased transition)
- [x] All termination provisions specified (Cause, Without Cause, Resignation, Death/Disability): PASS (Section (c) comprehensively addresses all four scenarios)
- [x] Key Person Escrow cross-reference and linkage: PASS (Section (d) establishes $25M escrow with draw mechanics and cross-reference to Section [X.Y])
- [x] Closing condition status stated: PASS (Section (e) makes Employment Agreement execution a condition precedent with 5-day deadline)
- [x] Precedent transaction references included: PASS (Section (f) cites AMG, Victory Capital, and Focus Financial comparables)
- [x] Rationale tied to due diligence findings: PASS (Section (f) explicitly references Section IV.H.B.1 findings and $280M/$112M exposure)

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Provision Location**: This provision is designed for insertion into the main Purchase Agreement. The contract drafter should:
1. Assign appropriate section numbering (currently marked as Section [X])
2. Create corresponding Exhibit [X] with full Employment Agreement template
3. Cross-reference Key Person Escrow section (currently marked as Section [X.Y])
4. Integrate closing condition into Article [Conditions Precedent]

**Integration with Memorandum Section IV.H.B.1**: This provision directly implements the mitigation strategy recommended in the due diligence memorandum finding on John Doe key person risk. When integrated into the final memorandum, add cross-reference: "See Exhibit [X]: Draft Key Person Retention Agreement Provisions."

**Market Positioning**: The earnout percentage (2.8% of purchase price) is conservative relative to AMG's 5-10% range, reflecting the fact that this is a pure retention mechanism rather than performance-based earnout. Combined with the 1.4% escrow, total key person protection represents 4.2% of purchase price, which is appropriate for a $280M gross risk exposure representing 15.6% of deal value.

**Negotiation Considerations**:
- Base salary of $2M is estimated; actual amount should be confirmed from Pinnacle compensation records
- Equity participation percentage ([X]%) intentionally left blank for buyer determination
- "Good Reason" definition in resignation provision should be negotiated to include material diminution of duties, compensation reduction, or relocation requirements
- Draw mechanism calculation (Lost AUM × 1.2% × 5x) uses institutional account fee rate; may need blended rate if retail clients also affected

**Execution Timeline**: Employment Agreement must be negotiated and signed at least 5 business days before closing to satisfy condition precedent. Recommend initiating negotiations with John Doe during exclusivity period to avoid last-minute closing risk.
