# REMEDIATION COMPLETE: W4-005

## STATUS: SUCCESS

## ORIGINAL_START
Under IRC Section 1061 as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, does Pinnacle's carried interest income ( million earned in 2024) qualify for long-term capital gains treatment (20% rate) where the Opportunity Fund hedge fund maintains average holding periods of 6-12 months, below the 3-year statutory requirement, resulting in ordinary income treatment (37% top rate) and annual tax differential of .9 million?
## ORIGINAL_END

## EDITED_START
Under IRC Section 1061 as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, does Pinnacle's carried interest income ($23 million earned in 2024) qualify for long-term capital gains treatment (20% rate) where the Opportunity Fund hedge fund maintains average holding periods of 6-12 months?
## EDITED_END

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Removed embedded legal conclusion "below the 3-year statutory requirement" which presupposed the answer. Also removed the consequential language about ordinary income treatment and tax differential, as these are conclusions that belong in the Brief Answer, not the Question Presented. Selected Option B approach with enhanced specificity by including the dollar amount ($23M) and rate specification (20%), which provides factual context without advocating for a conclusion.

## RATIONALE FOR REVISION CHOICE

**Selected: Modified Option B (Enhanced Specificity with Minimal Editorial)**

**Why Not Option A (Minimal)**: While removing "below the 3-year statutory requirement" was necessary, Option A was too minimal. The original question also contained consequential conclusion language ("resulting in ordinary income treatment (37% top rate) and annual tax differential of .9 million") that embedded the negative answer into the question itself.

**Why Modified Option B**: This approach:
1. **Eliminates All Advocacy**: Removes both the comparative conclusion ("below the 3-year statutory requirement") and the consequential conclusions (ordinary income treatment and tax differential)
2. **Preserves Material Facts**: Retains the specific holding period (6-12 months), dollar amount ($23M), and rate specification (20%)
3. **Maintains Neutrality**: Presents facts without suggesting the legal outcome
4. **Follows Questions Presented Best Practices**: The question now presents the legal issue (IRC 1061 qualification), the factual predicate (6-12 month holding periods), and asks for a determination—without embedding the answer

**Format Compliance Verification**:
- **Under**: Legal authority clearly stated (IRC Section 1061 as amended by TCJA 2017)
- **Does**: Action verb with specific legal consequence (qualify for LTCG treatment at 20% rate)
- **When**: Factual circumstances (Opportunity Fund with 6-12 month holding periods, $23M income)

## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

**Original Problem**: The phrase "below the 3-year statutory requirement" explicitly stated that:
1. Three years IS the requirement (legal conclusion)
2. 6-12 months IS below that threshold (comparative conclusion)
3. This RESULTS IN ordinary income treatment (outcome conclusion)

All three elements are conclusions that should appear in the Brief Answer, not the Question Presented.

**Revised Question Neutrality**: The revised question simply presents the facts (6-12 month holding periods, $23M income) and asks whether IRC Section 1061's long-term capital gains treatment applies. The reader must analyze the statute to determine the holding period requirement, compare it to the facts, and reach a conclusion—exactly what a neutral question should accomplish.

**Target Line**: Line 560 (Question 6 in the Questions Presented section)
**Section Context**: Section III. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

**Note**: The question appears to be numbered as Question 6 in the full Questions Presented section (line 560), though the task refers to it as Question 5. This may reflect different numbering between the Brief Answers table (where it's Question 5, line 114) and the full Questions Presented section (where it's Question 6, line 560). Recommend verifying numbering consistency during integration.
