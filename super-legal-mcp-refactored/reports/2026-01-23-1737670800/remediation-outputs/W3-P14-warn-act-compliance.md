**Section [X]. WARN Act Compliance Covenant.**

(a) **Representation.** Seller represents and warrants that, as of the Closing Date, no "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq., the "**WARN Act**") has occurred or is contemplated at any Pinnacle employment site (Boston headquarters, New York, Chicago, or San Francisco offices), and no WARN Act notice obligations currently exist or have been triggered during the [12] months preceding the Closing Date.

(b) **Pre-Closing WARN Compliance Plan.** Buyer and Seller shall, within [30] days after execution of this Agreement, jointly develop a written Employee Integration Plan (the "**Integration Plan**") addressing:

   (i) **Scope Analysis**: Anticipated post-Closing terminations, office consolidations (including planned closure of New York, Chicago, and San Francisco offices), employee relocations, and workforce reductions at each employment site;

   (ii) **WARN Act Compliance Analysis**: A written legal opinion prepared by independent employment counsel experienced in WARN Act compliance, analyzing whether the contemplated integration actions constitute a "plant closing" (closure of a single employment site affecting 50 or more employees) or "mass layoff" (employment loss for 50 or more employees representing at least 33% of the workforce at a single site, within any 90-day period, per 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(2)-(3));

   (iii) **Notice Protocol**: If the Integration Plan contemplates actions triggering WARN Act obligations (affecting 50 or more of Pinnacle's 138 employees), a detailed 60-day advance written notice protocol compliant with 29 U.S.C. § 2102, including:
      - Draft notice forms for affected employees;
      - Identification of applicable state dislocated worker units and local elected officials requiring notice;
      - Timeline ensuring 60-day notice period completed before any employment losses; and
      - Designation of responsible party (Buyer or Seller) for issuing notices.

   (iv) **Risk Quantification**: Estimated WARN Act liability exposure if notice requirements not satisfied, calculated as 60 days' back pay and benefits for each affected employee (currently estimated at approximately $500,000 for 51 displaced employees based on average compensation of $50,000 annually).

(c) **Post-Closing Integration Covenant.** Buyer covenants to structure the post-Closing employee integration to minimize WARN Act liability through one or more of the following methods (at Buyer's sole election):

   (i) **Staggered Terminations**: Space any necessary involuntary terminations across Pinnacle employment sites over a period exceeding [90] days to avoid WARN Act "mass layoff" aggregation under 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(3) (which aggregates employment losses occurring within any 90-day period at a single employment site). For purposes of this subsection, terminations at the New York office (31 employees), Chicago office (12 employees), and San Francisco office (8 employees) shall be treated as occurring at separate employment sites and shall not be aggregated unless occurring within 90 days of each other;

   (ii) **Voluntary Separation Program**: Offer enhanced voluntary separation packages to Pinnacle employees at offices designated for closure or consolidation, with minimum benefits of:
      - [3] months' base salary severance payment;
      - [6] months of employer-subsidized COBRA health insurance continuation coverage;
      - Professional outplacement services (minimum [6] months); and
      - Pro-rated annual bonus for year of separation.

   Such voluntary separation packages, if accepted by sufficient employees to achieve workforce reduction targets through voluntary attrition, shall avoid involuntary "employment losses" triggering WARN Act obligations;

   (iii) **Relocation Offers**: Offer substantially similar positions at Buyer's Boston or New York offices to displaced Pinnacle employees (particularly the 51 employees at offices designated for closure), with relocation assistance packages including:
      - Relocation expense reimbursement of $[25,000] per relocating employee;
      - [90] days to accept or decline relocation offer;
      - Temporary housing assistance (up to [3] months); and
      - Spousal job search assistance.

   Employees who decline bona fide relocation offers shall not be counted as "employment losses" for WARN Act purposes, per 29 C.F.R. § 639.3(e);

   (iv) **Compliant WARN Notice**: If a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" triggering WARN Act obligations is unavoidable (e.g., closure of single employment site affecting 50+ employees, or termination of 50+ employees representing 33%+ of workforce at single site within 90 days), Buyer shall provide 60-day advance written notice to:
      - Each affected Pinnacle employee (including reasonably foreseeable termination date);
      - The state dislocated worker unit in each affected state (Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, California);
      - The chief elected official of the unit of local government where each affected employment site is located;

   in compliance with 29 U.S.C. § 2102 and 20 C.F.R. Part 639. Notices shall be delivered no later than 60 days before any employment losses occur.

(d) **Indemnity Allocation.**

   (i) **Seller Indemnity**: Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer from and against any WARN Act Losses (defined below) arising from or related to:
      - Any plant closing, mass layoff, or employment loss occurring at any Pinnacle employment site prior to the Closing Date;
      - Any failure by Seller to provide required WARN Act notices for pre-Closing actions; or
      - Any misrepresentation in Section (a) above.

   (ii) **Buyer Assumption**: Buyer assumes and shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller from and against any WARN Act Losses arising from or related to Buyer's post-Closing integration decisions, employment actions, office closures, or workforce reductions, EXCEPT as provided in Section (e) below (Shared Liability Exception).

   (iii) **WARN Act Losses Defined**: For purposes of this Section, "**WARN Act Losses**" means any liability, damages, back pay, benefits, penalties, fines, attorneys' fees, or settlement amounts arising from or related to violations of the WARN Act or similar state plant closing laws (including California WARN Act, New York WARN Act, Illinois WARN Act), including but not limited to:
      - Back pay for each affected employee for the period of WARN Act violation (up to 60 days);
      - Value of benefits (health insurance, retirement contributions) for violation period;
      - Civil penalties up to $500 per day of violation (29 U.S.C. § 2104(a)(3));
      - Attorneys' fees and costs incurred by affected employees (29 U.S.C. § 2104(a)(6)); and
      - Costs of providing required notices and administrative compliance.

(e) **Shared Liability Exception.** Notwithstanding Section (d)(ii) above, if Buyer directs or implements an employee integration plan within [90] days of the Closing Date that results in a WARN Act violation (failure to provide required 60-day advance notice for a plant closing or mass layoff affecting 50 or more Pinnacle employees at any single employment site within a 90-day period), and such violation was not contemplated or addressed in the Pre-Closing WARN Compliance Plan prepared pursuant to Section (b):

   (i) **Shared Liability**: Buyer and Seller shall share WARN Act Losses arising from such violation equally (50% Buyer, 50% Seller);

   (ii) **Seller Liability Cap**: Seller's maximum aggregate liability under this subsection (e) for all WARN Act Losses is $[1,250,000] (representing 50% of estimated worst-case exposure of $2,500,000 for mass layoff affecting all 51 employees at closed offices);

   (iii) **Survival Period**: Claims under this subsection (e) must be asserted within [18] months after the Closing Date; provided that any claim asserted in writing within such period may be pursued thereafter until finally resolved;

   (iv) **Basket and Cap**: Shared liability under this subsection (e) is subject to the general indemnification basket and cap provisions in Section [●], except that Seller's $1,250,000 cap under subsection (e)(ii) shall apply specifically to WARN Act Losses and shall not reduce Seller's general indemnification cap.

(f) **Safe Harbor - No Seller Liability.** Seller has no liability under Section (e) (Shared Liability Exception) if Buyer satisfies any of the following conditions:

   (i) **Compliant Notice Provided**: Buyer provides full and timely 60-day advance WARN Act notice compliant with 29 U.S.C. § 2102 and 20 C.F.R. Part 639 for any plant closing or mass layoff affecting Pinnacle employees; OR

   (ii) **WARN Triggers Avoided**: Buyer structures the post-Closing integration to avoid WARN Act triggering events through:
      - Staggered terminations at each employment site spaced over a period exceeding 90 days (avoiding the 90-day aggregation rule under 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(3)); OR
      - Voluntary separation program achieving workforce reductions through voluntary attrition (with sufficient employee acceptance to avoid involuntary mass layoffs); OR
      - Bona fide relocation offers accepted by sufficient employees to reduce involuntary terminations below WARN Act thresholds; OR

   (iii) **Below Statutory Threshold**: The number of affected employees experiencing "employment loss" (as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(6)) remains below 50 at any single Pinnacle employment site (Boston, New York, Chicago, or San Francisco) within any 90-day period following the Closing Date.

(g) **Cooperation and Information Sharing.**

   (i) **Employee Census Data**: Seller shall provide Buyer, within [10] business days after execution of this Agreement, a detailed employee census listing all 138 Pinnacle employees by employment site, including:
      - Name, title, hire date, base salary, and benefits enrollment;
      - Employment site location (Boston HQ: 87 employees; New York: 31; Chicago: 12; San Francisco: 8);
      - Full-time/part-time status;
      - Any employment agreements, severance obligations, or change-in-control payments;
      - Historical turnover data (past [24] months) and pending terminations.

   (ii) **Integration Consultation**: Buyer and Seller agree to consult in good faith regarding the timing and structure of post-Closing terminations, office closures, and workforce reductions to minimize aggregate WARN Act exposure. Buyer shall provide Seller with [30] days' advance notice (to the extent commercially practicable) of any contemplated actions that may trigger WARN Act obligations.

   (iii) **Joint Employment Counsel**: If the Pre-Closing WARN Compliance Plan identifies material WARN Act risk (affecting 50+ employees or creating estimated liability exceeding $250,000), Buyer and Seller may jointly retain independent employment counsel specializing in WARN Act compliance, with fees shared equally, to advise on structuring integration to minimize liability.

   (iv) **State WARN Act Compliance**: The parties acknowledge that certain states (including California, New York, and Illinois, where Pinnacle maintains offices) have state-level "mini-WARN" acts with requirements differing from federal WARN Act (e.g., California WARN applies to employers with 75+ employees and requires notice for relocations exceeding 100 miles). The Integration Plan shall address compliance with applicable state plant closing laws, and references to "WARN Act" in this Section include applicable state law counterparts.

(h) **Cross-Reference to Risk Analysis.** This covenant addresses the WARN Act Integration Risk identified in Section IV.H.C.2 of the Legal Due Diligence Memorandum, which quantified:

   (i) **Gross Exposure**: $2,500,000 (assuming failure to provide 60-day notice for mass layoff affecting 51 employees at closed offices: estimated $500,000 in back pay and benefits, plus potential civil penalties and attorneys' fees);

   (ii) **Weighted Exposure**: $750,000 (30% probability reflecting integration execution risk and availability of mitigation strategies);

   (iii) **Affected Employees**: 51 employees (37% of Pinnacle's 138-person workforce) at New York (31), Chicago (12), and San Francisco (8) offices designated for closure or consolidation;

   (iv) **Integration Timeline**: Buyer's contemplated integration within 90 days of Closing creates heightened WARN Act aggregation risk under 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(3).

(i) **Verification and Authority.** This covenant is based on the following legal authorities and risk calculations:

   (i) **Statutory Authority**: Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109 (WARN Act); 20 C.F.R. Part 639 (Department of Labor WARN Act regulations);

   (ii) **Key WARN Act Triggers**:
      - **Plant Closing**: Permanent or temporary shutdown of single site of employment, or one or more facilities or operating units within single site, affecting 50+ employees during 30-day period (29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(2));
      - **Mass Layoff**: Employment loss at single site during 30-day period for (A) 50-499 employees if they constitute at least 33% of active workforce, OR (B) 500+ employees (29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(3));
      - **90-Day Aggregation**: Employment losses within any 90-day period aggregated to determine if WARN Act triggered, unless employer demonstrates losses result from separate and distinct actions (29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(3));

   (iii) **Notice Requirement**: 60 days' advance written notice to affected employees, state dislocated worker unit, and chief elected official (29 U.S.C. § 2102);

   (iv) **Penalties**: Back pay and benefits for each affected employee for period of violation (up to 60 days), plus civil penalty up to $500/day for failure to notify local government, plus attorneys' fees (29 U.S.C. § 2104(a));

   (v) **Exposure Calculation**: 51 employees × $50,000 average annual compensation = $2,550,000 total annual payroll ÷ 12 months × 2 months (60 days) = $425,000 back pay + estimated $75,000 benefits (health insurance, 401(k) contributions) = $500,000 base exposure, escalated to $2,500,000 gross exposure including civil penalties ($500/day × 60 days × 51 employees = $1,530,000) and estimated attorneys' fees ($500,000).

**Drafting Note**: WARN Act applies to employers with 100+ employees (Pinnacle's 138 employees exceed threshold). "Employment loss" includes termination (other than for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement), layoff exceeding 6 months, or reduction in work hours exceeding 50% for each month in any 6-month period (29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(6)). Employees who decline bona fide relocation offers to employment sites within reasonable commuting distance (generally <50 miles) are not counted as experiencing "employment loss" (20 C.F.R. § 639.3(e)). Staggering terminations across multiple 90-day periods is lawful mitigation strategy, but must result from "separate and distinct actions and causes" not undertaken to evade WARN Act (20 C.F.R. § 639.5(a)(2)). Enhanced voluntary separation packages ($25,000-$50,000 per employee) are often more cost-effective than WARN Act penalties ($500,000+ for 51 employees).

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Created comprehensive WARN Act Compliance Covenant provision addressing $2.5M gross exposure risk from planned integration of Pinnacle's 138 employees across 4 offices. Provision includes: (a) Seller representation of no existing WARN obligations; (b) mandatory 30-day Pre-Closing WARN Compliance Plan development; (c) four mitigation strategies (staggered terminations over 91+ days, voluntary separation packages with 3 months' severance, relocation offers with $25K assistance, or compliant 60-day notice); (d) indemnity allocation (Seller for pre-Closing, Buyer for post-Closing); (e) 50/50 shared liability exception capped at $1.25M per party with 18-month survival if Buyer-directed violation within 90 days; (f) safe harbor eliminating Seller liability if compliant notice provided, WARN triggers avoided, or <50 employees affected; (g) cooperation requirements including employee census sharing and joint employment counsel option; (h) cross-reference to Section IV.H.C.2 risk quantification ($500K base exposure for 51 employees); and (i) statutory authority verification citing 29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq. and 20 C.F.R. Part 639, with detailed exposure calculation methodology showing escalation from $500K base to $2.5M gross including civil penalties and attorneys' fees.
