### B.4 Counter-Analysis: Limitations on LP Enforcement of Key Person Redemption Rights

While key person provisions in Pinnacle's hedge fund LPAs facially grant limited partners enhanced redemption rights upon John Doe's departure, Delaware case law and typical hedge fund redemption mechanics impose significant limitations on LP enforcement. The analysis in Section IV.E.B.2 above presents the catastrophic scenario ($180M-$280M valuation impairment) assuming immediate, unimpeded LP redemptions. This counter-analysis examines adverse authority and structural limitations that may reduce enforcement probability or delay redemption timelines, thereby mitigating transaction risk.

#### GP Discretion and Business Judgment Deference

Where Pinnacle's LPAs grant the general partner authority to determine whether a key person event has occurred, Delaware courts apply highly deferential standards protecting GP business judgment. In *Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP v. Bandera Master Fund LP*, 286 A.3d 1 (Del. 2022), the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a $690 million damages award, emphasizing that courts must give "maximum effect to the principle of freedom of contract" in limited partnerships. The Court upheld exculpation provisions protecting GP determinations made with advice of legal counsel, even where the Court of Chancery found the GP acted "intentionally and opportunistically." *Boardwalk* establishes that partnership agreements may include conclusive presumptions of good faith when GPs rely on counsel opinions, and that judicial inquiry focuses on whether the GP *reasonably* relied on its determination—not whether the determination was substantively correct.

Similarly, *Allen v. El Paso Pipeline GP Co.*, 113 A.3d 167 (Del. 2015), established that where an LPA requires the GP to make determinations "in good faith," courts apply a "subjective belief" standard. LPs challenging the GP's determination bear the burden of proving the GP did not subjectively believe its determination—a showing requiring evidence of subjective bad faith, not mere disagreement with the decision's merits. Under *Allen*, if Pinnacle's GP determines that John Doe continues to "devote substantially all business time" to the funds despite post-acquisition reduced involvement, LPs must prove the GP subjectively knew this determination was false—a nearly insurmountable burden absent smoking gun evidence.

**Application to Pinnacle**: If Pinnacle's LPAs contain provisions stating "the General Partner shall determine in good faith whether a Key Person Event has occurred," or grant the GP discretion to assess cure through succession planning, these Delaware precedents create substantial barriers to LP enforcement:

- GP determination receives deference if made with advice of legal counsel (*Boardwalk*)
- Exculpation provisions may create conclusive presumptions of good faith (*Boardwalk*)
- LPs must prove subjective bad faith, not objective incorrectness (*Allen*)
- Courts will not substitute judicial judgment for GP business judgment (DRULPA § 17-1101)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Prior to closing, Pinnacle's GP should: (1) develop detailed succession plan identifying replacement key persons; (2) obtain legal opinion that succession plan satisfies LPA requirements or that John Doe's continued involvement (even if reduced) prevents key person event; (3) document founders' ongoing post-closing roles (advisory capacity, board seats, time commitments); and (4) create contemporaneous board resolutions determining no key person event occurred or event has been cured. Under *Boardwalk*, such legal opinions receive substantial judicial deference.

**Probability Adjustment**: If Pinnacle's LPA includes GP determination discretion and exculpation provisions, the probability that LPs successfully force immediate redemptions decreases from 35-45% (baseline in Section IV.E.B.2) to **15-25%**. The probability that GP determination is upheld increases to **40-50%**.

#### Implied Covenant Limitations on Opportunistic Redemption

Even where key person provisions appear clear, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing—which cannot be contractually eliminated under DRULPA § 17-1101(d)—imposes an "objective reasonableness" limitation on both GP and LP conduct. In *Gerber v. Enterprise Products Holdings, LLC*, 67 A.3d 400 (Del. 2013), the Delaware Supreme Court held that the implied covenant prohibits conduct that "acts arbitrarily or unreasonably to frustrate the unitholder's bargain." However, the Court emphasized that the covenant does not create new contractual rights; rather, it protects objectively reasonable expectations based on the partnership agreement's text.

*Gerber* establishes a dual limitation relevant to key person clause enforcement:

1. **GP Limitation**: GP cannot arbitrarily manipulate key person definitions to avoid clear triggers where LPA uses precise language.

2. **LP Limitation**: LP expectations must be objectively reasonable based on LPA text, not subjective investor preferences. LPs cannot claim covenant violation based on interpretations outside the agreement's language.

In *Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. v. Pillarstone Capital REIT*, C.A. No. 2022-0607-LWW (Del. Ch. Jan. 25, 2024), the Court reinforced that the implied covenant operates bilaterally, requiring both GP and LPs to act reasonably regarding contractual rights. While *Whitestone* protected LP redemption rights from GP interference through adoption of a poison pill, the Court's reasoning simultaneously suggests LPs cannot exercise redemption rights opportunistically or in a manner frustrating the partnership's legitimate business purposes.

**Application to Pinnacle**: If Pinnacle's LPAs define "key person" with flexible standards (e.g., "substantially all business time" rather than "80% time commitment" or "John Doe must serve as Chief Investment Officer"), the implied covenant permits GP to interpret this language reasonably and prevents LPs from claiming violation based on expansive interpretations:

- Reasonable succession planning may satisfy flexible key person requirements (*Gerber*)
- Continued founder involvement (even reduced) may support GP determination that no event occurred
- LP claims of opportunistic redemption during strategic acquisition—which may enhance LP value through Global Asset Partners' institutional infrastructure—may themselves violate the implied covenant (*Whitestone*)

**Distinguishing Factors**: LPs will argue that key person provisions exist precisely for change-of-control scenarios where founders' permanent departure (not temporary absence) creates investment risk. However, if John Doe remains involved post-closing in advisory capacity with meaningful time commitment (e.g., 50-60% vs. pre-acquisition 100%), GP has colorable argument that "substantially all business time" standard is satisfied when aggregating active management by successors plus founder advisory role.

**Probability Adjustment**: Implied covenant analysis suggests **20-30% probability** that courts would limit LP redemption exercise as unreasonable if: (1) LPA uses flexible key person language, (2) GP presents documented succession plan, (3) founder maintains material ongoing involvement, and (4) acquisition demonstrably enhances fund value through institutional resources.

#### Redemption Mechanics: Gates, Suspensions, and Procedural Delays

Even if key person provisions trigger redemption rights, such rights remain subject to the LPA's general redemption procedures. Typical hedge fund LPAs include:

- **Gates**: Limiting aggregate redemptions to specified percentage per period (commonly 10-25% quarterly)
- **Suspensions**: Permitting GP to suspend redemptions during "extraordinary circumstances"
- **Notice periods**: Requiring 30-90 days advance notice before redemption effective date
- **Orderly liquidation requirements**: Prohibiting redemptions requiring fire sales or disadvantaging remaining LPs

In *Lerner v. Paige Capital Management*, courts held that GPs possess substantial discretion to impose redemption gates in good faith, subject only to fiduciary duty not to act arbitrarily or solely for the GP's benefit. While *Lerner* established that "sole discretion" does not eliminate fiduciary duty, the decision confirms GP authority to gate redemptions to protect fund stability.

In *Seibold v. Camulos Partners LP* (Del. Ch.), the Court held that fund managers breached the LPA by withholding redemptions without "extraordinary circumstances" as required by the agreement. However, the Court's analysis confirms that where LPAs grant broad suspension authority, such authority is enforceable. The acquisition context—involving integration pressures, portfolio transitions, and operational disruptions—may constitute "extraordinary circumstances" permitting temporary suspension under typical LPA provisions.

**Application to Pinnacle**: Due diligence must analyze whether Pinnacle's LPAs subject key person redemptions to general redemption procedures. If so, procedural limitations materially extend LP exit timeline:

- **10% quarterly gate**: Only 10% of total fund NAV can redeem per quarter. For $3.0B gate-exempt key person redemptions (Section IV.E.B.2), if gate applies, actual quarterly outflow limited to $630M (10% of $6.3B total AUM), requiring **10 quarters (2.5 years)** for full exit.

- **90-day notice period**: Minimum 3-month delay between John Doe departure and first redemption payments, providing time for: (i) GP to obtain legal opinion; (ii) GP to negotiate retention agreement preventing departure; (iii) succession plan implementation.

- **"Extraordinary circumstances" suspension**: GP may argue acquisition integration constitutes extraordinary circumstances justifying 6-12 month temporary suspension. SEC enforcement precedent (*Aria Partners*, *Deccan Value Investors*) requires uniform treatment, meaning GP must apply suspension to all LPs (cannot selectively retain "friendly" LPs while redeeming "hostile" LPs).

- **Combined effect**: 12-24 month managed exit timeline even if key person redemptions triggered, reducing valuation impairment from catastrophic scenario ($440M-$660M immediate loss) to orderly transition scenario ($150M-$250M over 24 months with opportunity for AUM replacement).

**Critical Due Diligence Question**: Do Pinnacle's LPAs explicitly state that key person redemptions are "*exempt from*" or "*not subject to*" gates and notice periods? If LPAs are silent, Delaware's freedom of contract principles under DRULPA § 17-1101(c) suggest general redemption procedures apply unless expressly excluded.

**Probability Adjustment**: If gates and procedures apply to key person redemptions, probability of catastrophic 90-day outflow (Section IV.E.B.2 scenario) decreases to **5-10%**. Probability of managed 18-24 month exit timeline increases to **60-70%**, reducing valuation impairment by 50-65% due to: (i) time for AUM replacement, (ii) reduced fire-sale discounts, (iii) minimized cascade effect.

#### Waiver and Estoppel Defenses Based on Prior Course of Conduct

Delaware DRULPA §§ 17-202 and 17-302 permit waiver of partnership agreement requirements through LP conduct. Section 17-302 provides that acts that become void or voidable by reason of failure to comply with LPA requirements may have such requirements waived by approval of the persons required to approve the act or amend the agreement. Delaware courts recognize waiver by course of conduct, particularly where sophisticated parties demonstrate pattern of non-enforcement.

**Application to Pinnacle**: If Pinnacle's founders previously departed temporarily, reduced time commitment, or took extended absences (sabbaticals, medical leave, family emergencies) without triggering LP redemptions, the GP may argue LPs waived strict enforcement or acquiesced to flexible interpretation of key person provisions. Evidence supporting waiver defense includes:

- Multiple prior instances of founder absence/reduced involvement without redemption exercises
- LP communications acknowledging operational flexibility (e.g., annual meeting minutes noting founder sabbatical without objection)
- Long passage of time since prior "events" without objection (suggesting acquiescence)
- LPs continued to contribute capital after prior events (suggesting consent to GP's interpretation)

**Counter-Arguments**: LPs will distinguish operational flexibility from change-of-control transactions, arguing that: (1) key person provisions are designed specifically for M&A scenarios where founder departure is permanent, not temporary absences; (2) single instance of non-enforcement is insufficient for waiver absent clear LP knowledge and consent; (3) prior events were qualitatively different from complete exit in acquisition.

**Viability Assessment**: Waiver defense is stronger if: (i) prior departures involved extended absences (6+ months) rather than short vacations; (ii) prior departures occurred during critical performance periods (analogous to acquisition stress); (iii) LP investor relations materials acknowledged departures without triggering redemption language; (iv) 3+ instances over fund's lifetime establish pattern.

**Due Diligence Priority**: Document all instances since fund inception where John Doe or other designated key persons: (1) reduced time commitment below full-time; (2) took leave; (3) assumed external roles (board seats, advisory positions); (4) experienced temporary incapacity. Obtain LP correspondence from such periods to identify whether LPs raised key person concerns.

**Probability Adjustment**: Waiver defense has **20-30% probability** of success if strong pattern exists. More likely outcome is that waiver evidence supports GP's "good faith belief" that flexible interpretation is consistent with parties' course of performance, strengthening *Allen* subjective belief defense rather than completely barring LP claims.

#### SEC Enforcement Precedent: Uniform Treatment Requirement

SEC enforcement actions under Investment Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-8 (*Aria Partners GP, LLC*; *Deccan Value Investors*; *Galois Capital Management*) establish that GPs must apply redemption rights uniformly absent disclosure of preferential treatment. These cases, while protecting LPs from selective non-enforcement, simultaneously support GP arguments that key person provisions cannot be selectively enforced:

- If some LPs claim key person event occurred but others do not, GP must make uniform determination applying to all LPs.
- GP cannot permit "friendly" LPs to remain invested while forcing "hostile" LP redemptions based on key person provisions.
- Uniform determination that no key person event occurred treats all LPs equally, avoiding Rule 206(4)-8 preferential treatment violations.

**Application to Pinnacle**: If Pinnacle's GP determines—based on legal counsel opinion—that succession planning cured any key person event or that John Doe's continued advisory involvement satisfies LPA requirements, this determination must apply uniformly to all LPs. Individual LPs cannot claim preferential enforcement based on their subjective views of key person status. SEC precedent thus limits fragmentation of LP responses and supports GP's authority to make binding determinations.

#### Net Probability Adjustment and Revised Risk Assessment

Integrating the above counter-arguments with the baseline analysis in Section IV.E.B.2, the probability distribution for key person redemption enforcement shifts as follows:

| Scenario | Baseline Probability (§IV.E.B.2) | Adjusted Probability (w/ Counter-Analysis) | Key Determinants |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **GP determination upheld; no redemption rights triggered** | 10-15% | **40-50%** | • LPA grants GP determination discretion<br>• GP obtains legal opinion on succession adequacy<br>• Exculpation provisions present<br>• John Doe maintains material advisory role (40-60% time) |
| **Redemption rights triggered BUT delayed by procedures** | 20-30% | **35-45%** | • Clear key person event occurred<br>• Gates limit to 10-25% quarterly<br>• Notice periods extend timeline 90+ days<br>• Suspension for "extraordinary circumstances"<br>• Result: 18-24 month orderly exit vs. 90-day catastrophic exit |
| **Full immediate LP redemption enforced (catastrophic scenario)** | 35-45% | **15-25%** | • Objective key person triggers clearly met<br>• No GP discretion provisions in LPA<br>• LPA explicitly exempts key person redemptions from gates<br>• Complete founder departure with zero ongoing involvement |

**Revised Expected Value Calculation**:

- **Optimistic scenario (GP determination upheld)**: 45% probability × $0 valuation impairment = **$0**
- **Base case (delayed redemptions)**: 40% probability × $180M impairment = **$72M**
- **Stress scenario (immediate redemptions)**: 15% probability × $550M impairment = **$82.5M**
- **Revised Expected Value**: $72M + $82.5M = **$154.5M** (compared to $209M baseline expected value in Section IV.E.B.2)

**Expected value reduction: $54.5M (26% decrease) through application of limiting precedent.**

#### Critical Due Diligence Items to Determine Applicability

The counter-analysis limitations depend entirely on specific LPA provisions, which must be analyzed during confirmatory due diligence:

**Priority 1 – GP Discretion Provisions**:
- Does LPA state "the General Partner shall determine in good faith whether a Key Person Event has occurred"?
- Does LPA grant GP authority to cure key person events through succession planning or replacement hiring?
- Does LPA include exculpation for GP determinations made "in reliance on advice of counsel"?

**Priority 2 – Redemption Procedure Applicability**:
- Are key person redemptions explicitly "*exempt from*" gates and notice periods, or are they "*subject to*" general redemption procedures?
- What percentage gate applies (10%, 15%, 25%)?
- What notice period applies (30, 60, 90 days)?
- What constitutes "extraordinary circumstances" permitting redemption suspension?

**Priority 3 – Key Person Definition Precision**:
- Does LPA use objective triggers ("John Doe must serve as Chief Investment Officer") or flexible standards ("key persons must devote substantially all business time")?
- Does LPA permit GP to designate successor key persons?
- Does LPA define "departure" to include reduced involvement, or only resignation/termination/death/disability?

**Priority 4 – Historical Enforcement**:
- Has John Doe previously taken extended leave (3+ months) without triggering key person provisions?
- Have LPs submitted redemption requests citing key person concerns in the past?
- Do LP correspondence files contain discussions of founder time commitment or role changes?

**Priority 5 – Side Letter Variations**:
- Do any side letters grant enhanced key person redemption rights beyond base LPA (e.g., exemption from gates)?
- Do side letters contain MFN clauses that would spread enhanced rights to other LPs?
- What percentage of $3.0B affected AUM is governed by side letters with varied provisions?

**Mitigation Recommendation**: Prior to signing definitive acquisition agreement, Global Asset Partners should: (1) complete full LPA review with specific attention to items above; (2) model revised expected value under optimistic scenario (GP discretion upheld) vs. stress scenario (immediate redemptions); (3) negotiate purchase price adjustment or escrow equal to incremental expected value risk; (4) require Pinnacle GP to obtain legal opinion pre-closing that no key person event has occurred or that succession plan satisfies LPA requirements (creating *Boardwalk* deference presumption).

**Supporting Authority**:

1. *Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP v. Bandera Master Fund LP*, 286 A.3d 1 (Del. 2022) (maximum deference to freedom of contract; exculpation provisions for counsel-reliant determinations)
2. *Allen v. El Paso Pipeline GP Co.*, 113 A.3d 167 (Del. 2015) (subjective belief standard for good faith determinations)
3. *Gerber v. Enterprise Products Holdings, LLC*, 67 A.3d 400 (Del. 2013) (implied covenant requires objective reasonableness; does not create new rights)
4. *Whitestone REIT Operating Partnership, L.P. v. Pillarstone Capital REIT*, C.A. No. 2022-0607-LWW (Del. Ch. Jan. 25, 2024) (implied covenant applies bilaterally to GP and LPs)
5. 6 Del. C. § 17-1101(c) (DRULPA freedom of contract policy)
6. 6 Del. C. § 17-1101(d) (implied covenant cannot be eliminated but has limited scope)
7. 6 Del. C. §§ 17-202, 17-302 (waiver and amendment provisions)
8. *Lerner v. Paige Capital Management* (GP discretion to impose redemption gates in good faith)
9. *Seibold v. Camulos Partners LP* (Del. Ch.) (extraordinary circumstances suspension authority)
10. SEC enforcement actions: *Aria Partners GP, LLC*; *Deccan Value Investors*; *Galois Capital Management* (uniform treatment requirement for redemption rights)
