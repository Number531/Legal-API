# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Project Argos - Acquisition of Pinnacle Investment Management, Inc.
**Prepared for**: Global Asset Partners LLC Board of Directors
**Date**: January 23, 2026

---

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Overall Risk Assessment**: HIGH

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
Global Asset Partners should proceed with the $1.8B acquisition of Pinnacle Investment Management, subject to enhanced escrow ($120M-$160M), pre-closing remediation of critical regulatory deficiencies, and founder/CIO retention arrangements with succession planning. The transaction presents probability-weighted exposure of $85.4M (4.7% of deal value), driven primarily by key person risk ($112M) and insurance coverage gaps ($8M), both mitigable through structured deal protections. No deal-blocking issues were identified across 12 specialized due diligence analyses.

### Rationale
Primary transaction risks center on operational concentration and regulatory compliance rather than litigation or contractual obstacles. The founder/CIO's age (62) combined with absence of a designated successor creates the single largest exposure at $180M-$280M gross ($112M weighted). Concurrent regulatory deficiencies from the October 2023 SEC examination require $1.35M-$2.05M in remediation but present manageable enforcement risk if addressed pre-closing. The target's $42.5B AUM, 18-year operating history, and diversified client base across mutual funds ($16.8B), institutional separate accounts ($23.4B), and private funds ($3.0B) provide a defensible integration platform. [See **Section IV.H** (key person), **Section IV.C** (SEC examination)]

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding
1. **Founder/CIO Retention** - Execute 3-year retention agreement with John Doe including phased transition plan and successor designation [**Section IV.H**]
2. **Escrow Establishment** - $120M-$160M holdback for key person risk, regulatory exposure, and valuation markdown contingencies [**Section II**]
3. **SEC Deficiency Remediation** - Complete Form ADV amendments, cross-trading investigation, and custody rule compliance before closing [**Section IV.C**]
4. **Insurance Procurement** - Obtain $10M-$15M cyber liability policy and increase E&O limits from $10M to $25M-$50M [**Section IV.K**]
5. **Independent Director Addition** - Add 1-2 independent directors to mutual fund board for Section 15(f) compliance cushion above 75% threshold [**Section IV.B**]

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question (Abbreviated) | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Under Section 206, are Form ADV disclosures materially deficient? | **Probably Yes** | SEC October 2023 exam identified deficiencies in Items 10 (custody), 11 (code of ethics), 12 (cross-trading), 17 (compliance). 5 categories require amendment. | IV.A, IV.C |
| 2 | Under ICA Section 15(f), does board composition satisfy independent director requirements? | **Yes (At Threshold)** | Board is exactly 75.0% independent (9 of 12), meeting minimum but with zero cushion. One director change could trigger violation. | IV.B |
| 3 | Under ERISA Section 406(b), do cross-trades constitute prohibited transactions? | **Probably Yes** | SEC exam identified 8 cross-trades with procedural deficiencies suggesting non-compliance with Section 408(b)(19) exemption. 60-70% probability of prohibited transaction status. | IV.F |
| 4 | Under SEC Marketing Rule 206(4)-1, do testimonial disclosures satisfy requirements? | **No** | $10.08M annual fee reductions to testimonial providers not disclosed. Generic 8-point gray font footer fails prominence standard per December 2025 Risk Alert. | IV.D |
| 5 | Under IRC Section 1061, does carried interest qualify for LTCG treatment? | **Probably No** | Holding periods under 3 years result in ordinary income treatment (37% vs. 20%), creating $3.9M annual tax differential. | IV.I |
| 6 | Under Massachusetts law, are PM non-compete covenants enforceable? | **Probably No** | Massachusetts requires garden leave payments for non-competes with employees earning >$100K. Without garden leave, covenants likely unenforceable for senior PMs. | IV.H |
| 7 | Are current E&O/D&O policy limits adequate for $42.5B AUM RIA? | **No** | Industry benchmark is $25M-$50M E&O for comparable AUM. Current $10M limits create $10M-$20M uninsured gap in valuation markdown scenarios. | IV.K |
| 8 | Does acquisition trigger change-of-control client consents? | **Yes** | 40% of institutional separate account AUM ($9.4B) includes change-of-control provisions requiring affirmative consent. 5-10% client termination risk. | IV.J |

**Answer Scale:** Yes (high confidence) | Probably Yes (more likely than not) | Uncertain (split authority) | Probably No (risk remains) | No (high confidence negative)

- **Most Volatile**: Valuation Markdown - 20-60% probability range creates $45M variance
- **Correlated Risks**: PM departures and client terminations compound - 2+ senior PM exits could trigger cascade increasing exposure from $73M to $200M+

### Market Benchmark Summary

| Risk Category | Market Escrow Range | Typical Survival | Standard Cap | Our Position |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Key Person/Retention | 5-8% purchase price | 24-36 months | 50% of escrow | Within (7-9%) |
| Regulatory/Compliance | 2-3% purchase price | 18-24 months | 100% of fines | Within (0.3%) |
| Valuation/Financial | 3-5% purchase price | 12-18 months | 150% of markdown | Within (2-3%) |
| Insurance Gaps | Require procurement | Pre-closing | Full limits | At Market |

**Positioning vs. Market:**
- **Above Market (Justified)**: Key person escrow at $75M-$100M (4-6% vs. typical 3-5%) due to founder age 62 + no successor

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Key Person and Retention Risk Cascade

The founder/CIO John Doe's age (62) and absence of a designated successor creates interconnected risks:

**Primary Finding** [**Section IV.H**]: John Doe personally manages relationships with 60% of institutional clients ($14B AUM) and serves as the firm's public face. His departure would trigger LPA key person clauses affecting $3.0B in private fund commitments.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Private Fund Structures [IV.E]**: Key person clauses in 4 hedge fund and 2 private equity LPAs enable LP redemptions within 90 days, potentially triggering $900M-$1.5B in redemption requests
- **Commercial Contracts [IV.J]**: 40% of institutional separate accounts ($9.4B) include John Doe-specific "key person" provisions enabling termination without standard 90-day notice
- **Valuation [IV.G]**: Firm valuation at 10-15x EBITDA ($440M-$660M) depends on AUM stability; founder departure could reduce multiple to 6-8x
- **Insurance [IV.K]**: Key man life insurance currently $5M, materially below $50M-$100M benchmark for founder-dependent RIAs

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $185.2M weighted ($112M founder + $73.2M PM concentration)

### B. Regulatory Compliance Concentration

October 2023 SEC examination deficiencies create compounding exposure across statutory frameworks:

**Primary Finding** [**Section IV.C**]: SEC identified deficiencies in 5 categories: cross-trading disclosure, custody rule compliance, valuation documentation, trade allocation, and compliance program annual review.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Investment Advisers Act [IV.A]**: Form ADV Items 10, 11, 12, 17 require amendment within 30 days
- **ERISA Fiduciary [IV.F]**: 8 cross-trades with procedural deficiencies suggest non-compliance with Section 408(b)(19), creating $11.5M IRC Section 4975 excise tax exposure
- **Marketing Rule [IV.D]**: Pattern-and-practice consideration compounds penalty risk by 35-40%
- **Insurance [IV.K]**: E&O policy excludes regulatory fines; all SEC remediation costs ($1.35M-$2.05M) are uninsured

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $4.5M weighted

### C. Insurance Coverage Gaps

Material coverage inadequacies create uninsured exposure across risk categories:

**Primary Finding** [**Section IV.K**]: E&O limits ($10M) are 60-80% below benchmark for $42.5B AUM RIA. Cyber liability insurance is absent despite 8,749 client PII records.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Privacy/Cybersecurity [IV.L]**: Data breach costs of $3.2M-$13.3M entirely uninsured
- **Valuation [IV.G]**: $360M Level 3 illiquid asset markdown could generate LP claims exceeding E&O limits by $10M-$20M
- **Investment Company Act [IV.B]**: Mutual fund fee litigation exposure of $5M-$8M exceeds D&O sublimit
- **ERISA [IV.F]**: IRC Section 4975 excise taxes ($1.5M-$16.1M) categorically uninsurable

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $20.1M-$21.9M weighted

### D. Private Fund Structural Constraints

Existing fund documentation creates perpetual financial constraints:

**Primary Finding** [**Section IV.E**]: Performance fee high-water marks require $326M in cumulative outperformance before next incentive fee collection. Side letter MFN provisions already triggered $3.6M annual fee reductions.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Tax Structure [IV.I]**: 70% of carried interest positions have holding periods under 3 years, resulting in ordinary income treatment ($3.9M annual differential)
- **Commercial Contracts [IV.J]**: MFN cascade effect - 15 side letters with MFN provisions, 8 already triggered
- **Valuation [IV.G]**: 10 consecutive quarters below HWM reduces revenue projections by $57M-$95M over 3-5 years

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $102.5M + $7.5M annually; warrants $60M-$100M purchase price adjustment

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening | Target | Walk-Away | Section |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Escrow Amount | $160M (9%) | $130M (7%) | $100M (5.5%) | II |
| Escrow Release | 36-month survival | 24-month with milestones | 18-month minimum | II |
| Key Person Retention | 5-year earnout, full vesting | 3-year, 60% vesting | 2-year minimum | IV.H |
| Purchase Price Adjustment | $100M reduction | $75M reduction | $50M minimum | IV.E, IV.I |
| Insurance Procurement | Seller procures pre-closing | Shared 50/50 | Buyer procures at seller cost | IV.K |
| SEC Remediation | Seller completes pre-closing | Seller initiates, cost cap $2M | Buyer handles with indemnity | IV.C |

### Key Leverage Points
1. **Regulatory Deficiency Pattern**: 6 SEC deficiency categories create pattern-and-practice risk justifying enhanced escrow [**IV.C, IV.D**]
2. **Insurance Gaps**: Absent cyber insurance and material E&O inadequacy justify pre-closing procurement requirement [**IV.K**]
3. **Founder Age**: John Doe's age (62) and no documented succession plan support retention requirements [**IV.H**]

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| # | Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence |
|---|-----------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | "Key person risk overstated - John Doe committed" | HIGH | No written succession plan; 40% clients have Doe-specific provisions | IV.H |
| 2 | "SEC exam deficiencies are routine" | MEDIUM | 5 deficiency categories in single exam is above median; pattern risk | December 2025 Risk Alert |
| 3 | "High-water mark will recover within 18 months" | MEDIUM | 28.8% cumulative return required; 10 consecutive quarters underwater | IV.E |
| 4 | "Insurance limits adequate for firm this size" | LOW | Benchmark $25M-$50M E&O; complete cyber absence is critical | ACA Group data, IV.K |

### Negotiation Playbook

| Scenario | If Seller Says... | We Respond... | Fallback |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Escrow | "10% excessive for clean RIA" | Cite 6 deficiency categories + key person concentration | Accept 6% with 36-month survival |
| Key Person | "Retirement not imminent" | Age 62 + no written plan + 60% client relationships | Require 3-year commitment + successor designation |
| Insurance | "No claims history" | Claims history irrelevant; benchmark data shows gap | Require cyber pre-closing; E&O increase within 90 days |
| Price | "HWM recovery is market-dependent" | 100% probability of $57M-$95M revenue gap is certain | Accept 50% reduction with HWM earnout if recovered within 24 months |

### Critical Path Risks
- **Founder Retention**: Failure to execute by Mar 15 could delay closing 30-60 days and increase escrow
- **Client Consents**: 40% institutional AUM requiring consent; 5-10% termination probability could reduce deal value by $9.4M-$18.8M
- **SEC Remediation**: Incomplete remediation could attract enforcement attention, requiring disclosure and delaying closing
