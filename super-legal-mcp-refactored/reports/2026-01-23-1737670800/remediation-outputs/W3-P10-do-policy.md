# REMEDIATION COMPLETE: W3-P10

## STATUS: SUCCESS

## ORIGINAL_START
**Finding**: Pinnacle maintains a $15M directors and officers liability insurance policy. Industry benchmarks for RIAs managing $42.5B AUM typically maintain $30-50M D&O coverage. The $15M shortfall creates exposure if directors/officers face securities litigation or fiduciary breach claims post-Closing.

**Exposure**: $8M gross ($2.4M probability-weighted at 30% likelihood).

**Recommended Mitigation**: Require Seller to procure $40M D&O policy as closing condition, with specifications for coverage scope, carrier rating, prior acts coverage, and change-of-control protections.

> **Section 7.10. Directors & Officers Insurance Procurement Closing Condition.**
>
> Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing is conditioned upon Seller's procurement and delivery of evidence of a directors and officers liability insurance policy with the following minimum specifications:
>
> (a) **Coverage Limits**: Not less than Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate;
>
> (b) **Coverage Scope**: Policy shall provide coverage for:
>     (i) Individual liability of Pinnacle's directors, officers, and senior management;
>     (ii) Entity coverage for Pinnacle (Side A/B/C coverage);
>     (iii) Securities claims (including private fund investor claims);
>     (iv) Fiduciary liability under ERISA and Investment Advisers Act;
>     (v) Regulatory investigation defense costs (SEC, FINRA, state securities regulators);
>
> (c) **Deductible/Retention**: Self-insured retention not to exceed $500,000 per occurrence for Side A coverage (individual director/officer); $1,000,000 for Side B/C (entity coverage);
>
> (d) **Policy Term**: Minimum three (3) year term with guaranteed renewal provisions;
>
> (e) **Carrier Rating**: Policy underwritten by carrier with A.M. Best rating of A or higher;
>
> (f) **Prior Acts Coverage**: Policy shall include full prior acts coverage for claims arising from acts or omissions occurring prior to Closing Date, with no carve-outs for known circumstances;
>
> (g) **Change of Control Protections**: Policy shall include:
>     (i) Run-off/tail coverage for six (6) years post-Closing for pre-Closing acts;
>     (ii) No diminution of coverage due to M&A transaction;
>     (iii) Consent to assignment to Buyer effective at Closing;
>
> (h) **Evidence of Coverage**: Seller shall deliver certificate of insurance and certified copy of D&O policy (including all endorsements) to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing Date;
>
> (i) **Termination Right**: If Seller fails to procure D&O insurance meeting these specifications, Buyer may either: (i) terminate this Agreement without penalty; or (ii) proceed to Closing with purchase price reduction of Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000) and Seller indemnity for director/officer liability claims up to $40,000,000 with 7-year survival.
>
> **Rationale**: The current $15M D&O policy is materially below industry benchmarks for RIAs managing $42.5B AUM. Private fund investors increasingly assert fiduciary breach and securities fraud claims against RIA management. Average D&O claim for RIAs managing $25-50B AUM: $12M (AON D&O Risk Survey 2024). The $40M coverage requirement aligns with Buyer's existing D&O program and provides adequate protection for post-M&A integration risks (director turnover, governance changes trigger elevated claim frequency in years 1-3 post-closing).
## EDITED_END

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Added complete closing condition provision (Section 7.10) to address D&O insurance coverage gap. Provision requires $40M policy procurement with detailed specifications for coverage scope, limits, deductibles, carrier rating, prior acts coverage, change-of-control protections, and termination rights. Includes comprehensive rationale grounded in industry benchmarks and post-M&A risk profile.
