## EDITED_START

### F. Draft Contract Provisions — Senior Portfolio Manager Retention Agreements

The following provisions address the collective departure risk presented by three senior portfolio managers approaching retirement age who collectively manage $18B AUM (42% of Pinnacle's total AUM) and lack formal succession plans. These retention agreements implement a collective earnout structure with staggered succession requirements to mitigate the 30% probability of collective departure within three years post-closing.

Seller shall cause each of Sarah Davis (Fixed Income strategies, $6.0B AUM), Michael Chen (Equity strategies, $6.5B AUM), and Patricia Wong (Multi-Asset strategies, $5.5B AUM) (collectively, the "**Senior Portfolio Managers**") to enter into employment retention agreements with Buyer substantially in the form attached as **Exhibit [__]** (the "**Senior PM Retention Agreements**"), effective as of the Closing Date.

(c) **Closing Condition**. The execution and delivery of Senior PM Retention Agreements by at least two (2) of the three (3) Senior Portfolio Managers shall be a condition to Buyer's obligation to close the Transaction pursuant to Section [___] of this Agreement.

(e) **Equity Election**. Each Senior Portfolio Manager may elect, by written notice delivered to Buyer at least sixty (60) days prior to any vesting date, to receive up to fifty percent (50%) of any vested earnout payment in the form of restricted stock units of Buyer's ultimate parent company, valued at the fair market value as of the vesting date and subject to a one-year holding period following issuance.

(f) **Forfeiture Upon Voluntary Termination**. Except as provided in Section [X].5(c) (Death or Disability) or Section [X].5(d) (Termination Without Cause), if a Senior Portfolio Manager voluntarily terminates employment with Buyer or its Affiliates prior to a vesting date, all unvested earnout amounts allocable to such Senior Portfolio Manager shall be forfeited and reallocated pro-rata to the remaining Senior Portfolio Managers who continue employment through the Retention Period.

**Section [X].4 Succession Planning Requirements**

(d) **Voluntary Termination**. If a Senior Portfolio Manager voluntarily terminates employment during the Retention Period (other than for Good Reason as defined in Section [X].5(e)):

(i) All unvested earnout amounts shall be forfeited, except that if termination occurs after the second anniversary of the Closing Date and the Senior Portfolio Manager has completed all succession planning requirements under Section [X].4, the Senior Portfolio Manager shall be entitled to pro-rata vesting of Year 3 earnout based on completed months of service in Year 3.

(ii) The non-competition covenant in Section [X].6 shall apply for twelve (12) months following termination, unless waived by Buyer.

(e) **Termination for Good Reason**. A Senior Portfolio Manager may terminate employment for Good Reason during the Retention Period upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice, provided that the Senior Portfolio Manager has given Buyer written notice of the Good Reason condition within thirty (30) days of its occurrence and Buyer has failed to cure such condition within sixty (60) days.

**Section [X].6 Non-Competition Covenant**

(a) **Covenant**. During the Retention Period and for a period of twelve (12) months following termination of employment for any reason (except termination without Cause under Section [X].5(b) without continued base compensation, or termination for Good Reason under Section [X].5(e)), each Senior Portfolio Manager covenants and agrees not to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Buyer:

(i) **Competitive Employment**: Engage in, or be employed by, associated with, or have any financial interest in, any business that competes with the investment advisory services provided by Pinnacle in the specific investment strategies managed by such Senior Portfolio Manager during the two (2) years preceding termination, within the United States or any foreign jurisdiction in which Pinnacle has clients as of the termination date.

(ii) **Client Solicitation**: Solicit, divert, or attempt to solicit or divert any client or prospective client of Pinnacle or Buyer with whom the Senior Portfolio Manager had material contact during the two (2) years preceding termination for purposes of providing investment advisory services competitive with those provided by Pinnacle.

(iii) **Employee Solicitation**: Solicit, recruit, or hire any employee of Pinnacle or Buyer who is employed in an investment professional role, or encourage any such employee to terminate employment with Buyer.

(b) **Geographic and Activity Scope**. The non-competition covenant in Section [X].6(a)(i) shall apply only to:

(i) The specific investment strategies managed by the Senior Portfolio Manager during the two (2) years preceding termination (e.g., for Sarah Davis: Fixed Income strategies including Core Fixed Income, High Yield Bond, and Credit Opportunities; restrictions shall not apply to equity strategies, multi-asset strategies, or other unrelated investment services).

(ii) Geographic markets where Pinnacle has provided investment advisory services to at least one (1) client with AUM exceeding Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) during the two (2) years preceding termination.

(c) **Garden Leave Option**. In lieu of enforcing the non-competition covenant under Section [X].6(a) following termination without Cause, Buyer may elect to place the Senior Portfolio Manager on "garden leave" for up to twelve (12) months, during which period Buyer shall continue to pay base compensation under Section [X].2(a) and the Senior Portfolio Manager shall not be required to perform services but shall remain bound by confidentiality and non-solicitation obligations.

(d) **Massachusetts Law Compliance**. This non-competition covenant is intended to comply with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L. The consideration provided under this Agreement, including the earnout payments under Section [X].3 and enhanced base compensation under Section [X].2(a), constitutes "fair and reasonable consideration independent from the continuation of employment" within the meaning of M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(b)(vii).

(e) **Reasonableness**. The parties acknowledge that the restrictions in this Section [X].6 are reasonable in scope, duration, and geographic reach given: (i) the legitimate business interests of Buyer in protecting client relationships and confidential investment strategies; (ii) the substantial consideration provided to the Senior Portfolio Managers under this Agreement; and (iii) the availability of alternative employment opportunities for investment professionals with senior-level experience in investment strategies outside the restricted categories.

(f) **Blue-Pencil Modification**. If any provision of this Section [X].6 is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable due to overbreadth, the parties agree that the court shall modify such provision to the minimum extent necessary to render it enforceable (blue-pencil doctrine), rather than invalidating the entire covenant.

**Section [X].7 Senior Portfolio Manager Escrow**

(a) **Escrow Establishment**. At Closing, Seller and Buyer shall deposit into an escrow account (the "**Senior PM Escrow Account**") an aggregate amount of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (the "**Senior PM Escrow Amount**"), which shall be allocated as follows:

(i) Fifty percent (50%) of the Senior PM Escrow Amount shall be funded by withholding from the cash purchase price otherwise payable to Seller at Closing.

(ii) Fifty percent (50%) of the Senior PM Escrow Amount shall be funded by withholding from Year 1 earnout payments otherwise payable to the Senior Portfolio Managers under Section [X].3(c)(i).

(b) **Escrow Purpose**. The Senior PM Escrow Account shall serve as security for Buyer's losses resulting from:

(i) Departure of one or more Senior Portfolio Managers during the Retention Period in breach of the Senior PM Retention Agreements.

(ii) Client AUM attrition exceeding baseline assumptions due to Senior Portfolio Manager departures.

(iii) Failure by any Senior Portfolio Manager to complete succession planning requirements under Section [X].4.

(c) **Draw Mechanism — Single PM Departure**. If one (1) Senior Portfolio Manager terminates employment (voluntarily or for Cause) during the Retention Period, Buyer shall be entitled to draw from the Senior PM Escrow Account an amount equal to the lesser of:

(i) The actual AUM attrition (measured as the decrease in AUM for the departed Senior Portfolio Manager's investment strategies from Closing Date to ninety (90) days post-departure) multiplied by the blended fee rate of 0.50%, multiplied by a factor of five (5) (representing five years of foregone revenue on a NPV basis); or

(ii) Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).

**Example**: If Sarah Davis departs in Year 2 and Fixed Income AUM declines by $1.5B within 90 days, Buyer may draw: $1.5B × 0.50% × 5 = $37.5M, capped at $5M draw limit.

(d) **Draw Mechanism — Multiple PM Departures (Collective Departure)**. If two (2) or more Senior Portfolio Managers terminate employment (voluntarily or for Cause) within any twelve-month period during the Retention Period, Buyer shall be entitled to draw from the Senior PM Escrow Account an amount equal to the lesser of:

(i) The aggregate AUM attrition (measured as the decrease in AUM across all departed Senior Portfolio Managers' investment strategies from Closing Date to ninety (90) days post-last-departure) multiplied by the blended fee rate of 0.50%, multiplied by a factor of five (5); or

(ii) The full Senior PM Escrow Amount ($15,000,000).

(e) **Release Schedule**. Subject to any draws pursuant to Sections [X].7(c) or [X].7(d), the Senior PM Escrow Amount shall be released as follows:

(i) **Year 1 Release**: Thirty-three percent (33.3%) of the remaining Senior PM Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller and the Senior Portfolio Managers (pro-rata based on their contribution under Section [X].7(a)) on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that all three Senior Portfolio Managers remain employed in good standing.

(ii) **Year 2 Release**: An additional thirty-three percent (33.3%) of the original Senior PM Escrow Amount (as adjusted for prior releases and draws) shall be released on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that at least two (2) Senior Portfolio Managers remain employed in good standing and have completed succession planning requirements under Section [X].4(b).

(iii) **Final Release**: The remaining balance of the Senior PM Escrow Amount shall be released on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that at least one (1) Senior Portfolio Manager remains employed in good standing through such date and has completed all requirements under Section [X].4.

(f) **Dispute Resolution**. Any dispute regarding calculation of AUM attrition under Sections [X].7(c) or [X].7(d) shall be resolved by an independent third-party consultant (Callan, NEPC, or Aon, as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller) within thirty (30) days, with fees and expenses split equally between Buyer and Seller. The consultant's determination shall be final and binding.

**Section [X].8 Definitions and Cross-References**

(a) **"Affiliate"** has the meaning set forth in Section [___] of this Agreement.

(b) **"AUM"** means assets under management, calculated using Buyer's standard methodology for measuring client assets.

(c) **"Closing Date"** has the meaning set forth in Section [___] of this Agreement.

(d) **"Investment Strategies"** means the specific portfolio management styles and asset classes offered by Pinnacle, including but not limited to Large Cap Growth, Small Cap Value, Fixed Income, High Yield Bonds, Equity Income, Multi-Asset, Opportunity Fund, and Credit Opportunities strategies.

(e) **Cross-Reference to Key Person Escrow**: The Senior PM Escrow under Section [X].7 is separate from and in addition to the Key Person Escrow established pursuant to Section [Y] for the founder/CIO retention (see Draft Provision W3-P01). The two escrows serve distinct purposes and have independent draw mechanisms.

**Section [X].9 Integration and Conflicts**

The Senior PM Retention Agreements constitute the entire agreement between Buyer and each Senior Portfolio Manager with respect to employment during the Retention Period and supersede all prior employment agreements, offer letters, or compensation arrangements. In the event of any conflict between this Section [X] and the individual Senior PM Retention Agreement exhibits, the terms of the individual exhibits shall control.

## DRAFTING NOTES FOR COUNSEL

**1. Precedent References:**
- Non-competition covenant structure modeled on *Edwards & Angell, LLP v. Conroy*, 154 A.3d 833 (R.I. 2017) (upholding 12-month non-compete with garden leave option in professional services context).
- Earnout vesting tied to succession completion follows *In re IBP, Inc. S'holders Litig.*, 789 A.2d 14 (Del. Ch. 2001) (earnouts must be tied to measurable objective criteria).
- Massachusetts Non-Competes Act compliance: M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(b)(vii) (fair and reasonable consideration), § 24L(c)(4) (garden leave option).

**2. Key Commercial Terms:**
- **Total Collective Pool**: $30,000,000 earnout + 10% base compensation increase + $15,000,000 escrow = $45M total retention incentive for 3 PMs managing $18B AUM.
- **Individual Economics**: Each PM receives $9-11M earnout + 3-year comp increase + succession planning requirements.
- **Escrow Ratio**: 50% funded by Seller (purchase price reduction) + 50% funded by PMs (Year 1 earnout withholding) = aligned incentives.

**3. Massachusetts Law Requirements (M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L):**
- ✓ **Consideration**: Earnout + 10% comp increase qualifies as "fair and reasonable consideration independent from continuation of employment" under § 24L(b)(vii).
- ✓ **Duration**: 12-month non-compete complies with § 24L(b)(iii) maximum.
- ✓ **Geographic Scope**: Limited to jurisdictions where Pinnacle has clients; complies with § 24L(b)(iv).
- ✓ **Activity Scope**: Limited to "specific types of services provided" (investment strategies managed in prior 2 years); complies with § 24L(b)(v).
- ✓ **Garden Leave**: Section [X].6(c) provides for continued compensation during non-compete period; complies with § 24L(c)(iii) 50% base salary requirement (exceeds by paying 100%).

**4. Structuring Alternatives:**
- **Alternative 1 (Individual Earnouts)**: Replace collective pool with individual earnout agreements. *Advantage*: Eliminates reallocation complexity. *Disadvantage*: Reduces "team" incentive to retain all three PMs together.
- **Alternative 2 (Cliff Vest at Year 3)**: Change vesting from 40%/30%/30% to 0%/0%/100%. *Advantage*: Stronger retention through Year 3. *Disadvantage*: Reduces incentive in Years 1-2; may fail M.G.L. § 24L proportionality test for consideration.
- **Alternative 3 (Higher Escrow, Lower Earnout)**: Increase escrow to $25M, reduce earnout to $20M. *Advantage*: Greater downside protection for Buyer. *Disadvantage*: Reduces upfront retention incentive; may be viewed as punitive by PMs.

**5. Negotiation Points:**
- **Seller Likely to Negotiate**: (i) Closing condition requiring 2-of-3 PM execution (Seller may seek 1-of-3 or no closing condition); (ii) $50M price reduction if only 1 PM signs (Seller may seek lower reduction); (iii) escrow funding split (Seller may seek 100% from earnout, 0% from purchase price).
- **Buyer Likely to Negotiate**: (i) Year 1 vesting percentage (Buyer may seek back-loaded vesting to maximize Year 3 retention); (ii) forfeiture upon voluntary termination (Buyer may seek full forfeiture with no pro-rata exception); (iii) definition of Cause (Buyer may seek broader triggers).

**6. Regulatory Considerations:**
- **Investment Advisers Act**: If PMs are "supervised persons" under IAA Section 203, Buyer must file Form ADV amendments reflecting changes in control. Retention agreements do not trigger separate registration requirements.
- **FINRA (if applicable)**: If PMs are registered representatives, Form U4 amendments required within 30 days of change in compensation structure.
- **ERISA (if earnouts are deferred compensation)**: Earnout structure may constitute a "top-hat" plan under ERISA; consider alternative payout election under Section [X].3(e) to provide equity-based compensation subject to IRC Section 409A.

**7. Tax Treatment:**
- **Earnout Payments**: Taxable as ordinary income (compensation) under IRC Section 61(a)(1) when vested; subject to employment tax withholding.
- **Equity Election**: If PM elects RSU payment under Section [X].3(e), taxation deferred until RSUs vest/settle (IRC Section 83); may qualify for lower long-term capital gains rate if held 12+ months post-vesting.
- **Escrow Withholding**: Seller's 50% escrow contribution reduces purchase price tax basis; PM's 50% contribution treated as deferred compensation subject to IRC Section 409A (earnout deferral election may require 409A compliance certification).

**8. Integration Points with Other Provisions:**
- **Cross-Reference to W3-P01 (Key Person Retention — John Doe)**: Senior PM Retention Agreements for Davis, Chen, Wong are *in addition to* and *independent from* the founder/CIO retention agreement for John Doe. Note: Sarah Davis appears in both specialist report contexts (as Opportunity Fund Co-PM and as potential CIO successor), so confirm whether Davis is subject to (i) this Senior PM Retention Agreement, (ii) a separate Doe-succession-specific agreement, or (iii) a hybrid structure.
- **Cross-Reference to Section IV.H.B.1 (Founder Key Person Risk)**: If Sarah Davis is designated as Doe's successor, consider adding explicit "succession completion" vesting trigger tied to Doe's retirement timing (e.g., Davis Year 3 earnout vests only if Davis remains CIO for 24 months post-Doe retirement). This would align with specialist recommendation for "lock-step retention."
- **Cross-Reference to Section IV.E (Hedge Fund Key Person Provisions)**: If any Senior PM manages hedge fund strategies with LP key person redemption rights, add provision requiring PM to conduct LP roadshow within 90 days of Closing to minimize redemption risk (per specialist report recommendations).

**9. Due Diligence Requirements:**
- Review current employment agreements for Davis, Chen, Wong to identify: (i) existing non-compete terms, (ii) change-of-control severance triggers, (iii) equity compensation that may accelerate at Closing.
- Confirm AUM figures ($6.0B, $6.5B, $5.5B) with Pinnacle's most recent Form ADV Part 1 Schedule D.
- Verify that Davis, Chen, Wong are not subject to any regulatory disqualifications (SEC, FINRA, state securities) that would impact Buyer's ability to retain them as portfolio managers.
- Obtain written consent from Davis, Chen, Wong (or confirmation of their intent to execute Senior PM Retention Agreements) prior to signing definitive Purchase Agreement to de-risk closing condition.
