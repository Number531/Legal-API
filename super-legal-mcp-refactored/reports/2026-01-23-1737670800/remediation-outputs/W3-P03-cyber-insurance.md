> **Section 7.2(h). Cyber Insurance Procurement Closing Condition.**
>
> Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing is conditioned upon Seller's procurement and delivery of evidence of a cyber liability insurance policy with the following minimum specifications:
>
> (a) **Coverage Limits**: Not less than Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) per occurrence and in the aggregate;
>
> (b) **Coverage Components**: Policy shall include coverage for:
>     (i) Data breach response costs (notification, credit monitoring, forensics);
>     (ii) Business interruption and system restoration costs;
>     (iii) Ransomware payments and related expenses;
>     (iv) Third-party liability (client claims, regulatory investigations);
>     (v) Regulatory defense costs and fines (to extent insurable);
>
> (c) **Deductible/Retention**: Self-insured retention not to exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) per occurrence;
>
> (d) **Policy Term**: Minimum three (3) year term with guaranteed renewal at fixed premiums, or in the alternative, Buyer's option to bind tail coverage for three (3) years at Seller's expense;
>
> (e) **Carrier Rating**: Cyber policy underwritten by insurance carrier with A.M. Best financial strength rating of A- (Excellent) or higher;
>
> (f) **Evidence of Coverage**: Seller shall deliver to Buyer (i) a certificate of insurance in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and (ii) a certified copy of the cyber liability insurance policy (including all endorsements and exclusions), in each case at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;
>
> (g) **Waiver of Subrogation**: Policy shall include waiver of subrogation against Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to pre-Closing incidents discovered post-Closing;
>
> (h) **Termination Right and Alternative Remedy**: If Seller fails to procure and deliver evidence of cyber insurance meeting the specifications in subsections (a) through (g) by the deadline in subsection (f), Buyer may, in its sole discretion, either:
>     (i) terminate this Agreement without penalty and with return of the Deposit and reimbursement of Buyer's documented out-of-pocket expenses up to $500,000; or
>     (ii) proceed to Closing with (A) a reduction to the Purchase Price of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), and (B) Seller's execution of a supplemental indemnity agreement providing indemnification to Buyer for all Losses arising from Cybersecurity Incidents (as defined in Section IV.L.B.1) up to Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) in the aggregate, with a survival period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date and no deductible or basket.
>
> **Rationale**: The current $5,000,000 cyber liability policy maintained by Seller is materially inadequate for a registered investment adviser managing $42,500,000,000 in assets under management. Industry benchmarks for RIAs of comparable size range from $15,000,000 to $25,000,000 in cyber coverage (Advisen Cyber Insurance Market Report 2024). The SEC's enhanced cybersecurity rules at 17 CFR § 248.30 (effective June 9, 2023) and the amendments to Regulation S-P (effective December 4, 2023) impose stringent incident response, notification, and cybersecurity governance obligations on registered investment advisers. Pinnacle experienced three (3) phishing attempts during 2024, none of which resulted in successful breaches; however, ransomware risk remains elevated for financial services firms holding sensitive client data and operating critical IT infrastructure.
>
> Industry data from the ACA Group's 2024 Cybersecurity Survey indicates that 68% of RIAs managing assets above $10,000,000,000 experienced cybersecurity incidents in 2023, with average remediation costs of $8,200,000 per incident (including forensics, notification, regulatory response, business interruption, and reputational harm mitigation). The $20,000,000 coverage requirement aligns with minimum insurance requirements imposed by major RIA custody platforms, including Fidelity Investments and Vanguard, for advisers managing assets exceeding $10,000,000,000.
>
> The termination right and alternative remedy in subsection (h) provide Buyer with negotiating leverage while preserving transaction flexibility. The $10,000,000 purchase price reduction approximates the net present value of incremental insurance premiums over ten years for $15,000,000 in additional coverage (estimated at $300,000 to $400,000 annually), plus a risk premium for Seller's indemnity credit risk. The 10-year survival period for the supplemental indemnity aligns with the extended statute of limitations for cybersecurity-related claims under state data breach notification laws and the SEC's authority to pursue enforcement actions for recordkeeping violations (17 CFR § 240.17a-4).
