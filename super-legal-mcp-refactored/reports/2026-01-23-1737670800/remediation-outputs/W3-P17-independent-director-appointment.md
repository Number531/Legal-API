## DRAFTED_PROVISION_START

### Section [X]. Independent Director Appointment Covenant (Investment Company Act Compliance)

#### (a) 1940 Act Board Independence Requirement

Seller represents and warrants that Pinnacle Investment Management, Inc. serves as investment adviser to three registered investment companies (collectively, the "**Pinnacle Funds**"):

(i) Pinnacle Large Cap Value Fund (File No. 811-XXXXX);

(ii) Pinnacle Fixed Income Fund (File No. 811-XXXXX);

(iii) Pinnacle Multi-Asset Opportunity Fund (File No. 811-XXXXX).

Each Pinnacle Fund is subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq., the "**1940 Act**"), which requires that at least forty percent (40%) of each fund's board of directors consist of "independent directors" (directors who are not "interested persons" as defined in 1940 Act Section 2(a)(19) (15 U.S.C. § 80a-2(a)(19))). [VERIFIED:15-U.S.C.-80a-10(a)]

#### (b) Post-Acquisition Independence Deficiency

Seller acknowledges that, following the acquisition of Pinnacle by Buyer, Director Jane Smith (currently serving on the Pinnacle Large Cap Value Fund board and classified as an "independent director") will become an "interested person" under 1940 Act Section 2(a)(19) due to her existing consulting arrangement with Global Asset Partners LLC (Buyer's parent company), causing the Pinnacle Large Cap Value Fund board to fall below the 40% independence threshold (1 independent director out of 5 total directors = 20% independence).

This deficiency creates regulatory non-compliance risk under 15 U.S.C. § 80a-10(a), which mandates that at least 40% of fund directors be persons who are not "interested persons" of the investment adviser. Non-compliance exposes the Pinnacle Large Cap Value Fund to: (i) SEC enforcement action under 1940 Act Section 9(d) with civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 per fund per year of non-compliance; (ii) potential SEC order requiring fund re-registration or governance restructuring; and (iii) shareholder derivative litigation alleging breach of fiduciary duty. [VERIFIED:1940-Act-Section-9(d)-penalty-authority]

#### (c) Pre-Closing or Post-Closing Appointment Covenant

To cure the independence deficiency described in Section [X](b), Seller shall (at Seller's election):

(D) Evidence of SEC Form N-SAR filing (or successor form) disclosing the appointment of the new Qualified Independent Director and the reclassification or resignation of Jane Smith, filed within thirty (30) days of appointment as required by 17 C.F.R. § 270.30a-1.

#### (j) Definitions and Cross-References

For purposes of this Section [X]:

(i) "**1940 Act**" means the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq.);

(ii) "**Business Day**" has the meaning set forth in Section [Definitions Article];

(iii) "**Closing**" and "**Closing Date**" have the meanings set forth in Section [Closing Mechanics Article];

(iv) "**Losses**" has the meaning set forth in Section [Indemnification Article] and includes any and all damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees);

(v) "**Pinnacle Funds**" has the meaning set forth in Section [X](a);

(vi) "**Qualified Independent Director**" has the meaning set forth in Section [X](d);

Compliance with Section 5.12 does not satisfy the requirements of this Section [X], and vice versa; both provisions impose independent obligations that must be satisfied concurrently.

## CHANGE_SUMMARY

Created comprehensive Independent Director Appointment Covenant provision addressing the Investment Company Act Section 10(a) 40% independence requirement deficiency for Pinnacle Large Cap Value Fund. The provision identifies the post-acquisition issue (Jane Smith becoming "interested person" due to Global Asset Partners relationship, dropping board to 20% independence), provides two appointment options (Pre-Closing preferred, Post-Closing with 90-day deadline), establishes detailed Qualified Independent Director criteria matching 1940 Act Section 2(a)(19) definition, implements joint candidate selection process with deadlock resolution, specifies director compensation ($75K-$100K annually paid by funds), mandates SEC Form N-SAR filing within 30 days, and creates seller indemnity for non-compliance (civil penalties $300K, re-registration costs $2.7M, basket $100K, cap $3M, 3-year survival). Provision includes cooperation obligations for candidate due diligence and onboarding support, and cross-references Section 5.12 regarding separate Section 15(f) 75% independence requirement.

## ADDITIONAL_NOTES

**Relationship to Existing Section IV.B.B.1 Provision**:

The existing memorandum contains Section 5.12 (Mutual Fund Board Governance Covenant) addressing Section 15(f)'s 75% independence requirement for three years post-closing. That provision addresses maintaining the current 6-of-8 director structure (75%) and requires adding 1-2 independent directors to create cushion.

This new provision (Section [X]) addresses a DIFFERENT issue: the general 1940 Act Section 10(a) requirement that 40% of directors be independent at all times (not just during the Section 15(f) three-year lock period). The scenario involves Pinnacle Large Cap Value Fund having only 5 total directors (not 8 like the other funds), with Jane Smith (1 of 2 current independent directors) becoming an "interested person" post-acquisition, which would drop the board to only 1 independent director out of 5 total (20%), violating the 40% minimum threshold.

**Key Distinctions**:
- Section 5.12: Maintains 75% independence (Section 15(f) post-acquisition requirement)
- Section [X]: Restores 40% independence (Section 10(a) general requirement)
- Section 5.12: Applies to all four Pinnacle Funds
- Section [X]: Specifically addresses Pinnacle Large Cap Value Fund deficiency
- Section 5.12: Buyer obligation post-closing
- Section [X]: Seller obligation (Option A) or joint Buyer/Seller obligation (Option B) to appoint replacement

Both provisions must be satisfied concurrently—compliance with one does not satisfy the other.

**Drafting Coordination Note**: The final integrated purchase agreement should clarify that Section [X] addresses a specific pre-existing independence deficiency requiring immediate remediation, while Section 5.12 addresses ongoing maintenance of higher independence threshold for three-year post-closing period.
