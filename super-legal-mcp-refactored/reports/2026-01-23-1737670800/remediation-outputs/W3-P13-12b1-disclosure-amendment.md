**Section [X]. 12b-1 Fee Disclosure Amendment Covenant.**

(a) **Disclosure Deficiency Acknowledgment.** Seller represents and warrants that its Form ADV Part 2A Item 5 (Fees and Compensation) filed with the SEC on March 15, 2023 omits required disclosure of 12b-1 fees received from mutual fund platforms, contrary to Investment Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-7 compliance requirements.[^1] Seller acknowledges that such omission constitutes a material compliance deficiency requiring amendment pursuant to SEC guidance.[^2]

(b) **Pre-Closing Form ADV Amendment.** Seller shall, no later than forty-five (45) days after execution of this Agreement:

   (i) **Amend Form ADV Part 2A Item 5.A** to add the following disclosure (or substantively equivalent language approved in writing by Buyer):

   > *"The Firm receives 12(b)-1 fees from mutual fund platforms (including Fidelity, Schwab, and Pershing). In 2024, such fees totaled approximately $1,200,000 annually. These fees are paid by the mutual fund and do not increase direct client costs, but represent additional compensation to the Firm for assets held in fund platforms. Clients should consider this conflict of interest when evaluating the Firm's recommendation of fund platform investments."*

   (ii) **File Amendment** with the SEC via the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD) system in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 275.204-1;

   (iii) **Deliver to Buyer** within five (5) Business Days of SEC filing acceptance:
   - (A) SEC filing confirmation screenshot or IARD system confirmation showing Form ADV amendment accepted and effective date;
   - (B) Complete copies of amended Form ADV Part 2A pages showing revised Item 5.A (Fees and Compensation) and Item 5.C (Other Compensation);
   - (C) Legal opinion from independent securities or ERISA counsel (reasonably acceptable to Buyer) confirming that the amendment cures the Item 5 disclosure deficiency and satisfies Investment Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-7 requirements.

(c) **Client Notification.** Seller shall, within five (5) Business Days after the SEC accepts the Form ADV amendment:

   (i) Distribute the amended Form ADV Part 2A Brochure to all current advisory clients via email (with mail backup for clients without valid email addresses on file);

   (ii) Provide Buyer with:
   - (A) Client distribution list containing each recipient's name, contact method (email or mail), and distribution date/timestamp; and
   - (B) Delivery confirmation evidence, including email read receipts (if available), bounce-back logs, and mail tracking numbers for physical deliveries;

   (iii) Respond to any client inquiries regarding the amended disclosure within two (2) Business Days of receipt, with copies of such responses provided to Buyer.

(d) **Indemnity for Pre-Amendment Period.** Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including the post-Closing acquired Business) from and against any Losses arising from or relating to SEC Enforcement Actions concerning the 12b-1 fee disclosure deficiency for periods prior to the Form ADV amendment filing date, including without limitation:

   (i) Civil monetary penalties under Investment Advisers Act Section 203(i) or Section 203(e) (up to $1,200,000 based on gross fee receipt);

   (ii) Disgorgement orders or client refund obligations related to undisclosed 12b-1 fees received prior to amendment;

   (iii) Reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and other costs incurred in responding to SEC examinations, investigations, or enforcement proceedings related to the disclosure deficiency;

   (iv) Reputational harm costs, including public relations expenses, if the disclosure deficiency results in a public SEC order or press release.

   **Indemnity Limitations**:
   - (A) **Basket**: Seller's indemnification obligations under this Section [X](d) shall apply only to Losses exceeding $100,000 in the aggregate, after which Seller shall be liable for all Losses on a first-dollar basis (including the first $100,000);
   - (B) **Cap**: Seller's aggregate liability under this Section [X](d) shall not exceed $1,200,000 (representing gross annual 12b-1 fee exposure);
   - (C) **Survival**: The representations, covenants, and indemnities in this Section [X] shall survive Closing for five (5) years, reflecting the SEC's statute of limitations under Investment Advisers Act Section 209(e).[^3]

(e) **Closing Condition.** Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing is expressly conditioned upon satisfaction of the following conditions precedent no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date:

   (i) Receipt of SEC filing confirmation showing Form ADV amendment filed, accepted, and publicly available on the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) website;

   (ii) Receipt of legal opinion from independent counsel confirming that the Form ADV amendment cures the Item 5 disclosure deficiency and achieves compliance with Investment Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-7;

   (iii) Receipt of evidence of client distribution, including the complete distribution list and delivery confirmations described in Section [X](c)(ii);

   (iv) Seller's delivery of a certificate signed by its Chief Compliance Officer certifying that (A) all deliverables required by Section [X](b)(iii) and Section [X](c)(ii) have been provided, (B) no adverse client reactions or terminations have resulted from the amended disclosure, and (C) no SEC inquiries or examination notifications have been received regarding 12b-1 fees.

### Exposure Quantification Methodology

**Probability Assessment (30% SEC Examination Risk)**:

The 30% probability estimate derives from:
- **SEC RIA Examination Cycle Data**: The SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) examines approximately 15% of registered investment advisers annually.[^4] With Pinnacle's last examination occurring in 2021 (3 years ago), the firm falls within the typical 4-7 year examination cycle, increasing near-term examination probability.
- **Targeted Sweep Risk**: The SEC's 2024 examination priorities include "conflicts of interest related to third-party compensation arrangements," specifically mentioning 12b-1 fees.[^5] Firms receiving $1M+ in such fees face elevated scrutiny (estimated 2x baseline examination probability).
- **Form ADV Review Triggers**: Pinnacle's March 2023 Form ADV amendment (updating AUM) would have undergone SEC staff screening. The absence of 12b-1 disclosure in a firm receiving $1.2M annually creates a detectable red flag in IARD system analytics.

**Weighted Exposure Calculation**:
- Gross exposure: $1,200,000 (maximum civil penalty under tiered penalty framework for advisers with $10M+ revenue)[^6]
- Examination probability: 30%
- **Weighted exposure**: $1,200,000 × 0.30 = **$360,000**

**Penalty Tier Justification**: Pinnacle's $18M annual revenue and lack of prior enforcement history place it in Tier II of the SEC's penalty framework (penalties up to the greater of gross pecuniary gain or $100,000 per violation).[^7] With 12b-1 fees representing ongoing annual violations (2021-2024), aggregate exposure reaches $1.2M.

### Drafting Notes

**Why 45-Day Amendment Timeline**: Form ADV amendments require internal compliance review, CCO approval, and SEC IARD system processing (typically 5-10 business days). A 45-day window provides adequate time for counsel review of disclosure language, internal approval, SEC filing, and 10-day pre-Closing delivery buffer.

**Why Independent Legal Opinion**: Buyer lacks visibility into Pinnacle's full compensation structure. An opinion from independent ERISA/securities counsel (not Seller's general counsel) provides third-party validation that the amended disclosure is comprehensive and cures the deficiency, reducing post-Closing examination risk.

**Why 5-Year Survival**: Aligns with SEC's statute of limitations under Section 209(e). While Form ADV amendment cures prospective compliance, it does not eliminate liability for non-disclosure during 2021-2024 (the period since Pinnacle's last SEC examination). Five-year survival ensures indemnity coverage extends through the entire potential enforcement window.

**Why First-Dollar-After-Basket Structure**: The $100,000 basket filters out immaterial claims (e.g., minor SEC inquiry costs), but once exceeded, Seller bears full liability including the basket amount. This avoids the "dollar-for-dollar" structure that would require Buyer to absorb the first $100,000 of a material enforcement action.

**Alternative: Post-Closing Amendment with Escrow**: If Seller cannot complete amendment pre-Closing due to timing constraints, consider alternative structure: (i) escrow $360,000 of purchase price, (ii) require amendment within 30 days post-Closing, (iii) release escrow upon delivery of SEC filing confirmation and 90-day "all clear" period (no SEC inquiries). This shifts cure obligation post-Closing but maintains Buyer's security.

**Client Notification Risk**: While Form ADV amendments are publicly filed, affirmative client notification (required here) may trigger client inquiries or departures. Seller should prepare FAQ document and talking points for financial advisors to address "Why wasn't this disclosed before?" questions. Buyer should require advance review of client communication plan as part of Section [X](b)(iii) deliverables.
