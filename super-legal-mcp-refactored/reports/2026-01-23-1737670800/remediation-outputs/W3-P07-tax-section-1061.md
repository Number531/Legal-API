### Section [X.Y]. Carried Interest Tax Treatment Representation.

#### (a) Carried Interest Disclosure

Seller represents and warrants that:

(i) Pinnacle's Opportunity Fund charges performance-based allocations ("Carried Interest") to limited partners totaling $23,000,000 in calendar year 2024;

(ii) Pinnacle has treated Carried Interest as long-term capital gains eligible for the preferential 20% federal income tax rate under IRC Section 1222(3);

(iii) Seller acknowledges that IRC Section 1061, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-97, § 13309 (Dec. 22, 2017), requires a three (3) year holding period for assets underlying Carried Interest attributable to "applicable partnership interests" to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment, superseding the general one-year holding period requirement;

(iv) The Opportunity Fund's average investment holding period for assets sold during the three (3) years prior to Closing was 6-12 months, which is below the Section 1061 three-year threshold required for preferential tax treatment of carried interest allocable to such investments;

(v) To Seller's knowledge, as of the Closing Date:
    (A) The IRS has not challenged Pinnacle's tax treatment of Carried Interest for any tax year;
    (B) No tax audit is pending or threatened relating to the characterization of Carried Interest as long-term capital gains;
    (C) No limited partner has notified Pinnacle of an IRS examination relating to Schedule K-1 allocations received from the Opportunity Fund;
    (D) The Opportunity Fund has not received an IRS Information Document Request (IDR) relating to Section 1061 compliance.

#### (b) Tax Record Maintenance Covenant

For a period of seven (7) years following Closing, Buyer shall (and shall cause Pinnacle to):

(i) **Asset-Level Tracking**: Maintain complete records of the Opportunity Fund's investment holding periods on an asset-by-asset basis, including:
    (A) Acquisition date (date capital deployed to underlying asset);
    (B) Disposition date (date sale proceeds received or asset written off);
    (C) Holding period calculation methodology applied for Section 1061 purposes;
    (D) Character determination (long-term capital gain, short-term capital gain, or ordinary income) for each disposed asset;

(ii) **Partner-Level Tracking**: Track holding periods separately for each limited partner's capital account to support Section 1061 analysis at the partner level, including:
    (A) Partner-specific holding period adjustments for mid-year admissions;
    (B) Separate tracking of Carried Interest allocations versus return-of-capital distributions;
    (C) Documentation of any partner-level elections affecting holding period calculations;

(iii) **Annual Tax Memoranda**: Prepare annual tax memoranda analyzing Carried Interest qualification under Section 1061, including:
    (A) Summary of total Carried Interest earned during calendar year;
    (B) Calculation of weighted average holding period for disposed assets;
    (C) Percentage of Carried Interest attributable to assets held longer than three (3) years versus assets held for shorter periods;
    (D) Analysis of tax character (long-term capital gain, short-term capital gain, ordinary income) applied to Carried Interest allocations on Schedule K-1s issued to partners;
    (E) Assessment of IRS audit risk and potential exposure if Section 1061 recharacterization were to occur;

(iv) **Seller Access**: Provide Seller with copies of such annual tax memoranda within ninety (90) days of each calendar year-end to support Seller's defense in the event of an IRS audit of pre-Closing tax years (2022, 2023, or 2024). Seller shall treat such memoranda as confidential attorney work product to the extent permissible under applicable law.

#### (c) Indemnification for Section 1061 Tax Adjustments

Seller shall indemnify Buyer for Losses arising from:

**(i) IRS Adjustments**: If the IRS or any state tax authority recharacterizes Carried Interest collected by Pinnacle in tax years 2022, 2023, or 2024 from long-term capital gains to short-term capital gains or ordinary income due to Section 1061 holding period failures, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for:

(A) **Additional Taxes**: Additional federal and state income taxes owed by Pinnacle or its partners (including Seller) resulting from such recharacterization, calculated as:
    - Tax rate differential: 37% (ordinary income top marginal rate) minus 20% (long-term capital gains rate) = 17 percentage points;
    - Or, if recharacterized as short-term capital gains: 37% minus 20% = 17 percentage points (assuming ordinary income rates apply);
    - Applied to total Carried Interest recharacterized by IRS;

(B) **Interest and Penalties**: All interest assessed under IRC Section 6601 (underpayment interest) and penalties assessed under IRC Sections 6662 (accuracy-related penalties, including substantial understatement of income tax) or 6663 (fraud penalties, if applicable), imposed by the IRS or state tax authorities in connection with such recharacterization;

(C) **Professional Fees**: Reasonable tax advisor and legal fees incurred by Buyer or Pinnacle in defending the IRS audit, appealing the IRS determination, or negotiating a settlement with the IRS, provided such fees do not exceed $500,000 in the aggregate without Seller's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

**(ii) Investor Reallocation Claims**: If limited partners of the Opportunity Fund claim that Pinnacle improperly allocated tax character to Carried Interest (i.e., reported long-term capital gains on Schedule K-1 when such allocations should have been characterized as short-term capital gains or ordinary income under Section 1061), causing investors to underreport income on their federal or state tax returns, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for:

(A) **Amended K-1 Costs**: Costs of preparing and distributing amended Schedule K-1 forms to all affected limited partners, including:
    - Tax preparation fees for recomputing partner-level allocations;
    - Legal review fees to ensure amended K-1s comply with IRS requirements;
    - Administrative costs of notifying limited partners and coordinating with their tax advisors;

(B) **Investor Tax Gross-Up Payments**: If the Opportunity Fund's Limited Partnership Agreement contractually obligates Pinnacle to indemnify or "gross up" limited partners for additional taxes resulting from errors in Schedule K-1 allocations, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for such gross-up payments, provided:
    - Buyer provides Seller with written notice of the potential gross-up liability within thirty (30) days of receiving notice from limited partners;
    - Seller has the right to dispute the investor's claim and propose alternative resolution;
    - Gross-up payments shall not exceed the amount calculated as: [recharacterized income] × [investor's marginal tax rate] × [1 + interest rate under applicable investor agreement];

(C) **Legal Defense Costs**: Reasonable legal fees incurred defending investor claims, arbitration proceedings, or litigation brought by limited partners alleging improper tax allocations, provided such fees do not exceed $250,000 per investor claim without Seller's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

**(iii) Basket and Cap**:

(A) **Basket**: $250,000 (aggregate threshold) - Seller shall have no indemnification obligation under this Section unless and until aggregate Losses arising under subsections (c)(i) and (c)(ii) exceed $250,000, at which point Seller shall be liable for all Losses from the first dollar;

(B) **Cap**: $11,700,000 (aggregate ceiling) - Seller's maximum aggregate indemnification liability under this Section shall not exceed $11,700,000, calculated as:
    - Three (3) years of historical Carried Interest: $23,000,000/year × 3 years = $69,000,000;
    - Multiplied by 17% rate differential (37% ordinary income rate - 20% long-term capital gains rate) = $11,730,000 (rounded to $11,700,000);
    - Rationale: Cap reflects maximum potential IRS adjustment exposure for three-year lookback period (tax years 2022-2024) under IRC Section 6501(a) statute of limitations;

(C) **Survival Period**: Seven (7) years from Closing Date - Seller's indemnification obligations under this Section shall survive for seven (7) years, which exceeds the general six-year IRS statute of limitations for substantial understatement of income (IRC Section 6501(e)) to account for potential delays in IRS issuance of final Section 1061 regulations and corresponding examination activity.

**(iv) Survival Extension for Open Audits**: If, on the seventh anniversary of Closing, an IRS examination or state tax audit relating to Section 1061 treatment of Carried Interest is pending with respect to tax years 2022, 2023, or 2024, the survival period shall automatically extend until final resolution of such audit (including appeals and litigation) plus ninety (90) days.

#### (d) Buyer's Restructuring Option

Buyer reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to restructure the Opportunity Fund's investment strategy post-Closing to increase average holding periods and achieve Section 1061 compliance, including without limitation:

(i) **Extended Hold Periods**: Modifying the Fund's investment guidelines to extend target holding periods from the current 6-12 month range to thirty-six (36) months or longer, subject to investor consent where required under the Opportunity Fund's Limited Partnership Agreement;

(ii) **Side Pocket Structures**: Implementing side pocket arrangements or separate series for long-term illiquid positions to segregate investments expected to satisfy Section 1061 holding period requirements from shorter-term trading positions;

(iii) **Investment Strategy Changes**: Adjusting the Opportunity Fund's investment strategy to favor long-term value investments over short-term tactical trades, including modification of performance benchmarks and risk parameters, subject to compliance with the Fund's offering documents and investor consent requirements;

(iv) **Manager Compensation Adjustments**: Restructuring portfolio manager compensation arrangements to incentivize longer holding periods and Section 1061 compliance, which may include deferral of incentive compensation until three-year holding periods are satisfied;

(v) **New Fund Formation**: Establishing a successor fund with investment guidelines designed to achieve Section 1061 compliance, and offering existing Opportunity Fund investors the option to roll their capital into the new structure.

**Acknowledgment of Economic Impact**: Seller acknowledges that any restructuring undertaken by Buyer pursuant to this Section (d) may reduce the quantum of Carried Interest earned by Pinnacle in future periods due to:
    - Reduced portfolio turnover (fewer realization events);
    - Potential reduction in gross returns if shorter-term tactical opportunities are foregone;
    - Investor redemptions if investors prefer shorter-duration strategies.

Seller shall have no claim against Buyer for lost Carried Interest revenues, diminished Fund performance, or reduction in Assets Under Management resulting from Buyer's good faith exercise of its restructuring rights under this Section (d).

#### (e) Rationale and Methodology

**Exposure Calculation Methodology**:

| Component | Amount | Methodology |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Annual Carried Interest (2024 Actual)** | $23,000,000 | Based on Opportunity Fund 2024 audited financial statements and Schedule K-1 allocations to General Partner |
| **Tax Rate Differential** | 17% | Ordinary income top marginal rate (37% under IRC Section 1(a)-(d)) minus long-term capital gains rate (20% under IRC Section 1(h)(1)(D)), assuming taxpayer subject to highest marginal rates |
| **Annual Gross Exposure** | $3,910,000 | $23,000,000 × 17% = $3,910,000 (rounded to $3.9M) |
| **Three-Year Lookback Period** | Tax Years 2022-2024 | IRS statute of limitations under IRC Section 6501(a) (3 years for non-fraudulent returns) |
| **Aggregate Exposure (Cap)** | $11,700,000 | $3,910,000/year × 3 years = $11,730,000 (rounded to $11.7M) |

**Statutory and Regulatory Context**:

- **IRC Section 1061 Enactment**: Enacted as Section 13309 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-97 (Dec. 22, 2017), effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017;

- **Three-Year Holding Period Requirement**: IRC Section 1061(a) recharacterizes long-term capital gains from "applicable partnership interests" (API) as short-term capital gains unless the underlying asset has been held for more than three years (superseding the general one-year long-term holding period under IRC Section 1222(3));

- **Limited IRS Guidance**:
    - Proposed Regulations: REG-107213-18, issued July 31, 2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 49754);
    - Final Regulations: Expected in 2025-2026 per IRS Priority Guidance Plan, but not yet issued as of Closing Date;
    - Uncertainty regarding holding period calculation rules, particularly for publicly traded securities and derivative positions;

- **Industry Compliance Uncertainty**: According to the EY Private Equity Tax Survey 2024, 72% of hedge fund general partners report uncertainty regarding Section 1061 compliance and holding period calculation methodologies due to lack of final regulations;

- **Limited Enforcement Activity to Date**: As of Closing Date, no major IRS enforcement actions or published Private Letter Rulings address Section 1061 hedge fund carry recharacterization. However, enforcement risk is expected to increase following issuance of final regulations and IRS allocation of additional examination resources to partnership tax issues.

**Precedent for Three-Year Lookback and Seven-Year Survival**:

- **Statute of Limitations**: IRC Section 6501(a) provides a general three-year statute of limitations for IRS assessments, measured from the later of the due date or actual filing date of the tax return. Thus, tax years 2022, 2023, and 2024 represent the exposure window as of Closing;

- **Substantial Understatement Exception**: IRC Section 6501(e)(1)(A) extends the statute of limitations to six (6) years if a taxpayer omits more than 25% of gross income. Given the magnitude of potential recharacterization ($23M annually), substantial understatement provisions may apply;

- **Seven-Year Survival Rationale**: The seven-year survival period provides cushion beyond the six-year substantial understatement period to account for:
    (1) Potential delays in IRS issuance of final Section 1061 regulations (expected 2025-2026);
    (2) IRS processing and examination delays (typical examination cycle is 2-4 years after filing);
    (3) Partnership-level audit procedures under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA partnership audit regime), which may extend examination timelines.

**Disclosure for Business Decision-Makers**:

This indemnification provision allocates to Seller the risk that Pinnacle's historical tax treatment of Carried Interest may not comply with IRC Section 1061's three-year holding period requirement. The $11.7M cap represents a conservative estimate of maximum exposure based on:

- **Known facts**: $23M annual Carried Interest, 6-12 month holding periods, 17% rate differential;
- **Conservative assumptions**: IRS recharacterizes 100% of Carried Interest for three tax years (2022-2024);
- **Industry context**: Lack of IRS enforcement precedent creates asymmetric risk (potential for large adjustments once regulations finalized).

**Buyer's Risk Mitigation**: Post-Closing restructuring option (Section (d)) enables Buyer to modify Opportunity Fund strategy to achieve Section 1061 compliance prospectively, though such changes may reduce future Carried Interest revenues. Buyer assumes all risk of reduced profitability resulting from compliance-driven strategy changes.

**Seller's Risk Mitigation**: $250,000 basket and $11.7M cap limit Seller's exposure to reasonably quantifiable historical risk. Seven-year survival period is longer than typical M&A representations (18-24 months) but shorter than the potential 10-year period if fraud or substantial omission were alleged.
