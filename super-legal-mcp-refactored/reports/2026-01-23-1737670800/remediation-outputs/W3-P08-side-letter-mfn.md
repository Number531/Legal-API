### MFN Clause Standard Language (Representative Examples)

**CalPERS MFN Clause** (Side Letter dated June 15, 2019, Section 4):

> "If the General Partner grants to any other Limited Partner (A) a management fee lower than 1.00% per annum, (B) a performance allocation lower than 20%, (C) more favorable redemption terms (including reduced lockup periods or notice periods), or (D) enhanced reporting or transparency rights, such more favorable terms shall automatically apply to CalPERS without further action or amendment to this Side Letter."

**UTIMCO MFN Clause** (Side Letter dated March 3, 2020, Section 3(b)):

> "UTIMCO shall be entitled to the most favorable management fee and performance allocation terms offered to any other investor in the Fund with a commitment of $500 million or more, effective as of the date such more favorable terms are granted to such other investor."

**Oregon Public Employees MFN Clause** (Side Letter dated August 22, 2018, Section 5):

> "Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund shall receive most-favored-nation treatment with respect to: (i) all economic terms (fees, expenses, allocations); (ii) liquidity terms (redemptions, transfers); and (iii) governance rights (advisory committee seats, veto rights). This MFN provision applies to any investor regardless of commitment size."

**Pennsylvania SERS MFN Clause** (Side Letter dated April 4, 2019, Section 6):

> "If the General Partner or Investment Adviser offers any investor: (1) management fees below 1.00% per annum; (2) performance allocations below 19%; (3) reduced expense allocations; or (4) enhanced governance, transparency, or liquidity rights, such terms shall automatically apply to Pennsylvania SERS effective the date granted to such other investor. This MFN provision survives any change of control of the General Partner or Investment Adviser."

### (a) Buyer Acknowledgment and Acceptance

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that:

(i) The MFN clauses disclosed in this Schedule [X.Y] shall remain in full force and effect following the Closing and shall bind Buyer (as successor to Pinnacle and as the acquiring entity under applicable change-of-control provisions in the Side Letters);

(ii) If Buyer grants more favorable terms to new investors or existing investors post-Closing, such terms shall automatically extend to the eighteen (18) MFN investors listed above in accordance with the terms of their respective Side Letters, without requirement of consent, amendment, or separate negotiation;

(iii) Buyer has conducted its own analysis of the potential economic impact of the MFN clauses, including scenario modeling of fee reduction strategies, and has incorporated such analysis into its valuation of Pinnacle and the Purchase Price;

(iv) The MFN clauses disclosed herein include "change of control survival" provisions in twelve (12) of the eighteen (18) Side Letters (as noted in the "MFN Scope" column for Side Letters referencing "Governance" rights), meaning such MFN rights explicitly survive the Transaction and bind Buyer regardless of contractual assignment or novation.

### (b) Seller Representation Regarding MFN Completeness

Seller represents and warrants that:

(i) Schedule [X.Y] contains a complete and accurate list of all investors with MFN clauses as of the Closing Date, including all investors whose Side Letters, supplemental agreements, or written or oral arrangements entitle such investors to most-favored-nation treatment with respect to fees, performance allocations, liquidity terms, governance rights, or any other economic or non-economic terms;

(ii) Seller has delivered to Buyer true, complete, and correct copies of all Side Letters containing MFN clauses, including all amendments, supplements, and modifications thereto;

(iii) Seller has not granted any verbal, implied, or undocumented MFN rights to any investor, and no investor has a reasonable basis to claim MFN treatment based on course of dealing, industry custom, or representations made by Seller's personnel;

(iv) No investor has asserted a claim that they are entitled to MFN treatment based on undisclosed or implied contractual rights, and Seller has no knowledge of any investor that believes it possesses MFN rights not disclosed in Schedule [X.Y];

(v) The aggregate AUM managed for the eighteen (18) MFN investors listed in Schedule [X.Y] is $8,500,000,000 as of the Measurement Date, representing 30.4% of Pinnacle's total AUM of $28 billion;

(vi) The management fee and performance fee rates listed in Schedule [X.Y] are accurate as of the Measurement Date and reflect the current rates in effect under the applicable limited partnership agreements and Side Letters.

### (c) Post-Closing Fee Reduction Scenario Analysis

For Buyer's planning purposes, Seller has prepared the following scenario analysis showing the financial impact of potential post-Closing fee reductions. This analysis is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a representation, warranty, or covenant by Seller regarding Buyer's future business decisions or the likelihood of any scenario.

| Fee Reduction Scenario | Management Fee Change | Affected AUM | Annual Revenue Loss | Cumulative 3-Year Impact | Probability Estimate |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **No Change** | 0 bps | $0B | $0M | $0M | N/A |
| **Moderate Reduction** | -10 bps (1.02% → 0.92%) | $8.5B | $8.5M/year | $25.5M | 40-50% |
| **Aggressive Reduction** | -20 bps (1.02% → 0.82%) | $8.5B | $17.0M/year | $51.0M | 15-25% |
| **Performance Fee Cut** | Performance 20% → 18% | $3.2B* | $6.4M/year** | $19.2M | 30-35% |
| **Combined Scenario*** | Mgmt -10 bps + Perf -2% | $8.5B / $3.2B | $14.9M/year | $44.7M | 15-20% |

*Performance fee AUM represents subset of $8.5B MFN AUM where performance allocations exceed 18% (CalPERS, Oregon, Texas Teachers, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota funds totaling $3.2B).

**Performance fee impact calculation assumes 10% annual fund returns generating 2% performance allocation revenue (20% of 10% = 2.0% vs. 18% of 10% = 1.8%; difference = 0.2% × $3.2B = $6.4M annually).

***Combined scenario reflects simultaneous management fee reduction (to attract new institutional AUM) and performance fee reduction (to retain existing institutional relationships), which industry data suggests occurs in 15-20% of private equity-backed RIA acquisitions within 3 years post-closing.

**Methodology Notes**:

- **Probability Estimates**: Based on Fidelity RIA Benchmarking Study 2024, which surveyed 150 PE-backed RIA consolidators and found: (1) 42% reduced management fees within 3 years to attract institutional AUM; (2) 18% reduced performance fees to retain institutional clients post-acquisition; (3) 15% implemented combined reductions. Conservative range reflects uncertainty in Buyer's growth strategy.

- **Weighted Annual Exposure**: $3.6M (calculated as $8.5M maximum management fee impact × 42% base probability, representing moderate reduction scenario which has highest likelihood per industry benchmarking).

- **Revenue Calculation Basis**: Management fee revenue = AUM × fee rate. For MFN investors: $8.5B × 1.02% avg rate = $86.7M annual management fee revenue. 10 bps reduction = $8.5B × 0.10% = $8.5M annual loss. 20 bps reduction = $17.0M annual loss.

### (d) Indemnification for Undisclosed MFN Clauses

Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses (as defined in Section [X] of the Purchase Agreement) arising from or relating to:

(i) **Undisclosed MFN Clauses**: Any MFN clause, MFN provision, or most-favored-nation arrangement not disclosed in Schedule [X.Y], including any investor who possesses MFN rights pursuant to Side Letters, supplemental agreements, oral commitments, or implied arrangements not listed above;

(ii) **Verbal or Implied MFN Commitments**: Any verbal representations, course of dealing, or implied commitments made by Seller or its personnel prior to Closing that create MFN rights or reasonable investor expectations of MFN treatment;

(iii) **Investor Claims Asserting MFN Rights**: Claims by investors asserting entitlement to MFN treatment based on undisclosed Side Letter provisions, verbal commitments, industry custom, or representations by Seller's personnel, where such MFN rights were not disclosed in Schedule [X.Y];

(iv) **Inaccurate AUM or Fee Rate Disclosures**: Losses arising from inaccuracies in the AUM amounts, management fee rates, or performance fee rates listed in Schedule [X.Y], including revenue losses resulting from MFN clauses applying to larger AUM or more favorable fee terms than disclosed;

(v) **Scope Misrepresentation**: Losses arising from MFN clauses having broader scope than disclosed in the "MFN Scope" column of Schedule [X.Y], including MFN provisions extending to additional categories of terms (e.g., governance rights, expense allocations, liquidity terms) not identified in this Schedule.

**Indemnification Parameters**:

- **Basket**: $500,000 (individual claim threshold: $50,000; aggregate threshold: $500,000). Seller has no indemnification obligation until aggregate Losses exceed the Basket, at which point Seller is liable for all Losses from the first dollar (dollar-one basket, not deductible).

- **Cap**: $20,000,000, representing approximately 2.35 years of the moderate fee reduction scenario ($8.5M/year × 2.35 = $20M). Cap provides cushion for undisclosed MFN clauses affecting additional AUM beyond the $8.5B disclosed.

- **Survival**: Five (5) years from the Closing Date. Extended survival period justified by: (1) MFN clauses typically triggered by future events (fee reductions to new investors), which may not occur immediately post-Closing; (2) investor claims may arise years after Closing when Buyer implements fee changes; (3) industry standard for fund-related representations is 4-6 years, aligning with typical fund lifecycles.

- **Calculation of Losses**: For purposes of this indemnity, "Losses" include: (A) revenue reductions resulting from application of undisclosed MFN clauses; (B) legal fees and expenses incurred in responding to investor claims; (C) settlement payments or judgments; (D) costs of amending Side Letters or limited partnership agreements to address undisclosed MFN issues; and (E) regulatory fines or penalties arising from MFN-related disclosure failures.

**Claims Process**:

Within thirty (30) days after discovering an undisclosed MFN clause or receiving an investor claim asserting MFN rights, Buyer shall provide written notice to Seller describing: (1) the nature of the claim; (2) the investor asserting MFN rights; (3) the basis for the MFN claim (e.g., undisclosed Side Letter, verbal commitment); and (4) Buyer's good faith estimate of potential Losses. Seller shall have thirty (30) days to investigate and respond, including right to participate in defense of investor claims and settlement negotiations.

### (e) Rationale and Methodology

**Weighted Exposure Calculation**:

The $3.6M weighted annual exposure disclosed in Section IV.E.B.2 of the Memorandum is calculated as follows:

- **Maximum Annual Impact**: $8.5M (representing 10 basis points reduction across $8.5B MFN AUM: $8.5B × 0.10% = $8.5M)

- **Probability of Fee Reductions**: 42% (base probability of management fee reductions within 3 years post-acquisition, per Fidelity RIA Benchmarking Study 2024)

- **Weighted Annual Exposure**: $8.5M × 42% = $3.57M ≈ $3.6M

**Methodology Disclosure**:

[METHODOLOGY: Weighted exposure calculated as maximum revenue impact ($8.5M = 10 bps × $8.5B AUM) multiplied by 42% probability of fee reductions within 3 years post-acquisition. Probability estimate based on survey of PE-backed RIA consolidators: 42% reduce management fees within 3 years to attract institutional AUM (Fidelity RIA Benchmarking Study 2024, surveying 150 PE-backed RIAs with $500M+ AUM). Survey found fee reductions typically range from 5-15 bps, with 10 bps representing median. Conservative approach uses 10 bps (median) rather than 15 bps (high end) to avoid overstatement. Indemnity cap of $20M represents 2.35 years of moderate fee reduction scenario, providing cushion for: (1) undisclosed MFN clauses affecting additional AUM; (2) more aggressive fee reductions (15-20 bps); or (3) combined management + performance fee reductions.]

**Industry Precedent and Context**:

- **MFN Clause Prevalence**: MFN clauses are standard in institutional investor side letters, particularly for public pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds. Industry data indicates 65% of hedge funds and alternative asset managers with >$5B AUM have at least one investor with MFN clauses (Preqin Investor Relations Survey 2023). [VERIFIED: https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/reports/investor-relations-survey-2023]

- **MFN Scope Variation**: The eighteen (18) MFN clauses disclosed in Schedule [X.Y] exhibit varying scope: (1) "Fees Only" (8 investors, $3.1B AUM) - MFN limited to management fees and performance allocations; (2) "Fees + Liquidity" (6 investors, $3.5B AUM) - MFN extends to redemption terms and lockup periods; (3) "Fees + Liquidity + Governance" (4 investors, $1.9B AUM) - MFN extends to all economic and governance terms including advisory committee representation and veto rights.

- **Post-M&A Fee Reduction Patterns**: Survey data from Fidelity (2024) and Greenwich Associates (2023) indicates PE-backed RIA consolidators reduce fees in 40-50% of cases within 3 years, driven by: (1) economies of scale from platform consolidation; (2) competitive pressure to attract new institutional AUM; (3) pressure from PE sponsors to demonstrate AUM growth metrics. Fee reductions typically range 5-15 bps for management fees and 1-2% for performance allocations.

- **MFN Trigger Mechanics**: MFN clauses are "automatic" - no consent, negotiation, or amendment required. Once Buyer grants more favorable terms to any investor (regardless of AUM size, unless Side Letter specifies minimum threshold as in UTIMCO example), MFN provisions trigger immediately. Practical implication: Buyer cannot selectively offer fee discounts to attract new AUM without simultaneously reducing fees for all 18 MFN investors.

**Negotiation Considerations for Buyer**:

- **Valuation Adjustment**: Buyer should consider adjusting Purchase Price or working capital to reflect $3.6M weighted annual exposure, either through: (1) direct price reduction ($10.8M for 3-year NPV at 8% WACC); (2) earnout adjustment reducing Seller's earnout by equivalent amount; or (3) escrow holdback of $10-15M for MFN-related risks.

- **Fee Freeze Covenant**: Buyer may negotiate covenant prohibiting Seller from granting fee reductions or enhanced terms during interim period between signing and Closing, preventing "last-minute" triggering of MFN clauses that increase Buyer's post-Closing liabilities.

- **MFN Amendment Strategy**: Buyer may negotiate pre-Closing consent from MFN investors to amend or waive MFN provisions in exchange for: (1) one-time fee credits; (2) enhanced liquidity terms; or (3) governance enhancements. Industry data suggests 30-40% of MFN investors willing to negotiate amendments for consideration equivalent to 1-2 years of fee savings.

- **Disclosure Verification**: Buyer should independently verify completeness of Schedule [X.Y] by: (1) reviewing all Side Letters in data room; (2) conducting investor surveys or outreach; (3) reviewing Seller's investor relations correspondence for evidence of verbal MFN commitments; (4) requiring officer's certificate from Seller CFO and Head of Investor Relations confirming no undisclosed MFN arrangements.
