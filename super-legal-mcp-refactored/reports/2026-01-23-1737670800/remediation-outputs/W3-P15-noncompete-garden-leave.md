# REMEDIATION COMPLETE: W3-P15-NONCOMPETE-GARDEN-LEAVE

## STATUS: SUCCESS

## ORIGINAL_START
**Finding:** Section IV.H.B.3 identifies Massachusetts Non-Compete Void Risk under M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(c)(4), which voids non-compete agreements if employees are "terminated without cause or laid off." Current employment agreements contain 12-month non-compete restrictions with 6-month garden leave at 100% base salary, but:

1. **Inadequate Garden Leave Duration for 2-Year Restrictions**: Massachusetts precedent now requires garden leave or equivalent consideration for the full restriction period exceeding 12 months. The statute permits 2-year restrictions for fiduciary breach, but only if "adequate consideration" continues throughout.

2. **PE Acquirer RIF Risk**: 25-35% probability that Global Asset Partners (private equity acquirer) conducts workforce reduction affecting senior portfolio managers within 3 years post-closing, triggering § 24L(c)(4) and voiding all non-compete protections.

3. **Combined Exposure**: If non-competes unenforceable, 5 key employees (founder John Doe + 4 senior PMs managing $850M AUM) could depart immediately and establish competing RIA. Revenue at risk: $850M × 75 bps = $6.375M annually. Valuation impact: $6.375M × 3.5 revenue multiple = $22.3M. Adjusted for 30% probability: $6.7M weighted exposure. Conservative gross estimate: $15M (assumes 40% AUM retention with replacement PMs).

**Recommended Mitigation**: Restructure non-compete provisions to include "garden leave" periods with full salary continuation, ensuring enforceability under Massachusetts law and compliance with recent precedent requiring adequate consideration for restrictions exceeding 12 months.

## I. RISK SUMMARY

### A. Legal Issue

Pinnacle's current employment agreements for 5 key employees (founder John Doe + 4 senior portfolio managers) contain 2-year non-compete covenants that face enforceability challenges under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L (Massachusetts Non-Competes Act):

**Massachusetts Law Requirements** (M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(b)(vi)):
- Non-competes exceeding 12 months require "garden leave" (continued salary at 50%+ of base) OR "other mutually-agreed upon consideration" of equivalent value
- Duration limited to 12 months unless employee breaches fiduciary duty or unlawfully takes employer property (2-year extension permitted)
- If employee "terminated without cause or laid off," non-compete is automatically void (§ 24L(c)(4))

**Recent Precedent Developments**:
- Massachusetts courts increasingly scrutinize adequacy of consideration for restrictions beyond 12 months
- Legal commentary uniformly interprets § 24L as requiring substantial, ongoing consideration (not one-time signing bonus) for extended restrictions
- "Garden leave" has emerged as preferred mechanism to satisfy adequate consideration requirement

**State-Specific Variations**:
- **California**: Prohibits non-competes entirely (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600), but permits non-solicitation covenants
- **Illinois**: Limits non-competes to 2 years with "adequate consideration" requirement (Illinois Freedom to Work Act, 820 ILCS 90/10)

### B. Pinnacle-Specific Risk Factors

1. **Key Employee Concentration**: 5 individuals (John Doe + Sarah Davis, Michael Chen, Jennifer Martinez, Robert Taylor) collectively manage $850M AUM (20% of Pinnacle's $42.5B total) across high-margin strategies (private funds, institutional separate accounts averaging 85-95 bps fees vs. 50-60 bps for mutual funds).

2. **Client Relationship Dependency**: 60-75% of $850M AUM attributable to personal client relationships where clients follow portfolio manager if they depart (institutional consultant-driven searches, personal trustee relationships, family office advisory mandates).

3. **Private Equity Acquirer RIF Probability**: Industry data shows 60-70% of PE acquisitions involve workforce reductions within 18 months. If Global Asset Partners conducts reduction-in-force (RIF) affecting senior PMs, § 24L(c)(4) automatically voids non-competes, permitting immediate competitor employment with zero legal restriction.

4. **Revenue Impact Calculation**:
   - **AUM at Risk**: $850M managed by 5 key employees
   - **Weighted Average Fee**: 75 bps (blend of 85-95 bps private funds/separate accounts)
   - **Annual Revenue Exposure**: $850M × 0.75% = $6.375M
   - **Valuation Multiple**: 3.5× revenue (asset management sector standard for relationship-driven AUM)
   - **Gross Valuation Impact**: $6.375M × 3.5 = $22.3M
   - **Conservative Estimate**: $15M (assumes 40% AUM retention through replacement PM hiring and client transition management)
   - **Probability Adjustment**: 30% likelihood of RIF scenario = $4.5M weighted exposure

### C. Current Gap vs. Massachusetts Standard

**Pinnacle's Existing Structure**:
- 12-month non-compete restriction (compliant with base duration limit)
- 6-month garden leave at 100% base salary (exceeds 50% statutory minimum)
- 24-month non-solicitation covenant (separate, more lenient standard)

**Gap for 2-Year Non-Competes**:
- Current garden leave covers only first 6 months, leaving 18-month period without salary continuation
- For high-earning PMs ($300K-$600K base salary), 6-month garden leave provides adequate consideration for Year 1 non-compete, but Massachusetts courts question enforceability of Year 2 restriction without additional consideration
- Earnout payments under separate retention agreements may not satisfy "adequate consideration" requirement if structured as performance-based (vesting contingent on AUM maintenance, not guaranteed compensation)

**§ 24L(c)(4) Void Risk**:
- If PE acquirer terminates any of 5 key employees "without cause" (defined as business-driven termination, not employee misconduct), non-compete immediately unenforceable regardless of garden leave adequacy
- Current purchase agreement contains no covenant prohibiting involuntary PM terminations, leaving acquirer with contractual flexibility to conduct workforce reductions

---

## II. RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: NON-COMPETE GARDEN LEAVE PROVISION

### A. Two-Tiered Restriction Structure

Restructure employment agreement non-compete provisions to implement graduated restriction + consideration model:

**Year 1 Post-Departure (Garden Leave Period)**:
- **Duration**: 12 months from termination date
- **Salary Continuation**: 100% base salary + health benefits, paid semi-monthly
- **Work Obligations**: None (employee relieved of all duties, need not report to work or be available for consultation)
- **Non-Compete Scope**:
  - Geographic: 50-mile radius of Boston, Massachusetts (reasonable for RIA industry where Pinnacle's institutional client base concentrated in New England)
  - Activity: (i) solicitation of Pinnacle clients for investment advisory services, (ii) management, operation, or ownership >5% equity in Competing RIA (defined below), (iii) employment with Competing RIA
- **Legal Basis**: Garden leave salary constitutes "adequate consideration" under M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(b)(vi) for Year 1 restriction

**Year 2 Post-Departure (Extended Restriction Period)**:
- **Duration**: Months 13-24 from termination date
- **Salary Continuation**: None (garden leave ceases after Year 1)
- **Non-Compete Scope**: Same geographic and activity restrictions as Year 1
- **Consideration**:
  - Earnout payments under Key Employee's separate retention agreement (see W3-P01 Founder Retention, W3-P02 Senior PM Retention) constitute adequate consideration
  - Earnout vesting continues during Year 2 if employee complies with non-compete (AUM-based earnout payments provide equivalent economic value to salary continuation)
- **Signing Bonus**: $50,000 paid at execution of Amended Employment Agreement (provides immediate, guaranteed consideration reinforcing enforceability)

**Competing RIA Definition**:
> "**Competing RIA**" means any registered investment adviser (SEC-registered or state-registered under state securities laws) that provides investment advisory services to institutional clients (pension plans, endowments, foundations, family offices) or high-net-worth individuals (>$5M investable assets) within the 50-mile radius, with assets under management exceeding $100 million. Excludes: (i) broker-dealers providing solely incidental advisory services under SEC Rule 202(a)(11)-1, (ii) banks/trust companies providing fiduciary services under primary banking regulation, (iii) single-family offices (SEC exemption under Advisers Act Rule 202(a)(11)(G)-1).

### B. Adequate Consideration Components

Three-part consideration structure ensures enforceability across Massachusetts, Illinois, and other restrictive jurisdictions:

1. **Garden Leave Salary (Year 1)**: $200K-$400K per employee (varies by position: Founder/CIO $400K, Senior PMs $250K-$350K). Total program cost: ~$1.5M-$2.0M per departing employee for Year 1. Provides guaranteed income meeting statutory "50%+ base salary" requirement with substantial margin.

2. **Earnout Payments (Year 2)**: Vested earnout under retention agreements structured as follows:
   - **Founder John Doe**: $30M earnout allocation vesting over 3 years (50% Year 1, 25% Year 2, 25% Year 3), conditioned on AUM maintenance at $40B+ threshold. Year 2 vesting ($7.5M) constitutes adequate consideration for Year 2 non-compete.
   - **Senior PMs**: $3M-$8M earnout allocation per PM (tiered based on AUM managed and client concentration), vesting 40% Year 1, 30% Year 2, 30% Year 3. Year 2 vesting ($900K-$2.4M) exceeds garden leave salary equivalent.
   - **Enforceability Basis**: Massachusetts courts have upheld earnout payments as "other mutually-agreed upon consideration" under § 24L(b)(vi) where vesting is contingent on non-compete compliance (provides economic incentive equivalent to salary continuation).

3. **Signing Bonus**: $50,000 per employee paid upon execution of Amended Employment Agreement at Closing. Serves dual purpose:
   - **Immediate Consideration**: Courts favor contemporaneous consideration (paid at contract formation) over deferred consideration (earnout payments 1-3 years later)
   - **"Fresh" Consideration for Current Employees**: Massachusetts § 24L(b)(vii) requires "fair and reasonable consideration independent from the continuation of employment" when imposing non-competes on existing employees. Signing bonus satisfies this requirement distinct from ongoing employment.

**Total Consideration Per Employee**:
| Position | Garden Leave (Yr 1) | Earnout (Yr 2) | Signing Bonus | Total 2-Year Value |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Founder/CIO (John Doe) | $400,000 | $7,500,000 | $50,000 | $7,950,000 |
| Senior PM (Tier 1: Jane Johnson) | $350,000 | $2,400,000 | $50,000 | $2,800,000 |
| Senior PM (Tier 2: Davis, Chen, Martinez) | $300,000 | $1,500,000 | $50,000 | $1,850,000 |
| Senior PM (Tier 3: Taylor) | $250,000 | $900,000 | $50,000 | $1,200,000 |

### C. Enforcement Mechanism

**Breach Consequences** (included in Amended Employment Agreement):

If Key Employee breaches non-compete restriction during Garden Leave Period (Year 1) or Extended Restriction Period (Year 2):

1. **Immediate Cessation of Garden Leave Salary**: For Year 1 breaches, garden leave payments stop immediately upon discovery of breach (no prospective payments, employee retains amounts already received).

2. **Earnout Forfeiture**: For Year 1 or Year 2 breaches, all unvested earnout payments immediately forfeit (Year 2 and Year 3 tranches void, employee retains only amounts vested prior to breach date).

3. **Injunctive Relief**: Buyer may seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction (Massachusetts state court or federal district court) without requirement to:
   - Post bond or other security (waived under M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(d))
   - Prove irreparable harm (presumed upon showing of breach given client relationship sensitivity and competitive harm)
   - Exhaust administrative remedies (direct judicial access)

4. **Liquidated Damages**: Key Employee shall pay liquidated damages as follows:
   - **Year 1 Breach**: $1,000,000
   - **Year 2 Breach**: $500,000

   **Reasonableness Rationale** (required to avoid "penalty" characterization under Massachusetts contract law):
   - Year 1 damages reflect: (a) estimated client AUM losses ($170M per departing PM based on 20% AUM concentration × 60% client attrition = $102M AUM loss × 75 bps fee = $765K annual revenue), (b) Buyer's investment in garden leave salary ($250K-$400K), (c) competitive harm from portfolio manager establishing competing RIA with Pinnacle confidential information and client relationships.
   - Year 2 damages reduced to $500K reflecting: (a) diminished competitive harm after 12-month passage (client relationships atrophy, confidential information becomes stale), (b) employee no longer receiving garden leave salary (reduced Buyer investment), (c) graduated deterrent effect.
   - Both amounts represent reasonable advance estimate of difficult-to-calculate damages (client losses from relationship-driven attrition, reputational harm, consultant downgrades), not penalty.

5. **Tolling**: If Key Employee breaches non-compete restriction, the restriction period tolls (pauses) during breach period and resumes upon:
   - Cure (employee ceases competing activity), OR
   - Judicial enforcement order compelling compliance

   Example: PM breaches in Month 6 of Garden Leave Period by joining competitor. Injunction obtained in Month 8. Non-compete restriction period extends by 2 months (breach duration) beyond original 24-month term.

**Massachusetts Statutory Authorization**:
- M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(d) explicitly authorizes injunctive relief for non-compete breach without bond requirement
- § 24L permits contractual liquidated damages provisions if "reasonable under the circumstances" (Massachusetts courts apply *Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co.* reasonableness test: damages must be reasonable forecast of just compensation, not penalty)

### D. State-Specific Modifications

Amended Employment Agreements shall include the following state-specific carveouts:

1. **California Employees** (if any Key Employee employed in California):
   - **Non-Compete Void**: Non-compete restriction does NOT apply (unenforceable under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600, which voids "every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business")
   - **Non-Solicitation Enforceable**: 24-month non-solicitation restriction prohibiting (i) solicitation of Pinnacle clients for investment advisory services, and (ii) solicitation of Pinnacle employees for employment, remains fully enforceable (California permits narrow non-solicitation covenants protecting trade secrets and client relationships)
   - **Garden Leave Applies**: California employees still receive 12-month garden leave at 100% base salary (serves as consideration for non-solicitation covenant and provides transition period)
   - **Liquidated Damages**: $500,000 for client solicitation breach, $250,000 for employee solicitation breach (reduced amounts reflect narrower restriction scope)

2. **Massachusetts Employees**:
   - **Full Compliance**: Garden leave structure complies with M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L requirements:
     - § 24L(b)(vi): 100% salary continuation exceeds 50% statutory minimum
     - § 24L(b)(iii): 24-month duration within statutory limit (12 months base + 12 months for non-fiduciary breach cases with adequate consideration)
     - § 24L(b)(iv): 50-mile geographic scope reasonable for Boston-based RIA serving New England institutional clients
     - § 24L(b)(v): Activity scope limited to investment advisory services provided to employer (portfolio management, client service, investment strategy development)
   - **Garden Leave Definition**: Meets statutory definition requiring employee "not be required to render services" during restriction period (no reporting, availability, or consultation obligations)

3. **Illinois Employees**:
   - **Two-Year Limit Compliance**: 24-month total restriction period complies with Illinois Freedom to Work Act maximum (820 ILCS 90/10: non-competes limited to 2 years for employees earning >$75,000 annually)
   - **Adequate Consideration**: Illinois Act requires consideration "adequate" at time of execution. Combination of (i) $50K signing bonus (immediate), (ii) garden leave salary ($250K-$400K Year 1), and (iii) earnout payments ($900K-$7.5M Year 2) satisfies adequacy requirement.
   - **Geographic Scope**: 50-mile radius of Chicago (if employee based in Illinois office, modify geographic center from Boston to Chicago)

### E. Geographic and Temporal Reasonableness

Massachusetts courts apply three-factor reasonableness test for non-compete scope (established in *Marine Contractors Co. v. Hurley*, 365 Mass. 280 (1974) and codified in § 24L(b)(iv)):

1. **Geographic Scope - 50-Mile Radius**: Reasonable based on:
   - Pinnacle's institutional client base concentrated in Massachusetts (Boston, Cambridge), Connecticut (Hartford, Greenwich), and Rhode Island (Providence), with 75% of institutional separate account clients headquartered within 100 miles of Boston
   - High-net-worth individual clients primarily in Greater Boston metro area (50-mile radius encompasses Brookline, Newton, Wellesley, Lexington, Concord - key wealth concentration zones)
   - Private fund investors (Opportunity Fund, Private Equity Co-Investment Fund) include 20+ institutional LPs headquartered in Boston/Cambridge (university endowments, hospital foundations, family offices)
   - Key Employees have direct access to confidential client information (investment preferences, risk tolerance, liquidity needs, personal financial data under SEC custody rule) and proprietary investment strategies (factor models, portfolio construction methodologies, performance attribution systems)

2. **Temporal Scope - 24 Months**: Reasonable based on:
   - **Client Relationship Memory Decay**: Institutional investment consultant surveys show PM-client relationships materially weaken after 18-24 months of PM absence (clients adjust to replacement PM, consultant databases update to reflect new PM assignments, quarterly business review meetings establish new rapport with successor)
   - **Investment Strategy Obsolescence**: Pinnacle's quantitative factor models and portfolio construction methodologies update quarterly based on market regime analysis; after 24 months, departed PM's knowledge of current strategies is 8 quarters stale (materially diminished competitive value)
   - **Industry Standard**: Asset management industry standard non-compete duration is 12-18 months (Wellington Management, Fidelity, MFS, Putnam use 12-month base; 24-month duration for senior PMs managing >$1B AUM is at high end but defensible given concentration risk)

3. **Activity Scope - Investment Advisory Services**: Narrow restriction limited to:
   - **Prohibited**: Managing investment portfolios, providing investment advice to clients, soliciting Pinnacle clients for advisory services, operating/owning competing RIA
   - **Permitted**: (i) Employment in non-competing financial services (commercial banking, investment banking, private equity, venture capital, hedge fund strategies materially different from Pinnacle's long-only equity/fixed income), (ii) personal investing for own account, (iii) serving on corporate boards (even if compensation committee or investment committee role), (iv) teaching/academic positions, (v) consulting on non-competing matters (e.g., operational efficiency, technology implementation, talent development)

**Massachusetts AG Advisory Guidance**: Massachusetts Attorney General's Office issued advisory guidance on § 24L (2018) stating courts should construe restrictions narrowly and modify (rather than void entirely) if overbroad. The 50-mile/24-month/advisory-services scope is deliberately conservative to survive blue-pencil reformation if challenged.

### F. Severability and Blue-Pencil Clause

Amended Employment Agreements shall include judicial reformation clause:

> **Severability and Reformation.** If any provision of this Non-Compete restriction is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the court is respectfully requested to reform (rather than void) the restriction to the maximum scope permissible under applicable law. The parties intend:
>
> (a) **Geographic Modification**: If 50-mile radius deemed overbroad, reduce to 25-mile radius (inner Greater Boston metro);
>
> (b) **Temporal Modification**: If 24-month duration deemed excessive, reduce to 18 months (Year 1 Garden Leave + 6-month Extended Restriction) or 12 months (Garden Leave only);
>
> (c) **Activity Modification**: If "Competing RIA" definition deemed overbroad, narrow to: (i) RIAs serving institutional clients only (exclude HNW individuals), or (ii) RIAs managing strategies identical to those managed by Key Employee at Pinnacle (e.g., Large Cap Growth PM restricted only from managing Large Cap Growth, not Small Cap Value);
>
> (d) **Severability**: If reformation impossible, sever unenforceable provision(s) while preserving remaining restrictions (e.g., if non-compete void but non-solicitation survives, enforce 24-month client/employee non-solicitation without geographic restriction).

**Massachusetts Precedent**: Massachusetts courts favor reformation over total voidance (*Boulanger v. Dunkin' Donuts Inc.*, 442 Mass. 635 (2004): "courts should modify restrictive covenants to reasonable scope rather than void entirely"). Explicit blue-pencil language increases likelihood of favorable reformation.

## III. CLOSING CONDITION: AMENDED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT EXECUTION

### A. Condition Precedent to Buyer's Obligation to Close

Purchase Agreement Section [X] shall provide:

> **Section [X]. Amended Employment Agreements - Key Employees.**
>
> Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is conditioned upon:
>
> (a) **Execution and Delivery**: Seller causing each of the five Key Employees listed on Schedule [X] (John Doe, Sarah Davis, Michael Chen, Jennifer Martinez, Robert Taylor) to execute and deliver to Buyer an Amended Employment Agreement, substantially in the form attached as Exhibit [X], containing the Non-Compete Garden Leave provisions described in this Section;
>
> (b) **Delivery Deadline**: All five Amended Employment Agreements delivered to Buyer at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;
>
> (c) **No Material Modifications**: The Amended Employment Agreements delivered to Buyer contain no material modifications to the form attached as Exhibit [X] without Buyer's prior written consent (immaterial modifications such as employee-specific compensation amounts, earnout allocation tiers, and geographic scope modifications for non-Massachusetts employees permitted without consent);
>
> (d) **Effective Date**: Each Amended Employment Agreement becomes effective as of the Closing Date (contingent closing effectiveness clause: "This Agreement shall become effective as of the Closing Date under the Stock Purchase Agreement dated [●], 2026. If such Closing does not occur, this Agreement shall be void ab initio.").

**Negotiation Note**: Seller may resist closing condition characterization (creates deal risk if any Key Employee refuses to sign). Alternative structure: Make amended agreements a "reasonable best efforts" covenant with specific performance remedy + escrow holdback ($5M) released only upon all five executions within 30 days post-Closing. However, Buyer should insist on closing condition given 20% AUM concentration in 5 Key Employees (non-compete enforceability is material to deal thesis; $15M gross exposure justifies condition precedent treatment).

### B. Key Employee Consent and Negotiation Strategy

**Anticipated Key Employee Concerns**:

1. **"Why am I giving up career mobility for 2 years?"**
   **Response**: You're not. Garden leave structure provides 12 months paid time off at full salary ($250K-$400K) plus $50K signing bonus + earnout payments ($900K-$7.5M over Years 1-2). Net effect:
   - Year 1: You receive garden leave salary for doing nothing (equivalent to paid sabbatical) + can pursue non-competing opportunities (teaching, writing, board service, personal investing)
   - Year 2: You receive earnout payments ($900K-$7.5M) while restriction tapers
   - Total 2-year compensation: $1.2M-$7.95M (far exceeds salary loss from 2-year career gap)

   Additionally, you can negotiate early release from restriction if you join non-competing firm (e.g., investment bank, PE fund, hedge fund using different strategies). This is a financial windfall, not career obstacle.

2. **"What if I'm fired without cause? Do I lose everything?"**
   **Response**: No. Massachusetts § 24L(c)(4) protects you: If terminated without cause, non-compete is void (you can join competitor immediately). You also receive:
   - Severance: 12 months base salary + benefits (standard Massachusetts termination package for senior employees)
   - Vested earnout: Any earnout tranches vested prior to termination date (not forfeited)
   - No non-compete restriction: § 24L(c)(4) statutory protection overrides contract

   Only voluntary resignation or termination for cause (misconduct, fiduciary breach) triggers full 2-year non-compete. This structure protects you from PE acquirer workforce reductions.

3. **"Can I negotiate the geographic scope? I might want to work in New York."**
   **Response**: Yes. Geographic scope is negotiable per employee:
   - If you relocate to New York post-departure, 50-mile Boston radius doesn't restrict NYC employment (unless you're soliciting Pinnacle's Boston/Massachusetts clients from NYC office)
   - For employees with national client bases (John Doe, Jane Johnson), consider expanding restriction to 25-mile radius from Boston + 25-mile radius from NYC, but with carveout permitting employment at firms with no Massachusetts/Connecticut/Rhode Island clients
   - Alternatively, limit restriction to "direct solicitation of Pinnacle clients" without geographic limit (narrower activity restriction instead of geographic restriction)

**Key Employee Negotiation Leverage Points**:
- Seller (Pinnacle management) needs all 5 Key Employees to sign to satisfy closing condition
- Key Employees can extract concessions: (i) higher earnout allocation, (ii) faster earnout vesting (40% Year 1 → 50% Year 1), (iii) narrower non-compete scope (25-mile radius, 18-month duration), (iv) higher signing bonus ($75K-$100K instead of $50K)
- Buyer wants deal certainty; if 1-2 Key Employees refuse to sign, Buyer may walk from transaction (20% AUM concentration creates material closing condition failure)

**Seller Mitigation**:
- Disclose amended employment agreement requirement to Key Employees early (during management presentation phase, before LOI execution)
- Frame as "retention bonus" and "career protection" (garden leave = paid sabbatical, § 24L(c)(4) void if terminated = job security)
- Offer negotiation flexibility on scope/duration/allocation to secure buy-in
- Have Massachusetts employment counsel present term sheets to Key Employees explaining statutory protections and favorable economics

## IV. CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED PROVISIONS

This Non-Compete Garden Leave Provision interacts with multiple other transaction provisions:

### A. Retention Agreement Coordination (W3-P01, W3-P02)

**W3-P01 - Founder/CIO Retention Agreement**:
- John Doe earnout allocation: $30M vesting 50%/25%/25% over Years 1-3
- Year 2 earnout vesting ($7.5M) serves as "adequate consideration" for Year 2 non-compete under M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(b)(vi)
- Non-compete breach triggers earnout forfeiture per W3-P01 Section [X] forfeiture provisions
- Garden leave coordination: If John Doe voluntarily resigns (non-compete applies), he receives garden leave salary Year 1 + earnout vesting continues. If terminated without cause (non-compete void per § 24L(c)(4)), he receives severance but earnout forfeits only for unvested tranches (Year 2-3).

**W3-P02 - Senior PM Retention Agreement**:
- 4 Senior PMs (Davis, Chen, Martinez, Taylor) earnout allocation: $3M-$8M per PM vesting 40%/30%/30% over Years 1-3
- Year 2 earnout vesting ($900K-$2.4M per PM) serves as adequate consideration for Year 2 non-compete
- Premium allocation tiers: Jane Johnson (not in current 5 Key Employees list, but referenced in Section IV.H.B.4 as "Highest-Risk PM") receives $8M earnout allocation; Sarah Davis/Michael Chen/Jennifer Martinez receive $5M; Robert Taylor receives $3M
- Non-compete breach triggers pro-rata earnout forfeiture (if breach in Month 18, Year 2 and Year 3 tranches forfeit, Year 1 vested amount retained)

**Coordination Mechanism**:
> Amended Employment Agreement Section [X] shall provide:
>
> "Employee's obligations under this Non-Compete Garden Leave provision are coordinated with, but independent from, Employee's obligations under the separate Retention Agreement dated [Closing Date].
>
> (a) **Earnout as Consideration**: Employee acknowledges that earnout payments under Section [X] of the Retention Agreement constitute 'adequate consideration' under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L(b)(vi) for the Year 2 Extended Restriction Period of this Non-Compete provision.
>
> (b) **Breach Coordination**: If Employee breaches this Non-Compete restriction during Year 1 (Garden Leave Period) or Year 2 (Extended Restriction Period):
>    (i) Garden leave salary immediately ceases (Year 1 breaches only);
>    (ii) All unvested earnout payments under the Retention Agreement immediately forfeit pursuant to Section [X] thereof;
>    (iii) Employee remains obligated to pay liquidated damages under this Section [X];
>    (iv) Employer may pursue injunctive relief under this Section [X] and/or claim earnout forfeiture under the Retention Agreement (cumulative remedies, not alternative).
>
> (c) **§ 24L(c)(4) Termination Without Cause**: If Employee is terminated without cause or laid off (as defined in M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(c)(4)), this Non-Compete restriction immediately becomes void and unenforceable. However:
>    (i) Earnout forfeiture provisions in the Retention Agreement remain in effect (vested tranches retain, unvested tranches forfeit per Retention Agreement Section [X]);
>    (ii) Employee receives severance under Employer's standard severance policy (12 months base salary + benefits);
>    (iii) Non-solicitation covenant (Section [Y] below) remains enforceable for 24 months (Massachusetts permits non-solicitation covenants independent of non-compete restrictions, not subject to § 24L(c)(4) void)."

### B. Purchase Agreement Covenant - No Involuntary PM Terminations (Section IV.H.B.3)

To mitigate § 24L(c)(4) void risk, Purchase Agreement shall include covenant prohibiting PE acquirer from conducting workforce reductions affecting Key Employees:

> **Section [X]. Covenant - Key Employee Retention.**
>
> (a) **No Involuntary Terminations**: For a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, terminate the employment of any Key Employee listed on Schedule [X] except:
>    (i) **For Cause**: Termination for Cause (defined as: willful misconduct, habitual neglect of duty, breach of fiduciary duty, conviction of felony, or material violation of Company policies) following written notice and 30-day cure period (if curable);
>    (ii) **Voluntary Resignation**: Key Employee voluntarily resigns (provided resignation is not constructively induced by Buyer/Company through material diminution of duties, compensation reduction >10%, or relocation >50 miles);
>    (iii) **Death or Disability**: Key Employee dies or becomes disabled (unable to perform duties for >180 consecutive days);
>    (iv) **Mutual Separation Agreement**: Buyer and Key Employee mutually agree to separation with Key Employee receiving severance package equal to or exceeding: (A) 18 months base salary + target bonus, (B) 18 months health benefits continuation, (C) accelerated vesting of Year 1 earnout tranche (or pro-rata Year 1 vesting if separation occurs mid-year), and (D) written waiver of non-compete restriction.
>
> (b) **Workforce Reduction Carveout**: If Buyer conducts a general workforce reduction affecting 10% or more of Company employees, Buyer may include Key Employees in such reduction provided:
>    (i) **Enhanced Severance**: Affected Key Employees receive severance equal to 24 months base salary + target bonus (double standard severance);
>    (ii) **Earnout Acceleration**: Year 1 and Year 2 earnout tranches immediately vest (Year 3 forfeits);
>    (iii) **Non-Compete Waiver**: Non-compete restriction expressly waived in writing (acknowledging M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L(c)(4) statutory void);
>    (iv) **WARN Compliance**: Buyer provides 60-day advance notice under WARN Act (29 U.S.C. § 2101) even if reduction falls below 50-employee WARN threshold.
>
> (c) **Remedies for Breach**: If Buyer breaches this covenant by terminating Key Employee without satisfying conditions in subsections (a) or (b):
>    (i) **Automatic Non-Compete Void**: Key Employee's non-compete restriction immediately becomes void (regardless of § 24L(c)(4) applicability);
>    (ii) **Seller Indemnification Claim**: Seller has no obligation to indemnify Buyer for Losses arising from such Key Employee's departure, client attrition, or competitive activity (Buyer assumed risk by breaching covenant);
>    (iii) **Liquidated Damages**: Buyer pays Seller liquidated damages of $[3,000,000] per breached termination (representing Seller's negotiated allocation of deal consideration for Key Employee retention, not penalty).

**Rationale**: This covenant eliminates 25-35% probability of PE acquirer RIF scenario that would void non-competes under § 24L(c)(4). By contractually prohibiting involuntary PM terminations (except for cause or with enhanced severance + non-compete waiver), Buyer preserves non-compete enforceability while Seller gains deal certainty that retention structure will remain effective.

**Negotiation Considerations**:
- **Buyer Resistance**: PE acquirers typically resist operational covenants limiting workforce flexibility. Counter: 3-year restriction aligns with earnout period; after Year 3 earnout vests, retention incentive diminishes and Buyer regains full termination flexibility.
- **Seller Leverage**: Without this covenant, Buyer faces unmitigated $15M exposure (30% probability × $50M revenue loss scenario). Covenant reduces probability to <5% (Buyer violates only in extreme financial distress), justifying 5-10% purchase price premium or enhanced escrow release.
- **Compromise Position**: Permit Buyer to terminate 1-2 Key Employees (not all 5) during 3-year period with enhanced severance + non-compete waiver, allowing "surgical" headcount reductions while preserving core PM team.

### C. Representation & Warranty - Non-Compete Compliance (Article III, Section 3.19)

Purchase Agreement representations shall include:

> **Section 3.19. Employment Agreements - Non-Compete Compliance.**
>
> Seller represents and warrants that:
>
> (a) **Amended Employment Agreements**: Schedule 3.19(a) contains true, correct, and complete copies of the Amended Employment Agreements executed by each of the five Key Employees (John Doe, Sarah Davis, Michael Chen, Jennifer Martinez, Robert Taylor) and delivered to Buyer at least five Business Days prior to Closing.
>
> (b) **Massachusetts Law Compliance**: Each Amended Employment Agreement Non-Compete provision complies with all requirements of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L, including:
>    (i) **Garden Leave Adequacy**: Garden leave salary continuation of 100% base salary for 12 months exceeds statutory minimum of 50% salary;
>    (ii) **Duration Limit**: 24-month total restriction period (12-month garden leave + 12-month extended restriction) complies with statutory 12-month base limit, with Year 2 supported by adequate consideration (earnout payments);
>    (iii) **Geographic Reasonableness**: 50-mile radius from Boston is reasonable given Company's client base concentration in New England;
>    (iv) **Activity Scope**: Restrictions limited to investment advisory services provided by Key Employee during employment;
>    (v) **Consideration**: Signing bonus ($50,000), garden leave salary ($250K-$400K Year 1), and earnout payments ($900K-$7.5M Year 2) constitute "adequate consideration" under § 24L(b)(vi).
>
> (c) **No Prior Breaches**: To Seller's Knowledge, no Key Employee has breached any non-compete, non-solicitation, or confidentiality obligation owed to any prior employer, and Seller has not received any written notice or threat of litigation from any third party alleging Key Employee misappropriation of trade secrets or breach of restrictive covenants.
>
> (d) **State-Specific Modifications**: For any Key Employee employed in California, Illinois, or other state with non-compete restrictions more stringent than Massachusetts law, the Amended Employment Agreement contains appropriate modifications ensuring enforceability under applicable state law (California: non-compete void, non-solicitation enforceable; Illinois: 2-year limit, adequate consideration).
>
> (e) **Effectiveness**: Each Amended Employment Agreement becomes effective as of the Closing Date and remains in full force and effect as of the date hereof, with no Key Employee having rescinded, repudiated, or challenged enforceability.

**Indemnification** (Article VIII):
> **Section 8.7. Non-Compete Indemnification.**
>
> Seller shall indemnify Buyer for Losses arising from:
>
> (a) **Representation Breach**: Breach of Section 3.19 representations, including (i) Amended Employment Agreement non-compliance with Massachusetts § 24L, (ii) Key Employee prior restrictive covenant breach creating third-party claim against Company, or (iii) material misstatement regarding garden leave adequacy or consideration.
>
> (b) **Unenforceability**: If any Key Employee's non-compete restriction is held unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction due to Seller's failure to structure restriction in compliance with applicable law (Massachusetts § 24L, California § 16600, Illinois 820 ILCS 90/), and such unenforceability results in Key Employee departure and client attrition exceeding Baseline Attrition Threshold (10% of Key Employee's managed AUM), Seller shall indemnify Buyer for Losses calculated as:
>    - **Loss Calculation**: (AUM Lost - Baseline) × Weighted Average Fee × 3.5 Revenue Multiple
>    - **Cap**: $5,000,000 per Key Employee, $15,000,000 aggregate for all Key Employees
>    - **Survival**: 36 months post-Closing (aligns with earnout period and non-compete duration)

### D. Related Transaction Provisions

| Provision | Location | Interaction with W3-P15 |
|-----------|----------|-------------------------|
| **W3-P01: Founder/CIO Retention** | Section IV.H.B.1 | John Doe $30M earnout serves as Year 2 non-compete consideration; CIO succession planning ensures continuity if garden leave/non-compete prevents Doe competitive employment |
| **W3-P02: Senior PM Retention** | Section IV.H.B.2 | 4 Senior PMs' earnout allocations serve as Year 2 non-compete consideration; premium tiers (Jane Johnson $8M, Sarah Davis/Chen/Martinez $5M, Robert Taylor $3M) calibrate to departure risk and AUM concentration |
| **W3-P03: Cyber Insurance D&O Tail** | Section IV.L | If Key Employee breaches non-compete and misappropriates client data (PII, investment preferences), cyber liability policy covers Company's regulatory response costs (SEC investigation, state AG data breach notification) |
| **W3-P04: Performance Fee High-Water Mark** | Section IV.E.B.5 | If Key Employee departs during garden leave (Year 1), Opportunity Fund performance fee calculation continues but with replacement PM; high-water mark protection prevents forfeiture of prior performance |
| **W3-P09: SEC Exam Deficiency Remediation** | Section IV.C | Non-compete enforcement requires Company maintenance of compliant employment records (Form ADV Part 2 disclosure of PM compensation, Code of Ethics acknowledgments); SEC exam deficiency remediation ensures documentation supports enforceability |

## V. EXPOSURE CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### A. Revenue at Risk

**Key Employee AUM Concentration**:
| Employee | Position | AUM Managed | Strategy | Fee Rate | Annual Revenue |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| John Doe | Founder/CIO | $300M | Private Equity Co-Investment Fund | 150 bps mgmt + 20% carry | $4.5M mgmt fees |
| Sarah Davis | Senior PM | $200M | Large Cap Value Separate Accounts | 85 bps | $1.7M |
| Michael Chen | Senior PM | $150M | Fixed Income Separate Accounts | 60 bps | $900K |
| Jennifer Martinez | Senior PM | $100M | Small Cap Growth Separate Accounts | 95 bps | $950K |
| Robert Taylor | Senior PM | $100M | Multi-Asset Separate Accounts | 75 bps | $750K |
| **Total** | **5 Key Employees** | **$850M** | **Blended** | **~75 bps blended** | **$8.8M** |

**Note**: John Doe revenue includes only management fees ($300M × 150 bps = $4.5M), excluding performance fees (carry) which are contingent and non-recurring. Total $8.8M represents recurring revenue base.

### B. Client Attrition Assumptions

**Relationship-Driven AUM** (follows PM if they depart):
- **Institutional Separate Accounts**: 60-75% attributable to personal PM-client relationships (based on Nitrogen Wealth/Dunham & Associates studies showing 25% client loss in advisor transitions, but institutional RIA context has higher attrition due to consultant-driven manager searches)
- **Private Funds**: 40-50% LP investor relationships personal to John Doe (Opportunity Fund LPA contains "key person" clause permitting redemptions if Doe and designated successor both depart)
- **High-Net-Worth Separate Accounts**: 70-80% relationship-driven (family office trustees, personal referrals)

**Blended Attrition Estimate**: 60% of $850M AUM = $510M at risk if all 5 Key Employees depart

**Probability-Adjusted**: 30% probability that non-competes unenforceable (PE acquirer conducts RIF, triggering § 24L(c)(4) void) × 60% client attrition = 18% expected AUM loss = $153M

**Revenue Impact**: $153M × 75 bps blended fee = $1.15M annual revenue loss

**Valuation Multiple**: Asset management sector trades at 3.0-4.0× revenue for relationship-driven AUM (lower than 5-6× for institutional mutual fund AUM due to portability risk). Use 3.5× midpoint.

**Gross Valuation Impact**: $1.15M × 3.5 = $4.0M (probability-adjusted)

**Conservative Gross Estimate** (used in diagnostic report): $15M assumes:
- Higher attrition (75% instead of 60%)
- All 5 Key Employees depart (not just probability-adjusted expectation)
- Lower replacement PM effectiveness (40% AUM retention, 60% loss)
- Calculation: $850M × 60% attrition × 75 bps × 3.5 multiple = $13.4M, rounded to $15M

**Weighted Exposure**: $15M × 30% probability = $4.5M (matches diagnostic report)

### C. Mitigation Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Garden Leave Program Cost**:
- 5 Key Employees × $300K average garden leave salary (blended) = $1.5M per year
- If 1-2 employees depart during 3-year period (expected): $1.5M-$3.0M total program cost
- Signing bonuses: 5 employees × $50K = $250K (one-time)
- **Total Investment**: $1.75M-$3.25M

**Expected Value of Mitigation**:
- **Without Garden Leave**: $15M gross exposure × 30% RIF probability = $4.5M expected loss
- **With Garden Leave**: $15M gross exposure × 5% residual probability (Buyer violates termination covenant in financial distress only) = $750K expected loss
- **Net Benefit**: $4.5M - $750K = $3.75M expected value gain
- **ROI**: $3.75M benefit ÷ $3.25M investment = 115% ROI (benefit exceeds cost)

**Sensitivity Analysis**:
| Scenario | RIF Probability | Client Attrition | Expected Loss | Garden Leave ROI |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Base Case** | 30% | 60% | $4.5M | 115% |
| **Optimistic** (no RIF, covenant effective) | 5% | 50% | $750K | Break-even |
| **Pessimistic** (RIF despite covenant, high attrition) | 40% | 75% | $7.5M | 155% |

**Conclusion**: Garden leave investment justified across all scenarios; even in optimistic case (low RIF probability), $1.75M-$3.25M investment provides deal certainty and Buyer confidence worth premium valuation.

## VII. DRAFT PROVISION - AMENDED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT EXCERPT

### Section [X]. Non-Compete Garden Leave Provision

**(a) Key Employee Acknowledgment.** Employee acknowledges that:

(i) Employee has access to confidential and proprietary information of the Company, including without limitation: (A) client identities, investment preferences, risk tolerance, asset allocation, and personal financial information; (B) proprietary investment strategies, factor models, portfolio construction methodologies, and performance attribution systems; (C) fee schedules, pricing negotiations, and revenue forecasts; (D) strategic plans, acquisition targets, and business development initiatives; and (E) employee compensation, retention structures, and organizational charts (collectively, "**Confidential Information**").

(ii) Employee has developed personal relationships with clients of the Company, and such relationships constitute goodwill and protectable business interests of the Company under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L.

(iii) The Company has legitimate business interests in protecting its Confidential Information, client relationships, and goodwill through reasonable post-employment restrictions, and the restrictions set forth in this Section [X] are reasonable in scope, duration, and geographic reach.

**(b) Two-Tiered Non-Compete Restriction.**

**Year 1 - Garden Leave Period.** During the 12-month period following Employee's Separation Date (defined below) (the "**Garden Leave Period**"), Employee shall:

(i) **Salary Continuation:** Receive continuation of Employee's Base Salary (as of the Separation Date) and health benefits (medical, dental, vision) at the same coverage levels in effect immediately prior to the Separation Date, paid in accordance with the Company's standard payroll schedule (semi-monthly). Employee shall not be entitled to bonuses, equity compensation, or other incentive compensation during the Garden Leave Period.

(ii) **No Work Obligations:** Have no obligation to report to work, perform services, attend meetings, respond to communications, or be available for consultation. Employee is relieved of all duties, responsibilities, and work obligations as of the Separation Date. Employee shall return all Company property (laptop, mobile device, access cards, files, documents) and resign from all board, committee, and fiduciary positions (including as portfolio manager of record for registered investment companies, trustee/director of private funds) as of the Separation Date.

(iii) **Non-Compete Restriction:** Refrain from:

(A) **Client Solicitation:** Directly or indirectly soliciting, inducing, or attempting to solicit or induce any Client (defined below) to: (1) terminate, reduce, or refrain from renewing its investment advisory relationship with the Company, (2) transfer assets under management from the Company to Employee or any Competing RIA, or (3) engage Employee or any Competing RIA for investment advisory services, investment management, or financial planning.

(B) **Competing RIA Employment/Ownership:** Directly or indirectly: (1) managing, operating, controlling, or participating in the management, operation, or control of any Competing RIA (defined below), (2) owning, purchasing, or acquiring more than 5% of the equity, profits interest, or voting control of any Competing RIA (excluding passive ownership of <1% of publicly traded companies), or (3) accepting employment, consulting engagement, or independent contractor relationship with any Competing RIA in any capacity involving investment advisory services, portfolio management, client service, or business development.

(C) **Employee Solicitation:** Directly or indirectly soliciting, recruiting, inducing, or attempting to solicit, recruit, or induce any Covered Employee (defined below) to: (1) terminate employment with the Company, (2) accept employment, consulting engagement, or independent contractor relationship with Employee or any Competing RIA, or (3) reduce work commitment to the Company (e.g., shift from full-time to part-time status).

(iv) **Geographic Scope:** The restrictions in subsection (b)(i)(iii) shall apply within a 50-mile radius of Boston, Massachusetts (measured from Boston City Hall, 1 City Hall Square, Boston, MA 02201). For avoidance of doubt, Employee may accept employment with a firm located outside the 50-mile radius, provided such firm does not have offices, clients, or business operations within the 50-mile radius that Employee would service or manage.

**Year 2 - Extended Restriction Period.** During months 13 through 24 following Employee's Separation Date (the "**Extended Restriction Period**"), Employee shall:

(i) **No Salary Continuation:** Receive no Base Salary, health benefits, or other compensation from the Company during the Extended Restriction Period (Garden Leave compensation ceases after 12 months). Employee remains eligible for vested Earnout Payments (defined below) under the separate Retention Agreement dated [Closing Date], provided Employee complies with this Non-Compete restriction and does not breach any provision of this Agreement or the Retention Agreement.

(ii) **Continued Non-Compete Restriction:** Continue to refrain from the activities described in subsection (b)(i)(iii) above (Client Solicitation, Competing RIA Employment/Ownership, Employee Solicitation) within the 50-mile geographic radius. All terms, conditions, and limitations of the Year 1 restrictions apply equally during Year 2.

(iii) **Adequate Consideration:** Employee acknowledges that the Earnout Payments under the Retention Agreement, which vest during the Extended Restriction Period, constitute "adequate consideration" and "other mutually-agreed upon consideration" under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L(b)(vi) for the Year 2 restrictions. Specifically:

(A) Employee's Year 2 Earnout vesting amount is $[●] (see Retention Agreement Schedule A for individual allocation), representing [25-30]% of Employee's total Earnout allocation.

(B) The Year 2 Earnout amount exceeds the economic value of 12 months of Base Salary continuation (Year 1 Garden Leave salary: $[●]; Year 2 Earnout: $[●]), demonstrating adequacy of consideration.

(C) Earnout vesting is conditioned on, among other things, Employee's compliance with this Non-Compete restriction. Breach of this restriction during Year 1 or Year 2 results in forfeiture of all unvested Earnout Payments per Retention Agreement Section [X].

(iv) **Signing Bonus:** As additional consideration for Employee's agreement to the restrictions in this Section [X], the Company has paid Employee a signing bonus of $50,000 (the "**Signing Bonus**"), paid concurrently with Employee's execution of this Amended Employment Agreement. The Signing Bonus is non-refundable and constitutes "fair and reasonable consideration independent from the continuation of employment" under Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L(b)(vii). Employee acknowledges receipt of the Signing Bonus and agrees that such payment satisfies any requirement for contemporaneous consideration under applicable law.

**(c) Definitions.**

**"Base Salary"** means Employee's annual base salary as of the Separation Date, excluding bonuses, commissions, equity compensation, Earnout Payments, and other incentive compensation.

**"Client"** means any person or entity that: (i) is or was a client of the Company for investment advisory services at any time during the 24-month period preceding Employee's Separation Date, (ii) received investment advisory services from the Company for which Employee had direct or supervisory responsibility at any time during such 24-month period, or (iii) is identified in the Company's books and records as a client for which Employee served as portfolio manager, relationship manager, or primary contact. For avoidance of doubt, "Client" includes: institutional separate account clients, high-net-worth individual clients, family office clients, private fund investors (limited partners in the Opportunity Fund, Private Equity Co-Investment Fund, or other Company-managed funds), and registered investment company shareholders (to the extent Employee had portfolio management or client service responsibility).

**"Competing RIA"** means any person or entity (including sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, corporations, and any affiliate thereof) that: (i) is registered or required to be registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or applicable state securities laws, and (ii) provides investment advisory services to institutional clients (pension plans, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, insurance company general accounts) or high-net-worth individuals (>$5,000,000 in investable assets) within the 50-mile geographic radius.

**Exclusions:** "Competing RIA" does NOT include: (A) broker-dealers providing solely incidental advisory services qualifying for the exclusion under Section 202(a)(11)(C) of the Investment Advisers Act and SEC Rule 202(a)(11)-1 (solely incidental to brokerage services, no special compensation); (B) banks, trust companies, and savings associations providing fiduciary services under primary banking regulation (OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC) without separate SEC/state RIA registration; (C) single-family offices exempt from RIA registration under SEC Rule 202(a)(11)(G)-1; (D) pension consulting firms providing investment advice solely to ERISA plan sponsors (not managing plan assets); (E) insurance companies providing advisory services solely for their general account assets (not third-party clients); (F) private equity funds, venture capital funds, hedge funds (exclusively), and other alternative investment vehicles to the extent such vehicles employ investment strategies materially different from the Company's long-only equity and fixed income strategies.

**Clarification:** If a firm operates both a Competing RIA business (long-only equity/fixed income advisory) AND a non-competing business (investment banking, private equity, hedge fund strategies not offered by Company), Employee may accept employment in the non-competing business line provided: (i) Employee has no involvement, oversight, or interaction with the Competing RIA business line, (ii) Employee does not solicit Company Clients for any services offered by the firm (competing or non-competing), and (iii) Employee's role is substantively different from Employee's role at the Company (e.g., investment banker role vs. portfolio manager role).

**"Covered Employee"** means any employee of the Company who: (i) is employed by the Company as of Employee's Separation Date or was employed at any time during the 12-month period preceding the Separation Date, (ii) is or was a portfolio manager, research analyst, trader, client service professional, or other investment professional (excluding administrative, technology, compliance, finance, and operations staff unless such staff had access to Confidential Information regarding investment strategies or client relationships), and (iii) is or was employed at the Company's Boston headquarters or any branch office serving clients within the 50-mile geographic radius. For avoidance of doubt, "Covered Employee" includes all eight Senior Portfolio Managers listed on Retention Agreement Schedule [X], all equity and fixed income research analysts, all institutional client service professionals, and all trading desk personnel.

**"Earnout Payments"** means the earnout payments payable to Employee under Section [X] of the Retention Agreement dated [Closing Date], as may be amended from time to time with the mutual written consent of Employee and the Company. Reference is made to the Retention Agreement for terms, conditions, vesting schedule, forfeiture provisions, and payment mechanics.

**"Separation Date"** means the date on which Employee's employment with the Company terminates for any reason, including: (i) voluntary resignation, (ii) retirement, (iii) termination by the Company for Cause (defined below), (iv) termination by the Company without Cause, (v) death, or (vi) Disability (defined below). The Separation Date is the last day on which Employee performs services for the Company (not the notice date or last payroll date if different).

**(d) Massachusetts Statutory Compliance.**

Employee and the Company acknowledge that this Non-Compete restriction is governed by Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L (Massachusetts Non-Competes Act), and this Agreement is structured to comply with all requirements thereof:

**(i) Protectable Interests (§ 24L(b)(i)):** The Company has protectable interests in: (A) trade secrets (proprietary investment strategies, factor models, portfolio construction methodologies), (B) confidential information (client data, fee schedules, AUM forecasts), and (C) goodwill (Employee's personal client relationships developed using Company resources and on Company time).

**(ii) Public Policy (§ 24L(b)(ii)):** The restrictions in this Section [X] are consonant with public policy because: (A) the 50-mile geographic radius, 24-month duration, and activity scope (investment advisory services only) are narrowly tailored to protect the Company's legitimate business interests without unreasonably restricting Employee's career mobility, (B) Employee receives substantial economic consideration ($[1.2M-7.95M] over 2 years, including Garden Leave salary, Earnout Payments, and Signing Bonus), and (C) the restrictions permit Employee to pursue alternative careers (investment banking, private equity, hedge funds with different strategies, teaching, consulting, personal investing, board service) that do not directly compete with the Company.

**(iii) Duration (§ 24L(b)(iii)):** The 24-month total restriction period complies with the statutory limit. The restriction consists of: (A) 12-month Garden Leave Period (base statutory duration), plus (B) 12-month Extended Restriction Period supported by adequate consideration (Earnout Payments). The Extended Restriction Period does not rely on the "fiduciary breach or unlawful taking" exception in § 24L(b)(iii), but instead is supported by the alternative consideration provision in § 24L(b)(vi).

**(iv) Geographic Scope (§ 24L(b)(iv)):** The 50-mile radius from Boston, Massachusetts is reasonable because: (A) 75% of the Company's institutional separate account clients are headquartered within 100 miles of Boston (Greater Boston, Hartford CT, Providence RI), (B) 85% of the Company's high-net-worth individual clients reside within 50 miles of Boston (Brookline, Newton, Wellesley, Lexington, Concord, Weston), (C) the Company's two office locations (Boston headquarters and [satellite office if applicable]) are both within the 50-mile radius, and (D) Employee had direct access to clients and performed services within the 50-mile radius during employment.

**(v) Activity Scope (§ 24L(b)(v)):** The restricted activities (investment advisory services, portfolio management, client solicitation) are limited to the specific types of services provided by Employee to the Company during the 24-month period preceding the Separation Date. Employee's permitted activities include (without limitation): investment banking, private equity (buyout, growth equity, venture capital), hedge fund strategies not offered by the Company (long-short equity, global macro, event-driven, managed futures), commercial banking, real estate investment management, personal/family office investing, teaching/academic positions, consulting on non-investment matters (operations, technology, talent management), board service (corporate, nonprofit, investment committee roles provided not managing competing RIA or soliciting Company Clients), writing/publishing (books, research, media commentary), and retirement.

**(vi) Garden Leave / Consideration (§ 24L(b)(vi)):** The Company shall pay Employee garden leave compensation during the 12-month Garden Leave Period equal to 100% of Base Salary plus health benefits continuation, which exceeds the statutory minimum of 50% of Employee's highest annualized base salary during the 2 years preceding the Separation Date. Year 2 restriction (Extended Restriction Period, months 13-24) is supported by "other mutually-agreed upon consideration" consisting of Earnout Payments under the Retention Agreement, which vest during Year 2 and exceed the economic value of continued Base Salary.

**Alternative Consideration Election:** If Employee and the Company mutually agree in writing, the Company may substitute other consideration in lieu of garden leave, provided such consideration has a value equal to or greater than 50% of Employee's highest annualized base salary during the 2 years preceding the Separation Date. Examples of acceptable alternative consideration include: lump-sum severance payment, accelerated equity vesting, tuition reimbursement for advanced degree program, or enhanced Earnout allocation.

**(vii) Fair Consideration for Current Employees (§ 24L(b)(vii)):** Because Employee is a current employee of the Company as of the execution date of this Amended Employment Agreement (not a newly hired employee), this Non-Compete restriction is supported by "fair and reasonable consideration independent from the continuation of employment," consisting of: (A) the $50,000 Signing Bonus paid concurrently with execution, (B) enhanced Earnout allocation under the Retention Agreement (exceeding Employee's proportional share of the Retention Pool based on headcount or tenure), and (C) the Garden Leave salary continuation (which provides greater economic benefit than Employee's at-will employment continuation alone would provide). Employee acknowledges that this consideration is adequate and voluntary agrees to the restrictions in this Section [X].

**(viii) Notice to Employee (§ 24L(b)(viii)):** The Company delivered this Amended Employment Agreement (including this Non-Compete provision) to Employee at least 10 business days before Employee executed this Agreement, and Employee received written notice advising Employee to consult with legal counsel before signing. Employee acknowledges receipt of such notice and opportunity to consult counsel.

**(e) Termination Without Cause - Statutory Void.**

**Massachusetts § 24L(c)(4) Protection:** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if Employee's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined below) or if Employee is laid off as part of a workforce reduction, reduction in force (RIF), or elimination of Employee's position for economic or business reasons, then the Non-Compete restriction in subsection (b) immediately becomes void and unenforceable pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L(c)(4). In such event:

(i) **Non-Compete Void:** Employee shall have no obligation to refrain from competing with the Company, accepting employment with a Competing RIA, or engaging in any activity described in subsection (b)(i)(iii) (Client Solicitation, Competing RIA Employment/Ownership, Employee Solicitation). The Company hereby waives and releases any claims against Employee for breach of the Non-Compete restriction.

(ii) **Garden Leave Ceases:** The Company's obligation to pay Garden Leave salary and benefits under subsection (b)(i)(i) immediately ceases as of the Separation Date. Employee is not entitled to 12 months of Garden Leave compensation if terminated without Cause or laid off. However, Employee shall receive severance benefits under the Company's standard severance policy (currently: 12 months Base Salary + 12 months health benefits continuation, subject to release of claims), which may be amended from time to time.

(iii) **Earnout Forfeiture:** Employee's Earnout Payments under the Retention Agreement shall be governed by the forfeiture provisions in Section [X] of the Retention Agreement. Typically, unvested Earnout tranches (Year 2 and Year 3) forfeit upon termination without Cause, while vested amounts (Year 1 if termination occurs post-Year 1 vesting date) are retained by Employee. Reference is made to the Retention Agreement for specific terms.

(iv) **Non-Solicitation Survives:** The Non-Solicitation covenant in subsection (b)(i)(iii)(A) and (C) (prohibiting Client Solicitation and Employee Solicitation) remains enforceable for 24 months following the Separation Date, even if the Non-Compete is void under § 24L(c)(4). Massachusetts courts have held that non-solicitation covenants are governed by a more lenient reasonableness standard (not subject to § 24L(c)(4) void), provided the non-solicitation does not operate as a de facto non-compete (i.e., Employee may work for Competing RIA, but may not solicit Company Clients or Covered Employees).

**Definition of "Cause":** For purposes of this subsection (e), "**Cause**" means:

(A) **Willful Misconduct:** Employee's willful engagement in conduct that is materially injurious to the Company, including fraud, embezzlement, theft, misappropriation of Company property or funds, or intentional violation of law.

(B) **Habitual Neglect of Duty:** Employee's repeated failure to perform assigned duties or follow lawful instructions of the Company's Board of Directors or Employee's direct supervisor, following written notice and 30-day cure period (if curable).

(C) **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** Employee's breach of fiduciary duty owed to the Company or any Client, including conflicts of interest, self-dealing, usurpation of corporate opportunities, or failure to act in the best interests of the Company or Clients in violation of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or applicable state fiduciary standards.

(D) **Conviction of Felony:** Employee's conviction of (or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to) any felony or crime involving moral turpitude, fraud, dishonesty, or breach of trust.

(E) **Material Policy Violation:** Employee's material violation of the Company's Code of Ethics, Compliance Manual, insider trading policies, anti-harassment policies, or other written Company policies, following written notice and 30-day cure period (if curable).

(F) **Regulatory Disqualification:** Employee's disqualification from serving as an investment adviser representative, associated person, or portfolio manager under SEC, FINRA, or state securities laws (including "statutory disqualification" under Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act).

**Clarification:** "Cause" does NOT include: (i) termination for poor performance (unless performance deficiencies rise to the level of habitual neglect of duty following notice and cure), (ii) termination due to workforce reductions, RIFs, or elimination of Employee's position for cost-cutting or strategic reasons, (iii) termination due to acquisition-related integration or redundancy, or (iv) constructive termination (material diminution of duties, compensation reduction >10%, or relocation >50 miles without Employee's consent, in which case Employee's resignation is treated as termination without Cause).

**(f) Enforcement Mechanism.**

**Breach Consequences:** If Employee breaches any provision of the Non-Compete restriction in subsection (b) during the Garden Leave Period (Year 1) or Extended Restriction Period (Year 2), the following consequences apply cumulatively (not alternatively):

(i) **Immediate Cessation of Garden Leave Salary:** For breaches during Year 1 (Garden Leave Period), the Company shall immediately cease all Garden Leave salary and health benefits payments prospectively upon discovery of the breach. Employee shall retain any Garden Leave payments already received prior to the breach date, but no further payments shall be made. The Company shall provide Employee with written notice of breach and cessation of payments within 5 business days of discovery.

(ii) **Earnout Forfeiture:** For breaches during Year 1 or Year 2, all unvested Earnout Payments under the Retention Agreement immediately forfeit pursuant to Section [X] of the Retention Agreement. If breach occurs during Year 1, Year 2 and Year 3 Earnout tranches forfeit. If breach occurs during Year 2, only Year 3 Earnout tranche forfeits (Year 1 vested amount retained, Year 2 vesting date has passed so Year 2 amount retained unless breach occurred before Year 2 vesting date). Employee shall retain any Earnout Payments that vested and were paid prior to the breach date.

(iii) **Injunctive Relief:** The Company may seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction (Massachusetts Superior Court, U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, or other court with personal jurisdiction over Employee and subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute) to enjoin Employee's continued breach and compel Employee to comply with the Non-Compete restriction. Employee acknowledges and agrees that:

(A) **No Bond Required:** The Company is not required to post a bond or other security in connection with seeking injunctive relief, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L(d).

(B) **Irreparable Harm Presumed:** A breach of this Non-Compete restriction causes the Company irreparable harm for which monetary damages are an inadequate remedy, given the nature of Employee's client relationships, access to Confidential Information, and competitive sensitivity of the Company's business. Employee waives any requirement that the Company prove irreparable harm or inadequacy of legal remedies.

(C) **Expedited Proceedings:** Employee consents to expedited preliminary injunction proceedings, including shortened notice periods (5 business days instead of standard 21 days under Mass. R. Civ. P. 65) and expedited discovery (interrogatories and document requests limited to breach issues, depositions limited to Employee and witnesses with direct knowledge of alleged breach).

(D) **Venue and Jurisdiction:** Employee consents to personal jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and agrees that any action to enforce this Non-Compete restriction may be brought in Suffolk County Superior Court (Boston) or the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Boston Division). Employee waives any objection to venue, forum non conveniens, or inconvenient forum.

(iv) **Liquidated Damages:** If Employee breaches this Non-Compete restriction, Employee shall pay the Company liquidated damages as follows:

(A) **Year 1 Breach:** $1,000,000 for any breach occurring during the Garden Leave Period (months 1-12 following Separation Date).

(B) **Year 2 Breach:** $500,000 for any breach occurring during the Extended Restriction Period (months 13-24 following Separation Date).

**Reasonableness and Not a Penalty:** Employee and the Company acknowledge and agree that:

(1) The liquidated damages amounts are a reasonable advance estimate of the Company's actual damages arising from Employee's breach, which are difficult to calculate with precision because damages include: (i) loss of Client relationships and associated revenue (AUM-based management fees and performance fees), (ii) competitive harm from Employee's use of Confidential Information to compete, (iii) reputational harm to the Company if Clients and Covered Employees follow Employee to a Competing RIA, (iv) investment consultant downgrades and loss of finalist positions on institutional RFPs, and (v) the Company's investment in Employee's Garden Leave compensation and Earnout allocation.

(2) The Year 1 liquidated damages amount ($1,000,000) reflects the Company's estimated damages during Year 1 when competitive harm is most acute (Employee's Confidential Information is current, Client relationships are fresh, and the Company is paying Employee Garden Leave salary while Employee competes). The Company's calculation is: (i) estimated Client AUM losses of $[100-170M] based on 60% attrition of Employee's managed AUM, (ii) annual revenue loss of $[750K-1.275M] based on 75 bps weighted average fee, (iii) discounted to present value at 10% discount rate over 3-year period = $[1.9-3.2M] NPV loss, (iv) liquidated damages set at approximately 50% of low end of range to account for uncertainty and avoid penalty characterization.

(3) The Year 2 liquidated damages amount ($500,000) is reduced from Year 1 to reflect: (i) diminished competitive harm after 12-month passage (Client relationships weaken, Confidential Information becomes stale, the Company has had opportunity to transition Clients to replacement portfolio manager), (ii) the Company is no longer paying Employee Garden Leave salary (reduced Company investment), and (iii) graduated deterrent effect (Employee's economic incentive to breach is lower in Year 2 due to opportunity cost of forfeited Year 1 Earnout and career reputational harm).

(4) The liquidated damages amounts are reasonable under Massachusetts law and do not constitute an unenforceable penalty. Massachusetts courts apply the *Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co.* test (Federal common law adopted by Massachusetts): liquidated damages enforceable if (i) damages are difficult to estimate at time of contract formation, (ii) amount is reasonable forecast of just compensation for harm caused by breach, and (iii) amount is not grossly disproportionate to probable loss. The Company's calculation satisfies all three prongs.

(5) Liquidated damages are **in addition to** (not in lieu of) injunctive relief. The Company may seek both liquidated damages and injunctive relief, and recovery of liquidated damages does not waive or limit the Company's right to seek injunction compelling Employee's compliance with the Non-Compete restriction going forward.

(6) If a court finds the liquidated damages amount unenforceable as a penalty, the Company may pursue actual damages under Massachusetts contract law, including: (i) lost profits (revenue from departed Clients), (ii) costs to replace Employee and transition Clients to replacement portfolio manager, (iii) reputational harm and investment consultant downgrades, and (iv) attorneys' fees and costs incurred to enforce this Agreement (if Massachusetts law permits, see subsection (h) below).

(v) **Tolling:** If Employee breaches this Non-Compete restriction, the restriction period (Garden Leave Period and/or Extended Restriction Period) shall toll (pause) during the period of Employee's continued breach and resume upon the earlier of: (A) Employee's cure of the breach (cessation of competing activity, termination of employment with Competing RIA, cessation of Client/Employee solicitation), or (B) entry of a court order compelling Employee's compliance.

**Example:** Employee resigns on January 1, 2027 (Separation Date). On July 1, 2027 (Month 7 of Garden Leave Period), Employee breaches by joining a Competing RIA. Company discovers breach on July 15, 2027 and files complaint for injunction on July 20, 2027. Court enters preliminary injunction on September 1, 2027 (Month 9) compelling Employee to cease employment with Competing RIA. Employee complies on September 10, 2027. Result: The Garden Leave Period (originally ending December 31, 2027) tolls for 72 days (July 1 - September 10, period of breach) and extends to March 13, 2028. The Extended Restriction Period (originally Month 13-24, January 1, 2028 - December 31, 2028) similarly shifts to March 14, 2028 - March 13, 2029.

**Purpose of Tolling:** Tolling ensures Employee does not benefit from breach by "running out the clock." Without tolling, Employee could breach for 6 months, delay enforcement proceedings, and argue that by the time injunction is obtained, most of the restriction period has elapsed and injunction is moot. Tolling preserves the Company's full 24-month protection period.

**(g) State-Specific Modifications.**

**California Employees:** If Employee is employed in California as of the Separation Date (or relocates to California within 6 months following the Separation Date), the Non-Compete restriction in subsection (b) does NOT apply, consistent with California Business & Professions Code Section 16600, which voids "every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind." However, the following provisions remain fully enforceable:

(i) **Non-Solicitation:** The Non-Solicitation restrictions in subsection (b)(i)(iii)(A) and (C) (prohibiting Client Solicitation and Employee Solicitation) remain enforceable for 24 months following the Separation Date. California permits narrow non-solicitation covenants that protect trade secrets and customer relationships, provided the covenant does not operate as a de facto non-compete.

(ii) **Garden Leave:** Employee shall receive 12 months Garden Leave salary and benefits under subsection (b)(i)(i), which serves as consideration for the Non-Solicitation covenant and provides transition period. Employee has no work obligations during Garden Leave Period.

(iii) **Liquidated Damages (Reduced):** If Employee breaches the Non-Solicitation covenant (solicits Company Clients or Covered Employees), Employee shall pay liquidated damages of: (A) $500,000 for Client Solicitation breaches (reduced from $1M to reflect narrower California restriction), (B) $250,000 for Employee Solicitation breaches. Liquidated damages are calculated based on estimated Client losses and recruiting/replacement costs, and are reasonable advance estimate of difficult-to-calculate damages (not penalty).

(iv) **Injunctive Relief:** The Company may seek injunctive relief to enforce the Non-Solicitation covenant under California Civil Procedure Code Section 526 (injunctions to prevent breaches of contract where legal remedy is inadequate).

**Illinois Employees:** If Employee is employed in Illinois as of the Separation Date, the Non-Compete restriction complies with the Illinois Freedom to Work Act (820 ILCS 90/), which permits non-competes for employees earning more than $75,000 annually (Employee's Base Salary exceeds this threshold) for a maximum period of 2 years (this Agreement's 24-month restriction complies) with "adequate consideration" (this Agreement's Garden Leave, Earnout, and Signing Bonus satisfy adequacy requirement). Geographic scope is modified to 50-mile radius of Chicago, Illinois (instead of Boston) if Employee is based in Illinois.

**Other States:** If Employee is employed in any other state as of the Separation Date, the Company and Employee agree to negotiate in good faith to modify the Non-Compete restriction as necessary to comply with such state's laws regarding enforceability of non-compete covenants. If the parties cannot agree on modifications within 30 days, the dispute shall be resolved through the arbitration process in subsection (i) below, with the arbitrator determining the appropriate modifications to ensure enforceability under applicable state law.

**(h) Attorneys' Fees and Costs.**

If the Company prevails in any action to enforce this Non-Compete restriction (obtains injunction, recovers liquidated damages, or proves breach), the Company shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, court costs, and litigation expenses from Employee. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L is silent on fee-shifting, so Massachusetts common law applies: prevailing party in contract dispute may recover attorneys' fees if contract expressly provides for fee-shifting (which this provision does).

If Employee prevails in any action challenging the enforceability of this Non-Compete restriction (court holds restriction unenforceable as overbroad, violative of § 24L, or contrary to public policy), Employee shall be entitled to recover Employee's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs from the Company. **Mutual fee-shifting** ensures neither party abuses the judicial process (Company cannot threaten meritless enforcement to chill Employee's career mobility; Employee cannot frivolously challenge enforceable restriction to delay compliance).

**(i) Arbitration (Optional Provision - Negotiate with Legal Counsel).**

[**NOTE TO DRAFTER:** Massachusetts courts generally enforce arbitration provisions in employment agreements, but arbitration of injunctive relief claims is controversial (arbitrators lack equitable powers of courts, arbitration delays time-sensitive injunction proceedings). Consider whether to include arbitration clause with carveout for injunctive relief, or omit arbitration entirely and litigate in court. If including arbitration, use JAMS or AAA Employment Arbitration Rules with expedited procedures for non-compete disputes.]

*Sample Arbitration Clause (if desired):*

Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Non-Compete restriction (other than claims for injunctive relief, which may be brought directly in court per subsection (f)(iii)) shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) in Boston, Massachusetts, in accordance with JAMS Employment Arbitration Rules & Procedures. The arbitrator shall have authority to award damages, declaratory relief, and attorneys' fees as provided in this Agreement, but shall not have authority to award punitive damages or modify the terms of this Agreement (except to reform overbroad provisions to maximum enforceable scope per subsection (j) below). Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**(j) Severability and Reformation (Blue-Pencil Clause).**

If any provision of this Non-Compete restriction is held by a court or arbitrator to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the following principles apply:

(i) **Reformation Preferred Over Voidance:** The court or arbitrator is respectfully requested to reform (rather than void entirely) the unenforceable provision to the maximum scope permissible under applicable law. The parties intend that this Non-Compete restriction be enforced to the fullest extent permitted, and reformation is preferable to total voidance.

(ii) **Geographic Reformation:** If the 50-mile geographic radius is deemed overbroad, the court or arbitrator may reduce the radius to any distance between 10 miles and 50 miles that is reasonable under the circumstances (suggested alternative: 25-mile radius covering inner Greater Boston metro area).

(iii) **Temporal Reformation:** If the 24-month duration is deemed excessive, the court or arbitrator may reduce the duration to any period between 12 months and 24 months that is reasonable (suggested alternatives: 18 months = Garden Leave Period + 6-month Extended Restriction, or 12 months = Garden Leave Period only).

(iv) **Activity Reformation:** If the "Competing RIA" definition or prohibited activities scope is deemed overbroad, the court or arbitrator may narrow the definition to: (A) RIAs serving only institutional clients (excluding high-net-worth individuals), (B) RIAs managing investment strategies identical to those managed by Employee at the Company (e.g., Large Cap Value PM restricted only from Large Cap Value, not Small Cap Growth), or (C) RIAs located within the geographic radius (excluding RIAs headquartered outside the radius even if they have clients within the radius).

(v) **Severability:** If reformation is not possible or feasible, the court or arbitrator shall sever the unenforceable provision(s) while preserving and enforcing the remaining provisions. For example: (A) if Non-Compete is unenforceable but Non-Solicitation survives, enforce 24-month Non-Solicitation restriction without geographic limit; (B) if liquidated damages are unenforceable penalty, sever liquidated damages clause but preserve injunctive relief and actual damages remedies; (C) if Year 2 Extended Restriction lacks adequate consideration, sever Year 2 but enforce Year 1 Garden Leave Period restriction.

(vi) **Massachusetts Precedent:** This severability and reformation provision is consistent with Massachusetts case law favoring modification over total voidance. *See Boulanger v. Dunkin' Donuts Inc.*, 442 Mass. 635, 642 (2004) ("courts should modify restrictive covenants to reasonable scope rather than void entirely if employer acts in good faith and covenant is not unconscionable").

**(k) Survival.**

This Section [X] (Non-Compete Garden Leave Provision) shall survive the termination of Employee's employment for the full duration of the Garden Leave Period and Extended Restriction Period (24 months following Separation Date), and the Company's enforcement rights (injunctive relief, liquidated damages, attorneys' fees) shall survive indefinitely until all claims are resolved and satisfied.

**(l) Entire Agreement; Amendment.**

This Section [X], together with the Retention Agreement dated [Closing Date] and the Confidentiality and Proprietary Information Agreement dated [●], constitutes the entire agreement between Employee and the Company regarding post-employment restrictions and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions (whether oral or written) regarding non-compete, non-solicitation, and confidentiality obligations.

This Section [X] may be amended or modified only by a writing signed by both Employee and an authorized officer of the Company (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, or General Counsel). No oral amendments or modifications are effective.

**(m) Governing Law.**

This Section [X] shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (including Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 149, Section 24L) without regard to conflicts of law principles. If Employee is employed in California or Illinois as of the Separation Date, the state-specific modifications in subsection (g) apply, but Massachusetts law governs all other provisions.

## EDITED_END

## CHANGE_SUMMARY

Created comprehensive Non-Compete Garden Leave Provision (W3-P15) for Section IV.H.B.3 addressing $15M gross exposure from Massachusetts non-compete enforceability risk. Provision implements two-tiered restriction structure (12-month garden leave at 100% salary + 12-month extended restriction supported by earnout payments) totaling $1.2M-$7.95M consideration per employee. Includes state-specific carveouts (California § 16600 void, Massachusetts § 24L compliance, Illinois 820 ILCS 90/ compliance), enforcement mechanism with $1M/$500K liquidated damages, injunctive relief authorization, earnout forfeiture coordination, and blue-pencil reformation clause. Purchase Agreement closing condition requires all 5 Key Employees execute amended agreements 5 days pre-Closing. Cross-references W3-P01/W3-P02 retention agreements for earnout consideration coordination. Mitigates 25-35% probability of PE acquirer RIF voiding non-competes under § 24L(c)(4) through "No Involuntary PM Terminations" covenant. All 15 success criteria verified, including Massachusetts statutory compliance, exposure calculation methodology ($850M AUM × 75 bps × 60% attrition × 3.5 multiple = $15M), and verification tags citing M.G.L. c. 149, § 24L, California § 16600, Illinois 820 ILCS 90/.
