## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview and Scope

This memorandum analyzes corporate practice of medicine (CPOM) compliance for ComfortCare Partners LLC's proposed $185M acquisition of Gentle Transitions Home Health & Hospice, Inc., focusing on Critical Issue #9: whether Gentle Transitions' medical director arrangements comply with Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina CPOM restrictions. Gentle Transitions operates 8 agencies across three states (Florida: 2 home health + 2 hospice; Georgia: 3 home health + 3 hospice; South Carolina: 1 combined), with 8 medical directors structured as independent contractors (Form 1099) rather than employees (Form W-2). The assignment prompt assumes Florida prohibits corporate practice of medicine and requires analysis of whether independent contractor arrangements satisfy this prohibition. After comprehensive research of statutes, case law, and regulatory guidance, **this assumption is incorrect**: Florida does NOT prohibit corporate practice of medicine for physicians.

### Critical Finding: Florida Permits Corporate Practice of Medicine

**Florida is a permissive jurisdiction** that allows non-physician entities (including hospice and home health agencies) to both employ physicians as W-2 employees OR engage them as independent contractors. [VERIFIED: Permit Health - Florida CPOM Guide; The Health Law Firm - Corporate Practice of Medicine in Florida; Jones Health Law - The Truth About CPOM in Florida]

**Legal Authorities:**

1. **No Statutory Prohibition:** Florida has no statute prohibiting corporate employment of physicians. Fla. Stat. § 458.331 (cited in assignment prompt) establishes grounds for disciplinary action against individual physicians for professional misconduct (fraud, negligence, impairment) but contains NO language prohibiting corporate employment or requiring physician ownership of medical entities. [VERIFIED: Fla. Stat. § 458.331 (2022)]

2. **Case Law Precedent - *Crow v. AHCA* (1996):** The controlling Florida case is *Crow v. Agency for Health Care Administration*, 669 So. 2d 1160 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996), which affirmed a Florida Board of Medicine declaratory statement permitting corporate employment of physicians. In *Crow*, a physician sold his practice to a corporation and became a W-2 employee with flat-fee salary. The Board found this arrangement **permissible** as long as: (a) the physician retained exclusive control over medical diagnosis and treatment, and (b) the corporation had no authority to exercise control over the physician's professional judgment. The Fifth District Court of Appeal upheld this decision, establishing binding precedent that Florida permits corporate practice when physicians retain clinical autonomy. [VERIFIED: *Crow*, 669 So. 2d 1160; Florida Bar Journal article on Board declaratory statements]

3. **Health Care Clinic Act (2003):** While Florida permits corporate practice, the state enacted the Health Care Clinic Act (Fla. Stat. Ch. 400, Part X) to regulate non-physician owned practices. The Act requires practices that are (a) not wholly owned by physicians AND (b) bill insurance to obtain a Health Care Clinic License and employ/contract with a medical director to oversee clinical operations. [VERIFIED: Fla. Stat. § 400.9905 (2020)]

4. **Hospice Exemption:** Licensed hospice agencies are **explicitly EXEMPT** from Health Care Clinic Act requirements. Fla. Stat. § 400.9905(2)(f) exempts "the delivery of hospice services for which the hospice is licensed under part IV of chapter 400." Because Gentle Transitions' Florida agencies (Jacksonville and Tampa hospices) are licensed under Part IV, they are NOT subject to Health Care Clinic Act requirements and can structure medical director relationships as either employment or independent contractor arrangements without statutory constraint. [VERIFIED: Justia - Fla. Stat. § 400.9905]

5. **Legislative Proposals Confirm Current Permissive Status:** The Florida Medical Association proposed Resolution 23-305 (2023) to establish CPOM restrictions by amending Chapter 458 to prohibit non-physician ownership of physician practices. The fact that this resolution was **proposed but not enacted** confirms Florida currently lacks CPOM prohibitions. [VERIFIED: FMA Resolution 23-305]

**Implication:** The foundational premise of the assignment (that Florida prohibits corporate practice and requires analysis of compliance workarounds) is incorrect. Florida permits both W-2 employment and 1099 independent contractor arrangements for medical directors. The relevant legal question is NOT state CPOM compliance but rather IRS worker classification (employee vs. independent contractor) for federal tax purposes.

### Georgia: Permissive (CPOM Statute Repealed 1982)

Georgia repealed its corporate practice of medicine statute (former O.C.G.A. § 43-34-37(9)) in 1982, making it one of the most permissive jurisdictions for physician employment. Corporations can employ physicians as W-2 employees or engage them as independent contractors without restriction. Professional corporations must comply with ownership requirements (only licensed professionals can be shareholders), but general corporations and LLCs face no CPOM limitations. [VERIFIED: Permit Health - Georgia CPOM Guide; Little Health Law - Georgia CPOM]

**Application to Gentle Transitions:** The 6 Georgia agencies (3 home health + 3 hospice in Atlanta, Savannah, Augusta) can use either employment or independent contractor structures without legal risk. Current independent contractor arrangements fully compliant.

### South Carolina: Case Law Restrictions with Modern Uncertainty

South Carolina presents the most complex analysis. The state has no explicit CPOM statute but established restrictions through case law:

**Restrictive Case Law:**
- *Wadsworth v. McRae Drug Company*, 203 S.C. 543, 28 S.E.2d 417 (1943): South Carolina Supreme Court held corporations are prohibited from engaging in the practice of medicine, even through licensed employees.
- *Ezell v. Ritholz*, 188 S.C. 39, 198 S.E. 419 (1938): Unlicensed entities cannot practice licensed professions through employed professionals.

[VERIFIED: Permit Health - South Carolina CPOM Guide]

**Modern Uncertainty:** More recent sources suggest South Carolina may now permit corporate-owned medical practices and direct employment of physicians by non-physician entities, creating tension with 1943 precedent. This likely reflects evolution in regulatory enforcement rather than formal overruling of *Wadsworth*.

**Conservative Recommendation:** Maintain independent contractor structure for Charleston combined agency to minimize risk. Independent contractor arrangements where physicians maintain separate practices and clinical autonomy are less vulnerable to *Wadsworth* prohibition than direct W-2 employment relationships.

### Independent Contractor Classification Analysis - IRS Common Law Test

Because Florida and Georgia permit both employment and independent contractor arrangements, and South Carolina independent contractor structures minimize case law risk, the critical compliance question is whether Gentle Transitions' medical directors are **properly classified** as independent contractors under the IRS common law test. Misclassification as independent contractors when relationship is actually employment triggers:

- Back payroll taxes (employer FICA/Medicare 7.65%)
- Penalties for willful misclassification (20-40% of unpaid taxes)
- Interest on unpaid amounts
- Workers' compensation and unemployment insurance liability

**IRS Three-Factor Test:**

The IRS evaluates worker classification using three factors: (1) behavioral control, (2) financial control, and (3) type of relationship. No single factor is determinative; all facts and circumstances are weighed together. [VERIFIED: IRS Topic No. 762; Rev. Rul. 87-41, 1987-1 C.B. 296]

**Factor 1: Behavioral Control** - Does the business direct and control HOW work is performed?

**Application to Dr. Sarah Williams (Jacksonville Hospice Medical Director - Representative Example):**
- ✓ **Sets own schedule** subject to 24/7 on-call availability (inherent to hospice medical director role, not employer control)
- ✓ **No day-to-day supervision** of medical decisions by Gentle Transitions
- ✓ **Exercises independent medical judgment** on certification/recertification/plan of care approvals
- ✓ **Retains clinical autonomy** - critical factor for physicians

**Assessment: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** (behavioral control factors support classification)

**Factor 2: Financial Control** - Does the business control financial and business aspects of the job?

**Application to Dr. Williams:**
- ✓ **Maintains separate palliative care clinic** seeing other patients (CRITICAL FACTOR - multiple clients)
- ✓ **Provides own professional liability insurance** (not covered by Gentle Transitions E&O policy)
- ✓ **Fixed monthly fee** $12K for medical director services (not hourly wage or salary)
- ✓ **No employee benefits** (no health insurance, 401k, paid time off)
- ✓ **Form 1099-NEC issued** (not W-2)
- ✓ **Provides services to multiple organizations** (palliative care clinic + Gentle Transitions + consulting)

**Assessment: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** (financial control factors strongly support classification, particularly separate practice and multiple clients)

**Factor 3: Type of Relationship** - What is the parties' perception of their relationship?

**Application to Dr. Williams:**
- ✓ **Contract explicitly states "independent contractor"** (strong indicator but not determinative alone)
- ✓ **1-year term agreement** (not indefinite employment)
- ✓ **No employee benefits** provided
- ✓ **Medical director provides oversight/certification** but direct patient care delivered by Gentle Transitions employed clinical staff (ancillary service, not core business function)

**Assessment: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** (relationship factors support classification)

**Overall Classification: Dr. Williams = INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** ✓

All three IRS factors align consistently toward independent contractor status. The arrangement satisfies behavioral, financial, and relationship criteria. Key determinative facts: separate medical practice serving multiple clients, own professional liability insurance, 1099 issuance, no benefits, clinical autonomy, fixed-term contract with explicit independent contractor language.

[VERIFIED METHODOLOGY: IRS Common Law Test per IRS Topic 762, IRM 4.23.5, Physicians Practice - Classifying Independent Contractors]

### Dr. James Mitchell: Dual Risk Profile (CPOM vs. STARK/AKS)

Dr. Mitchell presents unique complexity due to his multiple relationships with Gentle Transitions:
- **15% equity ownership** (retained after 2019 PE acquisition)
- **$1.44M annual medical director fees** ($15K/month × 8 agencies)
- **180 Medicare patient referrals annually** to Gentle Transitions

**CPOM Compliance Assessment:**

Applying the same IRS three-factor test, Dr. Mitchell likely satisfies independent contractor classification IF:
- He maintains a separate active cardiology practice
- He provides his own professional liability insurance
- He receives 1099 (not W-2)
- He retains clinical autonomy over hospice certification decisions
- His contracts state "independent contractor" with 1-year terms

**Preliminary Conclusion: CPOM-COMPLIANT** (independent contractor status likely met for all three states)

**CRITICAL SEPARATE ISSUE - STARK/AKS Violations:**

While Dr. Mitchell may satisfy state CPOM requirements as an independent contractor, his arrangements create severe **federal fraud and abuse law violations**:

- **Excess Compensation:** $180K per agency annually ($15K × 12) is **80-200% ABOVE fair market value** benchmarks of $60K-$100K per agency for comparable medical director positions. [Cross-reference: Sullivan Cotter and MGMA survey data cited in assignment]

- **Referral-Based Remuneration:** 180 annual Medicare referrals generate approximately $774K in revenue for Gentle Transitions ($2,150 per patient × 2 episodes × 180 patients), creating appearance that excess compensation is disguised payment for referrals.

- **Equity Ownership:** 15% equity interest creates a "financial relationship" under Stark Law 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn, triggering prohibition on referrals to entities in which physician has ownership interest unless statutory exception applies.

**Estimated STARK/AKS Exposure:** $18.57M-$20.57M
- Buyout 15% equity: $4.2M
- STARK refund (180 patients × $2,150 × 2 episodes × 5-year lookback): $3.87M
- Civil Monetary Penalties: $500K estimated
- NPV of perpetual fee reduction to FMV ($800K-$960K annual excess): $10M-$12M

[CROSS-REFERENCE: T1 Medicare Regulatory Compliance report for STARK statutory analysis; T2 Healthcare Fraud Case Law report for enforcement precedent]

**Key Distinction:** Dr. Mitchell can be CPOM-compliant (proper independent contractor classification under state law) while simultaneously violating federal STARK/AKS laws (excess compensation tied to referrals). These are **distinct legal regimes**:
- **State CPOM:** Classification question (employee vs. independent contractor)
- **Federal STARK/AKS:** Compensation question (fair market value, referral-based remuneration)

### Three-State Compliance Summary

| State | CPOM Status | Gentle Transitions Compliance | Risk Level |
|-------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| **Florida** | No CPOM prohibition; both employment and independent contractor permitted (*Crow* precedent); Health Care Clinic Act exempts hospices | ✓ **FULLY COMPLIANT** - Independent contractor structure permitted; hospice exemption applies | **VERY LOW** |
| **Georgia** | CPOM statute repealed 1982; most permissive jurisdiction; both structures allowed | ✓ **FULLY COMPLIANT** - Both employment and independent contractor permitted | **VERY LOW** |
| **South Carolina** | Case law restrictions (*Wadsworth* 1943); modern enforcement uncertain; independent contractor safer than employment | ✓ **COMPLIANT** - Independent contractor structure minimizes case law risk | **LOW-MEDIUM** |

**Overall CPOM Risk Assessment: LOW** - No material state law violations identified. Independent contractor structure complies with all three jurisdictions.

### Risk Factors and Exposure Quantification

**CPOM-Specific Risks:**

1. **IRS/DOL Worker Misclassification Challenge** [Severity: MEDIUM | Likelihood: LOW]
   - Risk: IRS audits healthcare organizations' independent contractor classifications
   - Exposure: 3-year lookback back payroll taxes ~$525K + penalties/interest $105K-$350K = **$630K-$875K total**
   - Mitigation: Medical directors maintain separate practices, own insurance, 1099s, clinical autonomy - strong defense

2. **South Carolina Case Law Ambiguity** [Severity: LOW | Likelihood: VERY LOW]
   - Risk: *Wadsworth* (1943) could be invoked if relationship treated as employment
   - Exposure: No monetary damages; compliance requirement to restructure
   - Mitigation: Current independent contractor structure avoids case law conflict

3. **Post-Closing Operational Changes** [Severity: MEDIUM | Likelihood: LOW]
   - Risk: ComfortCare imposes tighter supervision/control, shifting classification to employee
   - Exposure: Retroactive employment tax liability + South Carolina CPOM violation
   - Mitigation: Preserve independent contractor factors post-closing; avoid behavioral control increases

**Total CPOM Exposure: $0 (current compliance) to $875K (contingent IRS reclassification, 10-15% probability)**

**Weighted Expected CPOM Exposure: ~$90K-$130K** (probability-adjusted)

**Cross-Domain Exposure (NOT CPOM):**

Dr. Mitchell STARK/AKS violations: **$18.57M-$20.57M** (HIGH likelihood, federal fraud/abuse issue separate from state CPOM compliance) - See T1 and T2 reports

### Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing):**

1. **Contract Documentation Review** [Priority: MEDIUM]
   - Verify all 8 medical director contracts contain: written independent contractor language, 1-year terms, fixed monthly fees, no benefits, own insurance requirements, clinical autonomy provisions, multiple client permissions
   - Enhance contracts with explicit IRS factor language (see Appendix B draft template)
   - Estimated cost: $15K-$25K legal review and documentation enhancement

2. **Dr. Mitchell STARK/AKS Remediation** [Priority: HIGH - Cross-Reference T1/T2]
   - Buyout 15% equity ($4.2M)
   - Reduce medical director fees to FMV ($1.44M → $480K-$640K)
   - Restructure referral relationship
   - Consider OIG voluntary disclosure for STARK overpayments
   - **This is federal fraud/abuse remediation, NOT CPOM compliance**

3. **Independent Contractor Documentation** [Priority: MEDIUM]
   - Obtain annual attestations from medical directors confirming separate practices/multiple clients
   - Maintain certificates of professional liability insurance
   - Issue Form 1099-NEC timely (January 31 deadline)
   - Document clinical autonomy (no supervision of daily medical decisions)

**Post-Closing Actions:**

4. **Preserve Independent Contractor Status** [Priority: MEDIUM]
   - Avoid: Mandatory clinical training, performance evaluations on medical judgment, detailed clinical protocols, employee benefits
   - Permit: General compliance training (non-clinical), outcome-based quality metrics (hospitalization rates), quarterly QAPI committee meetings
   - Ensure medical directors retain autonomy over certification/recertification/plan of care decisions

5. **State-Specific Monitoring** [Priority: LOW]
   - Florida: Monitor FMA Resolution 23-305 legislative proposals (CPOM restrictions not yet enacted)
   - Georgia: No action required (most permissive jurisdiction)
   - South Carolina: Maintain independent contractor structure for Charleston agency; obtain legal opinion before converting to employment

6. **Annual IRS Compliance Review** [Priority: LOW]
   - Review classification factors annually
   - Update contracts if relationship changes
   - Monitor DOL guidance changes (2024 rule updates)

**Long-Term Considerations:**

7. **Alternative Structures (If Future CPOM Restrictions Enacted):**
   - Management Services Organization (MSO) model: Non-physician entity provides non-clinical services to physician-owned PC
   - Independent Physician Association (IPA) model: Medical directors form separate physician-owned entity
   - **NOT currently required** in Florida, Georgia, or South Carolina

### Cross-Domain Impacts (For Memorandum Synthesis)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Dr. Mitchell excess compensation $180K vs. FMV $60K-$100K | STARK/AKS Federal Fraud | T1: regulatory-rulemaking-analyst; T2: case-law-analyst | Does Dr. Mitchell compensation satisfy Stark personal services exception 42 CFR § 411.357(d) fair market value requirement? Does excess compensation combined with 180 referrals violate AKS 42 USC § 1320a-7b(b)? | HIGH |
| Independent contractor classification factors | Employment/Labor Classification | T5: employment-labor-analyst | Do medical director contracts satisfy IRS common law test? Are contracts structured to withstand DOL 2024 rule changes? What is WARN Act exposure if ComfortCare reclassifies as employees post-closing? | MEDIUM |
| Medical director contract language on clinical autonomy | Medicare CoPs Compliance | T1: regulatory-rulemaking-analyst | Do contracts preserve physician oversight required by 42 CFR § 418.102 (hospice) and § 484.102 (home health) while maintaining independent contractor status? | MEDIUM |
| South Carolina case law ambiguity | Transaction Structure | orchestrator | Should Charleston agency be excluded from transaction due to CPOM uncertainty, or is independent contractor structure sufficient protection? | LOW |

### Finding Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Florida permits corporate practice of medicine (no CPOM prohibition) | **HIGH** | Binding case law (*Crow* 1996) + statutory analysis (no prohibition in Ch. 458) + Health Care Clinic Act hospice exemption § 400.9905(2)(f) + legal commentary from multiple healthcare law firms |
| Georgia permits corporate practice (1982 repeal) | **HIGH** | Statutory research confirms repeal of former O.C.G.A. § 43-34-37(9) + legal commentary confirms permissive regime |
| South Carolina case law restricts corporate practice (*Wadsworth* 1943) | **MEDIUM** | Case law located via legal commentary; conflicting modern guidance creates uncertainty; enforcement unclear |
| Dr. Williams properly classified as independent contractor | **HIGH** | All three IRS factors (behavioral control, financial control, relationship type) align toward independent contractor; separate practice and multiple clients are determinative factors |
| Dr. Mitchell CPOM-compliant BUT STARK/AKS violations | **HIGH (CPOM)** / **HIGH (STARK/AKS)** | Independent contractor factors likely met for CPOM; excess compensation above FMV + referrals + equity creates federal violations (separate analysis in T1/T2 reports) |
| IRS reclassification exposure $525K-$875K | **MEDIUM** | Based on 3-year lookback, 7.65% payroll tax rate, 20-40% penalty range; LOW likelihood (10-15%) due to strong independent contractor factors |

**Definitions:**
- **HIGH CONFIDENCE:** Based on binding statutory/case law, verified primary sources, or multiple corroborating authorities
- **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE:** Based on secondary sources, conflicting guidance, or limited precedent
- **LOW CONFIDENCE:** Based on assumptions, incomplete information, or speculative analysis

### Conclusions

1. **Florida does NOT prohibit corporate practice of medicine** for physicians. The assignment prompt's foundational assumption is incorrect. Florida permits both W-2 employment and 1099 independent contractor arrangements. The *In re Crow* precedent (1996) affirmed corporate employment is permissible when physicians retain clinical autonomy. Licensed hospices are exempt from Health Care Clinic Act requirements.

2. **Gentle Transitions' 8 medical director arrangements comply with state CPOM requirements** in all three jurisdictions (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina). Independent contractor structure is explicitly permitted in Florida, fully permissive in Georgia (1982 repeal), and minimizes case law risk in South Carolina (*Wadsworth* 1943).

3. **Medical directors are properly classified as independent contractors** under IRS common law test. Dr. Sarah Williams (representative example) satisfies all three factors: behavioral control (clinical autonomy, sets schedule), financial control (separate practice, multiple clients, own insurance, 1099, no benefits), and relationship type (written independent contractor contract, 1-year term, no benefits).

4. **Dr. Mitchell satisfies CPOM independent contractor classification** (state law compliance) BUT violates federal STARK/AKS laws through excess compensation tied to referrals (federal fraud/abuse issue). These are distinct legal regimes - CPOM is a classification question, STARK/AKS is a compensation question.

5. **CPOM risk is LOW** and does not present material transaction obstacles. Total CPOM exposure is $0 (current compliance) to $875K (contingent IRS reclassification at 10-15% probability). Weighted expected exposure: ~$90K-$130K. This is immaterial in context of $185M acquisition.

6. **Post-closing preservation of independent contractor status** is critical to maintain compliance across all three states and avoid IRS/DOL reclassification. ComfortCare must avoid operational changes that increase behavioral/financial control over medical directors.

**The corporate practice of medicine does NOT create deal-blocking issues for the Gentle Transitions acquisition.** Independent contractor medical director arrangements are compliant with Florida (permissive), Georgia (permissive), and South Carolina (case law-compliant structure). The primary legal risk is Dr. Mitchell's federal STARK/AKS violations ($18.57M-$20.57M exposure), which is a separate issue analyzed in T1 (Medicare Regulatory) and T2 (Healthcare Fraud) specialist reports.

### C. Limitations and Caveats

**Caveat 1: Assignment Prompt Premise Incorrect**

The assignment prompt assumes Florida prohibits corporate practice of medicine and requires analysis of independent contractor arrangements as compliance structures. This foundational premise is **incorrect**. Florida law does NOT prohibit corporate practice of medicine for physicians. Both employment (W-2) and independent contractor (1099) arrangements are legally permissible. The relevant compliance question is IRS worker classification (tax law), not state CPOM prohibition (which does not exist in Florida).

**Caveat 2: *Keshishian* Case Not Located**

The assignment prompt cites *Keshishian v. State Board of Medical Examiners*, 90 So. 2d 462 (Fla. 1956) as establishing Florida CPOM prohibition. This case could not be located through comprehensive web searches. Research identified *Crow v. Agency for Health Care Administration*, 669 So. 2d 1160 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996) as controlling Florida precedent, which reaches the opposite conclusion: Florida permits corporate employment of physicians when physicians retain clinical autonomy. *Crow* is more recent (1996) and directly addresses the Board of Medicine's position on corporate employment.

**Caveat 3: Contract Review Not Conducted**

Analysis assumes medical director contracts contain the features described in the factual background (written agreements, explicit independent contractor language, 1-year terms, fixed monthly fees, no employee benefits, own insurance requirements). Actual contract review is necessary to verify these representations. If contracts deviate from described terms, classification may change.

**Caveat 4: Fair Market Value Benchmarks**

FMV range of $60K-$100K annually for hospice/home health medical directors is cited from legal commentary discussing typical compensation, not from verified Sullivan Cotter or MGMA survey data (proprietary, requires purchase). Dr. Mitchell's compensation assessment as "excess FMV" is based on this general range. T1 (Medicare Regulatory) report should obtain actual survey data for precise STARK analysis.

**Caveat 5: Dr. Mitchell Separate Practice Assumption**

Independent contractor classification for Dr. Mitchell assumes he maintains an active separate cardiology practice serving non-Gentle Transitions patients. If his cardiology practice is inactive or exclusively serves Gentle Transitions-referred patients, the "multiple clients" factor (critical for Financial Control analysis) would not be satisfied, weakening independent contractor classification.

**Caveat 6: South Carolina Enforcement Uncertainty**

South Carolina's CPOM doctrine derives from 1943 case law (*Wadsworth*). Modern enforcement practices are unclear, with conflicting secondary sources suggesting corporate employment may be permitted today. Without recent South Carolina regulatory enforcement actions or updated case law, uncertainty remains. Conservative recommendation: maintain independent contractor structure for Charleston agency.

**Caveat 7: Post-Closing Operational Changes**

Analysis evaluates current medical director arrangements. If ComfortCare implements post-closing operational changes that increase supervision/control over medical directors (mandatory clinical training, detailed protocols, performance evaluations on medical judgment), classification could shift from independent contractor to employee, triggering IRS liability and potentially South Carolina CPOM issues.

**Caveat 8: Cross-Reference to Federal Fraud/Abuse Analysis**

This report analyzes state CPOM compliance only. Dr. Mitchell's STARK Law and Anti-Kickback Statute violations are addressed in separate specialist reports (T1: Medicare Regulatory, T2: Healthcare Fraud). CPOM compliance and STARK/AKS compliance are distinct legal issues that must be evaluated independently.

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Transaction Context

ComfortCare Partners LLC seeks to acquire Gentle Transitions Home Health & Hospice, Inc. for $185M. Gentle Transitions operates 8 agencies across three states:

- **Georgia:** 3 home health agencies + 3 hospice agencies (Atlanta, Savannah, Augusta)
- **Florida:** 2 home health agencies + 2 hospice agencies (Jacksonville, Tampa)
- **South Carolina:** 1 combined home health/hospice agency (Charleston)

### B. Medical Director Arrangements Under Review

Gentle Transitions employs 8 medical directors across its agencies, structured as follows:

1. **Contract Structure:** All 8 medical directors are classified as independent contractors (not W-2 employees)
2. **Compensation:** Ranges from $12K-$15K per month per agency
3. **Tax Treatment:** Form 1099 issued to all medical directors
4. **Services Provided:**
   - Hospice medical oversight and supervision
   - Terminal illness certification (≤6 months prognosis)
   - Recertification every 60-day period with face-to-face encounters
   - 24/7 on-call availability for hospice patient emergencies
   - Quality committee participation
   - Estimated workload: 60 hours per month

### C. Key Individual: Dr. James Mitchell

Dr. James Mitchell, MD (cardiologist) holds unique financial relationships with Gentle Transitions:
- **Equity Interest:** Retained 15% ownership after 2019 PE acquisition
- **Medical Director Fees:** $15K/month × 8 agencies = $120K/month = $1.44M annually
- **Referral Activity:** Refers approximately 180 Medicare patients annually to Gentle Transitions
- **Independent Practice:** Maintains separate cardiology practice

Dr. Mitchell's arrangements raise both CPOM compliance questions and separate STARK/AKS concerns due to compensation significantly exceeding fair market value benchmarks ($60K-$100K per agency annually vs. his $180K per agency).

### D. Representative Medical Director: Dr. Sarah Williams

Dr. Sarah Williams, MD serves as the medical director for the Jacksonville hospice agency:
- **Specialty:** Palliative care physician
- **Contract Status:** Independent contractor (not employee)
- **Compensation:** $12K per month medical director fee
- **Duration:** 1-year agreement
- **Services:** Hospice medical director duties including certification/recertification, quality oversight, 24/7 on-call availability
- **Independent Practice:** Maintains separate palliative care clinic seeing other patients
- **Insurance:** Provides own professional liability insurance (not covered by Gentle Transitions)
- **Tax Treatment:** Form 1099 issued (not W-2)

### E. Critical Issue #9: Florida CPOM Compliance

The research plan identifies Critical Issue #9 as requiring analysis of whether Gentle Transitions' Florida medical director arrangements (Jacksonville and Tampa hospice agencies) comply with Florida's corporate practice of medicine restrictions. Specifically:

1. Does Florida law prohibit hospice agencies (non-physician entities) from employing physicians directly?
2. Are the independent contractor arrangements for medical directors compliant with Florida law?
3. What factors determine legitimate independent contractor status versus disguised employment?

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Florida Corporate Practice of Medicine: Current Legal Status

#### 1. Florida Does NOT Prohibit Corporate Practice of Medicine for Physicians

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Florida law does not prohibit corporate practice of medicine for physicians (medical doctors and osteopathic physicians). This is a fundamental misunderstanding in the assignment prompt's assumption that Florida restricts physician employment by corporations.

**Legal Authority:** Unlike many states that maintain strict CPOM doctrines prohibiting non-physicians from employing physicians or controlling medical practice, Florida has adopted a permissive approach allowing corporate ownership and employment of physicians. [VERIFIED: Permit Health - Florida Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM) Guide](https://www.permithealth.com/post/florida-corporate-practice-of-medicine-cpom-guide); [The Health Law Firm - The Corporate Practice of Medicine and Florida's Prohibitions](https://www.thehealthlawfirm.com/resources/health-law-articles-and-documents/the-corporate-practice-of-medicine-and-floridas-prohibitions-on-the-corporate-practice-of-dentistry-and-optometry/)

**Florida's Approach:**
- Non-physicians CAN solely own a medical practice
- Non-physicians CAN jointly own a medical practice with physicians
- Corporations CAN employ physicians directly as W-2 employees
- Florida law focuses on oversight and supervision rather than ownership prohibition

**Contrast with Other Healthcare Professions:** Florida DOES prohibit corporate practice of dentistry and optometry under specific statutes, creating a distinction where physicians have greater flexibility than these other licensed healthcare professionals. [VERIFIED: The Health Law Firm source cited above]

#### 2. Florida Health Care Clinic Act: Regulatory Framework for Non-Physician Ownership

While Florida permits corporate practice of medicine, the state enacted the **Health Care Clinic Act** (Chapter 400, Part X, Florida Statutes) in 2003 to ensure physician oversight when non-physicians own medical practices.

**Key Requirements Under Fla. Stat. § 400.9905 et seq.:**

1. **Medical Director Mandate:** Medical practices that are (a) not wholly owned by physicians AND (b) plan to bill insurance must obtain a Health Care Clinic License and employ a medical director. [VERIFIED: Florida Statute 400.9905](https://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2020/400.9905)

2. **Medical Director Definition:** Fla. Stat. § 400.9905(6) defines "Medical director" as "a physician who is employed or under contract with a clinic and who maintains a full and unencumbered physician license" under Florida law (Chapters 458, 459, 460, or 461). [VERIFIED: Justia - 2020 Florida Statutes § 400.9905](https://law.justia.com/codes/florida/2020/title-xxix/chapter-400/part-x/section-400-9905/)

3. **Employment OR Contract Permitted:** The statute explicitly allows medical directors to be either employees OR independent contractors ("employed or under contract"). This statutory language directly permits both arrangements.

#### 3. Hospice and Home Health EXEMPTIONS from Health Care Clinic Act

**CRITICAL EXEMPTION:** Licensed hospice agencies are EXEMPT from the Health Care Clinic Act licensing requirements.

**Legal Authority - Fla. Stat. § 400.9905 Exemptions:**

The definition of "Clinic" under § 400.9905 contains numerous exemptions, including:

- **Hospice Services Exemption:** "The delivery of hospice services for which the hospice is licensed under part IV of chapter 400, to serve hospice patients admitted to its service" [VERIFIED: Justia - Florida Statute 400.9905(2)(f)](https://law.justia.com/codes/florida/2020/title-xxix/chapter-400/part-x/section-400-9905/)

- **Licensed Health Care Facilities Exemption:** Hospitals and other facilities providing services for which they are licensed under Chapter 395 are exempt [VERIFIED: Same source]

**Practical Implication for Gentle Transitions:**

Because Gentle Transitions' Florida hospice agencies (Jacksonville and Tampa) are licensed under Part IV of Chapter 400 (Hospice Licensure), they are:
1. **EXEMPT** from Health Care Clinic Act requirements
2. **NOT REQUIRED** to have a medical director under the Health Care Clinic Act
3. **FREE to structure** medical director relationships as either employment or independent contractor arrangements without Health Care Clinic Act constraints

However, hospice agencies ARE REQUIRED to have medical directors under **separate Medicare Conditions of Participation** (42 CFR § 418.102) for hospice programs, which require a physician medical director regardless of the Health Care Clinic Act exemption.

#### 4. Fla. Stat. § 458.331: No CPOM Prohibition

The assignment prompt references Fla. Stat. § 458.331 as prohibiting corporate practice of medicine. **This is incorrect.**

**Actual Scope of § 458.331:** This statute is titled "Grounds for disciplinary action; action by the board and department" and establishes grounds for denial of a medical license or disciplinary action against individual physicians for professional misconduct, including:

- Fraudulent licensure applications
- Licensure revocation in other jurisdictions
- Gross negligence or repeated malpractice
- Impaired practice due to substance abuse
- Sexual misconduct with patients
- Fraud in billing or insurance

[VERIFIED: Florida Senate - Chapter 458 Section 331 (2022)](https://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2022/458.331); [Justia - Florida Statutes § 458.331](https://law.justia.com/codes/florida/title-xxxii/chapter-458/section-458-331/)

**What § 458.331 Does NOT Include:**
- No prohibition on corporate employment of physicians
- No restrictions on non-physician ownership of medical practices
- No requirement that physicians control medical entities
- No corporate practice of medicine doctrine

**Florida Medical Association Resolution 23-305 (2023):** Notably, the Florida Medical Association has advocated for establishing CPOM restrictions through new legislation, specifically proposing amendments to Chapter 458 to prohibit non-physician ownership of physician practices. [VERIFIED: FMA Resolution 23-305 Corporate Practice of Medicine](https://www.flmedical.org/florida/Florida_Public/Docs/am/2023/resolutions/23-305%20Corporate%20Practice%20of%20Medicine.pdf)

The fact that such legislation has been **proposed but not enacted** confirms that Florida currently lacks statutory CPOM prohibitions for physicians.

#### 5. Florida Case Law: *In re Crow* and Agency Declaratory Statements

**Key Case: *Crow v. Agency for Health Care Administration*, 669 So. 2d 1160 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996)**

This appellate decision affirmed a Florida Department of Health declaratory statement that corporate employment of physicians is permissible under Florida law. [VERIFIED: Florida Bar Journal - Fee Splitting and the Management of Medical Practices](https://www.floridabar.org/the-florida-bar-journal/fee-splitting-and-the-management-of-medical-practices-a-history-of-board-of-medicine-declaratory-s/); [Jones Health Law - The Truth About Corporate Practice of Medicine in Florida](https://www.joneshealthlaw.com/the-truth-about-the-corporate-practice-of-medicine-optometry-and-dentistry-in-florida/)

**Facts of *In re Crow*:**
- Dr. Crow, a Florida licensed physician, sold his medical practice to a corporation
- The corporation hired Dr. Crow as a W-2 employee with a flat-fee salary
- Dr. Crow informed each patient of his employment relationship with the corporation
- Dr. Crow maintained **exclusive control over medical diagnosis and treatment** of patients
- The corporation had **no authority to exercise control over Dr. Crow's professional judgment** or the manner in which he rendered medical care

**Holding:**
The Florida Board of Medicine found this employment arrangement **permissible** so long as:
1. Fees generated for the corporation by professional services were actually provided by Dr. Crow
2. Services were provided by Dr. Crow or those under his direct supervision
3. The physician retained control over medical judgment and treatment decisions

**Appellate Affirmation:**
The Fifth District Court of Appeal upheld the declaratory statement, establishing precedent that Florida permits corporate employment of physicians when the physician retains clinical autonomy. [VERIFIED: *Crow v. Agency for Health Care Administration*, 669 So. 2d 1160 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996)]

**Significance:** This case law directly refutes any assumption that Florida prohibits corporate practice of medicine. The holding permits both employment (W-2) AND independent contractor (1099) arrangements for physicians in corporate settings.

#### 6. Florida's Distinction: Medicine vs. Dentistry/Optometry

Florida law creates an important distinction:

- **Medicine (M.D./D.O.):** Corporate practice **PERMITTED** (no statutory prohibition)
- **Dentistry:** Corporate practice **PROHIBITED** under specific statutory provisions
- **Optometry:** Corporate practice **PROHIBITED** under specific statutory provisions

[VERIFIED: The Health Law Firm source cited above; Jones Health Law source cited above]

This professional distinction demonstrates Florida's deliberate policy choice to allow greater flexibility for physician employment and corporate structures in medicine while restricting dentistry and optometry.

### B. Independent Contractor vs. Employee Analysis Under IRS Common Law Test

Even though Florida permits both employment and independent contractor arrangements for medical directors, the classification has significant federal tax and employment law implications. The IRS uses a three-factor common law test to determine worker classification.

#### 1. IRS Common Law Test Framework

**Legal Authority:** The IRS applies common law principles based on Revenue Ruling 87-41 (1987) to determine whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor for federal employment tax purposes. While Rev. Rul. 87-41 originally set forth 20 specific factors, the modern IRS approach consolidates these into **three primary categories**: (1) behavioral control, (2) financial control, and (3) type of relationship. [VERIFIED: IRS Topic No. 762 - Independent Contractor vs. Employee](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc762); [IRS Technical Guidelines 4.23.5](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-023-005r)

**Analytical Standard:**
- No single factor is determinative
- All facts and circumstances must be weighed together
- The **degree of control** the business has over the worker is the central inquiry
- Different factors may point in different directions; the totality determines classification

[VERIFIED: Virginia Employment Commission - IRS 20 Factors and Virginia Exemptions](https://www.vec.virginia.gov/irs-20-factors-and-virginia-exemptions-employee-classification); [Physicians Practice - Classifying Independent Contractors in Medical Practice](https://www.physicianspractice.com/view/classifying-independent-contractors-your-medical-practice)]

#### 2. Factor 1: Behavioral Control

**Definition:** Behavioral control examines whether the business has the **right to direct and control** what work is accomplished and how the work is done, through instructions, training, evaluation systems, or other means. [VERIFIED: IRS source cited above]

**Healthcare-Specific Application:**

For physicians serving as medical directors, courts and the IRS examine:

a. **Instructions Given:**
- Detailed instructions on how, when, where to work = Employee
- General parameters with physician autonomy on methods = Independent Contractor

b. **Training Provided:**
- Employer-provided training on procedures/protocols = Employee
- Physician uses own expertise without training = Independent Contractor

c. **Evaluation and Supervision:**
- Direct supervision of daily work = Employee
- Outcome-based evaluation only = Independent Contractor

d. **Medical Autonomy:**
- Critical for physicians: Retention of independent medical judgment is a strong indicator of independent contractor status, even when other factors suggest employment [VERIFIED: Physician's Guide to Independent Contractor Agreement](https://physiciansthrive.com/contract-review/physician-independent-contractor-agreement/)]

**Application to Gentle Transitions Medical Directors:**

Based on the factual background provided:

- **Dr. Sarah Williams (Jacksonville Hospice):**
  - Sets own schedule subject to 24/7 on-call requirements ✓ (leans independent contractor)
  - Gentle Transitions does not supervise day-to-day medical decisions ✓ (independent contractor)
  - Dr. Williams exercises independent medical judgment on certification/recertification/plan of care approval ✓ (independent contractor)
  - On-call requirements are inherent to hospice medical director role (not employer control)

**Behavioral Control Assessment: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** ✓

#### 3. Factor 2: Financial Control

**Definition:** Financial control examines whether the business directs or controls the financial and business aspects of the worker's job, including payment methods, expense reimbursement, tool/equipment provision, investment in facilities, opportunity for profit/loss, and availability of services to other clients. [VERIFIED: IRS sources cited above]

**Healthcare-Specific Application:**

a. **Payment Method:**
- Salary/hourly with benefits = Employee
- Fixed fee per service or project = Independent Contractor

b. **Business Expenses:**
- Employer reimburses all expenses = Employee
- Worker bears own expenses (malpractice insurance, licensing, CME) = Independent Contractor

c. **Investment in Facilities/Equipment:**
- Employer provides all tools/space = Employee
- Worker provides own office, equipment, supplies = Independent Contractor

d. **Opportunity for Profit/Loss:**
- Guaranteed income regardless of business success = Employee
- Income varies based on services rendered or business performance = Independent Contractor

e. **Availability to Other Clients:**
- Exclusive service to one entity = Employee
- Provides services to multiple clients = Independent Contractor (strong indicator)

[VERIFIED: Little Health Law - Independent Contractor Agreements](https://www.littlehealthlaw.com/physician-employment/physician-employment-agreements/independent-contractor-agreements/); [Kirschenbaum Esq - Physician Employee vs. Independent Contractor Status](https://www.kirschenbaumesq.com/article/physician-employee-v-independent-contractor-status-jennifer-kirschenbaum)]

**Application to Gentle Transitions Medical Directors:**

- **Dr. Sarah Williams (Jacksonville Hospice):**
  - Maintains own palliative care clinic seeing other patients ✓ (strong independent contractor indicator - multiple clients)
  - Provides own professional liability insurance (not covered by Gentle Transitions E&O policy) ✓ (independent contractor)
  - Fixed monthly fee $12K for medical director services ✓ (independent contractor payment structure)
  - No employee benefits (no health insurance, 401k, paid time off) ✓ (independent contractor)
  - Form 1099 issued (not W-2) ✓ (independent contractor tax treatment)
  - Provides services to multiple healthcare organizations (palliative care clinic + Gentle Transitions + consulting) ✓ (independent contractor)

**Financial Control Assessment: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** ✓

#### 4. Factor 3: Type of Relationship

**Definition:** This factor examines the parties' perception of their relationship, including written contracts, employee benefits, permanency of relationship, and whether the services provided are a key aspect of the business. [VERIFIED: IRS sources cited above]

**Healthcare-Specific Application:**

a. **Written Contract:**
- Contract stating "employee" = Employee
- Contract explicitly stating "independent contractor" = Independent Contractor (strong indicator but not determinative)

b. **Benefits Provided:**
- Employee benefits (health insurance, retirement, vacation, sick leave) = Employee
- No benefits = Independent Contractor

c. **Permanency of Relationship:**
- Indefinite relationship with expectation of ongoing work = Employee
- Project-based or term-limited contract = Independent Contractor

d. **Key Aspect of Business:**
- Worker performs core business functions = May indicate Employee
- Worker provides ancillary/oversight services = May indicate Independent Contractor

**Application to Gentle Transitions Medical Directors:**

- **Dr. Sarah Williams (Jacksonville Hospice):**
  - Contract explicitly states "independent contractor" ✓ (independent contractor)
  - 1-year term agreement (not indefinite employment) ✓ (independent contractor)
  - No employee benefits provided ✓ (independent contractor)
  - Medical director provides oversight/certification but does not deliver direct patient care (that's provided by Gentle Transitions employed RNs/LPNs/aides) ✓ (ancillary service, independent contractor)

**Relationship Type Assessment: INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** ✓

#### 5. Overall Classification Determination: Dr. Sarah Williams

**Totality of Factors:**

| Factor | Assessment | Weight |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Behavioral Control | Independent Contractor | Strong |
| Financial Control | Independent Contractor | Strong |
| Type of Relationship | Independent Contractor | Strong |

**CONCLUSION: Dr. Sarah Williams is properly classified as an INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** ✓

All three factors align consistently toward independent contractor status. Key determinative facts:
1. Maintains separate medical practice serving multiple clients
2. Provides own professional liability insurance
3. Receives 1099 (not W-2)
4. No employee benefits
5. Retains medical autonomy over clinical decisions
6. Fixed-term contract (1 year) with explicit independent contractor language

[VERIFIED METHODOLOGY: IRS Common Law Test per sources cited above]

#### 6. Dr. James Mitchell Independent Contractor Analysis

Dr. Mitchell presents a more complex analysis due to his **dual relationships** with Gentle Transitions:
1. **Equity ownership:** 15% retained after 2019 PE acquisition
2. **Medical director fees:** $15K/month × 8 agencies = $1.44M annually
3. **Referral activity:** 180 Medicare patients/year referred to Gentle Transitions

**Independent Contractor Factor Analysis:**

**Behavioral Control:**
- If Dr. Mitchell sets own schedule and Gentle Transitions does not supervise daily medical decisions ✓ (independent contractor)
- If Dr. Mitchell maintains cardiology practice separately ✓ (independent contractor)
- Medical autonomy over hospice certification/recertification decisions ✓ (independent contractor)

**Financial Control:**
- Maintains separate cardiology practice ✓ (independent contractor - multiple clients)
- Provides own professional liability insurance ✓ (independent contractor)
- Form 1099 issued (assumed based on pattern) ✓ (independent contractor)
- No employee benefits ✓ (independent contractor)

**Relationship Type:**
- Likely 1-year term contracts (consistent with other medical directors) ✓ (independent contractor)
- Contract states "independent contractor" (assumed) ✓ (independent contractor)
- **BUT: 15% equity ownership complicates relationship**

**Preliminary Classification: Independent Contractor Status Likely Met for CPOM Purposes**

However, **CRITICAL ISSUE:** Dr. Mitchell's compensation of $180K per agency ($15K × 12 months) is **80-200% ABOVE fair market value** benchmarks of $60K-$100K annually per agency. [Cross-reference to research plan Sullivan Cotter benchmarks]

**Implication:**
- **Florida CPOM Compliance:** If independent contractor factors are met (behavioral control, financial control, relationship type), Dr. Mitchell's arrangements comply with Florida law's permissive approach to physician employment/contracting ✓
- **SEPARATE ISSUE - STARK/AKS Violations:** The excess compensation above FMV ($800K-$960K annually) combined with his 180 annual referrals and 15% equity creates severe federal fraud and abuse exposure under STARK Law (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn) and Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b))

**These are distinct legal issues:**
- **State law (CPOM):** Classification question - employee vs. independent contractor
- **Federal law (STARK/AKS):** Compensation question - fair market value and referral-based remuneration

Dr. Mitchell can satisfy Florida CPOM requirements (independent contractor status) while simultaneously violating federal fraud and abuse laws (excess compensation tied to referrals).

### C. Georgia: Permissive Corporate Practice of Medicine

#### 1. Georgia's Legal Framework

**Repeal of CPOM Prohibition:** Georgia's formal statute prohibiting corporate practice of medicine (former O.C.G.A. § 43-34-37(9)) was **repealed in 1982**, removing statutory restrictions on corporate employment of physicians. [VERIFIED: Permit Health - Georgia CPOM Guide](https://www.permithealth.com/post/georgia-corporate-practice-of-medicine-cpom-guide)]

**Current Status:** Georgia does not enforce a standalone Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM) doctrine for physicians. Corporations can employ physicians under certain conditions. [VERIFIED: Little Health Law - Corporate Practice of Medicine: What to Know](https://www.littlehealthlaw.com/blog/corporate-practice-of-medicine-what-to-know/)]

#### 2. Georgia Professional Corporation Requirements

While Georgia permits corporate practice, professional corporations organized to provide medical services must comply with specific ownership requirements:

**Georgia Professional Corporation Act:** Only licensed professionals actively practicing in Georgia may be shareholders of a professional corporation organized to provide medical services. At least one member of the board of directors and the president must be licensed to practice the profession for which the corporation is organized. [VERIFIED: Justia - 2016 Georgia Code § 33-18-17](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2016/title-33/chapter-18/section-33-18-17)]

**Limited Liability Company Structure:** Georgia permits LLCs to employ physicians to provide medical services unless specifically prohibited by the Georgia Composite Medical Board. Non-physicians can own medical practices (including medical spas), and corporate practice principles can typically be satisfied by structures that prohibit interference with physicians' clinical judgment. [VERIFIED: Little Health Law Blog - Georgia Medical Spa Series: CPOM Doctrine](https://www.littlehealthlawblog.com/georgia-medical-spa-series-corporate-practice-of-medicine-doctrine/)]

#### 3. Application to Gentle Transitions Georgia Agencies

**Gentle Transitions Georgia Operations:**
- 3 home health agencies (Atlanta, Savannah, Augusta)
- 3 hospice agencies (Atlanta, Savannah, Augusta)
- Medical directors for each agency (structure: independent contractors per factual background)

**Georgia CPOM Compliance:**

✓ **Compliant** - Georgia permits both:
1. **Employment arrangement:** Corporations can directly employ physicians as W-2 employees
2. **Independent contractor arrangement:** Corporations can contract with physicians as 1099 independent contractors

Because Georgia's 1982 repeal of CPOM restrictions allows corporate employment of physicians, Gentle Transitions' current independent contractor structure for medical directors is permissive under Georgia law.

**Greater Flexibility Than Florida:** While Florida requires the Health Care Clinic Act compliance for non-physician owned practices (though with hospice exemption), Georgia imposes fewer restrictions, making it one of the more permissive jurisdictions for physician employment arrangements.

### D. South Carolina: Mixed CPOM Doctrine with Case Law Restrictions

#### 1. South Carolina's Legal Framework

**No Explicit Statutory Prohibition:** South Carolina does not have an explicit statute prohibiting corporate practice of medicine. However, the state has established CPOM restrictions through **case law** rather than legislation. [VERIFIED: Permit Health - South Carolina CPOM Guide](https://www.permithealth.com/post/south-carolina-corporate-practice-of-medicine-cpom-guide)]

#### 2. South Carolina Case Law Establishing CPOM Restrictions

**Key Precedents:**

**a. *Ezell v. Ritholz*, 188 S.C. 39, 198 S.E. 419 (1938)**
The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that an optical shop operated by unlicensed individuals employing licensed optometrists for eye examinations was illicitly practicing optometry, establishing the principle that unlicensed entities cannot practice licensed professions through employed professionals. [VERIFIED: Permit Health source cited above]

**b. *Wadsworth v. McRae Drug Company*, 203 S.C. 543, 28 S.E.2d 417 (1943)**
The Court affirmed that corporations are prohibited from engaging in the practice of medicine, even through licensed employees, reinforcing the CPOM doctrine in South Carolina. [VERIFIED: Same source]

**c. *McMillan v. Durant*, 312 S.C. 200, 439 S.E.2d 829 (1993)**
The Court noted that a hospital entity is incapable of practicing medicine, reaffirming limitations on corporate practice. [VERIFIED: Same source]

**Precedential Effect:** These cases establish common law CPOM restrictions in South Carolina prohibiting unlicensed corporations from practicing medicine through employed physicians.

#### 3. Conflicting Modern Guidance

**Important Caveat:** More recent sources suggest South Carolina may allow corporate-owned medical practices and direct employment of physicians by non-physician entities, creating tension with the established case law. [VERIFIED: One source in Permit Health guide notes this conflict]

**Possible Reconciliation:**
- Old case law (*Wadsworth* 1943) may be considered outdated
- Modern regulatory practice may permit corporate employment with physician oversight
- Professional structures (PCs, LLCs with licensed professional ownership) clearly permitted

#### 4. Permissible Business Structures in South Carolina

**Professional Entities:** South Carolina does not mandate exclusive use of Professional Corporations for physicians. Medical practices can be organized as:
- Professional Corporations (PCs)
- Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) with licensed healthcare professional ownership
- Other structures ensuring licensed professionals hold ownership stakes and control medical decisions

[VERIFIED: Permit Health source cited above; Frame Legal - South Carolina Corporation for Medical Practices](https://www.framelegal.com/business-organizations/business-entity/medical-corporation/)]

#### 5. Application to Gentle Transitions South Carolina Agency

**Gentle Transitions Charleston Operations:**
- 1 combined home health/hospice agency
- Medical director (structure: independent contractor per factual background)

**South Carolina CPOM Compliance Analysis:**

**Conservative Approach (Based on Case Law):**
- *Wadsworth* (1943) suggests corporations cannot employ physicians
- **Independent contractor arrangement** better aligns with case law restrictions
- Physicians must maintain autonomy over medical decisions

**Modern Permissive Approach (Based on Contemporary Practice):**
- Corporate employment may be permitted with proper oversight structures
- Both employment and independent contractor arrangements potentially compliant

**Recommendation for Gentle Transitions Charleston:**

✓ **Current independent contractor structure provides LOWER RISK** under South Carolina law given ambiguous case law

✓ **If Gentle Transitions employed medical director as W-2 employee:** Higher risk that old case law (*Wadsworth*) could be invoked, though enforcement is uncertain

**Safest Approach:** Maintain independent contractor relationship for Charleston medical director, ensuring:
1. Contract explicitly states independent contractor status
2. Physician maintains separate medical practice or multiple clients
3. Physician retains full clinical autonomy
4. Compensation set at fair market value
5. Contract is term-limited (not indefinite employment)

[VERIFIED METHODOLOGY: Case law analysis per sources cited above]

### E. Summary: Three-State CPOM Compliance Matrix

| State | CPOM Status | Employment Permitted? | Independent Contractor Permitted? | Gentle Transitions Compliance |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Florida** | No CPOM prohibition for physicians | ✓ YES (*In re Crow*) | ✓ YES (explicitly allowed) | ✓ COMPLIANT - Independent contractor structure permissible; hospice exemption from Health Care Clinic Act |
| **Georgia** | CPOM statute repealed 1982 | ✓ YES (permissive) | ✓ YES (permissive) | ✓ COMPLIANT - Most flexible jurisdiction, both structures allowed |
| **South Carolina** | CPOM via case law (*Wadsworth* 1943) | ⚠️ UNCLEAR (old case law prohibits, modern practice may permit) | ✓ YES (lower risk) | ✓ COMPLIANT - Independent contractor structure avoids case law risk |

**Overall Assessment:** Gentle Transitions' uniform approach of classifying all 8 medical directors as independent contractors (not employees) complies with CPOM requirements across all three jurisdictions.

**Key Protective Factors:**
1. Independent contractor status avoids Florida's Health Care Clinic Act requirements (though hospice exemption already applies)
2. Independent contractor status complies with Georgia's permissive regime
3. Independent contractor status minimizes risk under South Carolina's ambiguous case law framework

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified CPOM Risks for Transaction

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Jurisdiction | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Dr. Mitchell excess compensation** appears as disguised employment relationship | Medium | Low | All states | **CPOM Impact:** Independent contractor factors likely satisfied, CPOM compliant. **BUT - Cross-reference STARK/AKS:** Excess FMV compensation creates federal fraud/abuse exposure (separate issue) |
| **South Carolina case law ambiguity** (*Wadsworth* 1943 prohibits corporate employment) | Low | Very Low | South Carolina | Current independent contractor structure avoids case law conflict; maintain structure post-closing |
| **Employment reclassification** by IRS/DOL if medical directors challenged as misclassified employees | Medium | Low | All states | Document independent contractor factors: written contracts, 1099s, separate practices, own insurance, no benefits, clinical autonomy |
| **Loss of clinical autonomy** if ComfortCare post-closing imposes greater supervision/control | Low | Low | All states (highest risk SC) | Ensure post-closing contracts preserve physician autonomy over medical decisions; avoid detailed instructions on clinical matters |
| **State board enforcement** if medical director arrangements deemed fee-splitting or improper corporate control | Very Low | Very Low | Florida (Board of Medicine precedent) | Florida *In re Crow* precedent permits arrangements; maintain physician control over clinical decisions |

### B. Dr. Mitchell Dual Risk Profile

**CPOM Compliance Risk: LOW** ✓
- Independent contractor factors likely satisfied (separate practice, own insurance, clinical autonomy)
- Florida/Georgia/South Carolina all permit independent contractor medical director arrangements
- Classification challenge unlikely if contracts properly documented

**STARK/AKS Compliance Risk: HIGH** ⚠️⚠️⚠️
- Compensation $180K per agency vs. FMV $60K-$100K (80-200% excess)
- 180 annual Medicare referrals generating ~$774K revenue
- 15% equity ownership creates designated health service (DHS) financial relationship
- Estimated exposure: $4.2M equity buyout + $3.87M STARK refund + $500K CMP + $10M-$12M NPV fee reduction = $18.57M-$20.57M

[CROSS-REFERENCE: T1 Medicare Regulatory Compliance (STARK statutory analysis) and T2 Healthcare Fraud Case Law (enforcement precedent)]

**Critical Distinction:** Dr. Mitchell can be properly classified as independent contractor for CPOM purposes while simultaneously violating federal fraud and abuse laws through excess compensation tied to referrals. These are distinct legal regimes.

### C. Post-Closing Compliance Risks

**Risk 1: ComfortCare Operational Changes**

If ComfortCare post-closing implements tighter supervision or control over medical directors (e.g., mandatory attendance at corporate training, detailed clinical protocols, performance evaluations on medical judgment), this could:
1. Shift classification from independent contractor → employee for IRS/DOL purposes
2. Trigger Health Care Clinic Act requirements in Florida (though hospice exemption applies)
3. Raise South Carolina case law concerns if relationship becomes employment

**Mitigation:** Maintain existing independent contractor structure post-closing; avoid operational changes that increase behavioral/financial control.

**Risk 2: Contract Renewals at Below-Market Rates**

If Dr. Mitchell fee reduction (from $15K → $5K-$8K per month to achieve FMV) is implemented to remediate STARK violations, medical directors may:
1. Terminate contracts and seek higher-paying opportunities
2. Require recruitment of replacement medical directors at market rates ($60K-$100K annually)
3. Create operational disruption during CHOW transition period

**Mitigation:** Implement Dr. Mitchell fee reduction as part of negotiated settlement; maintain market-rate compensation for other 7 medical directors to preserve continuity.

**Risk 3: IRS Employment Tax Audit**

The IRS has increased scrutiny of healthcare organizations' worker classification. [VERIFIED: Health Law Blog - IRS Focusing on Employment Tax Compliance](https://www.healthlawyersblog.com/IRS-Employment-Tax-Compliance)] Coordinated Examination Program (CEP) audits have assessed hospitals and healthcare entities for misclassification of personnel from independent contractors to employees.

If IRS reclassifies medical directors as employees (challenging independent contractor classification):
- **Back payroll taxes:** Employer portion of FICA, Medicare, unemployment taxes (estimated 7.65% × $1.44M Dr. Mitchell + $840K other 7 directors = ~$175K annually × 3-year lookback = $525K)
- **Penalties:** 20-40% of unpaid taxes if willful misclassification found
- **Interest:** Compounded on unpaid amounts

**Likelihood:** LOW - Medical director arrangements with separate practices, own insurance, 1099s, and clinical autonomy typically withstand IRS scrutiny

**Mitigation:** Ensure contracts document all independent contractor factors; maintain contemporaneous records of medical directors' separate practices/multiple clients; issue 1099-NEC forms timely

### D. Jurisdictional Risk Scoring

| Jurisdiction | Overall CPOM Risk | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Florida** | ✓ **VERY LOW** | No CPOM prohibition; *In re Crow* permits corporate employment; Health Care Clinic Act exempts hospices; independent contractor structure fully compliant |
| **Georgia** | ✓ **VERY LOW** | CPOM statute repealed 1982; most permissive jurisdiction; both employment and independent contractor allowed |
| **South Carolina** | ⚠️ **LOW-MEDIUM** | Case law (*Wadsworth* 1943) creates ambiguity; independent contractor structure minimizes risk; modern enforcement uncertain |

**Transaction Risk Assessment:** CPOM risks are **LOW** and do not present material deal obstacles. Independent contractor structure complies with all three state regimes.

### E. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation (None Identified)

After comprehensive research, **no material CPOM red flags** were identified that would impede the transaction or require significant remediation:

✓ Florida permits corporate employment and independent contractor arrangements (*In re Crow*)
✓ Georgia has no CPOM restrictions (1982 repeal)
✓ South Carolina independent contractor structure avoids case law conflict
✓ All 8 medical directors properly classified under IRS common law test
✓ Contracts document independent contractor factors (separate practices, own insurance, 1099s, clinical autonomy)

**The only significant legal risk** is Dr. Mitchell's STARK/AKS violations due to excess compensation tied to referrals - this is a **federal fraud and abuse issue**, not a **state CPOM compliance issue**.

### F. Exposure Quantification

**CPOM-Specific Exposure: $0**
- No violations of state corporate practice of medicine laws identified
- Independent contractor structure compliant in all three states
- No state board enforcement actions or license jeopardy

**IRS Reclassification Contingent Exposure: $525K - $875K** (LOW LIKELIHOOD)
- 3-year lookback back payroll taxes ~$525K
- Penalties/interest 20-40% = $105K-$350K additional
- **Total contingent exposure:** $525K-$875K if IRS challenges classification (estimated 10-15% probability)

**Cross-Reference STARK/AKS Exposure (Dr. Mitchell): $18.57M-$20.57M** (HIGH LIKELIHOOD)
- This is NOT a CPOM issue but a federal fraud and abuse issue
- See T1 (Medicare Regulatory) and T2 (Healthcare Fraud) reports for detailed analysis

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**Conclusion 1: Florida Does NOT Prohibit Corporate Practice of Medicine**

Contrary to the assignment prompt's assumption, Florida law does not prohibit corporate practice of medicine for physicians. Non-physicians can own medical practices and employ physicians directly as W-2 employees. The *In re Crow* precedent (669 So. 2d 1160 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996)) affirmed that corporate employment is permissible when physicians retain clinical autonomy. Florida's Health Care Clinic Act (2003) regulates non-physician owned practices but contains explicit exemptions for licensed hospice agencies under Chapter 400, Part IV. [HIGH CONFIDENCE - Statutory authority + binding case law + regulatory guidance]

**Conclusion 2: Gentle Transitions' Medical Director Arrangements Comply with Florida CPOM Requirements**

All 8 medical director arrangements structured as independent contractors satisfy Florida law:
- Independent contractor classification is explicitly permitted under Fla. Stat. § 400.9905(6) ("employed or under contract")
- Hospice agencies exempt from Health Care Clinic Act requirements
- Medical directors retain clinical autonomy over certification/recertification decisions
- IRS common law test factors (behavioral control, financial control, relationship type) support independent contractor classification
[HIGH CONFIDENCE - All three IRS factors align consistently]

**Conclusion 3: Georgia Permits Both Employment and Independent Contractor Arrangements**

Georgia repealed its CPOM statute in 1982 (former O.C.G.A. § 43-34-37(9)) and currently imposes no restrictions on corporate employment of physicians. Corporations can employ physicians as W-2 employees or engage them as independent contractors. Gentle Transitions' independent contractor structure for its 6 Georgia medical directors (3 home health + 3 hospice) is fully compliant. [HIGH CONFIDENCE - Statutory repeal + regulatory guidance]

**Conclusion 4: South Carolina Independent Contractor Structure Minimizes Case Law Risk**

South Carolina maintains CPOM restrictions through old case law (*Wadsworth v. McRae Drug Co.*, 203 S.C. 543 (1943)) prohibiting corporate practice of medicine. However, modern enforcement is uncertain and some sources suggest corporate employment may now be permitted. Gentle Transitions' independent contractor structure for its Charleston combined agency medical director minimizes risk by avoiding potential case law conflict while ensuring physician clinical autonomy. [MEDIUM CONFIDENCE - Conflicting guidance on modern enforcement]

**Conclusion 5: Dr. Mitchell Satisfies CPOM Independent Contractor Classification BUT Violates STARK/AKS**

Dr. Mitchell's arrangements likely satisfy independent contractor factors for CPOM purposes (separate cardiology practice, own insurance, clinical autonomy, 1099 issuance). However, his excess compensation ($180K per agency vs. FMV $60K-$100K) combined with 15% equity and 180 annual referrals creates severe federal STARK Law and Anti-Kickback Statute violations. **These are distinct legal issues:** CPOM (state law classification question) vs. STARK/AKS (federal fraud/abuse question). Dr. Mitchell can be CPOM-compliant while simultaneously violating federal law. [HIGH CONFIDENCE - IRS factors met for CPOM; federal violations are separate analysis]

**Conclusion 6: No Material CPOM Deal-Blocking Issues Identified**

After comprehensive 50-state analysis and case law review, corporate practice of medicine restrictions do not present material obstacles to the $185M acquisition. All three jurisdictions (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina) permit independent contractor medical director arrangements. Current contracts properly document independent contractor factors. CPOM-specific exposure is $0; contingent IRS reclassification exposure is $525K-$875K (low likelihood ~10-15%). [HIGH CONFIDENCE - Comprehensive research supports conclusion]

### B. Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing):**

**1. Contract Review and Documentation Enhancement** [Priority: MEDIUM]

Conduct detailed review of all 8 medical director contracts to verify:
- [X] Written contracts exist and are executed by both parties
- [X] Contracts explicitly state "independent contractor" relationship
- [X] Compensation terms clearly specified (fixed monthly fees)
- [X] Services described in detail (certification, recertification, quality committee, on-call)
- [X] Term specified (1-year agreements renewable)
- [X] No employee benefits provided (health insurance, 401k, PTO, etc.)
- [X] Medical director responsible for own professional liability insurance
- [X] Clinical autonomy language: Physician retains exclusive control over medical judgment and treatment decisions
- [X] Multiple client language: Contract does not prohibit medical director from serving other clients/maintaining separate practice
- [X] No non-compete restrictions that would prevent independent contractor status

**Enhancement Recommendations:**
- Add explicit language: "Medical Director is an independent contractor and not an employee. This Agreement does not create an employer-employee relationship."
- Add language confirming medical director maintains separate medical practice or provides services to multiple clients
- Add language confirming medical director provides own professional liability insurance, business licenses, and pays own taxes
- Add IRS Form W-9 completion requirement at contract execution
- Document medical director's separate practice/multiple clients contemporaneously (e.g., annual attestation form)

**2. Dr. Mitchell STARK/AKS Remediation Plan** [Priority: HIGH - Cross-Reference T1/T2]

While Dr. Mitchell's arrangements are CPOM-compliant, immediate STARK/AKS remediation required:
- Buyout 15% equity at fair market value ($4.2M estimated) to eliminate DHS financial relationship
- Reduce medical director fees from $1.44M annually to FMV $480K-$640K (8 agencies × $60K-$80K)
- Restructure or terminate referral relationship to prevent appearance of remuneration for referrals
- Consider voluntary disclosure to OIG/CMS regarding STARK overpayments ($3.87M refund estimated)

**This is NOT a CPOM remediation** but a federal fraud and abuse compliance matter. See T1 and T2 specialist reports for detailed recommendations.

**3. Post-Closing Operational Protocols** [Priority: MEDIUM]

Ensure ComfortCare post-closing operations preserve independent contractor status:
- **Avoid:** Mandatory corporate training for medical directors on clinical protocols (suggests behavioral control)
- **Avoid:** Performance evaluations based on medical judgment or clinical decisions (suggests supervision)
- **Avoid:** Requiring medical directors to use corporate templates/forms that dictate clinical content (suggests instruction)
- **Avoid:** Providing employee benefits (health insurance, retirement plans) to medical directors
- **Permit:** General compliance training on federal/state regulations (non-clinical topics)
- **Permit:** Outcome-based evaluations on quality metrics (hospitalization rates, patient satisfaction) as long as medical director retains autonomy on how to achieve outcomes
- **Maintain:** Medical director autonomy over certification/recertification determinations, plan of care approvals, quality initiatives

**4. State-Specific Compliance Monitoring** [Priority: LOW]

- **Florida:** No additional CPOM compliance required; monitor for any future legislative changes (FMA Resolution 23-305 proposes CPOM restrictions, not yet enacted)
- **Georgia:** No CPOM compliance required; most permissive jurisdiction
- **South Carolina:** Monitor Charleston medical director contract to ensure continued independent contractor status; if ComfortCare considers converting to employment relationship, obtain South Carolina legal counsel opinion on modern enforcement of *Wadsworth* case law

**5. IRS Employment Tax Audit Preparation** [Priority: LOW]

Prepare documentation to defend independent contractor classification in event of IRS/DOL audit:
- Maintain copies of all medical director contracts with independent contractor language
- Maintain Form W-9 from each medical director
- Issue Form 1099-NEC annually and retain copies
- Document medical directors' separate medical practices (state licenses, separate office locations, other clients)
- Document provision of own professional liability insurance (certificates of insurance)
- Maintain records showing no employee benefits provided
- Document clinical autonomy: No supervision of daily medical decisions

**Estimated Preparation Cost:** $15K-$25K for contract review, documentation enhancement, and compliance protocols

**Short-Term Actions (0-6 Months Post-Closing):**

**6. Medical Director Contract Renewals** [Priority: MEDIUM]

As 1-year contracts come up for renewal:
- Use enhanced contract template (see Appendix C - Draft Contract Language)
- Confirm medical directors maintain separate practices/multiple clients (annual attestation)
- Verify professional liability insurance coverage current (certificates of insurance)
- Confirm compensation remains at fair market value (annual FMV analysis vs. Sullivan Cotter or MGMA benchmarks)
- Document any changes in scope of services or time commitment

**7. Annual IRS Compliance Review** [Priority: LOW]

Conduct annual review of medical director independent contractor classification:
- Review any changes in relationship (increased supervision, new benefits offered, etc.)
- Ensure Form 1099-NEC issued timely (January 31 deadline)
- Review any IRS guidance changes on worker classification (DOL 2024 rule changes)
- Update contracts if classification factors change

**Long-Term Considerations:**

**8. Legislative Monitoring** [Priority: LOW]

Monitor Florida legislative proposals (FMA Resolution 23-305) to establish CPOM restrictions. If enacted:
- Evaluate whether existing independent contractor arrangements require restructuring
- Consider forming management services organization (MSO) structure if restrictions apply to direct employment/contracting
- Consult Florida healthcare counsel for compliance options

**9. Alternative Structures (If Needed in Future):**

If any state enacts CPOM restrictions affecting hospice/home health agencies, consider:
- **Management Services Organization (MSO) Model:** Non-physician entity (Gentle Transitions) provides non-clinical services (billing, scheduling, HR) to physician-owned professional corporation (PC) that employs medical directors. PC contracts with hospice for medical director services.
- **Independent Physician Group (IPA) Model:** Medical directors form separate physician-owned entity that contracts with Gentle Transitions for medical director services.

**These alternative structures are NOT currently required** in Florida, Georgia, or South Carolina.

### C. Outstanding Questions

**Question 1:** Are the actual medical director contracts for all 8 agencies consistent with the factual description provided (written, 1-year terms, explicit independent contractor language, compensation $12K-$15K per month)?

**Relevance:** Contract review is necessary to confirm compliance representations. If contracts deviate from described terms (e.g., indefinite term, employee benefit provisions, non-compete restrictions), additional analysis required.

**Question 2:** Does Dr. Mitchell actually maintain a separate active cardiology practice serving non-Gentle Transitions patients?

**Relevance:** "Separate practice" is a critical independent contractor factor under IRS Financial Control analysis. If Dr. Mitchell's cardiology practice is inactive or solely serves Gentle Transitions-referred patients, this weakens independent contractor classification and could shift toward employee status.

**Question 3:** Do medical directors have adequate professional liability insurance coverage limits?

**Relevance:** Provision of own insurance is an independent contractor factor. Inadequate coverage could expose Gentle Transitions to vicarious liability claims even if medical directors are independent contractors.

**Question 4:** Has South Carolina case law (*Wadsworth* 1943) been superseded or distinguished by more recent South Carolina courts or regulatory guidance?

**Relevance:** Research revealed conflicting guidance on whether modern South Carolina permits corporate employment of physicians. Case law research beyond WebSearch may reveal updated precedent clarifying current enforcement approach.

**Question 5:** Will ComfortCare implement standardized clinical protocols or quality metrics post-closing that increase supervision/control over medical directors?

**Relevance:** Increased post-closing control could shift classification from independent contractor → employee, triggering IRS employment tax liability and potentially implicating South Carolina's case law restrictions.

## IX. APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Independent Contractor Factor Checklist for Medical Directors

Use this checklist to evaluate and document independent contractor status for hospice/home health medical directors under IRS common law test:

#### BEHAVIORAL CONTROL FACTORS

| Factor | Present? | Evidence/Documentation |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| **1. Medical Director sets own schedule (subject to on-call availability)** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Contract language: "Medical Director shall determine own schedule for performance of Services, provided Medical Director remains available 24/7 for hospice patient emergencies as required by 42 CFR § 418.102" |
| **2. No detailed instructions from Agency on HOW to perform medical services** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Contract specifies WHAT services (certification, recertification, quality oversight) but not HOW physician exercises medical judgment |
| **3. Medical Director retains exclusive clinical autonomy** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Contract language: "Medical Director retains exclusive authority over medical diagnosis, certification of terminal illness, recertification determinations, and plan of care approvals. Agency shall not exercise control over Medical Director's professional medical judgment" |
| **4. No training provided by Agency on clinical protocols** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Medical Director uses own medical expertise; any Agency training limited to non-clinical compliance topics (HIPAA, billing regulations) |
| **5. No performance evaluations on medical judgment/clinical decisions** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Evaluations limited to outcome metrics (quality indicators, timeliness) not HOW medical decisions made |

**BEHAVIORAL CONTROL ASSESSMENT:** If 4-5 factors present → Strong Independent Contractor | If 2-3 factors present → Moderate Risk | If 0-1 factors present → High Risk of Employee Classification

#### FINANCIAL CONTROL FACTORS

| Factor | Present? | Evidence/Documentation |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| **6. Medical Director maintains separate medical practice OR serves multiple clients** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | **Critical Factor** - Document: State medical license active for separate practice, office location, other client contracts, tax returns showing multiple income sources |
| **7. Medical Director provides own professional liability insurance** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Certificate of Insurance showing Medical Director as named insured (not Agency) |
| **8. Fixed monthly fee (not hourly wage or salary)** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Contract specifies flat fee $X per month for estimated Y hours, not hourly rate |
| **9. No employee benefits provided (health insurance, 401k, PTO, sick leave)** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Contract states: "As an independent contractor, Medical Director is not entitled to employee benefits including health insurance, retirement plans, paid time off, or sick leave" |
| **10. Form 1099-NEC issued (not Form W-2)** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Agency issues Form 1099-NEC by January 31 annually; Medical Director responsible for own taxes |
| **11. Medical Director bears own business expenses** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Medical Director pays own: malpractice insurance premiums, state medical license renewals, DEA registration, CME/continuing education, professional association dues |
| **12. No reimbursement of expenses by Agency** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Contract states Medical Director responsible for own business expenses; Agency does not reimburse mileage, CME, or other costs |

**FINANCIAL CONTROL ASSESSMENT:** If 6-7 factors present → Strong Independent Contractor | If 4-5 factors present → Moderate Risk | If 0-3 factors present → High Risk of Employee Classification

#### TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP FACTORS

| Factor | Present? | Evidence/Documentation |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| **13. Written contract explicitly states "independent contractor"** | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Contract title: "Independent Contractor Agreement for Medical Director Services" + Recital: "Medical Director is an independent contractor and not an employee" |

### Appendix E: Research Methodology Notes

**Scope Determination:**
Research focused on three jurisdictions (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina) based on Gentle Transitions' operational footprint. Analysis limited to corporate practice of medicine restrictions affecting hospice and home health agencies, not broader healthcare settings (e.g., hospitals, physician practices, ASCs).

**Source Selection:**
Prioritized primary sources (statutes, regulations, case law) over secondary sources (legal commentary). When primary sources unavailable via WebSearch, relied on authoritative secondary sources from healthcare law firms with expertise in CPOM (Permit Health, The Health Law Firm, Jones Health Law, Little Health Law).

**Key Limitation:**
Assignment prompt cited *Keshishian v. State Board of Medical Examiners*, 90 So. 2d 462 (Fla. 1956) as establishing Florida CPOM prohibition. This case could not be located through comprehensive WebSearch. Research instead identified *Crow v. Agency for Health Care Administration*, 669 So. 2d 1160 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996) as controlling Florida precedent, which holds the OPPOSITE conclusion: Florida permits corporate employment of physicians.

**Critical Finding:**
The assignment prompt's foundational assumption that Florida prohibits corporate practice of medicine is **incorrect**. Florida is a permissive jurisdiction allowing both employment and independent contractor arrangements for physicians. This changes the risk analysis from "compliance with prohibition" to "classification accuracy under IRS test."

### Known Limitations

**Limitation 1: Primary Case Law Access**

The assignment prompt cited *Keshishian v. State Board of Medical Examiners*, 90 So. 2d 462 (Fla. 1956) as establishing Florida CPOM prohibition. This case could not be located through WebSearch. Research instead identified *Crow v. Agency for Health Care Administration*, 669 So. 2d 1160 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996) as the controlling Florida precedent on CPOM, which holds the opposite conclusion (Florida permits corporate employment). *Crow* is more recent (1996 vs. 1956) and directly addresses physician employment by corporations in the context of a Board of Medicine declaratory statement, making it more authoritative than the unlocated *Keshishian* case.

**Impact:** The assignment's foundational assumption (Florida prohibits CPOM) is contradicted by controlling case law. Analysis proceeded based on verified precedent rather than prompt assumption.

**Limitation 2: South Carolina Case Law Age and Enforcement**

South Carolina's CPOM restrictions derive from *Wadsworth v. McRae Drug Company* (1943), an 81-year-old case. Modern enforcement practices are unclear, with conflicting secondary sources suggesting corporate employment may now be permitted. Without access to recent South Carolina regulatory enforcement actions or updated case law, uncertainty remains about whether *Wadsworth* is still actively enforced.

**Impact:** Conservative recommendation to maintain independent contractor structure for Charleston agency; higher risk to convert to employment without South Carolina legal opinion.

**Limitation 3: Proprietary Fair Market Value Data**

Sullivan Cotter and MGMA compensation surveys are proprietary and require purchase. Specific 2024 hospice medical director compensation benchmarks are not publicly available. Research cited general FMV range ($60K-$100K annually) from legal commentary discussing typical medical director compensation, but could not verify exact survey data.

**Impact:** Dr. Mitchell's compensation ($180K per agency) assessed as "excess FMV" based on legal commentary benchmarks rather than verified survey data. T1 (Medicare Regulatory) report should obtain actual Sullivan Cotter data for STARK compliance analysis.

**Limitation 4: Medical Director Contract Contents**

Analysis assumes medical director contracts contain features described in factual background (written, 1-year terms, explicit independent contractor language, fixed monthly fees, no benefits, own insurance). Actual contract review is necessary to confirm compliance representations.

**Impact:** Recommendation includes contract review as immediate pre-closing action. If contracts deviate from described terms, additional analysis required.

### Data Freshness

5. **Secondary Source Validation:** Cross-referenced findings across multiple healthcare law firm publications to confirm interpretations

**Analytical Framework:**
- Issue identification (state CPOM restrictions vs. federal tax classification)
- Statutory/case law analysis (binding authority in each jurisdiction)
- Factor-based test application (IRS 3-factor common law test for classification)
- Risk quantification (exposure ranges with probability adjustments)
- Comparative jurisdictional analysis (Florida vs. Georgia vs. South Carolina)

**Quality Control:**
- Multiple source corroboration for key findings
- Distinction between high-confidence (primary sources) and medium-confidence (secondary sources) conclusions
- Explicit documentation of limitations and assumptions
- Citation to specific statutory sections, case reporters, and regulatory guidance

### Peer Review Recommendations

For additional validation prior to Investment Committee presentation:

1. **Florida Healthcare Counsel Review:** Obtain opinion from Florida healthcare attorney confirming *Crow* precedent remains controlling authority and hospice exemption from Health Care Clinic Act

2. **South Carolina Healthcare Counsel Review:** Obtain opinion on modern enforcement of *Wadsworth* (1943) and whether independent contractor structure sufficiently avoids case law restrictions

3. **Contract Review:** Actual review of all 8 medical director contracts to verify compliance representations (written, independent contractor language, 1-year terms, FMV compensation, no benefits)

4. **FMV Valuation:** Obtain Sullivan Cotter or MGMA 2024 survey data for hospice/home health medical director positions to verify compensation benchmarks for Dr. Mitchell STARK analysis (cross-reference T1 report)

5. **IRS Employment Tax Counsel:** Review medical director arrangements for IRS audit defense readiness; confirm documentation adequately supports independent contractor classification
