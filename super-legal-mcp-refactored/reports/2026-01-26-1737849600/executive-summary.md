# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: ComfortCare Partners LLC Acquisition of Gentle Transitions Home Health & Hospice, Inc.
**Prepared for**: ComfortCare Partners LLC Board of Directors
**Date**: January 26, 2026
**Transaction Value**: $185,000,000

---

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Risk Rating**: HIGH

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

ComfortCare Partners should **proceed with the acquisition of Gentle Transitions** subject to five mandatory conditions precedent, as the transaction generates an 18.4% probability-weighted IRR exceeding the 15-20% PE hurdle rate. The primary risks requiring mitigation are Dr. James Mitchell's STARK/AKS violations ($71.96M weighted exposure representing 95.7% of aggregate risk) and the MediSupply DME kickback arrangement ($16.09M weighted exposure). Immediate action required: Execute Dr. Mitchell equity buyout ($27.75M) and terminate MediSupply arrangement within 24 hours of closing, with OIG voluntary disclosures filed within 60 days post-closing.

### Rationale

The transaction presents attractive risk-adjusted economics despite significant regulatory exposure. The $185M purchase price (10x EBITDA) reduces to an effective 8.6x entry multiple after accounting for the $23.58M asset purchase tax benefit and $20M escrow protection. The base case scenario (60% probability) projects $13.48M net exposure after tax benefit offset, with Gentle Transitions' $95M annual revenue (76.4% Medicare) and 19.5% EBITDA margins providing stable cash flows to service the identified regulatory liabilities.

The regulatory landscape, while complex, is manageable through proactive voluntary disclosure. Historical precedent from comparable settlements (*Tuomey* $72.4M, *Halifax* $85M) demonstrates that cooperative compliance strategies reduce FCA exposure by 75-98% compared to litigation outcomes. Gentle Transitions' strong operational foundation across 8 agencies in 3 states, combined with Jacksonville's corrected infection control deficiency (94% hand hygiene compliance), positions the platform for continued growth post-closing.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **Dr. Mitchell Equity Buyout ($27.75M)** - See **Section IV.A** for details
2. **Asset Purchase Structure or Section 338(h)(10) Election** - See **Section IV.K** for details
3. **Escrow $20M, 36-Month Staggered Release** - See **Section IV.L** for details
4. **MediSupply DME Kickback Termination Within 24 Hours** - See **Section IV.I** for details
5. **Medical Director Fee Reduction to FMV ($640K-$800K)** - See **Section IV.A** for details

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Physician Financial Relationship Cascade

Dr. Mitchell's 15% equity ownership combined with $1.44M annual medical director compensation ($640K-$960K above FMV) creates interconnected regulatory exposure spanning three federal fraud statutes.

**Primary Finding**: Dr. Mitchell STARK/AKS violation (see **Section IV.A**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **FCA Liability (Section IV.B)**: Every Medicare claim submitted for Dr. Mitchell's 180 annual referrals constitutes a false certification under implied certification theory per *Tuomey* precedent
- **Tax Structure (Section IV.K)**: Mandatory equity buyout ($27.75M) triggers Dr. Mitchell capital gains tax ($6.6M), which cannot be structured as rollover due to ongoing STARK violation
- **Corporate Practice (Section IV.G)**: Independent contractor classification required for CPOM compliance creates tension with IRS 20-factor test analysis

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $61.71M-$71.60M (95.7% of total weighted risk)

### B. Jacksonville Regulatory Concentration

Jacksonville's February 2024 condition-level infection control deficiency (68% hand hygiene) triggers cascading regulatory scrutiny across state and federal oversight bodies.

**Primary Finding**: Jacksonville infection control deficiency (see **Section IV.E**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **CHOW Approval (Section IV.F)**: 45% probability AHCA imposes enhanced oversight ($375K Year 1), 12% probability 3-6 month delay ($5.55M financing cost)
- **Medicare Home Health Compliance (Section IV.C)**: Federal CoP parallel citation under 42 C.F.R. § 484.80 creates dual federal-state enforcement exposure
- **Insurance Coverage (Section IV.J)**: February-July 2024 deficiency period creates potential patient injury claims requiring E&O tail coverage

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $15.09M weighted (includes quality improvement NPV + CHOW scenarios)

### C. Commercial Contract Kickback Exposure

The MediSupply DME "marketing services agreement" paying $500 per DME order creates AKS tainted claims liability independent of Dr. Mitchell STARK violations.

**Primary Finding**: MediSupply DME kickback (see **Section IV.I**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **FCA Liability (Section IV.B)**: Tainted claims doctrine renders all DME-related Medicare claims false regardless of medical necessity
- **Insurance Coverage (Section IV.J)**: D&O policy defense costs $2.56M-$6.8M if DOJ investigation; tail coverage required
- **CIA Coordination (Section IV.A)**: Single Corporate Integrity Agreement covers both Dr. Mitchell STARK and MediSupply AKS violations ($1.35M PV)

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $16.09M weighted

### D. Transaction Structure Tax Optimization

Asset purchase structure election determines whether $23.58M tax benefit offsets regulatory exposure or is forfeited entirely.

**Primary Finding**: Section 338(h)(10) ineligibility (see **Section IV.K**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Purchase Price Economics**: Asset purchase preserves tax benefit but may trigger seller gross-up demand ($0-$15M depending on target tax basis)
- **IRR Impact**: Risk-adjusted IRR drops from 23.8% (asset purchase) to ~18% (stock purchase without step-up)
- **Closing Timeline**: Asset purchase requires more complex documentation but no 338(h)(10) eligibility verification

**Tax Benefit Preservation**: $23.58M NPV (Class V tangible $3.18M + Class VI intangibles $6.62M + Class VII goodwill $13.78M)

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section Reference |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Purchase Price Reduction | $30M | $21.1M | $15M | Section IV.L |
| Escrow Amount | $25M | $20M | $15M | Section IV.L |
| Escrow Duration | 48 months | 36 months | 24 months | Section IV.L |
| Indemnity Cap (Healthcare Fraud) | 50% of PP | 27% of PP | 20% of PP | Section IV.B |
| Survival Period (STARK/AKS) | 7 years | 6 years | 5 years | Section IV.B |
| Dr. Mitchell Buyout | $27.75M (non-negotiable) | $27.75M | Transaction fails | Section IV.A |
| Jacksonville Earnout | $0 (included in base) | $5M if 3-star | $7.5M if 3-star | Section IV.C |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **Dr. Mitchell STARK Exposure**: Documented 80-200% above-FMV compensation creates clear regulatory violation; Seller has limited defense
2. **Jacksonville Condition-Level History**: Recent deficiency (February 2024) provides factual basis for CHOW delay risk premium
3. **MediSupply Agreement Documentation**: Per-referral payment structure ($500/order) fails AKS safe harbor on its face

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| # | Expected Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence Basis |
|---|--------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | "Dr. Mitchell compensation reflects specialized expertise" | HIGH | FMV benchmarks ($60K-$100K/agency) are industry-specific; $180K is 80-200% excess | Sullivan Cotter, MGMA data |
| 2 | "Jacksonville deficiency was corrected" | HIGH | 94% compliance still 1% below threshold; AHCA enhanced oversight precedent | July 2024 resurvey data |
| 3 | "OASIS overcoding was inadvertent error" | MEDIUM | 43% rate across 30-patient sample indicates systematic failure | OIG October 2023 audit |
| 4 | "MA plans won't terminate for technical credentialing gaps" | MEDIUM | 42 C.F.R. § 422.504(i)(4)(iv) mandates annual audit; >25% deficiency = revocation | NCQA standards |

## VI. TIMELINE & CRITICAL PATH

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Risk Level | Section Reference |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Due Diligence Completion | +30 days | MA credentialing audit, OASIS sampling | MEDIUM | Section IV.H |
| CHOW Applications Filed (16 CCNs) | +45 days | Georgia/Florida/SC license applications | HIGH | Section IV.F |
| Dr. Mitchell Buyout Agreement | +60 days | STARK remediation coordination | CRITICAL | Section IV.A |
| MediSupply Termination | Closing Day | OIG SDP preparation | HIGH | Section IV.I |
| FL AHCA CHOW Approval | +105 days | Jacksonville enhanced oversight resolution | HIGH | Section IV.F |
| OIG Voluntary Disclosures Filed | +90 days post-close | Legal counsel coordination | HIGH | Section IV.B |
| Transaction Closing | +120 days | All CHOW approvals obtained | | |

### Critical Path Risks

- **Jacksonville CHOW Delay**: 12% probability of 3-6 month extension pending additional AHCA audits ($5.55M financing cost)
- **36-Month Rule Verification**: Must confirm no 2022-2024 hospice CCN ownership changes that reset 36-month clock
- **Qui Tam Filing Risk**: 60-90 day window between knowledge and voluntary disclosure creates whistleblower exposure
