    "time_based_classification_applied": "ONE_TIME: Vermont captive recapture $730M, IUL settlement $40M, market conduct fines $1.1M, WARN Act $6.41M, FINRA filing $250K. MULTI_YEAR: RBC capital injection $150M + long-term maintenance $250M contingent (5-year horizon), Global Re 2030 recapture $245M weighted (5-year PV), holding company capacity $550M capital raise (multi-year availability). PERPETUAL: Agent attrition $220M annually (NPV $2.75B at 8% discount, used 5-year PV $455M for practical calculation).",
    "correlation_adjustments_applied": "Vermont captive (CRIT-001) and holding company capacity (CRIT-002) are CORRELATED (correlation 0.9) - both driven by Liberty Life Holdings $280M net worth constraint and $730M parental guarantee. Probability of both occurring simultaneously is 10-15% (tied to captive recapture probability), not additive. Agent retention (HIGH-003) and long-term RBC maintenance (HIGH-006) are CORRELATED (correlation 0.7) - agent attrition reduces premium income which erodes TAC growth, impacting RBC trajectory. Mitigation of HIGH-003 directly benefits HIGH-006. IUL litigation (HIGH-001) and market conduct violations (HIGH-005) are WEAKLY CORRELATED (correlation 0.3) - both involve IUL illustration issues, but separate regulatory vs. litigation domains.",

      "test_1_coverage_ratio": "Escrow $185M ÷ probability-weighted total $280.7M = 0.659 (65.9% coverage) - ADEQUATE per test parameters (50-75% range)",
      "test_2_largest_exposure": "Escrow $185M ÷ largest single exposure $730M Vermont captive = 0.253 (25.3% coverage) - DOES NOT cover largest individual risk, but mitigated by $400M LOC as closing condition (LOC substitutes for escrow in this case)",
      "test_3_time_horizon": "Tier 1 captive 36 months ALIGNED with Vermont captive risk timeline (LOC procurement + AG48 compliance demonstration). Tier 2 treaties 18 months ALIGNED with consent review periods (6-9 months Global Re + 6-month buffer). Tier 3 general 24 months ALIGNED with survival periods (financial statements 24mo, compliance 24mo, contracts 18mo). NO MISMATCHES detected."
