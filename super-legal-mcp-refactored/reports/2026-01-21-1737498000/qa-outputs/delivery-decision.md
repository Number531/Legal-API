## ORCHESTRATOR ACTIONS

### IMMEDIATE: Present Client Decision

The memorandum has achieved **CERTIFY_WITH_LIMITATIONS** status. The orchestrator should present the client with two options:

**Option A: ACCEPT CURRENT VERSION** (Recommended)
- **File**: final-memorandum-v2.md
- **Score**: 88.4% (Pass 2, post-remediation)
- **Status**: CERTIFIED WITH LIMITATIONS
- **Delivery**: Immediate
- **Use Case**: M&A transaction diligence, Board review, contract drafting
- **Limitations**: 3 documented (Questions format, partial CREAC headers, minor advocacy language)

**Option B: REQUEST CYCLE 2 REMEDIATION** (Optional)
- **Projected Score**: 93-94%
- **Effort**: 25-35 minutes
- **Status**: Would achieve READY FOR CERTIFICATION
- **Use Case**: Gold-standard format compliance required
- **Tasks**: 3 remaining (9 Questions, 14 CREAC headers, 7 advocacy instances)

---

## IF OPTION A SELECTED

**Orchestrator Steps**:
1. Mark memorandum as DELIVERED
2. Provide client with:
   - `/Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-21-1737498000/final-memorandum-v2.md`
   - `/Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-21-1737498000/qa-outputs/final-qa-certificate.md`
   - `/Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-21-1737498000/qa-outputs/delivery-decision.md`
   - `/Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-21-1737498000/qa-outputs/certification-summary.json`
3. Close session with SUCCESS status
4. Document certification in session metadata

**Client Communication**:
```
Your legal memorandum has been CERTIFIED FOR DELIVERY with documented limitations.

Final Score: 88.4% (Senior Associate/Junior Partner Quality)
Improvement: +9.2 percentage points from initial assessment

The memorandum is ready for:
- Board of Directors presentation
- M&A transaction execution
- Purchase agreement contract drafting (APPENDIX C included)
- Regulatory filing support

Documented Limitations:
1. Questions Presented: 3 of 12 in gold-standard format (substantively excellent)
2. CREAC Structure: 17 of 31 findings with formal headers (reasoning present throughout)
3. Minor advocacy language: 7 technical instances (contextually appropriate)

These limitations do not materially impair the memorandum's utility for transaction purposes.

Optional: Request Cycle 2 remediation (25-35 min) for 93%+ certification.
```

## IF OPTION B SELECTED

**Orchestrator Steps**:
1. Read `/Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-21-1737498000/qa-outputs/diagnostic-assessment-pass2.md` for Cycle 2 task list
2. Generate Cycle 2 remediation dispatch with 3 tasks:
   - **Task C2-W1-001**: Reformat 9 Questions Presented (12-15 min, research-plan-refiner)
   - **Task C2-W2-001**: Apply CREAC headers to 14 secondary findings (15-20 min, memo-remediation-writer)
   - **Task C2-W3-001**: Optional advocacy language replacement (5-8 min, memo-remediation-writer)
3. Execute Cycle 2 remediation tasks (sequential execution)
4. Invoke memo-qa-diagnostic for Pass 3 (final verification)
5. Invoke memo-qa-certifier for final certification
6. Deliver with READY FOR CERTIFICATION status (projected 93-94% score)

## DECISION RATIONALE

The 88.4% score with CERTIFY_WITH_LIMITATIONS status reflects:

**Strengths**:
- Exceptional substantive legal analysis across 10 domains
- Comprehensive draft contract language (APPENDIX C: 11,149 words, 3 articles, 26 sections)
- Outstanding citation quality (1,015 footnotes, 95.8% verification rate)
- Sophisticated quantification with disclosed methodology ($280.7M aggregate exposure)
- No CRITICAL or HIGH unresolved issues

**Limitations**:
- Questions Presented: 3 of 12 in correct format (substantively excellent but format partial)
- CREAC Structure: 17 of 31 findings with formal headers (reasoning present throughout)
- Minor advocacy language: 7 contextually appropriate instances

**Comparison to Certification Thresholds**:

| Threshold | Score | Status | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|--------|------------|
| **Full Certification** | **93%+** | **NOT MET** | 4.6 points below threshold |
| **Certification with Limitations** | **88%+** | **✅ MET** | 0.4 points above threshold |
| **Reject (Loop)** | **<88%** | **NOT APPLICABLE** | 0.4 points above rejection |

**Conclusion**: The documented limitations do not materially impair the memorandum's utility for M&A transaction diligence. Option A (immediate delivery) is recommended unless client specifically requires gold-standard format compliance.

**Client Decision Point**: Does the benefit of 93%+ score justify 25-35 minutes of additional work, or is 88.4% with documented limitations sufficient for transaction purposes?
