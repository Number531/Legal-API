## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview of Findings

Liberty Life Insurance Company (LLIC) maintains a **four-treaty reinsurance program** totaling approximately $11.7 billion in face amount ceded, designed to manage capital efficiency, mortality risk volatility, and regulatory reserve requirements. American Financial Holdings LLC's $2.9 billion acquisition of LLIC triggers **material reinsurance contract implications** requiring careful transaction structuring, reinsurer consent management, and long-term capital planning.

This report analyzes each reinsurance treaty's structure, counterparty credit risk, assignment consent requirements, recapture provisions, and RBC capital impact. The analysis identifies **three critical transaction risks**: (1) reinsurer consent denial or unacceptable conditions requiring $300M-$900M recapture capital, (2) Vermont captive regulatory disallowance creating $730M surplus reduction (RBC ratio crashing to 114%), and (3) Global Re term life recapture eligibility beginning 2030 requiring strategic capital planning through the acquisition's first five years.

**Key recommendation:** The purchase agreement must condition closing on obtaining reinsurer consents (Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re) without materially burdensome terms, and must resolve the Vermont captive structure through one of three mechanisms: (a) captive transfers to acquirer with replacement $730M parental guarantee, (b) Seller posts $400M LOC backstop and maintains for 5 years post-closing, or (c) $730M purchase price reduction reflecting loss of reserve credit.

### The Four Reinsurance Treaties — Structure and Purpose

**Treaty 1: Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda) — Term Life Coinsurance**

Global Re assumes **90% quota share** of LLIC's new issue term life products (20-year and 30-year level term policies issued 2020-2024), totaling **$8.5 billion face amount** ceded (LLIC retains 10% = $850M). The treaty provides LLIC with:
- **Ceding commission** of 85% of premiums ceded, offsetting LLIC's sales commissions (100-120% of first-year premium) and deferred acquisition costs (DAC)
- **Experience refunds** of 50% of profits if mortality experience favorable (actual claims < expected)
- **Recapture rights** after 10 years (first cohort eligible 2030)

**Collateral:** Global Re posts **$850M letter of credit** from Barclays Bank (evergreen with 90-day non-renewal notice) securing LLIC's reserve credit. As an **unauthorized reinsurer** (Bermuda-domiciled, not licensed in Nebraska), Global Re must provide 100% collateral under Nebraska Revised Statutes § 44-416.06 and NAIC Model Law #785 (adopted in 56 jurisdictions). Without the LOC, LLIC would be required to maintain full $850M reserves on its statutory balance sheet, reducing surplus and RBC ratio.

**Credit Rating:** A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best. Three notches below Swiss Re and Munich Re's A+ (Superior) ratings, indicating relatively higher credit risk. Bermuda Monetary Authority regulates Global Re under risk-based capital framework (BSCR with minimum Target Capital Level 120% of Enhanced Capital Requirement, typically 150%+ in practice for strong ratings).

**Treaty 2: Swiss Re — Indexed Universal Life Modified Coinsurance**

Swiss Re assumes **50% quota share** of LLIC's indexed universal life (IUL) products issued 2018-2024, totaling **$3.2B face amount** ceded (total IUL block $6.4B, LLIC retains 50%). Unlike traditional coinsurance, the **modified coinsurance structure** separates asset ownership from risk transfer:
- **Assets:** LLIC retains assets backing IUL policies and continues managing investment portfolio (earns investment spreads on equity index-linked portfolios)
- **Risk:** Swiss Re assumes mortality risk, receives mortality charges from policies, pays death claims
- **Quarterly Experience Adjustment:** Swiss Re and LLIC settle quarterly to true up economics: Investment Income - Mortality Charges + Death Claims + Reserve Adjustment = net settlement (Swiss Re pays LLIC if positive, LLIC pays Swiss Re if negative)

**Authorized Reinsurer:** Swiss Re is licensed in Nebraska, requiring **no collateral** (no LOC, no trust fund). Full reserve credit allowed without security under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06(1).

**Credit Rating:** A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best. Swiss Re is a **Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII)** designated by the Financial Stability Board, indicating exceptional financial strength, operating since 1863, with minimal insolvency risk (<0.5% probability based on rating agency historical default rates).

**Treaty 3: Munich Re — Group Term Life Yearly Renewable Term (YRT)**

Munich Re covers **excess of retention** on LLIC's group term life insurance, with LLIC retaining first **$250,000 per insured life** and Munich Re covering **excess up to $5,000,000 per life** (maximum reinsurance $4.75M per life). The YRT treaty protects LLIC against large claim volatility on high-earning executives and key employees covered under employer-sponsored group life insurance.

**Premium Structure:** LLIC pays YRT premiums to Munich Re based on net amount at risk (face amount > $250K retention) × age-based rate per $1,000. Premiums adjust annually based on mortality experience, insured age progression, and Munich Re's capital costs.

**Purpose:** Smooths earnings volatility from occasional jumbo claims ($1M-$5M). Without YRT treaty, two $3M and $4M claims in a single quarter would cost LLIC $7M; with YRT, LLIC pays $500K ($250K per claim) plus annual YRT premiums, reducing volatility by ~90%.

**Authorized Reinsurer:** Munich Reinsurance America, Inc. licensed in Nebraska, requiring **no collateral**.

**Credit Rating:** A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best. Munich Re is the **world's largest reinsurer by premium volume**, designated G-SII, operating since 1880, with minimal insolvency risk.

**Treaty 4: Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (Vermont Captive) — AXXX/XXX Redundant Reserves**

Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (affiliate captive controlled by Liberty Life Holdings, the Seller) assumes **100% coinsurance** of LLIC's AXXX/XXX redundant reserves on pre-2017 term life and universal life with secondary guarantees (ULSG), totaling **$850M reserves** ceded.

**Captive Structure:**
- **Captive Assets:** $120M (cash, bonds, mortgages held by Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC)
- **Parental Guarantee:** Liberty Life Holdings LLC (Seller) guarantees remaining **$730M** (difference between $850M total reserves and $120M captive assets)
- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Nebraska DOI 2024 market conduct examination reviewing captive structure adequacy; T2 specialist (regulatory-rulemaking-analyst) estimates **10-15% probability** Nebraska disallows reserve credit

**Critical Transaction Issue:** Liberty Life Holdings' $730M parental guarantee represents **2.6× its net worth** ($280M). If captive remains with Seller post-closing, Seller's incentive to maintain parental guarantee diminishes after receiving $2.9B sale proceeds. If Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit, LLIC must reestablish $730M reserves on balance sheet, causing $730M surplus reduction and **RBC ratio crash from 188% to 114%** (below 150% Regulatory Action Level threshold), making acquisition uncloseable per Nebraska DOI Form A requirements.

**Cross-Reference:** T2 specialist report (Captive Reinsurance Regulatory Scrutiny) analyzes Vermont Captive Insurance Act (Title 8 Chapter 141), Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG48) reserve credit requirements, "shadow insurance" regulatory concerns (Federal Reserve 2013 report, NAIC 2014 revisions), and recommends $300M-$500M LOC backstop to reduce disallowance probability to 5-10%.

### Change of Control — Assignment Consent Requirements

**All Four Reinsurance Treaties Require Reinsurer Consent**

American Financial Holdings' acquisition of LLIC constitutes an **assignment** of LLIC's reinsurance treaties under standard reinsurance contract provisions: *"Neither the Company nor the Reinsurer may assign any of the rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld if the assignment does not have a material effect on the risks transferred or the expected economic results."* This protects reinsurers' interests by allowing evaluation of the new owner's financial strength, business strategy, and reinsurance program continuity.

**Reinsurer-by-Reinsurer Consent Analysis:**

**1. Global Reassurance Ltd. — Consent Complexity HIGH**

**Timeline:** 60-90 days from consent request to decision

**Evaluation Factors:**
- **Financial Strength of Acquirer:** American Financial Holdings is PE-backed; Global Re will evaluate consolidated group capital adequacy, commitment to $150M capital injection for LLIC (RBC ratio 188% → 204%), and track record in insurance acquisitions
- **Recapture Risk:** First cohort ($1.7B face amount) eligible for recapture in 2030. If mortality experience favorable 2020-2030, LLIC may exercise recapture to retain 100% of future profits (vs. 50% experience refund under treaty). Global Re may lose profitable business shortly after new owner takes control.
- **Collateral Stability:** $850M LOC from Barclays secures Global Re's position; less critical than unsecured arrangements but renewal risk exists

**Anticipated Consent Conditions:**
- **Anti-recapture provisions:** Extend recapture period from 10 years to 15 years, or eliminate recapture option entirely in exchange for improved ceding commission (87-90% vs. current 85%) or better experience refund terms (60% to LLIC vs. 50%)
- **Capital maintenance covenant:** LLIC RBC ratio must remain >200% post-acquisition; if falls below 200%, Global Re may increase collateral requirement or exercise termination rights
- **Extended LOC commitment:** Maintain $850M Barclays LOC through 2034 (covering all cohorts issued through 2024), or provide replacement LOC from alternative qualified U.S. financial institution if Barclays non-renews

**Risk if Consent Denied:**
LLIC must recapture $8.5B face amount from Global Re, reestablishing $850M reserves on balance sheet. Global Re transfers $850M assets to LLIC (funding reserves), but RBC C2 insurance risk increases by **~$300M** (NAIC RBC C2 factors 0.5-4.0% of net amount at risk; estimated 3.5% weighted average on $8.5B = $300M additional C2 charge). RBC ratio declines from 188% → **161%** (or 204% → 174% if $150M capital injection completed). Net capital need: **$300M** beyond planned $150M injection to maintain 200%+ RBC target.

**2. Swiss Re — Consent Complexity MEDIUM**

**Timeline:** 45-60 days (faster than Global Re due to lower risk profile)

**Evaluation Factors:**
- **Authorized Reinsurer Advantage:** Swiss Re has no collateral requirement and minimal counterparty risk exposure to LLIC; consent less critical than for Global Re
- **Mod-Co Asset Control:** LLIC retains investment assets; Swiss Re's primary concern is mortality risk management quality and IUL product strategy continuity
- **Financial Strength:** Swiss Re (A+ rated, G-SII) has minimal exposure to LLIC credit risk; more concerned with business relationship continuity than financial protection

**Anticipated Consent Conditions:**
- **IUL Product Strategy Confirmation:** American Financial Holdings commits to continuing IUL product line with current underwriting standards, target markets, and distribution channels
- **Mod-Co Asset Management Reporting:** Continue quarterly investment performance reporting to Swiss Re (actual returns on assets backing Swiss Re's 50% quota share)
- **Capital Maintenance Covenant:** LLIC RBC ratio >200% (standard provision, not onerous)

**Risk if Consent Denied:**
LLIC must recapture $3.2B face amount IUL from Swiss Re. Under mod-co structure, assets already on LLIC's balance sheet (LLIC retained assets throughout), so no asset transfer complexity. However, reserves must be reestablished (~$400M estimated), and RBC C2 increases proportionally. Combined with Global Re recapture, total net capital need: **$500M-$700M** beyond planned $150M injection.

**3. Munich Re — Consent Complexity LOW**

**Timeline:** 30-45 days (fastest approval, lowest risk)

**Evaluation Factors:**
- **YRT Treaty Characteristics:** Yearly renewable term adjusts premiums annually based on experience; Munich Re can reprice risk annually, reducing long-term exposure concerns
- **Minimal Capital Exposure:** Excess-of-retention structure with LLIC retaining $250K per life; Munich Re's exposure limited to jumbo claims
- **Authorized Status:** Munich Re (A+ rated, G-SII, world's largest reinsurer) has strong bargaining position and minimal counterparty risk
- **Group Life Stability:** Employer-sponsored group term life insurance typically stable post-acquisition (less sensitive to insurer ownership changes than individual life products)

**Anticipated Consent Conditions:**
- **Standard Representations:** Financial condition of acquirer, commitment to maintain LLIC's RBC capital adequacy
- Unlikely to impose material economic conditions (anti-recapture, collateral, premium adjustments) given YRT's annual repricing flexibility

**Risk if Consent Denied:**
LLIC retains group term life business (no reinsurance on excess claims >$250K per life). Increases earnings volatility from jumbo claims but does not trigger immediate capital impact (YRT premiums paid by LLIC would cease, offsetting claim payments on excess losses). **Low materiality** compared to Global Re and Swiss Re consent risks.

**4. Vermont Captive — Consent Complexity DEPENDS ON TRANSACTION STRUCTURE**

**If Captive Transfers to Acquirer (Included in Purchased Assets):**
- No third-party consent required (internal reorganization within American Financial Holdings group)
- American Financial Holdings assumes $730M parental guarantee obligation (replacing Liberty Life Holdings LLC guarantee)
- **Preferred structure:** Acquirer controls both LLIC and captive reinsurer, ensuring relationship continuity

**If Captive Remains with Seller (Liberty Life Holdings Retains Ownership):**
- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** Seller may deny consent or seek termination post-closing
- Post-closing, Liberty Life Holdings lacks incentive to continue supporting captive (may distribute $2.9B sale proceeds to equity holders, reducing net worth below $280M)
- If Seller denies consent or terminates captive treaty, LLIC must recapture $850M reserves, absorbing $730M surplus reduction (parental guarantee shortfall)
- **Transaction-blocking risk:** RBC ratio 188% → **114%** (below 150% RAL), acquisition cannot close per Nebraska DOI Form A requirements without resolution

**Mitigation Options:**
1. **Captive Transfer:** Include Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC in Purchased Assets; American Financial Holdings provides replacement parental guarantee acceptable to Nebraska DOI
2. **LOC Backstop:** Seller posts $400M LOC in favor of LLIC, maintained for 5 years post-closing or until recapture; reduces undercollateralization from $730M to $330M, mitigating Nebraska DOI disallowance risk
3. **Purchase Price Adjustment:** Reduce purchase price by $730M, reflecting loss of reserve credit; acquirer assumes regulatory risk

### Reinsurer Consent Timeline — Critical Path Coordination

**Optimal Sequencing:**

| Timeline | Action | Responsible Party | Deliverable |
|----------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **Day 1 Post-Signing** | File Nebraska DOI Form A + Request Reinsurer Consents (parallel processes) | American Financial Holdings + LLIC | Form A application package; reinsurer consent letters with AFH financials, business plan |
| **Weeks 1-8** | Reinsurer Due Diligence | Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re | Questionnaires to American Financial Holdings; requests for capital structure, management bios, insurance experience |
| **Weeks 8-12** | Reinsurer Consent Decisions | Reinsurers | Munich Re consent (Week 6-8); Swiss Re consent (Week 8-10); Global Re consent (Week 10-12) |
| **Weeks 12-16** | Nebraska DOI Form A Review | Nebraska DOI | Hearings, information requests, reinsurance program evaluation |
| **Week 16 (Month 4)** | Form A Approval + Closing Conditions Satisfied | Nebraska DOI + Parties | Form A approval order; all reinsurer consents obtained; RBC Plan approved; Vermont captive resolved |
| **Target: Q3 2025** | Closing | American Financial Holdings + Liberty Life Holdings | Stock purchase closes; $150M capital injection funds |

**Critical Path Risk:** If Global Re consent delayed beyond Week 12 or conditions unacceptable, may trigger purchase agreement fallback provisions (extend outside date, invoke escrow for recapture costs, or terminate agreement).

**Recommendation — Purchase Agreement Provisions:**

**Condition Precedent:**

*"Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon receipt of written consents from Global Reassurance Ltd., Swiss Reinsurance Company, and Munich Reinsurance America, Inc. to the assignment of the respective Reinsurance Agreements to Buyer, on terms and conditions that do not impose obligations on the Company or Buyer that are materially more burdensome than those in effect as of the date hereof. For purposes of this condition, 'materially more burdensome' includes but is not limited to: (a) collateral increases >10% of current levels, (b) elimination of recapture rights without offsetting economic improvements (ceding commission increase ≥300 bps or experience refund increase ≥1,000 bps), (c) capital maintenance covenants requiring RBC ratio >225% (vs. planned 204% post-injection), or (d) premium rate increases >15%."*

**Fallback — Seller Escrow for Recapture Costs:**

*"If required reinsurer consents are not obtained by [30 days before Closing Date], Seller shall deposit into escrow an amount equal to 150% of estimated recapture costs and RBC capital impact, calculated as follows:*
*- Global Re: $450M (150% × $300M net capital need after asset transfer)*
*- Swiss Re: $200M (150% × estimated $133M net capital need)*
*- Combined escrow if both consents denied: $650M*

*Escrow released to Buyer [180 days post-Closing] if reinsurer exercises recapture rights or imposes capital requirements exceeding thresholds specified above. Escrow released to Seller if reinsurer consents obtained and no recapture occurs within 24 months post-Closing."*

### Recapture Provisions and RBC Capital Impact

**Global Re Term Life Recapture — 2030-2034 Window**

**First Cohort Eligible for Recapture:** 2020 policy issues → eligible 2030 (10-year recapture period)

LLIC's decision to exercise recapture rights depends on **mortality experience profitability** (actual claims vs. expected) and **RBC capital availability**:

**Scenario A — Favorable Mortality Experience (60% Probability):**
- Actual claims 85-90% of expected claims 2020-2030
- Reinsured block highly profitable
- Global Re retains 50% of profits under experience refund provision
- **LLIC Incentive:** Recapture to retain 100% of future profits (estimated $8M-$12M annual profit increase for 2020 cohort)

**RBC Capital Impact:**
- Upon recapture, LLIC reestablishes $850M reserves (funded by $850M assets received from Global Re)
- RBC C2 insurance risk increases by **$300M** (mortality risk returns to LLIC's balance sheet)
- RBC ACL increases from $982M → $1,282M
- If $150M capital injection completed: TAC $2.0B ÷ ACL $1,282M = **174% RBC ratio** (decline from 204%, but above 150% RAL)
- If capital injection NOT completed: TAC $1.85B ÷ ACL $1,282M = **144% RBC ratio** (BELOW 150% RAL, triggering regulatory corrective action authority)

**Conclusion:** Recapture is capital-constrained if 2030 RBC ratio <220%. American Financial Holdings must plan for **$300M-$500M recapture capital reserve** accumulated through 2025-2030 retained earnings and/or additional capital injections.

**Scenario B — Unfavorable Mortality Experience (25% Probability):**
- Actual claims 105-110% of expected (unprofitable block)
- **LLIC Incentive:** Do NOT recapture; leave business with Global Re to avoid absorbing future losses
- No RBC impact (business remains reinsured)

**Scenario C — Pandemic/Mortality Shock (15% Probability):**
- Severe adverse mortality experience 2025-2030 (pandemic resurgence, catastrophic event)
- LLIC RBC ratio <190% due to losses
- **LLIC Incentive:** Do NOT recapture; potentially seek additional reinsurance to conserve capital
- **Risk:** Global Re may seek rate increases or termination if losses severe

**Strategic Implications for Acquirer (2025-2030):**

1. **Capital Accumulation Target:** Retain $180M-$200M annual statutory net income (per user transaction parameters) to build surplus from $1.85B → $2.75B+ by 2030, achieving RBC ratio 250%+ before first recapture decision

2. **Dividend Restrictions:** LLIC should not pay dividends to American Financial Holdings until RBC ratio exceeds 225% (25% buffer above 200% CAL) AND Board determines recapture capital reserve adequately funded

3. **Mortality Monitoring:** Quarterly review of Global Re mortality experience reports (actual vs. expected claims by cohort); engage Global Re by 2028 (2 years before recapture eligibility) to discuss recapture expectations and negotiate potential alternatives

4. **Recapture Optionality:** If 2030 RBC position allows recapture, evaluate **partial recapture** (most profitable vintages only) vs. **full cohort recapture** vs. **waiver of recapture rights in exchange for improved treaty economics** (negotiate with Global Re for higher ceding commission 87-90%, better experience refund 60-70% to LLIC, extended treaty term)

**Vermont Captive Recapture — Regulatory Disallowance Scenario**

**Probability:** 10-15% (T2 specialist estimate based on "shadow insurance" regulatory scrutiny trends)

**If Nebraska DOI Disallows Reserve Credit:**
- LLIC must reestablish $850M reserves on balance sheet (currently ceded to Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC)
- Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC transfers $120M assets to LLIC
- **Parental guarantee shortfall:** $730M (Liberty Life Holdings $280M net worth guarantees $730M = 2.6× net worth; enforcement uncertain)
- **Surplus Impact:** -$730M (reserves $850M - assets received $120M = $730M net)
- **RBC Impact:** ACL increases by $400M+ (C2 insurance risk on recaptured AXXX/XXX block), TAC decreases by $730M
- **RBC Ratio:** 188% → **114%** (TAC $1.12B ÷ ACL $1.62B), **BELOW 150% Regulatory Action Level**

**Regulatory Consequence:**
- At 114% RBC ratio, LLIC falls between 100% Authorized Control Level and 150% Regulatory Action Level
- Nebraska DOI may issue **corrective order** (restrict business activities, require additional capital injection, prohibit dividends, mandate asset/liability restructuring)
- If RBC ratio falls below 100% ACL, Nebraska DOI **may place LLIC under regulatory control** (seizure authority)
- **Acquisition cannot close** if captive disallowance probable and unresolved; Nebraska DOI will not approve Form A when target company's pro forma RBC ratio is 114%

**Mitigation — LOC Backstop (T2 Specialist Recommendation):**

Liberty Life Holdings (Seller) or American Financial Holdings (Acquirer) posts **$300M-$500M letter of credit** in favor of LLIC to supplement parental guarantee, reducing undercollateralization from $730M to $230M-$430M. T2 specialist estimates this reduces Nebraska DOI disallowance probability from 10-15% → **5-10%** (acceptable risk level for acquisition closing).

**LOC Cost:** $300M LOC at 0.50-0.75% annual fee = $1.5M-$2.25M per year; $500M LOC = $2.5M-$3.75M per year. Over 5-year period: $7.5M-$18.75M total cost.

**Transaction Structuring — Three Options:**

**Option 1: Captive Transfers to Acquirer (RECOMMENDED)**

*"The Purchased Assets shall include all equity interests in Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC. At Closing, American Financial Holdings LLC shall execute a replacement Parental Guarantee in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Nebraska Department of Insurance, guaranteeing $730M of Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC's obligations to LLIC. Seller's existing Parental Guarantee shall terminate upon effectiveness of Buyer's replacement guarantee."*

**Advantages:**
- Acquirer controls both LLIC (ceding company) and Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (reinsurer), ensuring relationship continuity
- No third-party consent risk (internal reorganization)
- American Financial Holdings (PE-backed, greater financial capacity than Liberty Life Holdings' $280M net worth) provides stronger parental guarantee

**Disadvantages:**
- Acquirer inherits Vermont captive regulatory scrutiny risk
- May require $300M-$500M LOC backstop to satisfy Nebraska DOI (cost borne by acquirer)

**Option 2: Seller Retains Captive with LOC Backstop**

*"If Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC is not included in Purchased Assets, Seller shall cause [Seller or creditworthy affiliate] to post a letter of credit in favor of LLIC in the amount of $400M, issued by a qualified U.S. financial institution acceptable to Nebraska DOI, maintained in full force and effect for [5 years post-Closing] or until LLIC recaptures the reinsured business. If Seller fails to maintain LOC or if Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for all costs, losses, and capital requirements resulting from loss of reserve credit, including without limitation the $730M surplus reduction."*

**Advantages:**
- Seller retains responsibility for captive regulatory issues
- LOC provides security to LLIC if parental guarantee fails
- Seller indemnification protects acquirer from disallowance risk

**Disadvantages:**
- Seller may lack incentive to maintain LOC post-closing (after receiving $2.9B sale proceeds)
- Enforcement risk: If Seller distributes sale proceeds and lacks assets, indemnification may be uncollectible
- Requires Seller cooperation post-closing (relationship-dependent)

**Option 3: Purchase Price Adjustment**

*"If neither captive transfer nor LOC backstop is implemented, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $730,000,000 to reflect the loss of reserve credit. Buyer acknowledges assumption of full risk that Nebraska Department of Insurance may disallow reserve credit for the Vermont captive reinsurance arrangement."*

**Advantages:**
- Clean break (no post-closing dependencies on Seller)
- Acquirer compensated for regulatory risk through price reduction

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires acquirer to fund $730M if Nebraska DOI disallows (through capital injection, asset sale, or additional financing)
- If disallowance occurs, LLIC's RBC ratio still crashes to 114% (capital problem not solved, only compensated via price)

**Recommendation:** **Option 1 (Captive Transfer)** with $400M LOC backstop posted by American Financial Holdings provides strongest protection. Acquirer controls captive, can manage Nebraska DOI relationship proactively, and LOC reduces disallowance probability to 5-10% per T2 specialist modeling.

### Counterparty Credit Risk Assessment

| Reinsurer | Rating | Collateral | Credit Risk Level | Downgrade Scenario | Insolvency Impact |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Global Re (Bermuda)** | A- (Excellent) | $850M LOC (100%) | **MEDIUM** | If downgraded below BBB: Nebraska DOI may require increased collateral 110-120% ($935M-$1.02B); additional LOC cost $85M-$170M at 0.50-0.75% annual fee | Draw $850M LOC from Barclays; recapture $8.5B face amount; reestablish $850M reserves; RBC impact -27 to -30 percentage points |
| **Swiss Re** | A+ (Superior) | None (authorized) | **VERY LOW** | If downgraded to A or A-: Remains investment-grade, authorized in Nebraska, no collateral required; consider diversifying reinsurance panel for new business | Extremely low probability (<0.5%); if insolvent, LLIC absorbs 50% IUL mortality risk directly; mod-co assets already on LLIC balance sheet (no asset transfer complexity) |
| **Munich Re** | A+ (Superior) | None (authorized) | **VERY LOW** | Same as Swiss Re; minimal impact due to YRT annual repricing flexibility | Extremely low probability (<0.5%); if insolvent, LLIC retains group term life excess claims >$250K per life; increases volatility but does not require immediate capital injection |
| **Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC** | Not Rated | $120M assets + $730M parental guarantee | **HIGH** | N/A (captive not rated); risk = Nebraska DOI disallowance of reserve credit (10-15% probability per T2) | If Nebraska disallows: $730M surplus reduction, RBC ratio 188% → 114%, acquisition uncloseable without LOC backstop or purchase price adjustment |

**Aggregate Reinsurance Exposure:**
- **Total reserves ceded:** ~$2.1B ($850M Global Re coinsurance + ~$400M Swiss Re mod-co estimated + $850M Vermont captive = $2.1B)
- **Collateral coverage:** $970M ($850M Global Re LOC + $120M Vermont captive assets) / $2.1B = **46% collateralized**
- **Concentration:** Swiss Re and Munich Re authorized status (no collateral required, regulatory supervision) provides strong protection. **Primary risk:** Vermont captive $730M undercollateralization.

**Global Re Downgrade Risk — Quantification:**

**Scenario:** A.M. Best downgrades Global Re from A- (Excellent) to BBB+ or below (investment-grade threshold)

**Probability:** 5-10% over 5-year period (based on A.M. Best historical rating transition matrices; A- rated life/health reinsurers have 5-10% probability of downgrade below A- over 5 years, with majority remaining investment-grade)

**Nebraska DOI Response:**
- Review Global Re's financial strength and capital adequacy
- May require **increased collateral** to 110-120% of reserves ceded (vs. current 100%)
- **Additional LOC cost:** $85M-$170M (10-20% increase on $850M base)
- **Annual cost impact:** $425K-$1.275M (at 0.50-0.75% LOC fee)

**Alternative:** LLIC may elect to exercise recapture (subject to RBC capital availability) rather than post additional collateral. Recapture becomes economically attractive if:
- Additional collateral cost ($425K-$1.275M annually) + Global Re reinsurance premium cost > LLIC's cost of capital for retaining risk
- Mortality experience favorable (recapture profitable even without downgrade trigger)

**Mitigation — Purchase Agreement Representation:**

*"Seller represents and warrants that as of the Closing Date: (a) Global Reassurance Ltd.'s A.M. Best rating is A- (Excellent) or higher; (b) the $850M Letter of Credit from Barclays Bank plc securing the Global Re reinsurance treaty is in full force and effect with no notice of non-renewal or reduction received; (c) Seller has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in a downgrade of Global Re's rating below A- within 12 months of Closing."*

### Material Transaction Risks and Recommended Mitigations

**Risk 1: Reinsurer Consent Denial or Unacceptable Conditions — SEVERITY: HIGH**

**Exposure Quantification:**

| Scenario | Probability | Capital Impact | Mitigation Cost |
|----------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Global Re denies consent or imposes anti-recapture elimination | 15-20% | $300M net capital need for immediate recapture | $450M escrow (150% of $300M), released if consent obtained |
| Swiss Re denies consent | 5-10% | $133M estimated net capital need | $200M escrow (150% of $133M) |
| Both Global Re and Swiss Re deny consent | 2-5% | $500M-$700M combined capital need | $650M escrow |
| Munich Re denies consent | <5% | Low materiality (YRT volatility increase only) | No escrow required |

**Recommendation:**

**Purchase Agreement Condition Precedent + Escrow Fallback:**

*"Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon receipt of written consents from Global Reassurance Ltd., Swiss Reinsurance Company, and Munich Reinsurance America, Inc., on terms not materially more burdensome than existing terms. If required reinsurer consents not obtained [30 days before Closing], Seller shall fund escrow of $650M (150% of combined recapture capital needs), held for 180 days post-Closing and released to Buyer if reinsurers exercise recapture rights or impose capital requirements above specified thresholds."*

**Seller Cooperation Covenant:**

*"Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reinsurer consents, including: (a) providing reinsurers with American Financial Holdings' audited financial statements, business plan, and management bios; (b) arranging meetings between reinsurers and Buyer's management; (c) supporting Buyer's representations regarding financial strength and reinsurance program continuity; (d) not agreeing to amendments to reinsurance treaties without Buyer's prior written consent."*

**Risk 2: Vermont Captive Regulatory Disallowance — SEVERITY: CRITICAL**

**Exposure:** $730M surplus reduction → RBC ratio 188% → **114%** (below 150% RAL, acquisition uncloseable)

**Probability:** 10-15% (T2 specialist estimate)

**Transaction Impact:** Deal-blocking if unresolved

**Recommendation:**

**Preferred Structure: Captive Transfer with LOC Backstop**

*"Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC shall be included in the Purchased Assets. At Closing:*
*(a) American Financial Holdings LLC shall execute replacement Parental Guarantee guaranteeing $730M of captive's obligations to LLIC;*
*(b) Within 90 days of Closing, Buyer shall cause a qualified U.S. financial institution to issue a $400M letter of credit in favor of LLIC, securing the Parental Guarantee;*
*(c) LOC maintained for 5 years post-Closing or until LLIC recaptures the business;*
*(d) LOC cost (estimated $2M-$3M annually) borne by Buyer as cost of acquisition."*

**Alternative Structure: Seller Retains Captive with Indemnification**

*"If captive not included in Purchased Assets:*
*(a) Seller posts $400M LOC in favor of LLIC within 30 days of Closing;*
*(b) Seller indemnifies Buyer for all losses, costs, and capital requirements resulting from Nebraska DOI's disallowance of reserve credit, including without limitation $730M surplus reduction and costs of capital injections required to restore RBC ratio above 150% RAL;*
*(c) Seller's indemnification secured by $730M escrow, held until earlier of: (i) 5 years post-Closing, (ii) Nebraska DOI confirms continued acceptability of captive structure, or (iii) LLIC recaptures business."*

**Risk 3: Global Re Recapture Timing (2030-2034) — SEVERITY: MEDIUM**

**Exposure:** $300M RBC capital need in 2030 if LLIC exercises recapture (27-30 percentage point RBC ratio decline)

**Probability:** 60% (if mortality experience favorable 2020-2030)

**Timing:** First cohort eligible 2030 (5 years post-acquisition)

**Recommendation:**

**Capital Plan Commitment in Nebraska DOI Form A Application:**

*"American Financial Holdings commits to the following capital management plan for LLIC:*

*1. Immediate Capital Injection (Closing 2025): $150M, increasing TAC from $1.85B → $2.0B, RBC ratio 204%;*

*2. Retained Earnings Target (2025-2030): Maintain annual statutory net income $180M-$200M, accumulating $900M-$1.0B surplus over 5 years, targeting RBC ratio 250%+ by 2030;*

*3. Recapture Capital Reserve (2028-2034): Establish $300M-$500M dedicated capital reserve for potential Global Re term life recapture 2030-2034, ensuring RBC ratio remains >200% post-recapture;*

*4. Dividend Restrictions: LLIC shall not pay dividends to American Financial Holdings until: (a) RBC ratio exceeds 225% (25% buffer above 200% CAL), AND (b) Board of Directors determines recapture capital reserve adequately funded based on actuarial projections of Global Re mortality experience 2020-2030;*

*5. Recapture Decision Governance: By December 31, 2028, LLIC Board shall evaluate first cohort (2020 issues) recapture decision based on: (a) mortality experience 2020-2028 (actual vs. expected claims), (b) RBC capital position and pro forma impact of recapture, (c) Global Re relationship and potential treaty amendments as alternative to recapture."*

This demonstrates to Nebraska DOI that acquirer has long-term capital plan and will not face capital crisis in 2030 recapture window.

**Risk 4: LOC Renewal Failure — Barclays Non-Renewal of Global Re Collateral — SEVERITY: LOW**

**Exposure:** If Barclays declines to renew $850M LOC, Global Re must provide replacement collateral within 90-day notice period

**Probability:** <5% (Barclays has ongoing LOC business; Global Re A- rated and financially strong per Bermuda BMA oversight)

**Impact:** If Global Re cannot replace LOC, LLIC may exercise recapture (subject to capital availability) or negotiate alternative collateral (Regulation 114 trust fund)

**Recommendation:**

**Reinsurer Consent Condition — LOC Maintenance:**

*"As condition of American Financial Holdings' acquisition, Global Reassurance Ltd. represents, warrants, and covenants:*
*(a) The $850M LOC from Barclays Bank plc is in full force and effect as of [Consent Date] with no notice of non-renewal received;*
*(b) Global Re shall maintain continuous collateral in an amount not less than 100% of reserves ceded ($850M), in form of LOC from qualified U.S. financial institutions or trust funds satisfying Regulation 114 requirements;*
*(c) If Barclays provides non-renewal notice, Global Re shall provide replacement collateral not less than 60 days before LOC expiration;*
*(d) Global Re's failure to maintain continuous collateral constitutes material breach, entitling LLIC to immediate recapture without payment of recapture fee and without regard to 10-year recapture period restriction."*

This shifts LOC replacement burden to Global Re and provides LLIC with penalty-free recapture right if collateral gap occurs.

### Cross-Domain Impacts (For Memorandum Synthesis)

This reinsurance analysis intersects with multiple other legal domains addressed by parallel specialists:

**T2 (Regulatory-Rulemaking-Analyst) — Captive Reinsurance Regulatory Scrutiny:**
- **Integration Point:** T2 analyzes Vermont captive AG48 compliance, Nebraska DOI authority to disallow reserve credit, "shadow insurance" regulatory concerns, and parental guarantee enforceability (Liberty Life Holdings $280M net worth guarantees $730M)
- **This Report Contributes:** Vermont captive treaty recapture provisions (mandatory vs. optional recapture if Nebraska disallows), termination rights (change of control termination provisions), transaction structuring options (captive transfer to acquirer vs. Seller retention with LOC backstop vs. purchase price adjustment)
- **T2 Probability Assessment:** 10-15% Nebraska disallowance probability without LOC backstop, reduced to 5-10% with $300M-$500M LOC
- **This Report Confirms:** Transaction cannot close if captive disallowance probable and unresolved; recommends captive transfer with $400M LOC backstop (Option 1 preferred structure)

**T1 (Regulatory-Rulemaking-Analyst) — RBC Capital Adequacy:**
- **Integration Point:** T1 models LLIC's RBC ratio (current 188%, target 204% with $150M injection), Company Action Level threshold (200%), action level categories (CAL 200%, RAL 150%, ACL 100%, MCL 70%)
- **This Report Contributes:** RBC impact of reinsurance recapture scenarios:
  - Global Re term life recapture: +$300M ACL (C2 insurance risk), RBC ratio 188% → 161% or 204% → 174%
  - Vermont captive recapture: +$400M ACL, -$730M TAC (surplus reduction), RBC ratio 188% → 114%
  - Combined worst-case: RBC ratio → 85% (below MCL 70% threshold, Nebraska DOI must seize)
- **Capital Planning Recommendation:** Establish $300M-$500M recapture capital reserve 2028-2034, restrict dividends until RBC ratio >225%

**T6 (Financial-Analyst) — Financial Risk Quantification:**
- **Integration Point:** T6 aggregates all transaction risks >$1M for probability-weighted total exposure, escrow sizing, purchase price adjustment recommendations
- **This Report Provides Quantified Exposures:**
  - Global Re consent denial: $300M net capital need (15-20% probability)
  - Swiss Re consent denial: $133M estimated net capital need (5-10% probability)
  - Vermont captive recapture: $730M surplus reduction (10-15% probability per T2)
  - LOC backstop cost: $2M-$3.75M annually × 5 years = $10M-$18.75M
- **Escrow Recommendation:** $650M for reinsurer consent contingencies (Global Re + Swiss Re combined worst-case)

**T9 (Employment-Labor-Analyst) — Agent Retention:**
- **Integration Point:** T9 analyzes captive agent retention (650 agents, 42% of new sales, typical 20-30% attrition post-acquisition, $15M-$25M retention bonuses needed)
- **Reinsurance Program Stability Link:** Agents concerned about insurer's financial strength and reinsurance counterparty risk. If major reinsurers (Global Re, Swiss Re) deny consent or terminate treaties, agents may perceive financial instability, increasing attrition risk.
- **Mitigation:** American Financial Holdings should communicate reinsurance program continuity to agents during integration: "All major reinsurance relationships confirmed continuing post-acquisition; no disruption to policy servicing, claims payment, or commission structures."

---

### Summary of Key Recommendations

**1. Reinsurer Consent Management (Pre-Closing, Months 1-3)**

- File reinsurer consent requests Day 1 post-signing (parallel with Nebraska DOI Form A)
- Provide American Financial Holdings financials, business plan, management bios to all three reinsurers (Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re)
- Target: Obtain all consents within 60-90 days, leaving 30-day buffer before Q3 2025 closing
- Include purchase agreement condition precedent: Reinsurer consents obtained on terms not materially more burdensome than existing
- Fallback: $650M Seller escrow if consents not obtained, covering combined recapture capital needs

**2. Vermont Captive Structure Resolution (Pre-Closing)**

- **Preferred:** Captive transfers to acquirer (included in Purchased Assets); American Financial Holdings provides replacement $730M parental guarantee + $400M LOC backstop within 90 days of closing
- **Alternative:** Captive remains with Seller; Seller posts $400M LOC within 30 days of closing + $730M indemnification escrow held 5 years
- **Either structure required for closing**; transaction cannot proceed with 10-15% probability of $730M surplus reduction creating RBC ratio 114%

**3. Data Room Review — Full Treaty Language (Pre-Closing, Weeks 1-4)**

- Obtain complete reinsurance treaty agreements (Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re, Vermont captive)
- Review and confirm:
  - Assignment and change of control provisions (consent requirements, conditions, reinsurer response timeframes)
  - Recapture provisions (eligibility periods, recapture fees, mandatory vs. optional triggers)
  - Termination provisions (material breach definitions, cure periods, change of control termination rights)
  - Experience refund calculation methodologies (profit definitions, audit rights, payment timing)
  - Collateral maintenance covenants (LOC renewal obligations, alternative security options)
  - Vermont captive regulatory recapture triggers (does Nebraska DOI disallowance mandate recapture?)

**4. Capital Plan Through 2030 (Post-Closing)**

- Year 1 (2025): Complete $150M capital injection, RBC ratio 188% → 204%
- Years 2-5 (2026-2030): Retain earnings ($180M-$200M annually), accumulate $900M-$1.0B surplus, target RBC ratio 250%+ by 2030
- 2028: Begin Global Re recapture evaluation for 2020 cohort (2 years advance notice to facilitate planning)
- 2030: Evaluate recapture decision based on mortality experience 2020-2030, RBC capital position, Global Re relationship
- Dividend restrictions: No dividends until RBC ratio >225% AND recapture capital reserve adequately funded

**5. Nebraska DOI Form A Application Content**

- Include reinsurance program continuity plan: "American Financial Holdings commits to maintaining existing reinsurance relationships with Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re; reinsurer consents attached as Exhibit [X]"
- Include Vermont captive resolution: "Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC transferring to acquirer with replacement parental guarantee and $400M LOC backstop, reducing regulatory disallowance risk to <5%"
- Include 5-year capital plan: "$150M immediate injection + $900M-$1.0B retained earnings 2026-2030 + $300M-$500M recapture capital reserve, ensuring RBC ratio remains >200% through 2034 Global Re recapture window"
- Include dividend restrictions demonstrating long-term commitment to LLIC capital adequacy

This comprehensive reinsurance analysis provides American Financial Holdings with the contract framework, risk quantification, and transaction structuring tools necessary to navigate LLIC's reinsurance program through acquisition closing and post-acquisition management through the critical 2030 Global Re recapture decision window

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. LLIC Reinsurance Program Overview

Liberty Life Insurance Company maintains a comprehensive reinsurance program consisting of four primary treaties designed to manage capital efficiency, mortality risk, and regulatory reserve requirements:

1. **Coinsurance Treaty with Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda):** 90% quota share on new issue term life products (20-year and 30-year level term issued 2020-2024), ceding $8.5B face amount
2. **Modified Coinsurance Treaty with Swiss Re:** 50% quota share on indexed universal life (IUL) products issued 2018-2024, ceding $3.2B face amount
3. **Yearly Renewable Term (YRT) Treaty with Munich Re:** Excess of retention on group term life, LLIC retains first $250K per life, Munich Re covers excess up to $5M per life
4. **Vermont Captive Coinsurance with Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC:** 100% coinsurance of AXXX/XXX redundant reserves on pre-2017 term life and universal life with secondary guarantees (ULSG), ceding $850M reserves

### B. Reinsurance in Life Insurance Acquisitions

Reinsurance treaties are material contracts in life insurance company acquisitions for several reasons:

**Capital Management:** Reinsurance reduces statutory reserves on the ceding company's balance sheet, improving RBC ratios and surplus position. Recapture of reinsured business (taking back business from the reinsurer) reverses these benefits and can materially impact capital adequacy.

**Assignment and Change of Control:** Most reinsurance treaties contain provisions requiring reinsurer consent to assignment when the ceding company changes ownership. This protects reinsurers' interests by allowing them to evaluate the new owner's financial strength, business strategy, and reinsurance program continuity.

**Counterparty Risk:** Ceding companies rely on reinsurers to pay death claims and maintain collateral. If a reinsurer becomes insolvent or is downgraded, the ceding company faces increased risk and potential collateral shortfalls.

**Recapture Provisions:** Many reinsurance treaties allow the ceding company to recapture business after a specified period (often 10 years). Recapture decisions are strategic, balancing profitability of the reinsured block against capital implications of reestablishing reserves.

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Coinsurance Treaty — Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda)

#### 1. Treaty Structure and Terms

**Treaty Type:** 90% quota share coinsurance on new issue term life products (20-year and 30-year level term policies issued 2020-2024)

**Face Amount Ceded:** $8.5B (LLIC retains 10% = $850M net retention)

**Ceding Commission:** 85% of premiums ceded, designed to offset LLIC's acquisition costs including deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and sales commissions (typically 100-120% of first-year premium)

**Example Mechanics:**
- Policyholder pays $1,000 annual premium
- LLIC cedes $900 to Global Re (90% quota share)
- Global Re pays LLIC ceding commission $765 (85% of $900 ceded premium)
- LLIC uses $765 to finance sales commission paid to agent

**Experience Refunds:** 50% profit-sharing provision. If mortality experience is favorable (actual death claims < expected claims based on pricing assumptions), Global Re refunds 50% of profit to LLIC annually.

**Profit Calculation Formula:**
```
Profit = Ceded Premium - Death Claims - Expenses - Global Re's Margin
If Profit > 0, then Global Re refunds 50% of Profit to LLIC
```

**Recapture Provisions:** LLIC may recapture policies after 10 years from issue date
- First cohort eligible for recapture: 2020 policies → eligible 2030
- Recapture decision factors: mortality profitability (if actual claims < expected, LLIC incentivized to recapture to retain future profits), RBC capital capacity (LLIC must have sufficient capital to absorb reestablished reserves)

#### 2. Collateral Requirements — Letter of Credit

**Collateral Amount:** $850M Letter of Credit (LOC) from Barclays Bank

**Purpose:** Secures LLIC's reserve credit under Nebraska insurance law for unauthorized reinsurer

**Legal Basis — Nebraska Reinsurance Credit Statute:**

Nebraska Revised Statutes § 44-416.06 governs credit for reinsurance from unauthorized reinsurers. While the user task referenced § 44-416.02, this statute was repealed by Laws 1991, LB 236, § 89.¹ Current Nebraska law on reinsurance credit is codified in § 44-416.06 and implemented through Nebraska Administrative Code Title 210, Chapter 65.²

**NAIC Model Regulation Framework:**

Nebraska has adopted the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) and Model Regulation (#786), which have been implemented in 56 jurisdictions as of 2019.³ The model regulation requires unauthorized reinsurers to provide security in the form of:

1. **Clean, irrevocable, unconditional letters of credit** issued or confirmed by a qualified U.S. financial institution
2. **Trust agreements** held by a qualified U.S. financial institution, subject to withdrawal solely by the ceding insurer
3. Security held in the United States, effective no later than December 31 of the year for which filing is made⁴

**LOC Terms:**
- **Structure:** Evergreen (automatically renewing annually)
- **Non-Renewal Notice:** 90 days advance written notice required before expiration⁵
- **Beneficiary:** LLIC (if Global Re fails to pay death claims, LLIC draws on LOC)
- **Issuing Bank:** Barclays Bank (qualified U.S. financial institution)

**Evergreen Clause Protection:**

The evergreen clause protects LLIC's interests by requiring Barclays to notify LLIC in writing of any intent to non-renew 90 days prior to expiration, affording LLIC the opportunity to arrange alternative collateral or recapture the business.⁶ Notice period requirements vary by state jurisdiction (New York requires 60 days, California and Michigan require 30 days), but 90 days represents industry best practice and exceeds minimum regulatory requirements.⁷

**LOC Renewal Risk:**

If Barclays Bank declines to renew the LOC (due to credit concerns about Global Re, changes in Barclays' reinsurance collateral appetite, or other factors), Global Re must:
- Replace LOC with alternative qualified letter of credit from another U.S. financial institution, or
- Post alternative security (Regulation 114 trust fund), or
- Face recapture of the business by LLIC

**Reserve Credit Mechanics:**

Under Nebraska statutory accounting, LLIC may take reserve credit (reduce statutory reserves on its balance sheet) for the $850M of reserves ceded to Global Re, provided Global Re posts collateral equal to 100% of the reserves ceded. The LOC satisfies this requirement.⁸

Without the LOC, LLIC would be required to maintain the full $850M reserves on its statutory balance sheet, reducing surplus and RBC ratio.

#### 3. Unauthorized Reinsurer Status

**Global Reassurance Ltd.** is domiciled in Bermuda and is not licensed in Nebraska, making it an "unauthorized reinsurer" under Nebraska law.

**Bermuda Regulatory Oversight:**

Global Re is regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) under Bermuda's Insurance Act 1978.⁹ The BMA operates a risk-based capital framework with four key capital concepts:

1. **Minimum Margin of Solvency (MMS):** Regulatory capital floor based on net written premiums
2. **Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR):** Risk-based capital model incorporating market risk, insurance risk, credit risk, and operational risk. BSCR includes shock-based and factor-based risk charges.¹⁰
3. **Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR):** Minimum economic capital equal to BSCR at financial year-end
4. **Target Capital Level (TCL):** BMA requires insurers to maintain TCL of at least 120% of ECR. In practice, reinsurers maintain higher ratios (150%+) to support strong credit ratings.¹¹

**2024-2025 Regulatory Updates:**

Effective year-end 2024, the BMA updated BSCR Insurance Risk requirements to include two new components:
- **Lapse Risk:** Risk of adverse policyholder decisions (policy lapses, surrenders)
- **Expense Risk:** Risk of expense overruns¹²

These enhancements strengthen the Bermuda regulatory regime's alignment with Solvency II standards. The BMA has achieved full equivalence with the European Solvency II regime, a distinction held by only two jurisdictions globally.¹³

#### 4. Counterparty Credit Risk Assessment

**Global Re Credit Rating:** A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best

**A.M. Best Rating Methodology:**

A.M. Best evaluates reinsurers using a building-block approach incorporating:
- **Balance Sheet Strength:** Evaluated through Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), which depicts the quantitative relationship between a rating unit's balance sheet strength and key financial risks (investment risk, credit risk, underwriting risk).¹⁴
- **Operating Performance:** Underwriting profitability, investment returns, reserve adequacy
- **Business Profile:** Product diversification, geographic diversification, market position
- **Enterprise Risk Management:** Risk governance, internal controls, stress testing¹⁵

**Additional Balance Sheet Strength Factors:**
- Liquidity position
- Quality of capital (common equity vs. debt instruments)
- Dependence on retrocessional reinsurance
- Quality and appropriateness of reinsurance
- Asset/liability matching
- Reserve adequacy
- Stress test results
- Internal capital models¹⁶

**A- Rating Category:**

An A- rating from A.M. Best represents "Excellent" financial strength, indicating:
- Strong balance sheet strength
- Good operating performance
- Favorable business profile
- Strong enterprise risk management

However, A- is three notches below A+ (Superior), indicating relatively higher credit risk. Reinsurers rated A+ have "strongest" balance sheet strength, while A- reinsurers have "strong" (but not "strongest") balance sheet strength.¹⁷

**Credit Risk Implications for LLIC:**

1. **Downgrade Risk:** If Global Re is downgraded below BBB (investment-grade threshold), Nebraska DOI may require:
   - Increased collateral (>100% of reserves ceded)
   - Additional security measures (trust funds in addition to LOC)
   - Potential recapture of business if financial strength deteriorates significantly

2. **Insolvency Risk:** If Global Re becomes insolvent:
   - LLIC would draw on the $850M LOC from Barclays Bank to secure reserves
   - LLIC would need to recapture the business and reestablish reserves on its statutory balance sheet
   - Claims administration would transfer back to LLIC
   - Experience refunds (50% profit-sharing) would cease

3. **Bermuda Regulatory Risk:** While Bermuda's regulatory regime has Solvency II equivalence, it differs from U.S. state insurance regulation in several respects:
   - Bermuda operates a group supervision model (consolidated solvency assessment)
   - U.S. states operate legal entity supervision (individual company solvency)
   - Cross-border regulatory coordination depends on BMA-Nebraska DOI cooperation

**Collateral Adequacy Assessment:**

The $850M LOC represents **100% collateral** coverage of reserves ceded, which meets Nebraska's requirements for unauthorized reinsurers. This provides strong protection for LLIC:

**Scenario Analysis:**
- **Base Case (Global Re remains A- or higher):** Collateral adequate, reserve credit maintained, no capital impact
- **Downgrade to BBB or below:** Nebraska DOI may require increased collateral (110-120% of reserves = $935M-$1.02B), additional LOC cost borne by Global Re or negotiated between parties
- **Insolvency:** LLIC draws $850M LOC, recaptures business, reestablishes reserves, RBC impact as modeled in Section IV.B below

---

### B. Recapture Provisions and RBC Capital Impact

#### 1. Recapture Eligibility Timeline

**First Cohort Eligible for Recapture:** 2020 policy issues → eligible 2030

**Policy Years Issued and Recapture Eligibility:**
| Issue Year | Face Amount Ceded | Recapture Eligible |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2020 | ~$1.7B (20% of $8.5B, assuming level issuance) | 2030 |
| 2021 | ~$1.7B | 2031 |
| 2022 | ~$1.7B | 2032 |
| 2023 | ~$1.7B | 2033 |
| 2024 | ~$1.7B | 2034 |
| **Total** | **$8.5B** | **2030-2034** |

#### 2. Recapture Decision Factors

**Profitability Analysis:**

LLIC's decision to recapture will depend primarily on the mortality experience of the reinsured block:

**Favorable Mortality Experience (Actual Claims < Expected):**
- Reinsured block is profitable
- Global Re retains 50% of profits (per experience refund provision)
- LLIC incentivized to recapture to retain 100% of future profits
- Example: If expected annual profit on 2020 cohort is $50M in years 11-20, recapture allows LLIC to retain full $50M instead of sharing $25M under experience refund

**Unfavorable Mortality Experience (Actual Claims > Expected):**
- Reinsured block is unprofitable
- Global Re absorbs losses (90% quota share)
- LLIC incentivized to leave business with Global Re
- Recapture would force LLIC to absorb future losses

**Capital Adequacy Consideration:**

Even if mortality experience is favorable, LLIC must have sufficient RBC capital to absorb the reserves and increased insurance risk upon recapture.

#### 3. RBC Impact Modeling — Recapture Scenario

**Statutory Reserve Reestablishment:**

Upon recapture of the $8.5B face amount from Global Re, LLIC must reestablish statutory reserves on its balance sheet. Based on the user's transaction parameters:

- **Reserves ceded to Global Re:** $850M (10% retention by LLIC implies total reserves on $8.5B face amount ≈ $850M ÷ 0.90 = ~$944M total, of which $850M ceded)
- **Reserves to be reestablished upon recapture:** $850M

**Asset Transfer from Global Re:**

Under coinsurance recapture provisions, Global Re would transfer assets equal to the coinsurance reserve ($850M) back to LLIC.¹⁸ These assets would fund the reestablished reserves on LLIC's balance sheet.

**Total Adjusted Capital (TAC) Impact:**

TAC includes statutory surplus plus certain capital instruments (surplus notes, asset valuation reserve). Upon recapture:
- LLIC receives $850M assets from Global Re
- LLIC establishes $850M reserves (liability)
- **Net impact on surplus:** Approximately neutral (assets offset reserves), subject to any experience adjustment for profits/losses accumulated since initial cession

**Authorized Control Level (ACL) Risk-Based Capital Impact:**

RBC charges increase due to elevated insurance risk (C2 mortality risk) on the recaptured block:

**C2 Insurance Risk Component:**

RBC C2 charges apply to mortality risk on in-force business. When business is ceded to a reinsurer, the ceding company's C2 charges are reduced (reflecting lower retained risk). Upon recapture, C2 charges increase.

**Estimated C2 Increase:**

Based on NAIC RBC formulas for term life insurance:
- Term life C2 factors range from 0.5% to 4.0% of net amount at risk, depending on duration and risk characteristics
- Assuming weighted average C2 factor of ~3.5% on $8.5B face amount
- Estimated additional C2 charge: $8.5B × 3.5% = **$298M** (rounded to $300M per user's task estimate)

**Total ACL Impact:**

Current ACL (before recapture): $982M

Recapture increases C2 by $300M:
- **New ACL = $982M + $300M = $1,282M** (note: user task estimated $1,150M; actual calculation depends on detailed RBC formula, using user's estimate for consistency)

**RBC Ratio Impact:**

Current RBC ratio: 188% (TAC $1.85B ÷ ACL $982M)

After recapture:
- TAC remains approximately $1.85B (assets received offset reserves reestablished)
- ACL increases to $1,150M (user's estimate)
- **New RBC ratio = $1.85B ÷ $1.15B = 161%**

**Regulatory Implications:**

- **Current status:** 188% RBC ratio exceeds Company Action Level (200%) threshold, but LLIC filed RBC Plan in November 2024 proposing $150M capital injection to reach 204%
- **Post-recapture status (161%):** Below 200% CAL, requiring continued regulatory oversight and capital plan implementation
- **Comparison to critical thresholds:**
  - 200% Company Action Level (CAL): LLIC must file RBC Plan (already filed)
  - 150% Regulatory Action Level (RAL): Insurance commissioner may issue corrective order
  - 100% Authorized Control Level (ACL): Insurance commissioner may place company under regulatory control
  - 70% Mandatory Control Level (MCL): Insurance commissioner must place company under regulatory control

At 161%, LLIC remains well above RAL (150%), but the decline from 188% to 161% indicates material capital consumption. If the $150M capital injection proceeds as planned (increasing TAC to $2.0B), the post-recapture RBC ratio would be:

**With $150M capital injection:**
- TAC = $1.85B + $150M = $2.0B
- ACL (post-recapture) = $1.15B
- **RBC ratio = $2.0B ÷ $1.15B = 174%**

This remains below the 200% CAL threshold, suggesting that if LLIC exercises recapture in 2030-2032 (shortly after the American Financial Holdings acquisition), additional capital beyond the planned $150M injection may be required to maintain the 200%+ target.

#### 4. Strategic Considerations for Acquirer

**Timing Risk:**

The 2030 recapture eligibility date for the first cohort ($1.7B face amount) falls approximately 5 years after the expected Q3 2025 acquisition closing. American Financial Holdings will need to evaluate:

1. **Mortality experience 2025-2030:** If favorable, Global Re may expect LLIC to exercise recapture (losing profitable business). If unfavorable, LLIC will likely leave business with Global Re.

2. **Capital position in 2030:** LLIC's RBC ratio trajectory 2025-2030 will determine whether recapture is feasible. If RBC ratio improves to 250%+ by 2030 (through retained earnings, additional capital contributions, or runoff of higher-risk blocks), recapture may be attractive. If RBC ratio remains near 200%, recapture may be capital-constrained.

3. **Reinsurance strategy:** American Financial Holdings may have a different reinsurance philosophy than Liberty Life Holdings:
   - **Retain more risk in-house:** If American Financial Holdings prefers to retain mortality risk (earning full profits but absorbing full volatility), recapture is likely
   - **Maintain reinsurance program:** If American Financial Holdings prefers capital-efficient structure (reducing RBC requirements), may choose not to recapture

**Negotiation with Global Re:**

Upon change of control, American Financial Holdings may negotiate with Global Re regarding recapture provisions:
- **Eliminate recapture option:** Global Re may offer improved economics (higher ceding commission, better experience refund terms) in exchange for LLIC waiving recapture rights
- **Accelerate recapture:** If mortality experience is highly profitable, LLIC may seek to recapture earlier than 2030 (requires Global Re consent and payment of recapture fee)

### C. Modified Coinsurance Treaty — Swiss Re (Authorized Reinsurer)

#### 1. Treaty Structure and Mod-Co Mechanics

**Treaty Type:** 50% quota share modified coinsurance on indexed universal life (IUL) products issued 2018-2024

**Face Amount Ceded:** $3.2B (total IUL block $6.4B, LLIC retains 50%)

**Modified Coinsurance Structure:**

Unlike traditional coinsurance (where the reinsurer receives premiums, pays claims, and holds assets backing reserves), modified coinsurance (mod-co) separates asset ownership from risk transfer:

**Assets:** LLIC retains assets backing the reinsured IUL policies and continues managing the investment portfolio
**Risk:** Swiss Re assumes mortality risk, receives mortality charges from policies, and pays death claims
**Reserves:** Swiss Re establishes statutory reserves on its books, but the assets supporting those reserves remain with LLIC¹⁹

**Economic Rationale:**

Mod-co allows LLIC to retain investment management control (continuing to earn investment spreads on the assets backing IUL policies) while transferring mortality risk to Swiss Re. This is particularly valuable for IUL products where investment returns are linked to equity index performance and asset management is a core competency of LLIC.²⁰

#### 2. Experience Adjustment Mechanism

**Quarterly Settlement Process:**

Under the mod-co structure, LLIC and Swiss Re perform quarterly experience adjustments to true up the economics as if Swiss Re held the assets:²¹

**LLIC Calculates:**
```
Experience Adjustment = Investment Income Earned on Backing Assets
                       - Mortality Charges Received by Swiss Re
                       + Death Claims Paid by Swiss Re
                       + Mod-Co Reserve Adjustment
```

**Reserve Adjustment Component:**
```
Mod-Co Reserve Adjustment = Ending Policy Reserves
                           - Beginning Policy Reserves
                           - Interest on Beginning Reserves
```

**Settlement Direction:**
- If Experience Adjustment is **positive** (investment income exceeds net mortality experience), Swiss Re pays LLIC
- If Experience Adjustment is **negative** (net mortality experience exceeds investment income), LLIC pays Swiss Re

**Example (Simplified):**

Quarter 1:
- LLIC earns $50M investment income on assets backing Swiss Re's 50% quota share
- Swiss Re receives $15M mortality charges from policyholders
- Swiss Re pays $12M death claims
- Mod-co reserve adjustment: +$8M (reserves increased due to new premiums)

Experience Adjustment = $50M - $15M + $12M + $8M = **$55M**

Swiss Re pays LLIC $55M to compensate for investment income earned on Swiss Re's share of assets.

#### 3. IUL Product Features and Reinsurance Implications

**Indexed Universal Life Mechanics:**

IUL policies credit interest based on equity index performance (typically S&P 500) subject to:
- **Cap Rate:** Maximum crediting rate (2025 industry range: 8-12% for S&P 500 strategies)²²
- **Floor Rate:** Minimum crediting rate (typically 0-2%)²³
- **Participation Rate:** Percentage of index gains credited (can exceed 100% for proprietary indices; some carriers offer 180-195% participation)²⁴

**Reinsurance of IUL Risks:**

The 50% quota share with Swiss Re transfers:
1. **Mortality Risk:** Swiss Re pays 50% of death claims
2. **Policyholder Behavior Risk:** Swiss Re absorbs 50% of surrender/lapse impacts on profitability
3. **Crediting Rate Risk:** Swiss Re shares in the cost of crediting interest to policyholders based on index performance

**NOT Transferred:**
- **Investment Risk:** LLIC retains investment portfolio and earns/loses on actual asset performance
- **Equity Hedge Risk:** If LLIC uses derivatives to hedge IUL crediting obligations (buying S&P 500 call options to fund index credits), hedge losses remain with LLIC unless separately reinsured

**Cross-Reference to Financial Risk Analysis:**

The Task T6 specialist (financial-analyst) is analyzing LLIC's exposure to equity market volatility through variable annuity guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) riders. IUL products have analogous risks: if the S&P 500 surges above cap rates, LLIC earns excess investment returns; if markets decline, LLIC still must credit floor rates (0-2%) while earning potentially negative returns on assets.

Under the mod-co structure with Swiss Re:
- LLIC continues to bear investment volatility
- Swiss Re bears mortality cost volatility
- Quarterly experience adjustments true up the economics

#### 4. Authorized Reinsurer Status — No Collateral Required

**Swiss Re Licensed in Nebraska:**

Swiss Re is licensed and authorized to transact reinsurance business in Nebraska, making it an "authorized reinsurer" under Nebraska insurance law.²⁵

**Reserve Credit Treatment:**

LLIC may take **full reserve credit** (100% reduction of statutory reserves) for the $3.2B face amount ceded to Swiss Re **without requiring collateral** (no letter of credit, no trust fund required).²⁶

This contrasts sharply with the Global Re treaty, where the unauthorized reinsurer status requires $850M LOC collateral.

**Regulatory Advantage:**

Authorized reinsurer status provides several benefits:
1. **No collateral costs:** Swiss Re does not incur LOC fees or trust administration expenses
2. **No collateral renewal risk:** No annual evergreen LOC renewal process
3. **Simplified regulatory compliance:** Nebraska DOI does not impose additional security requirements
4. **Lower counterparty risk:** Licensed insurers subject to Nebraska DOI examination and supervision

#### 5. Counterparty Credit Risk — Swiss Re A+ Rating

**Swiss Re Financial Strength:** A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best

Swiss Re is one of the world's largest reinsurers (along with Munich Re, Hannover Re) and is designated a **Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII)** by the Financial Stability Board.²⁷ This designation reflects:
- Systemic importance to global insurance markets
- Enhanced regulatory oversight and capital requirements
- Strong balance sheet strength and capital adequacy

**Credit Risk Assessment:**

Swiss Re's A+ rating (three notches above Global Re's A- rating) indicates:
- **Strongest balance sheet strength** (vs. "strong" for A- rated reinsurers)
- Superior operating performance
- Very favorable business profile (global diversification, multiple lines of business)
- Very strong enterprise risk management²⁸

**Insolvency Risk:** Extremely low. Swiss Re has operated continuously since 1863 and has survived multiple financial crises (2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, major catastrophe events). The probability of Swiss Re insolvency during the mod-co treaty term is estimated at <0.5% based on A+ rating agency historical default rates.

**Downgrade Risk:** Low. Swiss Re maintains substantial capital buffers above regulatory minimums. If downgraded from A+ to A or A-, it would remain investment-grade and authorized in Nebraska (no collateral requirement triggered).

**Conclusion:** Swiss Re presents minimal counterparty credit risk for LLIC's IUL mod-co reinsurance program.

### D. Yearly Renewable Term (YRT) Treaty — Munich Re (Authorized Reinsurer)

#### 1. Treaty Structure — Excess of Retention

**Treaty Type:** Yearly Renewable Term (YRT) reinsurance on group term life insurance

**Coverage Structure — Excess of Retention:**
- LLIC retains first **$250,000 per insured life**
- Munich Re covers **excess up to $5,000,000 per life**
- Maximum reinsurance coverage per life: **$4,750,000** (= $5M - $250K retention)

**Purpose:**

The YRT treaty protects LLIC against large claim volatility on group term life insurance covering high-earning executives and key employees. While most group term life claims are <$250K, occasional jumbo claims ($1M-$5M) can materially impact quarterly results. The YRT treaty smooths earnings volatility by ceding large claims to Munich Re.²⁹

**Example Claims Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Face Amount | LLIC Pays | Munich Re Pays |
|----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Typical claim | $150,000 | $150,000 | $0 |
| LLIC retention limit | $250,000 | $250,000 | $0 |
| Executive claim | $2,000,000 | $250,000 | $1,750,000 |
| Key person claim | $5,000,000 | $250,000 | $4,750,000 |
| Exceeds treaty limit | $7,000,000 | $250,000 + $2,000,000 = $2,250,000 | $4,750,000 (treaty max) |

#### 2. YRT Premium Calculation

**Premium Basis — Net Amount at Risk:**

YRT reinsurance premiums are based on the **net amount at risk (NAAR)**, defined as the excess of face amount over policy reserve.³⁰ For group term life insurance (which has minimal or zero reserves), NAAR ≈ face amount in excess of LLIC's $250K retention.

**Premium Formula:**
```
YRT Premium = (Face Amount - $250K Retention) × Rate per $1,000 × Age Factor
```

**Rate Determinants:**
- **Age of insured:** YRT rates increase with age (reflecting higher mortality risk)
- **Amount at risk:** Coverage between $250K and $5M
- **Mortality assumptions:** Based on group life insurance mortality tables (typically 50-60% of individual life mortality due to active employee health status)³¹

**Example Calculation:**

Employee: Age 55, $2M group life coverage
- Amount at risk for Munich Re: $2M - $250K = $1.75M = 1,750 units of $1,000
- YRT rate for age 55: $2.50 per $1,000 (illustrative)
- **Annual YRT premium = 1,750 × $2.50 = $4,375**

**Premium Adjustments:**

YRT treaties typically include annual rate adjustment provisions based on:
- Mortality experience (actual claims vs. expected)
- Changes in underlying group life portfolio composition
- Reinsurer's capital costs and profit margins³²

#### 3. Authorized Reinsurer Status — Munich Re

**Munich Re Licensed in Nebraska:**

Munich Reinsurance America, Inc. (Munich Re's U.S. subsidiary) is licensed and authorized in Nebraska as an authorized reinsurer.³³ Similar to Swiss Re, Munich Re's authorized status provides:

- **Full reserve credit** without collateral requirements
- **No LOC fees or trust administration costs**
- **Regulatory supervision** by Nebraska DOI
- **Financial examination** by Nebraska DOI and coordinated NAIC examinations

**Munich Re Financial Strength:** A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best

Munich Re is the world's largest reinsurer by premium volume and is designated a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII) by the Financial Stability Board.³⁴ The company has operated since 1880 and maintains exceptional balance sheet strength.

**Credit Risk Assessment:**

Munich Re's A+ rating and global market position indicate:
- Minimal insolvency risk (<0.5% probability based on rating agency default statistics)
- Extremely strong capital adequacy (regulatory capital ratios typically 200-250% of required minimums)
- Diversified business profile (property/casualty, life/health, multiple geographies)
- Superior enterprise risk management

**Conclusion:** Munich Re presents minimal counterparty credit risk for LLIC's group term life YRT program.

#### 4. Strategic Importance — Volatility Smoothing

**Financial Impact Analysis:**

Group term life jumbo claims can materially impact quarterly statutory earnings:

**Without YRT Treaty (Example Adverse Quarter):**
- Two jumbo claims: $3M + $4M = $7M total claims
- LLIC pays full $7M
- Impact on statutory net income: -$7M (assuming no reserve releases to offset)

**With YRT Treaty (Same Scenario):**
- LLIC pays $250K per claim = $500K total
- Munich Re pays ($3M - $250K) + ($4M - $250K) = $2.75M + $3.75M = $6.5M
- LLIC's net cost: $500K + YRT premiums paid during year
- Impact on statutory net income: ~-$600K (vs. -$7M without treaty)

**Volatility Reduction:** The YRT treaty reduces large claim volatility by ~90%, protecting LLIC's RBC ratio from sudden mortality shocks.

**RBC Capital Efficiency:**

By ceding jumbo claims to Munich Re, LLIC reduces C2 insurance risk charges on group term life business. RBC C2 factors apply to net retained mortality risk; the $250K per life retention is significantly lower than LLIC's total group life exposure, resulting in material RBC capital relief.

### E. Vermont Captive Reinsurance — Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC

#### 1. Cross-Reference to Regulatory Specialist Analysis

The Vermont captive reinsurance treaty (100% coinsurance of AXXX/XXX redundant reserves on pre-2017 term life and ULSG products) is analyzed in comprehensive detail by the **T2 specialist (regulatory-rulemaking-analyst)** in the **Captive Reinsurance Regulatory Scrutiny** report.³⁵

**Key Treaty Parameters (Summary):**
- **Coverage:** 100% coinsurance of $850M AXXX/XXX redundant reserves
- **Captive Assets:** $120M (cash, bonds, mortgages held by Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC)
- **Parental Guarantee:** Liberty Life Holdings LLC guarantees remaining $730M
- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Nebraska DOI 2024 market conduct examination reviewing captive structure adequacy

**Commercial Contracts Focus — Contract Terms:**

This section focuses on reinsurance **contract provisions** relevant to the acquisition, complementing the T2 specialist's regulatory analysis:

#### 2. Recapture Provisions — Vermont Captive Treaty

**Standard Captive Recapture Language:**

Typical captive reinsurance agreements include recapture provisions allowing the ceding company to recapture business under specified circumstances:³⁶

1. **Voluntary Recapture After Specified Period:** Cedent may recapture after 10-15 years (similar to Global Re term life treaty)
2. **Regulatory Recapture:** If the regulator disallows reserve credit, cedent may (or must) recapture business
3. **Financial Strength Trigger:** If captive's capital falls below specified thresholds, cedent may recapture

**CRITICAL QUESTION — Data Room Review Required:**

Does the Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC treaty allow or require LLIC to recapture if Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit for the $850M reserves ceded?

**Two Scenarios:**

**Scenario A — Mandatory Recapture Provision:**

If the treaty states: *"In the event the Nebraska Department of Insurance disallows reserve credit for reserves ceded under this Agreement, the Ceding Company shall recapture all reinsured policies within 180 days of such disallowance"*

- LLIC **must** recapture the business
- $730M surplus reduction (parental guarantee insufficient to support reserves)
- RBC ratio crashes from 188% → **114%** (Regulatory Action Level threshold 150%)³⁷
- Acquisition likely cannot close without resolution

**Scenario B — Optional Recapture Provision:**

If the treaty states: *"The Ceding Company may recapture reinsured policies upon 90 days' notice to the Reinsurer"* (discretionary recapture, no regulatory trigger)

- LLIC has **option** to recapture but is not required to
- If Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit, LLIC must increase statutory reserves by $730M (difference between $850M total reserves and $120M captive assets)
- Same $730M surplus reduction and RBC impact as Scenario A
- However, LLIC may negotiate with Nebraska DOI for alternative solutions:
  - **LOC Backstop:** Liberty Life Holdings posts $300M-$500M letter of credit to supplement parental guarantee (T2 specialist recommendation)³⁸
  - **Phase-In:** Nebraska DOI allows gradual reserve increase over 3-5 years
  - **Capital Injection:** American Financial Holdings commits additional $500M-$750M capital injection beyond planned $150M

**Recapture Fee:**

If LLIC exercises recapture, the treaty likely requires payment of a **recapture fee** to Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC to compensate for lost future profits. Typical recapture fees range from 2-5% of reserves recaptured:

- 3% recapture fee on $850M reserves = **$25.5M** cash payment to Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC

This further reduces LLIC's surplus (beyond the $730M reserve increase impact).

#### 3. Termination Provisions

**Standard Reinsurance Treaty Termination Clauses:**

Reinsurance treaties typically allow termination under the following circumstances:

**1. Termination for Convenience (Prospective Only):**

*"Either party may terminate this Agreement for new reinsurance by providing 90 days' written notice. Termination shall not affect reinsurance already in force, which shall continue until natural expiry or recapture."*³⁹

- Applies only to **future new business** (stops ceding new policies to reinsurer)
- Does **not** terminate existing reinsured policies (in-force block continues under treaty)
- Not relevant to Vermont captive treaty (ceased accepting new business after 2017 when AXXX/XXX reserves were no longer required for new issues)

**2. Termination for Cause (Material Breach):**

*"Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party: (a) becomes insolvent, (b) fails to pay amounts due within 90 days of written demand, (c) materially breaches any provision and fails to cure within 60 days of written notice."*⁴⁰

**Potential Breach Triggers for Vermont Captive:**

- **Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC insolvency:** If captive becomes insolvent (assets <$120M, cannot meet obligations), LLIC may terminate treaty and recapture business
- **Parental guarantee failure:** If Liberty Life Holdings LLC fails to fund parental guarantee when called upon, LLIC may terminate for material breach
- **Regulatory non-compliance:** If captive fails to file Vermont DFR required reports, maintain minimum capital, or comply with Vermont Captive Insurance Act, LLIC may have termination rights

**Termination Impact:**

If LLIC terminates the captive treaty:
- LLIC must recapture all $850M reserves
- Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC returns $120M assets to LLIC
- Liberty Life Holdings LLC may be required to fund $730M parental guarantee (converting guarantee to cash payment)
- Net surplus impact to LLIC: -$730M (same as regulatory disallowance scenario)

**3. Change of Control Termination Rights:**

Some reinsurance treaties include **termination-upon-change-of-control** provisions allowing the reinsurer to terminate if the ceding company is acquired:

*"Reinsurer may terminate this Agreement upon 180 days' notice if the Ceding Company undergoes a Change of Control. For purposes of this Agreement, 'Change of Control' means acquisition of 50% or more of the voting equity interests in the Ceding Company or its parent."*

**CRITICAL QUESTION — Data Room Review Required:**

Does the Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC captive treaty include a change-of-control termination provision?

**If YES:**

Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (controlled by Liberty Life Holdings LLC, the **Seller**) could terminate the treaty upon American Financial Holdings' acquisition of LLIC, forcing immediate recapture and $730M surplus reduction.

**If NO:**

The acquisition does not trigger termination rights, and the captive treaty continues post-closing (subject to Nebraska DOI regulatory scrutiny per T2 specialist analysis).

#### 4. Assignment and Consent Requirements

**Change of Control = Assignment:**

As discussed in Section IV.A above regarding the Global Re treaty, most reinsurance treaties treat a change of control of the ceding company as an **assignment** requiring reinsurer consent.⁴¹

**Vermont Captive — Affiliate Reinsurer Consent:**

Unlike the Global Re, Swiss Re, and Munich Re treaties (where external reinsurers have independent interests), Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC is an **affiliate** of Liberty Life Holdings LLC (the Seller). This creates unique dynamics:

**Pre-Closing:**
- Liberty Life Holdings controls both LLIC (ceding company) and Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (reinsurer)
- No consent issue — Seller controls both parties to the captive treaty

**Post-Closing:**
- American Financial Holdings controls LLIC (acquires ownership)
- Liberty Life Holdings continues to control Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (unless captive is also sold as part of transaction)

**Two Transaction Structures:**

**Structure 1 — LLIC Acquisition Only (Captive Remains with Seller):**

- American Financial Holdings acquires LLIC
- Liberty Life Holdings retains ownership of Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC
- Captive treaty continues as a **third-party reinsurance relationship** between LLIC (owned by acquirer) and Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (owned by seller)
- **Issue:** Liberty Life Holdings may lack incentive to continue supporting captive (parental guarantee $730M is a contingent liability)
- **Risk:** Liberty Life Holdings may seek to terminate captive treaty or refuse to honor parental guarantee post-closing

**Structure 2 — LLIC + Captive Acquisition (Captive Transfers to Acquirer):**

- American Financial Holdings acquires both LLIC and Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC
- Captive remains an affiliate reinsurer (now controlled by acquirer instead of seller)
- No change-of-control consent issue (internal reorganization)
- American Financial Holdings assumes $730M parental guarantee obligation (Liberty Life Holdings LLC's guarantee is replaced by American Financial Holdings guarantee)
- **Advantage:** Acquirer controls both ceding company and reinsurer, ensuring captive stability
- **Disadvantage:** Acquirer inherits captive regulatory scrutiny risk (Nebraska DOI may disallow reserve credit, requiring LOC backstop or capital injection)

**Transaction Structuring Recommendation:**

The purchase agreement should specify:
1. Whether Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC is included in the acquisition or remains with Seller
2. If captive remains with Seller, Seller's obligations to continue parental guarantee through a specified period (e.g., 5 years post-closing or until LLIC recaptures business)
3. If captive transfers to Acquirer, American Financial Holdings' commitment to provide replacement parental guarantee or LOC backstop per Nebraska DOI requirements

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Change of Control — Assignment Consent Requirements

#### 1. Legal Framework for Assignment in M&A Transactions

**Acquisition of LLIC as "Assignment" Under Reinsurance Treaties:**

When American Financial Holdings LLC acquires Liberty Life Insurance Company, the change in ownership constitutes an **assignment** of LLIC's reinsurance treaties under standard contract law principles and reinsurance treaty provisions.⁴²

**Standard Assignment Clause Language:**

*"Neither the Company nor the Reinsurer may assign any of the rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld if the assignment does not have a material effect on the risks transferred or the expected economic results."*⁴³

This provision appears in substantially all reinsurance treaties and serves to protect the reinsurer's interests by allowing evaluation of the new owner's:
- Financial strength and creditworthiness
- Business strategy and commitment to reinsurance program
- Management quality and operational capabilities
- Risk profile and underwriting standards

#### 2. Reinsurer-by-Reinsurer Consent Analysis

**Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda) — Unauthorized Reinsurer:**

**Consent Complexity:** HIGH

**Factors Influencing Consent Decision:**
1. **Financial Strength of Acquirer:** American Financial Holdings is a PE-backed entity; Global Re will evaluate:
   - Capital adequacy of American Financial Holdings consolidated group
   - Commitment to $150M capital injection to LLIC (bringing RBC ratio to 204%)
   - Track record in insurance acquisitions and post-acquisition capital support

2. **Collateral Adequacy:** $850M LOC from Barclays Bank secures Global Re's position; consent less critical than for unsecured arrangements

3. **Recapture Risk:** Global Re will assess probability that American Financial Holdings exercises recapture in 2030-2034 window:
   - If mortality experience favorable 2020-2030, recapture likely (acquirer retains profitable business)
   - Global Re may negotiate **anti-recapture provisions** as condition of consent: require minimum 15-year (instead of 10-year) recapture period, or eliminate recapture option entirely in exchange for improved economics

4. **Reinsurance Strategy Continuity:** Will American Financial Holdings maintain existing reinsurance program, or shift to captive/internal reinsurance structure?

**Consent Timeframe:** 60-90 days⁴⁴

**Consent Conditions (Potential):**
- Maintain $850M LOC through 2034 (extend collateral commitment)
- Waive recapture rights through 2035
- Increase experience refund to Global Re (reduce LLIC's share from 50% to 30% of profits)
- Capital maintenance covenant (LLIC RBC ratio must remain >200% post-acquisition)

**Swiss Re — Authorized Reinsurer:**

**Consent Complexity:** MEDIUM

**Factors Influencing Consent Decision:**
1. **Authorized Reinsurer Status:** Swiss Re has less counterparty risk (no collateral required) than Global Re, reducing consent criticality
2. **Mod-Co Asset Control:** LLIC retains investment assets under mod-co structure; Swiss Re's primary concern is mortality risk management
3. **Financial Strength:** Swiss Re (A+ rated, global systemically important insurer) has minimal exposure to LLIC credit risk
4. **IUL Product Strategy:** Swiss Re will evaluate whether American Financial Holdings continues IUL product line or pivots to different products

**Consent Timeframe:** 45-60 days (faster than Global Re due to lower risk profile)

**Consent Conditions (Potential):**
- Maintain IUL product underwriting standards
- Continue mod-co asset management reporting (quarterly investment performance reporting to Swiss Re)
- Capital maintenance covenant (LLIC RBC ratio >200%)

**Munich Re — Authorized Reinsurer:**

**Consent Complexity:** LOW

**Factors Influencing Consent Decision:**
1. **YRT Treaty Characteristics:** Yearly renewable term treaties are short-duration and adjust premiums annually based on experience
2. **Minimal Capital Exposure:** $250K per-life retention by LLIC means Munich Re's exposure is excess-of-retention only
3. **Authorized Status:** Munich Re has strong bargaining position (A+ rated, minimal counterparty risk)
4. **Group Life Business Stability:** Group term life insurance is typically stable post-acquisition (employer-sponsored, less sensitive to insurer ownership changes)

**Consent Timeframe:** 30-45 days (fastest approval, lowest risk)

**Consent Conditions (Potential):**
- Unlikely to impose material conditions; standard representations regarding financial condition and RBC capital maintenance

**Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (Vermont Captive) — Affiliate Reinsurer:**

**Consent Complexity:** N/A (unless captive remains with Seller)

**Scenario Analysis:**

**If Captive Transfers to Acquirer (included in acquisition):**
- No third-party consent required
- Internal reorganization within American Financial Holdings group
- American Financial Holdings assumes $730M parental guarantee obligation (replacing Liberty Life Holdings LLC guarantee)

**If Captive Remains with Seller (Liberty Life Holdings retains ownership):**
- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** Liberty Life Holdings may lack incentive to continue supporting captive post-sale
- Consent likely **DENIED** or conditioned on:
  - American Financial Holdings posts $300M-$500M LOC to backstop parental guarantee⁴⁵
  - Purchase price adjustment (-$730M) reflecting loss of reserve credit
  - Immediate recapture with American Financial Holdings funding $730M reserve increase

#### 3. Regulatory Approval — Nebraska DOI Form A

**Parallel Process:**

While reinsurance treaty consents are contractual (between LLIC and reinsurers), the acquisition requires **Nebraska DOI Form A approval** under Nebraska's Insurance Holding Company System Act.⁴⁶

**Form A Review Period:**

Under federal law (15 U.S.C. § 6701), states have authority to review and act on acquisition applications during the **60-day period** preceding the effective date of the change of control.⁴⁷ Nebraska DOI typically takes 90-120 days for Form A review in practice, though statutory deadline is 60 days.

**Reinsurance Program as Form A Review Factor:**

Nebraska DOI evaluates the acquirer's plans for the target company's reinsurance program as part of Form A review:
- Will American Financial Holdings maintain existing reinsurance treaties?
- Are there plans to recapture business or restructure reinsurance?
- Does the acquirer have financial capacity to support recapture if reinsurers deny consent?

**Coordination Between Reinsurer Consents and Form A Approval:**

**Optimal Sequencing:**
1. **Pre-closing (Months 0-3):** American Financial Holdings requests reinsurer consents simultaneously with filing Nebraska DOI Form A
2. **Reinsurer Consent Period (60-90 days):** Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re evaluate acquisition and respond with consent or conditions
3. **Form A Approval (90-120 days):** Nebraska DOI reviews acquisition, including reinsurance program continuity
4. **Closing Conditions:** Purchase agreement conditions closing on:
   - Nebraska DOI Form A approval obtained
   - Reinsurer consents obtained (or escrow funded for recapture costs if consent denied)
   - RBC Plan approved ($150M capital injection)

#### 4. Risk Mitigation — Purchase Agreement Provisions

**Recommended Purchase Agreement Terms:**

**Condition Precedent:**

*"Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon receipt of written consents from Global Reassurance Ltd., Swiss Re, and Munich Re to the assignment of the respective Reinsurance Agreements, which consents shall not impose conditions materially adverse to the business, operations, or financial condition of the Company."*

**Seller Covenant:**

*"Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reinsurer consents, including providing financial information regarding Buyer and cooperating with Buyer in reinsurer due diligence. Seller shall not agree to amendments to Reinsurance Agreements without Buyer's prior written consent."*

**Fallback — Escrow for Recapture Costs:**

If reinsurer consents are denied or subject to unacceptable conditions:

*"If reinsurer consents are not obtained by [30 days before Closing], Buyer may elect to: (a) waive the consent condition and proceed to Closing, (b) terminate this Agreement and receive return of deposit, or (c) proceed to Closing with an escrow of $[X] funded by Seller to cover recapture costs and RBC capital impact."*

**Escrow Sizing:**

Based on recapture scenarios:
- **Global Re recapture:** $850M reserves reinstated + $300M RBC impact = $1.15B total capital requirement, less $850M assets received from Global Re = **$300M net capital need**
- **Vermont captive recapture:** $730M surplus reduction (if Seller retains captive and denies consent)

**Recommended Escrow:** $500M-$750M to cover worst-case recapture scenario (Global Re + Vermont captive both require recapture/additional capital)

### B. Reinsurance Counterparty Credit Risk

| Reinsurer | Rating | Collateral | Credit Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------------|------------|
| Global Reassurance Ltd. | A- (Excellent) | $850M LOC (100%) | MEDIUM | LOC provides strong protection; Bermuda regulatory oversight; monitor for downgrades below BBB |
| Swiss Re | A+ (Superior) | None (authorized) | VERY LOW | Global systemically important insurer; authorized status; minimal insolvency risk <0.5% |
| Munich Re | A+ (Superior) | None (authorized) | VERY LOW | World's largest reinsurer; authorized status; minimal insolvency risk <0.5% |
| Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC | Not Rated | $120M assets + $730M parental guarantee | HIGH | Depends on Liberty Life Holdings financial capacity; T2 specialist recommends $300M-$500M LOC backstop |

**Aggregate Counterparty Exposure:**

- **Total face amount reinsured:** $8.5B (Global Re) + $3.2B (Swiss Re) + group term life excess (Munich Re) = ~$11.7B+ face amount
- **Reserve credit taken:** $850M (Global Re) + estimated $400M (Swiss Re mod-co) + $850M (Vermont captive) = ~$2.1B reserves ceded
- **Collateral coverage:** $850M LOC (Global Re) + $120M (Vermont captive) = $970M / $2.1B = **46% collateralized**

**Risk Concentration:**

Swiss Re and Munich Re authorized status provides strong protection (no collateral required, regulatory supervision). Global Re's $850M LOC provides 100% coverage. **Primary risk:** Vermont captive undercollateralization ($730M parental guarantee from Seller with $280M net worth).

**Downgrade Scenarios:**

**Global Re Downgrade (A- → BBB or below):**
- Nebraska DOI may require increased collateral (110-120% of reserves = $935M-$1.02B)
- Additional LOC cost: $85M-$170M annual LOC fees at 0.50-0.75% per annum
- **Mitigation:** Negotiate with Global Re for cost-sharing of additional collateral, or exercise recapture (subject to RBC capital availability)

**Swiss Re or Munich Re Downgrade (A+ → A or below):**
- Remain investment-grade and authorized in Nebraska (no immediate collateral requirement)
- Consider diversifying reinsurance panel (add second reinsurer for new business)
- Extremely low probability given size and systemic importance

### C. Recapture Risk — Strategic and Capital Implications

#### 1. Recapture Decision Framework

Life insurers evaluate recapture decisions based on multiple factors:⁴⁸

**Profitability Analysis:**
- **Favorable Experience:** Cedents recapture when business has proved more profitable than original expectations or mortality experience is better than priced⁴⁹
- **Rising Interest Rates:** Prolonged period of rising rates can change financial dynamics; if insurer can generate higher investment returns on retained assets, paying reinsurance premiums becomes less appealing⁵⁰
- **Experience Refunds:** Under Global Re treaty, LLIC receives 50% of profits; recapture allows retaining 100% of future profits

**Capital Requirements Impact:**
- **Reserve Reestablishment:** Reinsurance assets are derecognized and reserves are reestablished on ceding company balance sheet⁵¹
- **RBC Impact:** Capital requirements increase to reflect risks originally managed by reinsurer; weakens capital ratio as agreement's capital relief is undone⁵²
- **Asset Adequacy Risk:** Recaptured assets may not align with investment strategy or regulatory requirements, potentially causing losses⁵³

**Counterparty Risk Mitigation:**
- If reinsurer faces financial instability (rating downgrade, regulatory intervention), insurer may recapture to mitigate counterparty risk⁵⁴

#### 2. Global Re Term Life Recapture — 2030-2034 Window

**First Cohort Recapture Analysis (2020 Issues, Eligible 2030):**

**Decision Factors:**

| Factor | Recapture Favored If... | Continue Reinsurance Favored If... |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Mortality Experience** | Actual claims <85% of expected (highly profitable) | Actual claims >100% of expected (unprofitable) |
| **Investment Returns** | LLIC earns >6% on assets (can finance reserves efficiently) | Low interest rates persist <4% (capital expensive) |
| **RBC Position** | LLIC RBC ratio >250% (strong capital buffer) | LLIC RBC ratio <200% (capital-constrained) |
| **Reinsurer Relationship** | Global Re seeks rate increases or tightens terms | Global Re maintains competitive pricing and stable relationship |
| **Strategic Direction** | American Financial Holdings prefers risk retention | American Financial Holdings prefers capital-light model |

**Probabilistic Assessment (2030 Decision):**

**Base Case (60% probability):** Mortality experience favorable (actual/expected = 90%), LLIC RBC ratio 220-240% by 2030 through retained earnings
- **Decision:** Exercise recapture for 2020 cohort ($1.7B face amount)
- **RBC Impact:** ACL increases by ~$60M (proportional to $300M total recapture impact), RBC ratio declines by 5-7 percentage points
- **Financial Benefit:** LLIC retains 100% of profits (vs. 50% experience refund), estimated $8M-$12M annual profit increase

**Downside Case (25% probability):** Mortality experience unfavorable (actual/expected = 105-110%), LLIC RBC ratio 190-200% (capital-constrained)
- **Decision:** Do NOT exercise recapture; leave business with Global Re
- **Rationale:** Unprofitable block; avoid capital consumption; maintain capital buffer above 200% CAL threshold

**Severe Downside (15% probability):** Pandemic or mortality shock 2025-2030, LLIC RBC ratio <190%
- **Decision:** Do NOT recapture; potentially seek additional reinsurance to conserve capital
- **Risk:** Global Re may seek rate increases reflecting adverse experience

**Strategic Recommendation:**

American Financial Holdings should:
1. **Monitor mortality experience 2025-2030** on Global Re reinsured block using quarterly experience reports
2. **Model RBC impact** of recapture annually to assess capital capacity
3. **Negotiate with Global Re** starting 2028 (2 years before first recapture eligibility) regarding:
   - Potential waiver of recapture rights in exchange for improved ceding commission
   - Partial recapture (recapture most profitable vintages, leave less profitable vintages with Global Re)
   - Extension of recapture period (15 years instead of 10 years) in exchange for better experience refund terms

#### 3. Vermont Captive Recapture — Regulatory Disallowance Scenario

**Cross-Reference to T2 Specialist Analysis:**

The regulatory-rulemaking-analyst (T2) has modeled the Vermont captive recapture scenario in depth:⁵⁵

**If Nebraska DOI Disallows Reserve Credit:**
- **Probability:** 10-15% (T2 specialist estimate based on "shadow insurance" regulatory scrutiny trends)
- **Surplus Impact:** -$730M (difference between $850M total reserves and $120M captive assets)
- **RBC Ratio Impact:** 188% → **114%** (below 150% Regulatory Action Level)
- **Regulatory Consequence:** Nebraska DOI may issue corrective order, restrict dividends, require additional capital injection $500M-$750M

**Mitigation — LOC Backstop:**

T2 specialist recommends $300M-$500M letter of credit posted by Liberty Life Holdings (Seller) or American Financial Holdings (Acquirer) to reduce probability of disallowance to 5-10%.⁵⁶

**Contract Recapture Provisions — Data Room Review Required:**

As discussed in Section IV.E.2 above, the Vermont captive treaty recapture provisions determine whether recapture is:
- **Mandatory** (triggered automatically by regulatory disallowance), or
- **Optional** (LLIC has discretion to recapture, may instead negotiate with Nebraska DOI for alternatives)

If mandatory recapture, the acquisition cannot close without:
- **Resolution of captive issue pre-closing** (LOC backstop, captive restructuring, or regulatory approval confirmed), or
- **Purchase price adjustment** (-$730M reflecting loss of reserve credit), or
- **Escrow** ($730M funded by Seller to cover potential recapture obligation)

---

### D. Collateral Requirements and LOC Renewal Risk

#### 1. Global Re LOC — $850M Barclays Bank

**LOC Evergreen Structure:**

The $850M letter of credit issued by Barclays Bank automatically renews annually unless Barclays provides **90 days advance written notice** of non-renewal.⁵⁷

**Renewal Risk Factors:**

**Bank Credit Policy Changes:**
- If Barclays reduces reinsurance collateral exposure or exits LOC business, may decline to renew
- Requires Global Re to arrange replacement LOC from alternative bank (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, HSBC)

**Global Re Credit Deterioration:**
- If Global Re downgraded below investment grade (BBB-), Barclays may decline renewal
- Replacement LOC may require higher fees (0.75-1.25% per annum vs. current estimated 0.50-0.75%)

**Regulatory Changes:**
- If Bermuda Monetary Authority capital requirements increase, Global Re may face pressure to reduce LOC-backed business
- May seek to replace LOC with trust fund (Regulation 114 trust) or captive reinsurance structure

**LLIC Protection — 90-Day Notice Period:**

The 90-day notice period provides LLIC with time to:
1. **Demand replacement LOC from Global Re** (treaty requires Global Re to maintain continuous collateral)
2. **Exercise recapture** if Global Re cannot provide replacement LOC (subject to RBC capital availability)
3. **Negotiate with Nebraska DOI** for temporary waiver of collateral requirement pending resolution

**Mitigation:**

Purchase agreement should include:
- **Seller representation:** "The $850M LOC from Barclays Bank is in full force and effect as of Closing, with no notice of non-renewal received"
- **Post-closing covenant:** "Seller shall cooperate with Buyer for [180 days post-closing] to facilitate replacement of LOC if Barclays provides non-renewal notice"

#### 2. Vermont Captive Collateral — Parental Guarantee Enforcement

**Parental Guarantee Structure:**

Liberty Life Holdings LLC guarantees $730M of Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC's obligations to LLIC (difference between $850M total reserves ceded and $120M captive assets).

**Guarantee Enforceability Issues:**

**Seller Financial Capacity:**
- Liberty Life Holdings net worth: $280M
- Parental guarantee: $730M
- **Guarantee is 2.6× net worth of guarantor**

**If Liberty Life Holdings Cannot Fund Guarantee:**
- LLIC must recapture business and absorb $730M surplus reduction
- LLIC may have claim against Liberty Life Holdings for breach of guarantee (recovery uncertain if Seller lacks assets)

**Post-Closing Risk:**

If captive remains with Seller (Liberty Life Holdings), Seller's incentive to maintain parental guarantee diminishes after receiving $2.9B sale proceeds. Seller may:
- Distribute sale proceeds to equity holders, reducing net worth below $280M
- Refuse to honor guarantee if Nebraska DOI challenges captive structure
- Seek to terminate captive and force recapture by LLIC

**Mitigation — Transaction Structure Options:**

**Option 1: Captive Transfers to Acquirer**
- American Financial Holdings acquires both LLIC and Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC
- American Financial Holdings replaces parental guarantee with its own guarantee
- **Advantage:** Acquirer controls captive, ensures continuity
- **Disadvantage:** Acquirer inherits regulatory scrutiny risk

**Option 2: Seller Retains Captive with Enhanced Security**
- Liberty Life Holdings posts $300M-$500M LOC to backstop parental guarantee
- Purchase agreement includes escrow ($200M-$300M) released to Seller only after 3-5 years if captive performs
- **Advantage:** Seller retains responsibility for captive regulatory issues
- **Disadvantage:** Enforcement risk if Seller distributes sale proceeds

**Option 3: Immediate Recapture Pre-Closing**
- As condition of closing, Seller causes Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC to recapture business
- LLIC reestablishes $850M reserves, funded by:
  - $120M assets from captive
  - $730M additional capital injection from American Financial Holdings (beyond $150M planned injection)
- **Advantage:** Eliminates captive risk entirely
- **Disadvantage:** Requires $880M total capital injection ($150M RBC Plan + $730M recapture), may exceed acquirer's financing capacity

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Key Findings

#### 1. Reinsurance Program Overview

LLIC maintains a **four-treaty reinsurance program** totaling approximately $11.7B+ face amount ceded:

1. **Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda):** 90% quota share coinsurance, $8.5B term life, $850M LOC collateral, A- rated unauthorized reinsurer, recapture eligible 2030
2. **Swiss Re:** 50% quota share modified coinsurance, $3.2B IUL, no collateral (authorized), A+ rated
3. **Munich Re:** Yearly renewable term excess of retention, group term life $250K retention, no collateral (authorized), A+ rated
4. **Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC:** 100% coinsurance captive, $850M AXXX/XXX reserves, $120M assets + $730M parental guarantee, regulatory scrutiny per T2 specialist

#### 2. Change of Control — Assignment Consent Required

**All four reinsurance treaties require reinsurer consent** to assignment upon American Financial Holdings' acquisition of LLIC. Consent complexity and timeline varies:

| Reinsurer | Consent Complexity | Estimated Timeline | Key Conditions Expected |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Global Re | HIGH | 60-90 days | Anti-recapture provisions, capital maintenance covenant, extended LOC commitment |
| Swiss Re | MEDIUM | 45-60 days | Continue IUL product line, maintain underwriting standards, RBC >200% |
| Munich Re | LOW | 30-45 days | Standard financial condition representations |
| Vermont Captive | N/A (if transfers to acquirer) | N/A | Structure-dependent: captive transfer vs. Seller retention |

**Critical Path:** Reinsurer consents should be requested **simultaneously with Nebraska DOI Form A filing** (Day 1 post-signing) to ensure 60-90 day consent period aligns with 90-120 day Form A approval process.

#### 3. RBC Capital Impact — Recapture Scenarios

**Global Re Term Life Recapture (2030-2034):**

If LLIC exercises recapture of $8.5B face amount:
- Reserves reestablished: $850M
- RBC C2 increase: ~$300M (estimated)
- RBC ratio impact: 188% → **161%** (or 204% → 174% if $150M capital injection completed)
- **Assessment:** Remains above 150% Regulatory Action Level but below 200% Company Action Level target
- **Timing Risk:** First cohort eligible 2030 (5 years post-acquisition), requires capital planning now

**Vermont Captive Recapture (If Nebraska Disallows Reserve Credit):**

Per T2 specialist analysis:⁵⁸
- Surplus reduction: $730M (parental guarantee shortfall)
- RBC ratio impact: 188% → **114%** (below 150% RAL threshold)
- **Probability:** 10-15% (T2 estimate)
- **Mitigation:** $300M-$500M LOC backstop reduces probability to 5-10%
- **Transaction Impact:** Acquisition cannot close without resolution (LOC backstop, purchase price adjustment, or escrow)

#### 4. Counterparty Credit Risk Assessment

**Summary Risk Profile:**

| Risk Category | Risk Level | Basis | Mitigation |
|---------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Global Re (A-)** | MEDIUM | Bermuda-domiciled, 3 notches below A+, unauthorized status | $850M LOC (100% collateral), Bermuda regulatory oversight |
| **Swiss Re (A+)** | VERY LOW | Global systemically important insurer, authorized, strongest balance sheet | Authorized status, minimal insolvency risk <0.5% |
| **Munich Re (A+)** | VERY LOW | World's largest reinsurer, authorized, strongest balance sheet | Authorized status, minimal insolvency risk <0.5% |
| **Vermont Captive** | HIGH | $730M parental guarantee from Seller with $280M net worth (2.6× net worth) | LOC backstop recommended (T2), captive transfer to acquirer preferred |

**Aggregate Exposure:** $2.1B reserves ceded, 46% collateralized ($970M LOC/assets vs. $2.1B total). Primary risk concentration: Vermont captive undercollateralization.

#### 5. LOC Renewal Risk — Global Re

$850M Barclays Bank LOC is **evergreen with 90-day non-renewal notice**. Renewal risk factors:
- Bank credit policy changes (Barclays exits LOC business or reduces reinsurance exposure)
- Global Re credit deterioration (downgrade below BBB triggers Barclays review)
- Regulatory changes (Bermuda Monetary Authority capital requirements increase)

**Mitigation:** 90-day notice period allows LLIC to demand replacement LOC from Global Re or exercise recapture (subject to capital availability).

---

### B. Material Risks Requiring Transaction Documentation

#### Risk 1: Reinsurer Consent Denial or Unacceptable Conditions

**Severity:** HIGH (for Global Re), MEDIUM (for Swiss Re), LOW (for Munich Re)

**Impact:** If consent denied, LLIC must recapture business, triggering:
- Global Re: $850M reserve reestablishment + $300M RBC impact = $1.15B capital requirement, net $300M after asset transfer
- Swiss Re: ~$400M reserves + proportional RBC impact
- Combined worst case: $700M-$900M additional capital needed beyond $150M planned injection

**Recommendation:**

**Purchase Agreement Condition Precedent:**

*"Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon receipt of written consents from Global Reassurance Ltd., Swiss Re, and Munich Re to the assignment of the Reinsurance Agreements to Buyer, on terms and conditions that do not impose obligations on the Company or Buyer that are materially more burdensome than those in effect as of the date hereof."*

**Fallback — Seller Escrow:**

*"If any required reinsurer consent is not obtained by [30 days before Closing Date], Seller shall deposit into escrow an amount equal to [150% of estimated recapture costs and RBC capital impact], calculated as follows:*

*- Global Re: $450M (150% × $300M net capital need)*
*- Swiss Re: $200M (150% × estimated $133M net capital need)*
*- Total escrow if both consents denied: $650M*

*Escrow funds shall be released to Buyer [180 days post-Closing] if reinsurer exercises recapture rights or imposes capital requirements exceeding $[X] threshold."*

#### Risk 2: Vermont Captive Structure — Regulatory Disallowance and Parental Guarantee Enforceability

**Severity:** CRITICAL (if Nebraska disallows reserve credit without mitigation)

**Impact:** $730M surplus reduction → RBC ratio 114% (below 150% RAL) → acquisition cannot close per Nebraska DOI Form A requirements

**Cross-Reference:** T2 specialist (regulatory-rulemaking-analyst) addresses this risk comprehensively in Captive Reinsurance Regulatory Scrutiny report.⁵⁹

**Recommendation — Transaction Structure:**

**Preferred Structure: Captive Transfers to Acquirer**

*"The Purchased Assets shall include all equity interests in Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC. At Closing:*

*(a) Buyer shall cause American Financial Holdings LLC to execute a replacement Parental Guarantee in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Nebraska Department of Insurance, guaranteeing $730M of Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC's obligations to the Company;*

*(b) Seller's existing Parental Guarantee shall terminate upon effectiveness of Buyer's replacement guarantee;*

*(c) Buyer acknowledges assumption of all regulatory compliance obligations related to Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC, including responding to Nebraska DOI inquiries regarding reserve credit adequacy."*

**Alternative Structure: Seller Retains Captive with LOC Backstop**

*"If Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC is not included in the Purchased Assets:*

*(a) Seller shall cause [Seller or creditworthy affiliate] to post a letter of credit in favor of the Company in the amount of $400M (or such other amount as required by Nebraska Department of Insurance to maintain reserve credit), issued by a qualified U.S. financial institution acceptable to Nebraska DOI;*

*(b) Seller shall maintain the LOC in full force and effect for a period of [5 years post-Closing] or until such time as the Company recaptures the reinsured business;*

*(c) If Seller fails to maintain the LOC or if Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for all costs, losses, and capital requirements resulting from loss of reserve credit, including without limitation the $730M surplus reduction."*

**Fallback: Purchase Price Adjustment**

*"If neither captive transfer nor LOC backstop is implemented, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $730,000,000 to reflect the loss of reserve credit."*

#### Risk 3: Global Re Recapture Timing (2030-2034) — Capital Planning

**Severity:** MEDIUM (manageable with advance planning)

**Impact:** Recapture of $8.5B face amount increases RBC ACL by $300M, reducing RBC ratio by 27-30 percentage points (from 204% → ~174% if capital injection completed, or 188% → ~161% if not)

**Recommendation:**

**Post-Closing Business Plan Requirement:**

Include in Nebraska DOI Form A application and RBC Plan:

*"American Financial Holdings commits to the following capital management plan:*

*1. Immediate Capital Injection (Closing): $150M to increase LLIC's Total Adjusted Capital from $1.85B to $2.0B, achieving RBC ratio 204%;*

*2. Retained Earnings Target (2025-2030): Maintain annual statutory net income of $180M-$200M, accumulating $900M-$1.0B surplus over 5 years, targeting RBC ratio 250%+ by 2030;*

*3. Recapture Capital Reserve (2028-2034): Establish $300M-$500M capital reserve for potential Global Re term life recapture 2030-2034, ensuring RBC ratio remains >200% post-recapture;*

*4. Dividend Restrictions: LLIC shall not pay dividends to American Financial Holdings until RBC ratio exceeds 225% (25% buffer above Company Action Level) and Board of Directors determines recapture capital reserve is adequately funded."*

This demonstrates to Nebraska DOI that acquirer has considered long-term capital needs and will not be forced into capital-constrained recapture decisions.

#### Risk 4: LOC Renewal — Barclays Bank Non-Renewal of Global Re Collateral

**Severity:** LOW (manageable within 90-day notice period)

**Impact:** If Barclays declines to renew $850M LOC, Global Re must provide replacement collateral or face recapture by LLIC

**Recommendation:**

**Reinsurer Consent Condition:**

As part of Global Re's consent to assignment, require:

*"Global Reassurance Ltd. represents and warrants that:*

*(a) The $850M Letter of Credit issued by Barclays Bank plc is in full force and effect with no notice of non-renewal received as of [Consent Date];*

*(b) Global Re shall maintain continuous collateral in an amount not less than 100% of reserves ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement, in the form of letters of credit from qualified U.S. financial institutions or trust funds satisfying Regulation 114 requirements;*

*(c) If Barclays Bank provides notice of non-renewal, Global Re shall provide replacement collateral not less than 60 days before LOC expiration;*

*(d) Global Re's failure to maintain continuous collateral shall constitute a material breach, entitling LLIC to immediate recapture without payment of recapture fee."*

This shifts LOC replacement risk to Global Re and protects LLIC from collateral gaps.

---

### C. Recommendations for Acquirer

#### Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing, Months 1-3)

**1. Request Reinsurer Consents (Day 1 Post-Signing)**

Simultaneously with Nebraska DOI Form A filing, request written consents from:
- Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda)
- Swiss Reinsurance Company
- Munich Reinsurance America, Inc.

Provide each reinsurer with:
- American Financial Holdings financial statements (demonstrating capital strength)
- Business plan for LLIC post-acquisition (reinsurance program continuity, capital injection commitment)
- Management bios and insurance industry experience
- Answers to reinsurer due diligence questionnaires

**Target:** Obtain all three consents within 60-90 days, leaving 30-day buffer before anticipated Q3 2025 closing.

**2. Data Room Review — Full Treaty Language**

Obtain and review full reinsurance treaty agreements (user task noted summaries provided; full contracts required for due diligence):

**Global Re Treaty — Critical Provisions to Review:**
- Exact recapture language (10-year period confirmed? Any restrictions on recapture if experience adverse?)
- Assignment and change of control provisions (consent requirements, conditions, timeframe for reinsurer response)
- Experience refund calculation methodology (50% profit-sharing confirmed? Definition of "profit"? Audit rights?)
- LOC maintenance covenants (Global Re's obligations to maintain continuous collateral)
- Termination provisions (material breach definition, cure periods, termination upon insolvency)

**Swiss Re ModCo Treaty — Critical Provisions:**
- Experience adjustment calculation methodology (quarterly settlement confirmed? Investment income allocation formula?)
- Asset management reporting requirements (what investment performance metrics must LLIC report to Swiss Re?)
- Recapture provisions (any recapture rights? Likely none for mod-co treaties)
- Assignment consent requirements

**Munich Re YRT Treaty — Critical Provisions:**
- Rate adjustment provisions (how frequently can Munich Re adjust YRT premiums? Based on what experience triggers?)
- Termination notice period (90 days for new business confirmed?)
- Maximum retention limit ($5M per life confirmed? Indexed to inflation?)

**Vermont Captive Treaty — Critical Provisions:**
- Recapture provisions related to regulatory disallowance (mandatory vs. optional recapture if Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit)
- Parental guarantee terms (Liberty Life Holdings' obligations, enforcement mechanisms, termination events)
- Change of control provisions (does acquisition trigger termination rights for Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC?)
- Collateral substitution provisions (can parental guarantee be replaced with LOC? Under what terms?)

**3. Actuarial Analysis — Recapture Modeling**

Engage actuarial consultants (Milliman, Oliver Wyman, or internal LLIC actuaries) to model:

**Global Re Recapture Scenarios:**
- **Scenario 1 (Favorable Mortality):** Actual/expected claims = 85%, exercise recapture 2030 for 2020 cohort
  - Net present value of future profits retained vs. experience refunds foregone
  - RBC capital required for recapture
  - Break-even analysis: At what RBC ratio does recapture become capital-prohibitive?

- **Scenario 2 (Neutral Mortality):** Actual/expected = 95%, evaluate partial recapture (most profitable vintages only)

- **Scenario 3 (Adverse Mortality):** Actual/expected = 110%, do not recapture, evaluate renegotiation of experience refund terms

**Vermont Captive Recapture:**
- Probability-weight scenarios (T2 specialist estimates 10-15% probability Nebraska disallows)
- If disallowed: $730M surplus reduction impact on RBC ratio, dividend capacity, statutory financial statements
- LOC backstop sizing: What LOC amount ($300M? $400M? $500M?) reduces probability to acceptable level <5%?

**RBC Ratio Forecasting:**
- 5-year projection (2025-2030) incorporating:
  - $150M capital injection at closing (TAC increases to $2.0B)
  - Retained earnings $180M-$200M per year
  - Potential Global Re recapture 2030 (ACL increases $300M)
  - Potential Vermont captive recapture (ACL increases $400M+, surplus decreases $730M)
- Identify trigger points for additional capital injections

#### Pre-Closing Negotiations (Months 2-4)

**4. Purchase Agreement Amendments**

Based on reinsurance due diligence findings, negotiate with Seller:

**Condition Precedent — Reinsurer Consents:**

Add closing condition requiring Global Re, Swiss Re, and Munich Re consents obtained, with materiality qualifier (conditions not materially more burdensome than existing treaty terms).

**Vermont Captive Structure Election:**

Buyer's election (to be made within [60 days of Signing]):
- **Option A:** Captive transfers to Buyer (included in Purchased Assets), Buyer assumes $730M parental guarantee obligation
- **Option B:** Captive remains with Seller, Seller posts $400M LOC and maintains for 5 years
- **Option C:** Purchase price reduced by $730M reflecting loss of reserve credit (Buyer assumes risk of regulatory disallowance)

**Seller Representations and Warranties:**

*"Seller represents and warrants that:*

*(a) Schedule [X] sets forth a complete and accurate list of all reinsurance treaties to which the Company is a party, including all amendments, supplements, and side letters;*

*(b) Each reinsurance treaty is in full force and effect, and the Company has not received any notice of termination, non-renewal, or intent to seek material amendments;*

*(c) The Company is not in material breach of any reinsurance treaty, and Seller has no knowledge of any reinsurer breach;*

*(d) The $850M Letter of Credit from Barclays Bank securing the Global Reassurance Ltd. treaty is in full force and effect with no notice of non-renewal received;*

*(e) All collateral required under reinsurance treaties has been posted and is currently in place."*

**Seller Covenants:**

*"From Signing to Closing, Seller shall:*

*(a) Use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reinsurer consents to assignment, including providing financial information regarding Buyer and cooperating with reinsurer due diligence;*

*(b) Not amend, terminate, or materially modify any reinsurance treaty without Buyer's prior written consent;*

*(c) Maintain all collateral (letters of credit, trust funds) in full force and effect through Closing;*

*(d) Promptly notify Buyer of any communication from reinsurers regarding consents, treaty performance, or collateral."*

**Indemnification — Reinsurance Matters:**

*"Seller shall indemnify Buyer for losses arising from:*

*(a) Breach of Seller's representations and warranties regarding reinsurance treaties;*

*(b) Failure to obtain reinsurer consents if such failure results from Seller's failure to cooperate or provide accurate information;*

*(c) Vermont Captive regulatory disallowance, if: (i) captive remains with Seller, and (ii) disallowance results from facts or circumstances existing prior to Closing, and (iii) Seller failed to post LOC backstop as required by Purchase Agreement."*

**Escrow for Contingent Reinsurance Liabilities:**

*"At Closing, Seller shall deposit into escrow $[500M-$750M], to be held for [18-36 months] and released as follows:*

*(a) $[400M-$500M] released to Seller if Vermont Captive regulatory approval confirmed by Nebraska DOI within 18 months post-Closing;*

*(b) $[100M-$250M] released to Seller if Global Re, Swiss Re, and Munich Re consents obtained on acceptable terms and no reinsurer exercises termination rights within 24 months post-Closing;*

*(c) Amounts not released to Seller available to Buyer to fund recapture costs, additional capital injections, or LOC collateral if reinsurers deny consent or Nebraska DOI disallows Vermont Captive reserve credit."*

#### Post-Closing Actions (Months 1-12 Post-Closing)

**5. Reinsurance Relationship Management**

**Global Re:**
- Establish quarterly mortality experience review meetings (monitor actual vs. expected claims 2025-2030)
- Engage Global Re by 2028 to discuss 2030 recapture decision (provide 2-year advance notice to facilitate planning)
- Negotiate anti-recapture provisions if Global Re offers improved economics (higher ceding commission, better experience refund terms) in exchange for waiving recapture rights

**Swiss Re:**
- Continue quarterly mod-co experience adjustment settlements (ensure accurate investment income reporting)
- Confirm IUL product strategy aligns with Swiss Re's expectations (underwriting standards, target markets, distribution channels)
- Evaluate expansion of Swiss Re relationship (additional products, increased quota share to 60-70% if profitable)

**Munich Re:**
- Annual review of YRT premium rates (ensure rates remain competitive with alternative reinsurers)
- Monitor group term life mortality experience (if favorable, negotiate rate reductions)
- Consider increasing retention from $250K to $500K per life if LLIC's capital position strengthens (reduces YRT premium costs)

**Vermont Captive (If Transferred to Acquirer):**
- Implement T2 specialist's recommended LOC backstop ($300M-$500M) to mitigate regulatory disallowance risk
- Engage Nebraska DOI proactively to confirm continued acceptability of captive structure under American Financial Holdings ownership
- Conduct annual Vermont DFR examination compliance (captive financial statements, capital maintenance, actuarial opinions)

**6. Capital Plan Execution and Monitoring**

- **Year 1 (2025):** Complete $150M capital injection, file updated RBC Plan with Nebraska DOI, target RBC ratio 204%
- **Years 2-5 (2026-2030):** Retain earnings to build capital buffer, target RBC ratio 250%+ by 2030 to support potential Global Re recapture
- **Year 5 (2030):** Evaluate Global Re recapture decision based on mortality experience and capital position
- **Ongoing:** Quarterly RBC monitoring, board of directors review of reinsurance program performance, dividend restrictions until RBC ratio >225%

### D. Coordination with Other Specialists

This commercial contracts analysis intersects with several other specialist research areas:

**T2 (Regulatory-Rulemaking-Analyst) — Captive Reinsurance:**
- **Cross-Reference:** Vermont captive regulatory scrutiny (AG48 compliance, parental guarantee adequacy, LOC backstop recommendation)
- **Contract Focus (This Report):** Vermont captive treaty recapture provisions, termination rights, change of control impact
- **Integrated Analysis:** T2 specialist addresses regulatory risk (10-15% probability Nebraska disallows); this report addresses contractual mechanisms for recapture and transaction structuring

**T1 (Regulatory-Rulemaking-Analyst) — RBC Capital:**
- **Cross-Reference:** RBC ratio impact of reinsurance recapture scenarios (Global Re 2030 recapture → ACL increases $300M, Vermont captive recapture → ACL increases $400M + $730M surplus reduction)
- **Integrated Analysis:** T1 specialist models RBC ratios; this report identifies reinsurance triggers causing RBC impacts

**T6 (Financial-Analyst) — Financial Risk Quantification:**
- **Cross-Reference:** Aggregate reinsurance counterparty credit risk, probability-weighted recapture scenarios, escrow sizing recommendations
- **Integrated Analysis:** T6 specialist aggregates all transaction risks >$1M; this report provides reinsurance-specific exposures:
  - Global Re consent denial → $300M net capital need
  - Vermont captive recapture → $730M surplus reduction
  - LOC renewal failure → $850M collateral replacement cost

**T9 (Employment-Labor-Analyst) — Agent Retention:**
- **Cross-Reference:** Reinsurance program stability supports agent confidence (agents concerned about insurer's reinsurance counterparty risk, capital strength)
- **Integration:** Agent retention (T9 specialist analyzing 20-30% attrition risk) may be influenced by reinsurance program disruption if major reinsurers deny consent or terminate treaties

### C. Sources Attempted But Unavailable

| Source | Identifier | Reason Unavailable | Alternative Used |
|--------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Full reinsurance treaty agreements (Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re, Vermont captive) | LLIC proprietary contracts | Confidential commercial documents; user noted summaries provided, full treaties require data room access | User-provided treaty summaries in task brief; industry-standard specimen agreements from SEC EDGAR filings; SOA life treaty provisions resource |
| Global Reassurance Ltd. financial statements | Global Re proprietary | Private Bermuda-domiciled reinsurer; financial statements not publicly available | A.M. Best rating reports (publicly available methodology); Bermuda Monetary Authority regulatory framework (public regulations) |

### D. Data Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive statutory and regulatory framework accessed (Nebraska statutes, NAIC model laws/regulations, Bermuda BMA framework, federal insurance statutes)
- Industry-standard reinsurance provisions confirmed via multiple sources (SOA, specimen SEC filings, reinsurance industry associations)
- Rating agency methodologies verified via official A.M. Best publications
- Recent regulatory developments included (2024-2025 BMA updates, 2019 NAIC model law revisions with 56-jurisdiction adoption)

**Limitations:**
- Full reinsurance treaty language not reviewed (requires data room access); analysis based on user-provided summaries and industry-standard provisions
- Global Re specific financial strength beyond A.M. Best rating not independently verified (private company financials unavailable)
- Vermont captive regulatory review status based on T2 specialist's probabilistic assessment (10-15% disallowance probability) rather than direct Nebraska DOI consultation
- Recapture fee calculations illustrative (2-5% range cited from industry sources; actual fees require treaty review)

**Verification Confidence:**
- **HIGH:** Nebraska reinsurance credit statutes, NAIC model laws, Bermuda regulatory framework, A.M. Best rating methodology, change of control regulatory framework (60-90 day timelines)
- **MEDIUM:** Standard reinsurance treaty provisions (assignment, termination, recapture) based on specimen agreements and industry resources; actual LLIC treaties may vary
- **MEDIUM:** Counterparty credit risk assessments based on rating agency public information; detailed financial analysis would require reinsurer financial statements
- **LOW:** Vermont captive specific treaty terms (recapture triggers, termination provisions) pending data room review of full treaty agreement

| Net Surplus Impact | Neutral | Neutral (assets offset reserves) | ~$0 |
| RBC C2 Insurance Risk | Lower (90% ceded) | Higher (100% retained) | +$300M (estimated) |
| RBC ACL | $982M (current) | $1,282M | +$300M |
| TAC | $1.85B (current) or $2.0B (with $150M injection) | $1.85B or $2.0B (no change) | $0 |
| RBC Ratio | 188% (current) or 204% (with injection) | 161% or 174% | -27 to -30 percentage points |

**Scenario 2: Vermont Captive Recapture (Regulatory Disallowance)**

| Metric | Before Recapture | After Recapture | Change |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| Reserves (LLIC Balance Sheet) | $850M ceded to captive (reserve credit taken) | $850M restored to LLIC balance sheet | +$850M |
| Assets (LLIC Balance Sheet) | Current assets | +$120M received from captive | +$120M |
| Net Surplus Impact | Current surplus $1.85B | Surplus $1.12B | -$730M |
| RBC C2 Insurance Risk | Lower (reinsured) | Higher (recaptured) | +$400M (estimated) |
| RBC ACL | $982M (current) | $1,620M | +$638M |
| TAC | $1.85B (current) | $1.12B | -$730M |
| RBC Ratio | 188% (current) | 114% | -74 percentage points |

**Scenario 3: Combined Worst-Case (Global Re + Vermont Captive Both Recapture)**

| Metric | Current | Combined Recapture | Change |
|--------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| TAC | $1.85B | $1.97B ($1.85B - $730M + $850M) | +$120M |
| ACL | $982M | $2,320M ($982M + $300M + $638M net) | +$1,338M |
| RBC Ratio | 188% | 85% | -103 percentage points |
| Regulatory Status | Company Action Level | Below Mandatory Control Level (70%) threshold → Nebraska DOI must seize | CRITICAL |

**Conclusion:** Combined recapture scenario is catastrophic; acquisition cannot close if both recaptures are probable. Vermont captive must be resolved (LOC backstop, transfer to acquirer, or purchase price adjustment).

### Appendix C: Reinsurer Consent Timeline — Critical Path

```
Month 0 (Signing): Purchase Agreement executed
  ↓
Day 1: File Nebraska DOI Form A + Request Reinsurer Consents (parallel)
  ↓
Month 1-2: Reinsurer Due Diligence
  - Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re review American Financial Holdings financials
  - Reinsurers evaluate acquisition business plan, capital injection commitment
  - American Financial Holdings responds to reinsurer questionnaires
  ↓
Month 2-3: Reinsurer Consent Decisions
  - Munich Re consent (30-45 days): Expected Month 1.5
  - Swiss Re consent (45-60 days): Expected Month 2
  - Global Re consent (60-90 days): Expected Month 2.5-3
  ↓
Month 3: Nebraska DOI Form A Review Complete (90-120 days typical)
  ↓
Month 3-4: Closing Conditions Satisfied
  - All reinsurer consents obtained (or escrow funded for recapture)
  - Nebraska DOI Form A approved
  - RBC Plan approved ($150M capital injection)
  - Vermont captive structure resolved (LOC backstop or transfer to acquirer)
  ↓
Month 4 (Q3 2025 Target): Closing
```

**Critical Path Risk:** If Global Re consent delayed beyond 90 days, may push closing to Month 5. Contingency: Request extension of purchase agreement outside date, or invoke escrow fallback provision.

### Appendix D: Glossary of Reinsurance Terms

**Ceding Commission:** Amount paid by reinsurer to ceding company, typically as percentage of premiums ceded, designed to offset ceding company's acquisition costs (sales commissions, underwriting expenses, policy issuance costs).

**Coinsurance:** Reinsurance arrangement where reinsurer receives premiums, pays proportionate share of claims, establishes reserves, and holds assets backing reserves.

**Experience Refund:** Profit-sharing provision in reinsurance treaty; if actual experience (mortality, lapses, expenses) is better than expected, reinsurer refunds portion of profits to ceding company.

**Modified Coinsurance (Mod-Co):** Reinsurance arrangement where reinsurer assumes risk but ceding company retains assets; quarterly experience adjustments true up economics as if reinsurer held assets.

**Net Amount at Risk (NAAR):** Face amount of insurance minus policy reserve; for YRT reinsurance, premium based on NAAR.

**Quota Share:** Proportional reinsurance where reinsurer assumes fixed percentage of all policies (e.g., 90% quota share = reinsurer takes 90% of premiums and claims on every policy).

**Recapture:** Ceding company's exercise of contractual right to take back reinsured business from reinsurer, typically after specified period (e.g., 10 years); triggers reserve reestablishment on ceding company's balance sheet.

**Reserve Credit:** Statutory accounting treatment allowing ceding company to reduce reserves on balance sheet for business ceded to reinsurer; requires collateral if reinsurer is unauthorized.

**Yearly Renewable Term (YRT):** Reinsurance premium structure where premium adjusts annually based on insured's age and net amount at risk; commonly used for excess-of-retention group life reinsurance.

### Known Limitations

**Limitation 1 — Full Treaty Language Not Reviewed:**

User task noted reinsurance treaty summaries provided; full treaty agreements require data room access. Analysis based on:
- User-provided treaty parameters (coverage amounts, ceding commission, experience refunds, recapture eligibility)
- Industry-standard specimen agreements from SEC EDGAR filings
- SOA Reinsurance Section resources on life treaty provisions
- Reinsurance industry associations (RAA, RGA, Guy Carpenter)

**Impact:** Specific provisions (assignment consent exact language, recapture fees, cure periods, termination events, collateral substitution rights) require verification against actual LLIC treaties. Recommendations include "data room review required" flags for critical provisions.

**Limitation 2 — Global Re Financial Strength Beyond Rating:**

Global Reassurance Ltd. is a private Bermuda-domiciled reinsurer; detailed financial statements not publicly available. Analysis based on:
- A.M. Best A- rating (Excellent financial strength)
- Bermuda Monetary Authority regulatory framework (BSCR capital requirements, TCL minimums)
- $850M LOC collateral (100% of reserves ceded)

**Impact:** Cannot independently verify Global Re's capital adequacy beyond rating agency assessment. Recommendation: Require Global Re to provide audited financial statements as part of consent process (standard reinsurer practice in M&A transactions).

**Limitation 3 — Vermont Captive Regulatory Review Status:**

Nebraska DOI's position on Vermont captive reserve credit adequacy based on T2 specialist's probability assessment (10-15% disallowance risk). Direct consultation with Nebraska DOI not performed (requires formal inquiry by LLIC or acquirer).

**Impact:** Regulatory disallowance probability is estimate; actual Nebraska DOI position requires engagement. Recommendation: American Financial Holdings should include Nebraska DOI Vermont captive inquiry as part of Form A filing process.

**Limitation 4 — RBC Impact Calculations:**

RBC C2 insurance risk increase estimates ($300M for Global Re recapture, $400M+ for Vermont captive recapture) based on:
- NAIC RBC formula general principles (C2 factors 0.5-4.0% of net amount at risk for term life)
- User-provided estimate ($300M Global Re impact) in task brief
- T2 specialist modeling (Vermont captive impact)

**Impact:** Precise RBC calculations require LLIC's detailed RBC filing data (C1-C4 components, covariance adjustments, diversification credits). Recommendations use estimates for scenario planning; American Financial Holdings should engage LLIC actuaries for detailed RBC modeling pre-closing.

### Attestation

This research report represents a comprehensive analysis of LLIC's four reinsurance treaties and their implications for American Financial Holdings' acquisition, based on:
- **59 citations** to primary sources (statutes, regulations, model laws) and secondary sources (rating agency methodologies, industry publications, academic articles)
- **13 WebSearch queries** covering statutory framework, treaty provisions, counterparty risk, regulatory approvals, recapture mechanics
- **Cross-domain integration** with T2 specialist (captive reinsurance regulatory scrutiny), T1 specialist (RBC capital), T6 specialist (financial risk aggregation)

**Material findings:**
- All four treaties require reinsurer consent to assignment (60-90 day approval process, critical path coordination with Nebraska DOI Form A)
- Global Re recapture eligible 2030 creates $300M RBC capital planning requirement
- Vermont captive regulatory disallowance risk (10-15% probability per T2) creates $730M surplus reduction exposure; transaction-blocking if not resolved
- Reinsurance counterparty credit risk manageable (Swiss Re/Munich Re A+ rated authorized, Global Re A- rated with $850M LOC collateral), except Vermont captive undercollateralization ($730M parental guarantee from Seller with $280M net worth)

**Recommendations provided for:**
- Purchase agreement conditions precedent (reinsurer consents, Vermont captive structure election)
- Seller representations/warranties (treaty status, collateral in place, no breaches)
- Escrow sizing ($500M-$750M for contingent recapture liabilities)
- Post-closing reinsurance relationship management
- Capital plan execution (2025-2030 retained earnings target, recapture capital reserve)

**Research quality standards met:**
