The survival periods set forth in this Section 10.4 shall be tolled with respect to any particular claim during the period that an Indemnified Party is prevented from asserting such claim by order of a court or other Governmental Authority, or during any period in which Seller or Buyer (as applicable) is in bankruptcy or similar proceedings.

## Section 10.5  Claims Procedures

(a) **Notice of Claims**. An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Article X (a "**Claimant**") shall promptly notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "**Indemnifying Party**") in writing of any claim for indemnification under this Article X (a "**Claim Notice**"). The Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail:

> (i) the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim;
>
> (ii) the basis under this Article X for such claim;
>
> (iii) copies of any written materials relating to such claim (to the extent reasonably available);
>
> (iv) the amount of Losses claimed or a good faith estimate thereof (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim); and
>
> (v) the methodology for calculating such Losses.

(b) **Failure to Notify**. The failure to provide a Claim Notice in accordance with Section 10.5(a) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this Article X, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure (including by losing the ability to effectively defend against, mitigate, or settle the claim).

(c) **Response Period**. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Claim Notice relating to a claim that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (as defined in Section 10.6), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Claimant in writing either:

> (i) acknowledging its obligation to indemnify the Claimant for all Losses to which the Claim Notice relates (subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X);
>
> (ii) disputing its obligation to indemnify the Claimant for any or all Losses to which the Claim Notice relates, in which case the notice shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute; or
>
> (iii) acknowledging its obligation to indemnify the Claimant for certain Losses and disputing its obligation with respect to other Losses, specifying which Losses are acknowledged and which are disputed.

(d) **Dispute Resolution**. If the Indemnifying Party disputes all or any portion of a claim in accordance with Section 10.5(c)(ii) or (iii), and the parties are unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days following the Claimant's receipt of the Indemnifying Party's response, either party may submit the dispute for resolution in accordance with Section 11.9 (Dispute Resolution).

(e) **Payment**. The Indemnifying Party shall pay any undisputed amounts to the Claimant within thirty (30) days after the earlier of:

>
> (ii) the final resolution of any dispute through negotiation, arbitration, or litigation as provided in Section 10.5(d).

Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Claimant, or, in the case of indemnification obligations of Seller, by notice to the Escrow Agent to release funds from the Escrow Amount to the extent available.

## Section 10.6  Third-Party Claims

(a) **Notice of Third-Party Claims**. If a Claimant receives notice of any claim, demand, lawsuit, or other proceeding by a third party (a "**Third-Party Claim**") that may give rise to indemnification under this Article X, the Claimant shall provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice; *provided, however*, that the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

(b) **Defense of Third-Party Claims**. Upon receipt of a Claim Notice relating to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may, at its option and expense, assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim by providing written notice to the Claimant within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice; *provided, however*, that the Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim if:

> (i) the Third-Party Claim seeks non-monetary or equitable relief against the Claimant;
>
> (ii) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation, or investigation;
>
> (iii) the Third-Party Claim involves a material customer, supplier, or other business relationship of the Company and the conduct of the defense could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect such relationship;
>
> (iv) the Indemnifying Party does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy the potential liability (as reasonably determined by the Claimant);
>
> (v) the Third-Party Claim is reasonably likely to result in Losses exceeding the amount available under the Cap or the Escrow Amount; or
>
> (vi) there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Claimant with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

(c) **Indemnifying Party Control**. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 10.6(b):

> (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably acceptable to the Claimant, at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense;
>
> (ii) the Claimant shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and may participate in (but not control) the defense at its own expense;
>
> (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Claimant reasonably informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and provide copies of all material pleadings, correspondence, and other documents;
>
> (iv) the Claimant shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all relevant information and documents reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party; and
>
> (v) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Claimant (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) if such settlement or compromise:
>
>> (A) does not include an unconditional release of the Claimant from all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim;
>>
>> (B) includes any admission of wrongdoing or fault by the Claimant;

>
> (ii) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense at its own expense;

> (iii) the Claimant shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and provide copies of all material pleadings, correspondence, and other documents;
>
> (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall make available to the Claimant all relevant information and documents reasonably requested by the Claimant; and
>
> (v) the Claimant shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) if such settlement or compromise involves any payment or other liability by the Indemnifying Party.

(e) **Allocation of Costs**. If a Third-Party Claim involves matters for which some Losses are subject to indemnification under this Article X and others are not:

> (i) the parties shall use good faith efforts to allocate defense costs and liability in a fair and reasonable manner based on the relative merits and potential exposure of the indemnifiable and non-indemnifiable matters; and
>
> (ii) if the parties cannot agree on such allocation within thirty (30) days, the dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, whose determination shall be final and binding on the parties.

## Section 10.7  Exclusive Remedy

(a) **Exclusivity**. Except as provided in Section 10.7(b), following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained herein or in any certificate or other document delivered pursuant hereto.

(b) **Exceptions**. The exclusivity provisions of Section 10.7(a) shall not apply to:

>
> (iii) **Purchase Price Adjustment**: Disputes relating to the Purchase Price adjustment mechanism set forth in Section 2.3, which shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures specified therein; and
>
> (iv) **Escrow Disputes**: Claims relating to the administration of the Escrow Amount, which shall be resolved in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

(c) **No Other Representations**. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III AND ARTICLE IV (AS QUALIFIED BY THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES), (i) NEITHER SELLER NOR ANY OTHER PERSON MAKES OR HAS MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, WITH RESPECT TO SELLER, THE COMPANY, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING AS TO (A) MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, (B) THE OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS BY BUYER AFTER THE CLOSING, (C) THE PROBABLE SUCCESS OR PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY AFTER THE CLOSING, OR (D) THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY PROVIDED IN ANY "DATA ROOM," "VIRTUAL DATA ROOM," MANAGEMENT PRESENTATIONS, OR IN ANY OTHER FORM IN EXPECTATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND (ii) BUYER HAS NOT RELIED ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY FROM SELLER OR ANY OTHER PERSON EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

## Section 10.8  Treatment of Indemnification Payments

All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to a Claimant under this Article X shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or a final determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code) to the contrary.

## Section 10.9  Subrogation

Upon payment in full of any claim for indemnification under this Article X, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party with respect to the matter giving rise to such claim. The Indemnified Party shall execute all documents and instruments reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party to evidence and perfect such subrogation rights, including assignments, powers of attorney, and other instruments of transfer.

## Section 10.10  Right of Set-Off

Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to set off any amounts owed to Buyer Indemnified Parties by Seller under this Article X against any amounts owed by Buyer to Seller under this Agreement (including any Earnout Payments under Section 2.5 and any Purchase Price adjustment under Section 2.3), upon prior written notice to Seller specifying the basis for such set-off and the amount thereof. Any such set-off shall constitute full satisfaction of the obligation of Buyer to pay such amount to Seller and full satisfaction (to the extent of the set-off) of the indemnification obligation of Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 10.10 shall be construed as limiting Buyer's right to seek recovery from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

## Section 10.11  Escrow as Primary Source

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, following the Closing and prior to the expiration of the Escrow Period (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), the Escrow Amount shall be the primary source for satisfaction of any indemnification obligations of Seller under this Article X. Buyer shall first seek recovery from the Escrow Amount before seeking payment directly from Seller; *provided, however*, that:

(a) if the Escrow Amount has been exhausted or is insufficient to satisfy any indemnification claim, Buyer may seek recovery of the deficiency directly from Seller, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article X;

(b) Buyer may seek recovery directly from Seller (without first seeking recovery from the Escrow Amount) with respect to any indemnification claim that exceeds the Cap or relates to fraud or willful misconduct; and

(c) nothing in this Section 10.11 shall limit Buyer's right to assert claims against the Escrow Amount or directly against Seller within the applicable survival periods set forth in Section 10.4.

## Section 10.12  Insurance Proceeds

(a) **Pursuit of Insurance**. Prior to seeking indemnification under this Article X for any Loss that may be covered by insurance maintained by the Company or Seller, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue recovery under all applicable insurance policies. Seller shall cooperate with such efforts and shall not take any action to impair the Company's ability to recover under such policies.

(b) **Reduction for Recoveries**. The amount of any Losses for which Seller is obligated to provide indemnification under this Article X shall be reduced (including retroactively) by any insurance proceeds or other third-party recoveries actually received by any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses, net of:

> (i) any deductibles, co-payments, or uncovered amounts under the applicable policy;
>
> (ii) any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such proceeds;
>
> (iii) any increase in insurance premiums attributable to such recovery over the three (3) year period following such recovery (discounted to present value using a discount rate equal to the Prime Rate); and
>
> (iv) any Taxes payable with respect to such proceeds.

(c) **No Subrogation Waiver**. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any insurance coverage or any rights of subrogation that any insurance carrier may have with respect to any Loss.

## Section 10.13  Defined Terms for Article X

For purposes of this Article X:

**"Losses"** means any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees, and costs of investigation), judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, deficiencies, interest, and charges; *provided, however*, that "Losses" shall not include any diminution in value of the Company or the Company Shares, except to the extent such diminution directly results from a liability, cost, or expense otherwise constituting a Loss.

**"Pre-Closing Tax Period"** means any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period (as defined in Section 8.4(d)), the portion of such period ending on and including the Closing Date.

## DRAFTING NOTES

**Key Structural Decisions**:

1. **Specific Indemnity Thresholds**: Each specific indemnity (Sections 10.1(c)-(f)) includes explicit thresholds matching the risk assessments from the memorandum ($40M Thompson litigation, $1.1M market conduct, $500K FINRA costs)

2. **Captive Reinsurance Extended Survival**: 60-month survival period for captive reinsurance representations and indemnities aligns with Nebraska DOI's typical 5-year examination cycle for related-party transactions

3. **Third-Party Claims Carve-Outs**: Section 10.6(b) includes six situations where indemnifying party cannot assume defense, protecting buyer's interests in criminal matters, customer relationships, and conflicts of interest

4. **Escrow Priority**: Section 10.11 establishes escrow as primary source while preserving buyer's right to pursue seller directly for amounts exceeding escrow or involving fraud

5. **Insurance Coordination**: Section 10.12 requires buyer to pursue insurance first but provides detailed netting calculation including premium increases over 3-year period

6. **Purchase Price Treatment**: Section 10.8 treats indemnity payments as purchase price adjustments for tax purposes (standard M&A tax treatment)

**Alignment with Session Context**:

- Cap amount reflects adjusted purchase price of $2.76B (20% = $552M) rather than original $2.9B price
- Thompson litigation threshold of $40M matches Section IV.C analysis of $36.2M expected settlement plus buffer
- Market conduct threshold of $1.1M matches Section IV.D estimate of pattern-and-practice violations
- FINRA materiality threshold of $500K reflects conditional approval risk in Section IV.J
- Captive recapture indemnity (Section 10.1(c)) directly addresses collateralization failure risk in Section IV.A

**Standard M&A Provisions Included**:

- Mitigation obligation with insurance and tax benefit reductions
- No double recovery prohibition
- Consequential damages carve-out for third-party awards
- Subrogation rights upon payment
- Set-off rights against earnout and purchase price adjustments
- Tax characterization of payments as purchase price adjustments
- Knowledge qualifiers preserved through references to disclosure schedules
