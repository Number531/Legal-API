The Release Notice shall include reasonable supporting documentation evidencing satisfaction of the release conditions.

If Buyer becomes aware of a matter that Buyer believes constitutes a Captive Recapture Event, Global Re Consent Failure, or Thompson Litigation Adverse Event (each, a "**Claim Event**"), Buyer may deliver a written notice to Seller and the Escrow Agent (a "**Notice of Claim**") at any time during the applicable escrow period. The Notice of Claim must contain:

    (i) A description of the Claim Event in reasonable detail, including the date on which the Claim Event occurred or was discovered;

    (ii) The specific escrow tier(s) against which the claim is being asserted;

    (iii) The amount of Losses claimed (the "**Claimed Amount**"), including a reasonably detailed calculation of such amount and the factual basis for such calculation;

    (iv) Copies of any material documentation supporting the existence of the Claim Event and the calculation of Losses; and

    (v) A statement that Buyer has made such investigation of the Claim Event as is reasonable under the circumstances.

(b) **Claim Amount Cap**. The Claimed Amount in any Notice of Claim shall not exceed the then-remaining balance of the applicable escrow tier(s). If a Claim Event could reasonably be expected to result in Losses exceeding the balance of a single escrow tier, Buyer may assert claims against multiple escrow tiers, provided that Buyer specifies the allocation of the Claimed Amount among such tiers.

(c) **Seller's Response**. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a Notice of Claim, Seller may deliver a written response to Buyer and the Escrow Agent (a "**Claim Response**") either (i) agreeing to the claim and instructing the Escrow Agent to pay the Claimed Amount to Buyer, or (ii) disputing all or any portion of the claim and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute. If Seller delivers a Claim Response agreeing to the claim, the Escrow Agent shall pay the Claimed Amount to Buyer within five (5) Business Days by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Buyer.

(d) **Disputed Claims**. If Seller delivers a Claim Response disputing all or any portion of a claim, or if Seller fails to deliver any Claim Response within the thirty (30) day period (in which case Seller shall be deemed to have disputed the entire claim), the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for a period of thirty (30) days to resolve the dispute. If the Parties resolve the dispute within such period, they shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the disposition of the disputed amount. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute within such period, either Party may submit the dispute for resolution in accordance with Section 9.7.

(e) **Segregation of Disputed Amounts**. Upon receipt of a Notice of Claim that is disputed by Seller, the Escrow Agent shall segregate and continue to hold the Claimed Amount (up to the available balance of the applicable escrow tier) pending resolution of the dispute. The Escrow Agent shall release any remaining undisputed portion of the escrow account in accordance with the applicable release conditions under this Article IX.

(f) **Survival of Claims**. A Notice of Claim delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to expiration of the applicable escrow period shall survive such expiration, and the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the Claimed Amount until the dispute is resolved in accordance with this Article IX. The applicable escrow period shall be extended solely with respect to the Claimed Amount until final resolution of the claim.

#### Section 9.7  Dispute Resolution

(a) **Arbitration**. Any dispute arising under this Article IX that the Parties are unable to resolve through good faith negotiation shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 9.7. Either Party may initiate arbitration by delivering written notice to the other Party and the Escrow Agent specifying the nature of the dispute and the relief sought.

(b) **Arbitration Procedures**. The arbitration shall be conducted in Omaha, Nebraska, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "**AAA**"), as modified by this Section 9.7. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator mutually acceptable to both Parties. If the Parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after initiation of the arbitration, the AAA shall appoint an arbitrator who (i) is a retired federal or state judge or an attorney with at least twenty (20) years of experience in complex commercial disputes, and (ii) has no current or prior professional or personal relationship with either Party or their respective Affiliates.

(c) **Expedited Schedule**. The arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration on an expedited basis and shall issue a final written decision within sixty (60) days after appointment. The arbitrator may permit limited discovery, including document production and depositions, as the arbitrator deems necessary to resolve the dispute fairly and efficiently. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of Delaware and may award any relief that would be available in a court of law or equity, including payment from the escrow account, specific performance, or declaratory relief.

(d) **Final and Binding**. The arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The Parties irrevocably waive any right to appeal the arbitrator's decision, except on the grounds specified in the Federal Arbitration Act.

(e) **Costs**. Each Party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs in connection with any arbitration, except that the arbitrator may award attorneys' fees and costs to the prevailing Party if the arbitrator determines that the non-prevailing Party's position was frivolous or brought in bad faith. The Parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the AAA.

(f) **Instructions to Escrow Agent**. Upon resolution of any dispute through arbitration, the Parties shall promptly deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent directing the disposition of any disputed escrow amounts in accordance with the arbitrator's decision. If either Party fails to execute such joint instructions within five (5) Business Days after the arbitrator's decision, the other Party may deliver a copy of the arbitrator's decision to the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent shall comply with such decision.

#### Section 9.8  General Escrow Provisions

(a) **Escrow Agent as Stakeholder**. The Escrow Agent shall act solely as a stakeholder and shall have no duties or obligations other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or fiduciary obligations to either Party and shall not be required to make any independent investigation or determination regarding the matters set forth in this Article IX.

(b) **Reliance on Instructions**. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on any written instruction or notice delivered by either Party pursuant to this Article IX, and shall have no duty to inquire into or investigate the truth, accuracy, or validity of any such instruction or notice. The Escrow Agent may request from the Parties any additional documentation or evidence it reasonably deems necessary to confirm its obligations hereunder.

(c) **Indemnification of Escrow Agent**. Each Party shall indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with the Escrow Agent's performance of its duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent resulting from the Escrow Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The indemnification obligations under this Section 9.8(c) shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

(d) **Resignation of Escrow Agent**. The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the Parties. In the event of such resignation, the Parties shall jointly appoint a successor escrow agent reasonably acceptable to both Parties. If the Parties are unable to agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days after receipt of the resignation notice, either Party may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor escrow agent. The resigning Escrow Agent shall deliver the escrow funds to the successor escrow agent upon receipt of written acceptance of appointment from the successor.

(e) **Interpleader**. If the Escrow Agent becomes subject to conflicting claims or demands regarding any escrow funds, or if the Escrow Agent is uncertain as to its obligations hereunder, the Escrow Agent may (i) decline to take any action until it receives joint written instructions from the Parties, or (ii) deposit the escrow funds with a court of competent jurisdiction and interplead the Parties, in which case the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all further obligations hereunder with respect to such escrow funds. The Parties shall reimburse the Escrow Agent for all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any interpleader action, such reimbursement to be borne equally by the Parties unless a court orders otherwise.

(f) **Source of Payments**. All payments to be made by Buyer pursuant to this Article IX shall be made from Buyer's own funds and not from any funds or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, the escrow deposits required under Section 9.1(b) constitute a portion of the Purchase Price and shall be funded by Buyer at Closing in addition to the cash payment to be made to Seller under Section 3.2.

(g) **No Offset**. Seller's right to receive payment from the escrow accounts in accordance with this Article IX shall not be subject to any offset, counterclaim, or other defense by Buyer, except for claims properly asserted against the escrow accounts in accordance with Section 9.6. Buyer shall not have any right to offset any amounts due to Seller from the escrow accounts against any other amounts that may be owed by Seller to Buyer under this Agreement or otherwise.

(h) **Relationship to Indemnification**. The escrow accounts established pursuant to this Article IX are separate and independent from the indemnification provisions set forth in Article X. Buyer's right to recover Losses from the escrow accounts with respect to the specific Claim Events defined in this Article IX shall not limit or impair Buyer's indemnification rights under Article X with respect to breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants. However, Buyer shall not be entitled to recover duplicate or overlapping Losses with respect to the same matter under both this Article IX and Article X.
