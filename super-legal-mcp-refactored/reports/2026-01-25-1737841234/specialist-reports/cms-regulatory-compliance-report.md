## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report analyzes CMS regulatory compliance for Sunset Senior Living Group's 12 skilled nursing facilities (1,650 beds, $285M revenue, $52M EBITDA) in connection with Silver Oak Healthcare's proposed $425M acquisition. The analysis identifies **five critical regulatory risks** that materially affect transaction valuation and structure: (1) Orange County Care Center Special Focus Facility candidate status with 28% termination probability and $46.2M expected exposure; (2) CMS minimum staffing rule repeal eliminating $25.5M NPV compliance cost; (3) immediate jeopardy citation pattern indicating systemic quality problems; (4) below-average Five Star ratings (2.8 portfolio average vs. 3.2 nationally) suppressing occupancy and revenue; and (5) DPNA enforcement history ($1.53M FY2024) with $1.19M expected future exposure.

**CRITICAL FINDING #1: CMS STAFFING RULE REPEALED - $25.5M REGULATORY COST ELIMINATED**

On December 3, 2025, CMS repealed the minimum staffing requirements (3.48 hours PPD: RN 0.55, CNA 2.45, plus 24/7 RN onsite) that were finalized in May 2024, pursuant to Congressional moratorium under Public Law 119-21.⁶⁸ The repeal eliminates the federal mandate that would have required Sunset to hire 26 additional FTE RNs and 65 additional FTE CNAs at a cost of $4.3M annually ($25.5M NPV over 10 years).⁶⁹

**Transaction Impact:** The research plan projected $25.5M NPV staffing compliance cost as a material price adjustment factor. This cost is **NO LONGER APPLICABLE** under current federal law. Silver Oak should **eliminate or substantially reduce** any purchase price adjustment negotiated based on federal staffing compliance costs.

**Residual State Requirement:** California facilities remain subject to California Health & Safety Code § 1276.5 requiring 3.5 PPD minimum (effective July 1, 2023).⁷⁰ Orange County Care Center (3.35 PPD current) and San Diego Bay (3.45 PPD) have California-specific shortfalls requiring $494K annually in additional staffing (89% reduction from $4.3M federal estimate). Arizona (6 facilities) and Nevada (3 facilities) have no state numeric minimums.

**Recommendation:** Revise financial models to reflect $3.8M annual EBITDA improvement (elimination of AZ/NV staffing costs), retaining only $494K California compliance cost. Purchase price adjustments based on $4.3M staffing costs should be reduced by $3.8M annually ($20.1M NPV reduction over 10 years at 8% discount).

**CRITICAL FINDING #2: ORANGE COUNTY SFF CANDIDATE - 28% TERMINATION PROBABILITY, $46.2M EXPECTED EXPOSURE**

Orange County Care Center (145 beds, $28M revenue, 1-star overall rating) was designated **Special Focus Facility Candidate** in September 2024 based on persistent serious deficiencies: 3 immediate jeopardy citations in 18 months (March 2023 medication error, March 2024 COVID-19 outbreak, July 2024 PASARR violation), DPNA enforcement 6 months ($990K revenue loss), and quality rating decline from 3-star (2022) to 1-star (2024).⁷¹

**March 2025 Survey is Critical Milestone:** The next annual standard survey (scheduled March 2025, ~18 months after SFF candidate designation) will determine whether Orange County is designated as a **full Special Focus Facility** (full SFF). Based on deficiency history and facility performance trends:
- **60% probability:** Survey shows improvement, facility remains SFF candidate, potential graduation within 12-18 additional months → **Transaction proceeds without termination risk**
- **40% probability:** Survey shows continued serious deficiencies (4th immediate jeopardy or additional substandard quality findings) → **Full SFF designation September 2025**

**Full SFF Consequences (if 40% adverse scenario occurs):**

If designated full SFF in September 2025, Orange County enters mandatory improvement period with enhanced oversight:
- **Increased survey frequency:** Every 6 months (vs. 12 months standard)
- **Progressive enforcement:** CMPs, DPNA, temporary management if no improvement shown on each survey
- **Public disclosure:** Listed on CMS Special Focus Facility public list (severe reputational damage, accelerates occupancy decline)
- **Mandatory termination:** If facility remains in full SFF status for ≥3 years (September 2025 - March 2028) without achieving substantial compliance, CMS **must terminate** Medicare/Medicaid provider agreement per 42 C.F.R. § 488.404(e)⁷²

**Financial Impact of Termination:**

Medicare termination eliminates 28% of revenue ($7.8M annually). Medicaid automatically terminates when Medicare agreement terminated (42 C.F.R. § 442.12), eliminating additional 60% of revenue ($16.8M annually). **Total revenue loss: $24.6M annually (88% of facility revenue).** Remaining 12% private pay revenue ($3.36M) cannot sustain $25M annual operating costs → **Facility closure inevitable within 30-90 days of termination.**

**Consequences of Closure:**
- 145 residents displaced (must transfer to other facilities, significant resident trauma/family distress)
- 155 employees terminated (WARN Act 60-day notice required, $1.86M liability if notice not provided)
- $165M NPV revenue loss over 10-year horizon (at 8% discount rate)
- Silver Oak reputational damage (facility closure in first year post-acquisition signals operational failure)

**Probability-Weighted Expected Exposure:**

Compound probability of termination: 40% (March 2025 survey fails) × 70% (facility fails to improve over 3 years even with intervention) = **28% probability of termination by March 2028**.

Expected value of termination risk: 28% × $165M NPV loss = **$46.2M expected exposure**.

[METHODOLOGY: 70% failure-to-improve probability based on SFF program national outcomes showing ~30% of facilities in full SFF for 3+ years achieve sustained compliance and graduate; remaining 70% either terminate (~16% nationally) or continue in program beyond 3 years with marginal improvement. Orange County's elevated risk factors (3 immediate jeopardy citations, 1-star rating, occupancy declining 94%→88%, California stringent survey environment) justify using 70% vs. lower baseline.]

**SFF Improvement Plan Requirements (if Full SFF Designated):**

To avoid termination, Orange County would require:
- **Leadership changes:** Replace administrator/DON with turnaround specialists ($450K Year 1, $400K ongoing)
- **Staffing increases:** +27 FTE staff to meet California 3.5 PPD and provide adequate care ($1.3M annually)
- **Specialist staff:** Infection preventionist ($95K), wound care specialist ($85K)
- **Technology:** Bar-code medication administration system to prevent errors like Coumadin overdose ($200K upfront, $30K annually)
- **Consulting:** 18-month quality improvement consulting engagement ($250K total)
- **Total investment:** **$2.63M Year 1, $2.03M Years 2-3, $6.25M NPV over 3 years**

**Cost-Benefit:** $6.25M investment increases probability of avoiding termination from 30% (baseline) to 72% (with intervention), but still leaves 28% termination probability. Net expected value: 72% × $165M preserved - 28% × $165M lost - $6.25M cost = **+$45M positive expected value**, but high variance (binary outcome: +$159M if succeeds, -$171M if fails).

**Transaction Structure Recommendations:**

**Option 1 (RECOMMENDED): Exclude Orange County from Acquisition**
- Reduce purchase price by **$84M** (3× revenue multiple: $28M × 3)
- Eliminates all SFF termination risk, regulatory uncertainty, California CHOW delay risk, improvement investment requirement
- Silver Oak avoids reputational damage from 1-star facility in portfolio
- **Disadvantage:** Loses upside if facility improves (60% probability March 2025 survey passes), but expected value analysis supports exclusion given 28% termination risk and binary outcome volatility

**Option 2: Include with Bifurcated Closing and Survey Contingency**
- Make Orange County closing **contingent** on satisfactory March 2025 survey results (no immediate jeopardy, <8 deficiencies)
- Close on 11 facilities immediately (March 2025), delay Orange County closing until May-June 2025 (after survey results known)
- If survey passes: Close on Orange County with **$20M price reduction** (reflects remaining SFF candidate risk and improvement costs)
- If survey fails: **Do not close** on Orange County, seller retains facility and full termination risk
- **Advantage:** Eliminates uncertainty, Silver Oak only acquires Orange County if risk resolved
- **Disadvantage:** Seller unlikely to accept 3-4 month delayed closing with contingency on single survey outcome

**Option 3: Include with Substantial Price Adjustment and Escrow**
- Reduce purchase price by **$46.2M** (expected value of termination risk)
- Establish **$6.25M escrow** for SFF improvement plan, released to seller only if Orange County graduates from SFF program within 24 months post-closing
- Establish **$10M additional escrow** for potential termination loss, released to seller if facility achieves sustained substantial compliance (12 consecutive months with no immediate jeopardy or substandard quality citations) within 36 months post-closing
- **Total price adjustment:** $46.2M reduction + $16.25M escrowed = **$62.45M reduction to purchase price** ($425M → $362.55M), with potential earn-back to seller of up to $16.25M if facility improves
- **Advantage:** Aligns incentives (seller motivated to cooperate during transition to recover escrow), quantifies risk via expected value
- **Disadvantage:** Complex escrow mechanics, seller may reject $62M reduction as excessive

**California CHOW Delay Risk:** SFF candidate status creates substantial risk of California Department of Public Health (CDPH) denying or delaying license transfer approval for Orange County. CDPH may require Orange County to achieve substantial compliance (satisfactory March 2025 survey) before approving new owner. **Estimated CHOW delay: 3-6 months** beyond standard 30-60 day review period. Recommendation: File all 12 facility CHOW applications simultaneously January 2025, but **bifurcate transaction structure** to allow closing on 11 facilities if Orange County CDPH approval delayed.

**CRITICAL FINDING #3: IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY PATTERN - SYSTEMIC QUALITY PROBLEMS**

Sunset portfolio has experienced **9 immediate jeopardy citations** across 8 facilities (67% of portfolio) during 2023-2024, substantially exceeding national rates where approximately 6.4% of facilities have serious deficiencies causing immediate jeopardy.⁷³ Immediate jeopardy means "the facility's noncompliance with one or more requirements of participation has caused, or is likely to cause, serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to a resident."⁷⁴

**Most Severe Immediate Jeopardy Incidents:**

1. **Orange County (March 2023):** Medication error - Coumadin 10mg administered vs. 2mg prescribed, resident hospitalized with internal bleeding (F759 pharmacy services immediate jeopardy)

2. **Orange County (March 2024):** Infection control failure - COVID-19 outbreak 12 residents, failed to isolate/test/report timely, inadequate PPE (F880 infection prevention immediate jeopardy) → DPNA 6 months, $990K revenue loss

3. **Orange County (July 2024):** PASARR violation - admitted resident with serious mental illness without Level II evaluation, resident harmed others (F680 immediate jeopardy)

4. **Sunrise Manor (May 2024):** Life Safety Code violation - fire door propped open with trash can, smoke compartment barrier compromised (K-tag immediate jeopardy), corrected within 2 hours

5-9. **Other facilities:** 5 additional immediate jeopardy citations across portfolio (specific deficiencies not detailed in research plan, but pattern indicates widespread quality problems)

**Pattern Analysis:** Orange County accounts for 3 of 9 immediate jeopardy citations (33%), confirming it as the highest-risk facility in portfolio. However, 5 other facilities also experienced immediate jeopardy, indicating **systemic quality management failures** rather than isolated Orange County problem. Immediate jeopardy citations spanning medication management, infection control, resident assessment (PASARR), and life safety demonstrate failures across multiple clinical and operational domains.

**23-Day Termination Authority:** When immediate jeopardy identified, CMS has authority to terminate provider agreement within 23 calendar days of survey unless immediate jeopardy removed.⁷⁵ All Sunset immediate jeopardy citations were removed rapidly (within 2-14 days), avoiding 23-day termination, but facility remains at substantial risk if 4th immediate jeopardy occurs (especially Orange County, which already has 3 citations in 18 months).

**Remediation Requirements:** Portfolio-wide quality improvement program needed to prevent future immediate jeopardy citations:
- **Medication management:** Implement bar-code medication administration (BCMA) systems at all facilities to prevent medication errors ($2.4M upfront for 12 facilities, $360K annually)
- **Infection control:** Hire infection preventionists at 3 California facilities (AB 1502 requirement for facilities >100 beds) plus 2 high-risk Arizona/Nevada facilities ($475K annually for 5 IPs)
- **PASARR screening:** Automated PASARR screening checklists integrated into admission workflow, staff training ($150K upfront, $50K annually)
- **Life Safety Code:** Quarterly LSC audits, fire door monitoring systems, staff training on egress/smoke compartments ($200K upfront, $100K annually)
- **Total portfolio quality investment:** **$3.15M Year 1, $985K annually ongoing**

**Return on Investment:** Preventing single immediate jeopardy incident avoids: (1) DPNA revenue loss $600K-$1.2M per incident; (2) CMP penalties $50K-$100K; (3) survey remediation costs $100K-$200K; (4) reputational damage/occupancy decline; (5) termination risk if repeated immediate jeopardy at SFF facilities. Avoid 2-3 immediate jeopardy incidents per year = $1.5M-$3M savings → **ROI: 50-200% annually on $3.15M investment.**

**CRITICAL FINDING #4: BELOW-AVERAGE FIVE STAR RATINGS - OCCUPANCY & REVENUE IMPACT**

Sunset portfolio averages **2.8 stars overall** (vs. 3.2 nationally), with all three component ratings below national benchmarks: Health Inspections 2.8 stars (national 3.2), Staffing 2.6 stars (national 3.0), Quality Measures 2.7 stars (national 3.1).⁷⁶ **33% of portfolio (4 facilities) rated 1-2 stars** vs. 25% nationally, and **zero facilities achieve 5-star status** vs. 18% nationally.⁷⁷

**Star Rating Distribution:**

| Stars | # Facilities | % Portfolio | National % | Gap |
|-------|--------------|-------------|------------|-----|
| 5 | 0 | 0% | 18% | -18% |
| 4 | 1 (Silver Sage) | 8% | 22% | -14% |
| 3 | 7 | 58% | 35% | +23% (overweight average) |
| 2 | 3 (Desert Sun, Henderson, other) | 25% | 17% | +8% (overweight low) |
| 1 | 1 (Orange County) | 8% | 8% | 0% |

**Occupancy Correlation:** Low star ratings directly suppress occupancy and revenue. Orange County occupancy declined from 94% (FY2022, 3-star rating) to 88% (FY2024, 1-star rating) as deficiency history and SFF candidate designation damaged reputation. **6-percentage point occupancy decline = 9 lost beds × $192/day × 365 days = $630K annual revenue loss** attributable to star rating deterioration.⁷⁸

**Referral Source Impact:** Hospital discharge planners, Medicare Advantage plans, and private-pay families preferentially select 3-5 star facilities. 1-2 star facilities experience:
- **10-15% reduction in Medicare short-stay admissions** (higher-margin)
- **Payer mix deterioration** toward Medicaid long-stay (lower reimbursement) as Medicare census declines
- **Estimated revenue loss per 1-2 star facility: $840K-$2M annually**

**Portfolio Reputation Risk:** Silver Oak's reputation in post-acute care market could be damaged by association with below-average portfolio. Institutional payers (MA plans, ACOs, hospital systems) evaluating Silver Oak's quality will note 33% of portfolio is 1-2 stars with zero 5-star facilities.

**Quality Improvement Investment Requirements:**

To raise portfolio average from 2.8 stars to 3.5 stars (above-average target):

**Orange County (1-star → 3-star):** $2.5M annually (SFF improvement plan detailed above)

**Desert Sun & Henderson (2-star → 3-star):** $1.2M-$1.5M per facility annually:
- Pressure ulcer prevention: Specialty mattresses ($500K upfront), wound care specialists ($85K annually)
- Staffing increases: Henderson +20 FTE to reach 3.6 PPD expected ($950K annually)
- Infection control: Protocols, training, equipment ($200K upfront, $50K annually)

**Portfolio-wide programs:** $1.5M annually:
- Fall prevention: Bed/chair alarms, floor mats ($300K upfront)
- Antipsychotic reduction: Behavioral health consultants ($720K annually)
- Staff training: Quality improvement training for all clinical staff ($500K annually)

**Total Quality Improvement Investment:**
- **Year 1:** $6.7M ($2.5M Orange County + $1.5M Desert Sun + $1.2M Henderson + $1.5M portfolio-wide + $1M upfront technology/equipment)
- **Years 2-3 ongoing:** $5.5M-$6M annually
- **3-Year NPV (8% discount):** $15.8M

**Return on Investment:**

**Benefits:**
1. **Occupancy gains:** 1-2 star facilities improve from 85-88% → 92-93% occupancy (+5-7 points) = 60-85 additional residents portfolio-wide × $192/day × 365 = **$4.2M-$6M annual revenue increase**
2. **Payer mix improvement:** Higher Medicare % (28% → 32%) as referrals increase = **$2M-$3M annual revenue increase**
3. **Avoid future DPNA:** Quality improvements reduce deficiency citations, avoid $1.19M expected future DPNA exposure = **$1.19M risk mitigation**
4. **Avoid SFF termination:** Orange County improvement prevents $46.2M expected exposure = **$6.9M annual expected value preserved** ($46.2M ÷ 7 years average)

**Total Annual Benefits:** $14.6M-$18.9M (midpoint $16.75M)

**Net ROI:** Benefits $16.75M - Investment $6M annually = **+$10.75M annual positive NPV**

**However:** Investment front-loaded (Year 1 $6.7M), benefits phase in over 18-24 months. **Cash flow negative Year 1, positive Years 2-3.**

**Strategic Recommendation:** Star rating improvement is **financially justified** with strong ROI (+$10.75M annually after stabilization), but requires **$6.7M Year 1 capital commitment** and 18-24 month improvement timeline. Silver Oak should:
1. **Condition purchase price on current quality status:** Reduce by $15M-$20M to reflect below-average ratings requiring remediation investment
2. **Implement 100-day quality improvement plan** post-closing at Orange County, Desert Sun, Henderson (highest-priority facilities)
3. **Replicate Silver Sage best practices** portfolio-wide (Silver Sage 4-star performance proves Sunset capable of operating high-quality facilities with proper management)

**CRITICAL FINDING #5: DPNA ENFORCEMENT HISTORY & FUTURE RISK - $2.86M EXPOSURE**

Desert Sun (4 months DPNA, $540K revenue loss, $42K CMP) and Orange County (6 months DPNA, $990K revenue loss, $95K CMP) experienced **10 months aggregate DPNA** in FY2024, resulting in **$1.53M revenue loss + $137K CMPs = $1.667M total enforcement impact** (3.2% of $52M EBITDA).⁷⁹

**Future DPNA Risk (24 months post-closing):**

Based on deficiency patterns and facility compliance status, probability-weighted expected DPNA exposure:

| Facility | Risk Probability | Expected Loss |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| Orange County | 60% | $720K |
| Desert Sun | 25% | $150K |
| Henderson | 20% | $140K |
| Other 9 facilities | 5% each | $180K aggregate |
| **Total Expected Future DPNA** | | **$1,190,000** |

**Combined Historical + Future Exposure:** $1,667K (FY2024) + $1,190K (expected 24 months) + $65K (expected future CMPs) = **$2,922,000 total enforcement exposure** over 30-month period (Jan 2024 - June 2027).

**Working Capital Impact:** DPNA creates severe working capital strain (revenue loss immediate, expenses continue for existing residents, improvement costs required while revenue declining). Orange County DPNA 6 months required **$1.19M net cash burn** ($990K revenue loss + $200K improvement investment). Future DPNA incidents will require **$1.5M-$2M liquidity reserves** to cover working capital needs without debt covenant violations.

**Debt Covenant Risk:** If Silver Oak finances acquisition with debt (typical 60-70% LTV), DPNA revenue losses could reduce EBITDA from $52M → $50.7M (-2.4%), potentially triggering debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) covenant violations if lender requires DSCR ≥2.5× and unexpected DPNA occurs simultaneously with other adverse events.

**Remediation:** Quality improvement investments detailed above ($15.8M NPV over 3 years) will reduce future DPNA probability by preventing deficiency citations. ROI: Avoid $1.19M expected DPNA loss = **40-60% return on $2M Year 1 quality investment.**

**AGGREGATE REGULATORY RISK QUANTIFICATION:**

| Risk Category | Probability | Exposure Range | Expected Value | Mitigation Cost | Net Expected Risk |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **SFF Termination (Orange County)** | 28% | $165M NPV loss | **$46.2M** | $6.25M improvement plan | **$40M net** |
| **Federal Staffing Compliance** | 100% (REPEALED) | $0 (was $25.5M) | **$0** | $0 | **$0** (ELIMINATED) |
| **California Staffing (3 facilities)** | 100% | $494K annually | **$494K/year** | $494K (same as exposure) | **$0 net** |
| **Future DPNA (24 months)** | Varies by facility | $1.19M | **$1.19M** | $2M quality investment | **-$810K** (ROI positive) |
| **Future CMPs (24 months)** | Varies by facility | $65K | **$65K** | Included in quality investment | **$0** (absorbed) |
| **Star Rating Improvement** | N/A (discretionary) | $15.8M investment | **$15.8M cost** | $16.75M annual benefit | **+$10.75M** (ROI positive Years 2-3) |
| **Immediate Jeopardy Prevention** | 30% recurrence if no action | $3.15M investment | **$3.15M cost** | $1.5M-$3M annual DPNA/CMP avoidance | **+$500K-$1.85M** (ROI positive) |

**Total Net Expected Regulatory Cost (Post-Staffing Rule Repeal):** $40M (SFF) + $494K (CA staffing) + $1.19M (DPNA) + $65K (CMP) - $810K (DPNA mitigation ROI) = **$40.94M net regulatory risk**

**However:** If Orange County EXCLUDED from transaction (RECOMMENDED), eliminates $40M SFF risk + $1.19M × 60% (Orange County share of future DPNA) = **$40.71M risk eliminated**, leaving only **$1.23M residual portfolio regulatory risk** (11 facilities).

**TRANSACTION STRUCTURING RECOMMENDATIONS:**

**RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE:**

1. **Exclude Orange County Care Center** from acquisition → Reduce purchase price **$84M** (3× revenue multiple)
2. Remaining 11 facilities purchase price: **$341M** ($425M - $84M Orange County)
3. **No federal staffing price adjustment** (rule repealed) → Increases effective price vs. original $425M with $25.5M NPV staffing cost assumption
4. **Quality improvement escrow:** $5M held for 24 months, released as quality milestones achieved (Desert Sun/Henderson achieve 3-star ratings, no portfolio-wide immediate jeopardy citations for 12 consecutive months)
5. **Working capital reserve:** $2M facility-level liquidity for potential DPNA working capital needs
6. **Seller indemnification:** Seller indemnifies buyer for any DPNA/CMP arising from pre-closing surveys (even if imposed post-closing)

**ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE (If Orange County Included):**

1. **Bifurcated closing:** Close 11 facilities March 2025, delay Orange County until May-June 2025 (after March 2025 survey results)
2. **Orange County contingency:** Closing contingent on satisfactory survey (no immediate jeopardy, <8 deficiencies)
3. **Orange County price reduction:** $46.2M (expected value SFF termination risk) if proceeds with closing
4. **Orange County improvement escrow:** $6.25M held for 36 months, released if substantial compliance achieved
5. **Total purchase price:** $425M - $46.2M Orange County adjustment = **$378.8M**

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION: EXCLUDE ORANGE COUNTY, PROCEED WITH 11 FACILITIES AT $341M**

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed

This research addresses federal and state regulatory compliance requirements for skilled nursing facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, specifically analyzing Sunset Senior Living Group's compliance status and material regulatory risks affecting the $425M acquisition by Silver Oak Healthcare.

**Primary Questions:**

1. **Special Focus Facility (SFF) Program Risk:** What is the probability and financial impact of Orange County Care Center's SFF candidate designation leading to Medicare agreement termination?

2. **CMS Proposed Staffing Minimums:** What are the compliance gaps, implementation costs, and timeline for meeting the proposed 3.5 PPD federal minimum staffing requirements?

3. **Survey Deficiency Patterns:** Do Sunset's 9 immediate jeopardy citations (2023-2024) and substandard quality findings indicate systemic quality problems that threaten provider agreement continuation?

4. **DPNA and Enforcement History:** What is the probability of future denial of payment for new admissions based on historical deficiency patterns?

5. **Change of Ownership (CHOW) Process:** What regulatory barriers exist to CMS and state license transfers, particularly for the Orange County SFF candidate facility?

6. **Five Star Quality Rating Impact:** How do below-average star ratings across the portfolio affect occupancy, referrals, and revenue sustainability?

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted

- **CMS Care Compare (Nursing Home Compare):** https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare
- **Federal Register:** FederalRegister.gov (proposed staffing rule CMS-3442-P)
- **Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR):** 42 CFR Part 483, 42 CFR § 488.404, 42 CFR § 489.18
- **CMS State Operations Manual:** Appendix PP (survey protocol and interpretive guidance)
- **State Licensing Databases:**
  - Arizona Department of Health Services (licensing and surveys)
  - Nevada Department of Health and Human Services
  - California Department of Public Health (CDPH)
- **NFPA 101 Life Safety Code:** 2012 edition with 2016 amendments
- **CMS Guidance Documents:** SFF program guidance, CHOW guidance, PDPM billing guidance

### C. Limitations and Caveats

**Data Limitations:**
1. **Facility-specific survey reports not accessed:** This analysis relies on summary deficiency data from research plan. Full Statement of Deficiencies (Form CMS-2567) for each survey would enable deeper root cause analysis.

2. **CMS staffing final rule not yet published:** Analysis based on proposed rule (2024). Final rule expected Q1-Q2 2025 may contain modifications to PPD requirements, phase-in timeline, or exemptions.

3. **Real-time SFF status not verified:** Orange County SFF candidate designation as of September 2024 per research plan. Current status should be verified via CMS Special Focus Facility list.

4. **CHOW application documents not reviewed:** Analysis of regulatory approval barriers is based on regulatory requirements; actual application status unknown.

**Analytical Caveats:**
1. Probability assessments for SFF termination and future DPNA are based on historical patterns and regulatory framework interpretation, not facility-specific predictive analytics.

2. Financial exposure calculations assume current Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement rates and payer mix remain stable.

3. State-specific regulatory requirements analyzed at framework level; facility-specific state compliance issues may exist beyond scope of this analysis.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. CMS Requirements for Participation (42 CFR Part 483)

**Regulatory Framework:**

42 CFR Part 483 establishes the requirements that skilled nursing facilities must meet to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs.¹ These requirements serve as the basis for survey activities determining whether facilities meet participation standards.² The regulations encompass comprehensive standards for resident care, staffing, infection control, physical environment, and administrative compliance.

**Key Participation Requirements:**

1. **Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI):** Facilities must implement effective programs for preventing and detecting criminal, civil, and administrative violations.³

2. **Compliance and Ethics Programs:** Required programs must be effective in preventing and detecting violations, with specific requirements finalized in CMS regulations.⁴

3. **Survey and Enforcement System:** State survey agencies conduct annual unannounced standard surveys, with deficiencies cited using scope (A-L, isolated to widespread) and severity (1-4, no harm to immediate jeopardy) matrices.⁵

**Current Regulatory Status (2024-2025):**

Title 42 CFR is current as of December 5, 2025, with last amendments effective December 4, 2025.⁶ The regulations are actively being updated to reflect ongoing policy developments in nursing home staffing and oversight.

**Sunset Portfolio Compliance Analysis:**

Based on research plan data, Sunset Senior Living Group's 12 facilities exhibit the following compliance profile:

| Compliance Metric | Portfolio Status | National Benchmark | Assessment |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Average deficiencies per survey | 8-11 (AZ), 5-7 (NV), 11-15 (CA) | 9.5 nationally (2024)⁷ | Arizona/California above average |
| Immediate jeopardy citations | 9 instances (2023-2024) | 6.4% of facilities nationally⁸ | Significantly elevated (75% of portfolio affected) |
| Substandard quality findings | 2 facilities (Desert Sun, Orange County) | Rare (~3-5% facilities nationally) | Material compliance concern |
| DPNA enforcement actions | 2 facilities (FY2024), 10 months aggregate | Indicator of persistent non-compliance | Enforcement escalation pattern |

**Critical Finding - Immediate Jeopardy Pattern:**

Between 2015 and 2025, the average count of deficiencies per nursing facility increased from 6.8 to 9.5, an increase of 40%.⁹ Sunset's 9 immediate jeopardy citations across 8 facilities (67% of portfolio) in 18 months substantially exceeds national rates, where approximately 9 nursing homes (6.4% of 141 facilities) have serious deficiencies in Arizona alone.¹⁰

**Most Common Sunset Deficiency Areas:**

1. **F686 - Treatment/Services to Prevent/Heal Pressure Ulcers:** Desert Sun cited for substandard quality (scope E, severity 2), pattern of harm affecting 3 residents with Stage 3-4 ulcers due to inadequate repositioning and documentation.

2. **F880 - Infection Prevention and Control:** Orange County March 2024 immediate jeopardy, COVID-19 outbreak affecting 12 residents, facility failed to isolate, test, and report timely per CDC guidelines.

3. **F880 - Sufficient Staffing:** Henderson Care cited for providing 2.8 PPD actual vs. 3.6 PPD expected (22% understaffed), resulting in delayed medications and unanswered call lights.

4. **F689 - Free from Abuse/Neglect:** 2 facilities cited for abuse/neglect violations.

5. **F759 - Pharmacy Services/Procedures:** Orange County March 2023 immediate jeopardy, medication error (Coumadin 10mg administered vs. 2mg prescribed), resident hospitalized with internal bleeding.

### B. Five Star Quality Rating System

**Overview and Methodology:**

The CMS Five Star Quality Rating System provides publicly reported quality information on all Medicare/Medicaid certified nursing homes via the Care Compare website (www.medicare.gov/care-compare).²³ The system includes one Overall 5-star rating for each nursing home, plus separate ratings for three component domains: health inspections, staffing, and quality measures.²⁴ Ratings range from 1 star (much below average) to 5 stars (much above average).

**Three-Step Overall Rating Algorithm:**

**Step 1:** Start with the health inspection five-star rating (foundation of overall rating).

**Step 2:** Adjust for staffing:
- Add one star if staffing rating is 4-5 stars AND greater than health inspection rating
- Subtract one star if staffing rating is 1 star

**Step 3:** Adjust for quality measures:
- Add one star if quality measures rating is 5 stars
- Subtract one star if quality measures rating is 1 star²⁵

This methodology ensures health inspections serve as the foundation, with staffing and quality measures adjusting the final score.²⁶

**Domain Weighting (Approximate):**

While CMS uses a step-wise algorithm rather than strict weighting, the effective influence on overall ratings is:
- **Health Inspections:** 60-70% (dominant factor, foundation of rating)²⁷
- **Staffing:** 15-20% (modifier, can raise/lower by 1 star)
- **Quality Measures:** 15-25% (modifier, can raise/lower by 1 star)

**Health Inspections Component:**

Based on outcomes from the **two most recent standard surveys** (effective July 2025, changed from three surveys).²⁸ Each deficiency identified during inspections is scored and weighted according to its scope (A-L: isolated to widespread) and severity (1-4: no harm to immediate jeopardy).²⁹ A higher deficiency score indicates worse performance. Cut points for star ratings are set separately for each state to account for state-level variation in survey stringency.³⁰

**Staffing Component (Updated July 2024):**

Effective July 2024 refresh, CMS changed the staffing case-mix adjustment methodology to a model based on the Patient-Driven Payment Model (PDPM).³¹ The staffing rating incorporates six key measures:

1. RN Hours Per Resident Day
2. Total Nurse Hours Per Resident Day
3. Weekend Staffing Hours Per Resident Day
4. RN Turnover Rate
5. Total Nurse Turnover Rate
6. Administrator Turnover³²

Staffing level measures use Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) data from the most recent quarter. Turnover measures use a 90-day employment gap (changed from 60 days) to identify if turnover occurred.³³ Beginning April 2024, providers that fail to submit staffing data or submit erroneous data receive the lowest score possible for corresponding staffing turnover measures.³⁴

**Quality Measures Component:**

Quality measures are based on the CMS Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 assessments. All 11 quality measures are given equal weight, and points are summed across all QMs to create a total QM score for each facility.³⁵ Effective January 2025 refresh, CMS unfroze four quality measures that had been frozen beginning with April 2024 refresh, which were updated to accommodate recent changes to MDS.³⁶

**Recent Methodology Changes (2024-2025):**

| Effective Date | Change | Impact |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| April 2024 | Providers failing to submit PBJ data receive lowest staffing scores | Penalizes non-compliance |
| July 2024 | Staffing case-mix adjustment changed to PDPM-based model | Aligns with payment model |
| July 2025 | Health inspections use 2 most recent surveys (not 3) | More recent data weighted heavier |
| January 2025 | Unfroze 4 quality measures | Restored full QM scoring |
| October 2024 | Replaced short-stay functional improvement QM with cross-setting function measure | Updated clinical outcomes tracking |

**Sunset Senior Living Group Portfolio Star Rating Analysis:**

**Overall Portfolio Distribution:**

| Star Rating | # Facilities | % of Portfolio | National Benchmark (2024) | Assessment |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|------------|
| 5-star | 0 | 0% | ~18% of facilities³⁷ | **Significantly underperforming** |
| 4-star | 1 (Silver Sage) | 8% | ~22% | Below average |
| 3-star | 7 | 58% | ~35% | Average (largest category nationally) |
| 2-star | 3 | 25% | ~17% | **Above national average for low performers** |
| 1-star | 1 (Orange County) | 8% | ~8% | National average for worst performers |
| **Portfolio Average** | **2.8 stars** | | **3.2 stars nationally** | **0.4 stars below average** |

**Critical Finding:** 33% of Sunset's portfolio (4 of 12 facilities) is rated 1-2 stars, compared to 25% nationally. Zero facilities achieve 5-star status, compared to 18% nationally.

**Component Ratings Analysis (Portfolio Averages):**

| Component | Sunset Average | National Average | Gap | Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-----|------------|
| Health Inspections | 2.8 stars | 3.2 stars | -0.4 | **Below average** - driven by Orange County (1-star), Desert Sun (2-star) |
| Staffing | 2.6 stars | 3.0 stars | -0.4 | **Below average** - Henderson (1-star staffing), high turnover affects ratings |
| Quality Measures | 2.7 stars | 3.1 stars | -0.4 | **Below average** - clinical outcomes lag peers |

**All three components underperform national benchmarks**, indicating systemic quality challenges rather than isolated weakness in single domain.

**Facility-Level Detailed Analysis:**

**1-Star Facility (8% of portfolio):**

| Facility | Overall | Health | Staffing | Quality | Key Issues |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Orange County Care Center** | **1-star** | **1-star** | 2-star | **1-star** | SFF candidate, 3× immediate jeopardy 18 months, substandard quality, DPNA 6 months, occupancy declining 94% → 88% |

Orange County's 1-star rating is driven by catastrophic health inspection performance (1-star) reflecting 3 immediate jeopardy citations in 18 months, plus 1-star quality measures indicating poor clinical outcomes (pressure ulcers, infections, medication errors).

**2-Star Facilities (25% of portfolio):**

| Facility | Overall | Health | Staffing | Quality | Key Issues |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ) | 2-star | 2-star | 2-star | 3-star | F686 substandard quality pressure ulcers, DPNA 4 months, $540K revenue loss |
| Henderson Care (NV) | 2-star | 2-star | **1-star** | 3-star | Severe understaffing (2.8 PPD vs. 3.6 expected), 85% occupancy, competitive market |
| [Third 2-star facility] | 2-star | TBD | TBD | TBD | [Details from research plan not specified] |

Desert Sun's 2-star rating reflects serious deficiency history (substandard quality, DPNA enforcement). Henderson's 2-star rating is driven by 1-star staffing (22% understaffed), dragging down overall rating despite adequate health inspections and quality measures.

**4-Star Facility (8% of portfolio - Best Performer):**

| Facility | Overall | Health | Staffing | Quality | Key Issues |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| Silver Sage Las Vegas (NV) | 4-star | 4-star | 4-star | 4-star | **Portfolio flagship** - only 4 deficiencies last survey, excellent staffing, 92% occupancy, strong clinical outcomes |

Silver Sage demonstrates that Sunset's management **can** operate high-quality facilities when properly resourced and managed. This facility should be studied as internal best practice model.

**3-Star Facilities (58% of portfolio):**

7 facilities rated 3-star (Phoenix Valley, Tucson Ridge, Mesa Heights, Flagstaff Care, Yuma Senior Living, Reno Valley, Sunrise Manor, San Diego Bay) represent "average" performance by national standards. These facilities have:
- Standard deficiency citations (7-11 per survey)
- Adequate staffing (3.2-3.6 PPD range)
- Average clinical outcomes
- No immediate jeopardy history (except Sunrise Manor 1× LSC K-tag corrected within 2 hours)
- Occupancy 88-94%

**Impact of Star Ratings on Business Performance:**

**Occupancy Correlation:**

| Star Rating | Avg. Occupancy (Sunset) | National Avg. Occupancy | Revenue Impact |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| 4-star (Silver Sage) | 92% | 93-95% | Slight gap |
| 3-star (7 facilities) | 88-90% | 90-92% | At/slightly below market |
| 2-star (Desert Sun, Henderson) | 85-88% | 85-88% | **Occupancy suppressed** 5-7 percentage points below 3-star |
| 1-star (Orange County) | 88% (declining from 94%) | 82-85% | **Rapid decline** - reputation damage from SFF/IJ citations |

**Critical Finding:** Orange County's occupancy has declined from 94% (FY2022) to 88% (FY2024) as star rating dropped from 3-star to 1-star. This 6-percentage point decline represents **~9 lost beds × $192/day × 365 days = $630K annual revenue loss** attributable to reputation damage.

**Referral Source Impact:**

Low star ratings (1-2 stars) significantly impair referrals from:
1. **Hospital discharge planners:** Hospitals preferentially refer to 3-5 star facilities to avoid readmission penalties
2. **Medicare Advantage plans:** Many MA plans steer members to higher-rated facilities via preferred provider networks
3. **Private pay families:** Families researching facilities on Care Compare avoid 1-2 star facilities
4. **Physicians:** Physicians recommending post-acute care favor higher-rated facilities

**Estimated Referral Loss:** For 1-2 star facilities (4 facilities, 33% of portfolio):
- **Lost Medicare admissions:** 10-15% reduction in Medicare short-stay admissions (higher-margin)
- **Payer mix deterioration:** Shift toward Medicaid long-stay (lower reimbursement) as Medicare census declines
- **Revenue impact per facility:** $840K-$2M annually for 1-star facilities

**Portfolio-Wide Reputation Risk:**

Silver Oak Healthcare's reputation in post-acute care market could be damaged by association with Sunset's below-average star ratings. Institutional payers (MA plans, ACOs, hospital systems) evaluating Silver Oak's portfolio quality will note:
- 33% of portfolio 1-2 stars (vs. 25% nationally)
- 0% five-star facilities (vs. 18% nationally)
- Portfolio average 2.8 stars (vs. 3.2 nationally)

**Quality Improvement Investment Requirements:**

To raise portfolio average from 2.8 stars to 3.5 stars (above-average target) requires:

**Orange County (1-star → 3-star minimum):**
- **Administrator replacement:** Hire experienced turnaround DON/Administrator ($200K-$250K annually premium for turnaround specialists)
- **Staffing increase:** +27 FTE staff (meet SFF improvement plan requirements) = $1.3M annually
- **Infection prevention:** Hire full-time infection preventionist ($95K annually)
- **Wound care:** Contract wound care specialist ($80K annually)
- **Technology:** Implement bar-code medication administration (BCMA) to prevent medication errors ($200K upfront + $30K annually)
- **Total Orange County investment:** **$2.5M annually** (per research plan SFF improvement plan estimate)

**Desert Sun and Henderson (2-star → 3-star):**
- Pressure ulcer prevention program: Specialty mattresses ($500K upfront), repositioning protocols, wound nurse ($85K annually)
- Staffing increases: Henderson +20 FTE to reach 3.6 PPD expected ($950K annually)
- **Total per facility:** **$1.2M-$1.5M annually**

**Portfolio-Wide Quality Program:**
- Fall prevention: Bed/chair alarms, fall mats ($300K upfront across 12 facilities)
- Antipsychotic reduction: Behavioral health consultants ($60K × 12 = $720K annually)
- Staff training: Quality improvement training for all clinical staff ($500K annually)
- **Portfolio-wide programs:** **$1.5M annually**

**Total Quality Improvement Investment (3-Year Program):**
- **Year 1:** $2.5M (Orange County) + $1.5M (Desert Sun) + $1.2M (Henderson) + $1.5M (portfolio) = **$6.7M**
- **Years 2-3 ongoing:** **$5.5M-$6M annually**
- **3-Year NPV (8% discount):** **$15.8M**

**Return on Investment:**

**Benefits of Star Rating Improvement:**
1. **Occupancy gains:** 1-2 star facilities increase occupancy 85-88% → 92-93% (+5-7 points) = 60-85 additional residents portfolio-wide × $192/day × 365 = **$4.2M-$6M annual revenue gain**
2. **Payer mix improvement:** Higher Medicare % (28% → 32%) as referrals increase = **$2M-$3M annual revenue gain**
3. **Avoid DPNA:** Quality improvements reduce deficiency citations, avoiding future DPNA (research plan estimates $1.5M-$3M future DPNA risk) = **$1.5M-$3M risk mitigation**
4. **Avoid SFF termination:** Orange County improvement prevents $24.6M revenue loss (28% probability per research plan) = **$6.9M expected value preserved**

**Total Annual Benefits:** $14.6M-$18.9M

**Net ROI:** Benefits $16.75M (midpoint) - Investment $6M annually = **+$10.75M annual positive NPV**

**However:** Investment is front-loaded (Year 1 $6.7M), benefits phase in over 18-24 months. Cash flow negative Year 1, positive Years 2-3.

**Strategic Recommendation:**

Star rating improvement is **financially justified** and **operationally necessary** to preserve portfolio value, but requires substantial upfront capital commitment and 18-24 month improvement timeline. Silver Oak should:

1. **Condition purchase price on current star ratings** - Discount by $15M-$20M to reflect below-average quality requiring remediation investment
2. **Escrow $2.5M for Orange County SFF improvement** - If Orange County fails to improve, funds used for turnaround; if improves, funds released to seller
3. **Implement 100-day quality improvement plan** post-closing at Orange County, Desert Sun, Henderson
4. **Replicate Silver Sage best practices** portfolio-wide (Silver Sage 4-star model proves Sunset can operate high-quality facilities)

### C. Special Focus Facility (SFF) Program - Orange County Critical Risk ⚠️ **DEAL-CRITICAL ISSUE**

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - TERMINATION RISK:**

Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA, 145 beds, $28M annual revenue) was designated **Special Focus Facility Candidate** in September 2024 and faces **Medicare/Medicaid agreement termination** if designated as full SFF and fails to improve within ~3 years.³⁸ Termination would eliminate 88% of facility revenue ($24.6M annually: Medicare 28% + Medicaid 60%), forcing facility closure of 145 beds.³⁹ **March 2025 survey is critical milestone** - bad survey results trigger full SFF designation in September 2025, starting 3-year improvement clock toward potential March 2028 termination.⁴⁰

**Probability of termination by March 2028: 28%** [METHODOLOGY: 40% probability March 2025 survey shows continued serious deficiencies × 70% probability facility fails to improve over 3 years = 28% compound probability].

**Financial Impact if Terminated:**
- **Immediate:** $24.6M annual revenue loss, facility closure, 155 employees displaced, WARN Act liability $1.86M
- **NPV (10-year):** -$165M (assuming 10-year revenue loss horizon at 8% discount rate)
- **Expected value (probability-weighted):** 28% × $165M = **$46.2M expected exposure**

**Regulatory Framework - Special Focus Facility Program:**

The Special Focus Facility (SFF) program, codified at 42 C.F.R. § 488.404, identifies nursing homes in the bottom 5% nationally for persistent serious deficiencies and subjects them to enhanced federal oversight and mandatory termination if substantial compliance is not achieved.⁴¹

**SFF Designation Criteria (42 C.F.R. § 488.404):**

Facilities are selected for the SFF program based on:
1. **Survey performance:** Ranking in worst 5% nationally based on deficiency scope, severity, and frequency over 3-year period
2. **History of serious problems:** Pattern of immediate jeopardy, actual harm, or substandard quality citations
3. **Persistent non-compliance:** Failure to achieve sustained substantial compliance despite remedial actions⁴²

**SFF Candidate vs. Full SFF Status:**

| Status | Timing | Public Disclosure | Survey Frequency | Termination Risk |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **SFF Candidate** | Initial designation | **Published on Care Compare** (reputation damage) | Annual standard surveys | Not yet subject to termination |
| **Full SFF** | 9-18 months after candidacy if no improvement | **Public SFF list** (severe reputation damage) | **Every 6 months** (twice normal frequency) | **Mandatory termination if ≥3 years without substantial compliance** |

Orange County is currently an **SFF Candidate** (designated September 2024), which carries no specific penalties but eligibility for selection as full SFF at any time.⁴³ The facility is already publicly listed on Care Compare as an SFF Candidate, damaging referrals.

**Timeline to Termination (Critical Path Analysis):**

**September 2024:** SFF Candidate designation (based on 3-year survey history 2021-2024: 3 immediate jeopardy citations, substandard quality, pattern of harm)

**March 2025:** **CRITICAL SURVEY** (next annual standard survey, ~18 months after designation)
- **Scenario A (60% probability):** Survey shows improvement → No immediate jeopardy, reduced deficiencies, substantial compliance achieved → Remains SFF Candidate, potential graduation if sustained improvement over additional 6-12 months → **Transaction proceeds without SFF termination risk**
- **Scenario B (40% probability):** Survey shows continued serious deficiencies → Immediate jeopardy (4th occurrence) or additional substandard quality → **Triggers full SFF designation**

**September 2025:** If Scenario B occurs, CMS designates Orange County as **full Special Focus Facility**
- Enhanced survey every 6 months (March 2026, September 2026, March 2027, September 2027, March 2028)
- Progressive enforcement: CMPs, DPNA, temporary management if no improvement
- Public disclosure on CMS SFF list (severe reputational damage, occupancy decline accelerates)

**March 2028:** If Orange County remains full SFF for ≥3 years (September 2025 - March 2028) without achieving substantial compliance, CMS **mandatory termination** of Medicare/Medicaid provider agreement per 42 C.F.R. § 488.404(e).⁴⁴

**23-Day Immediate Termination:** If survey at any point identifies immediate jeopardy (4th occurrence for Orange County), CMS has authority to terminate provider agreement within 23 days unless immediate jeopardy removed within that period.⁴⁵

**SFF Program Outcomes (National Data):**

Based on GAO and CMS data on SFF program outcomes 18-24 months after designation:⁴⁶
- **~50%:** Significantly improve quality, graduate from SFF program
- **~34%:** Continue in SFF program with marginal improvement, monitoring continues
- **~16%:** Terminated from Medicare/Medicaid for failure to improve

**Orange County-Specific Risk Factors (Elevated Termination Probability):**

Standard SFF termination risk is 16% nationally, but Orange County exhibits aggravating factors increasing probability:

1. **Three immediate jeopardy citations in 18 months (March 2023, March 2024, July 2024):** Demonstrates pattern of serious deficiencies, not isolated incident. Facilities cited for immediate jeopardy on **any two surveys** while in SFF program face discretionary termination.⁴⁷ Orange County already has 3, perilously close to 4th citation triggering termination authority.

2. **Substandard quality finding (F686):** Desert Sun also has substandard quality, but Orange County's overall pattern is worse (1-star vs. 2-star).

3. **DPNA enforcement 6 months (April-October 2024):** Longest DPNA in portfolio, indicates sustained non-compliance requiring prolonged sanctions.

4. **Star rating decline 3-star → 1-star (2022-2024):** Rapid deterioration suggests systemic management failure, not isolated quality issue.

5. **Occupancy decline 94% → 88% (2022-2024):** 6-point drop correlates with reputation damage from deficiency history, creates negative financial spiral (lower revenue → less staffing → worse quality → more deficiencies).

6. **California's stringent survey environment:** California facilities average 11-15 deficiencies per survey (vs. 7.4 nationally).⁴⁸ More difficult to achieve substantial compliance in California than other states.

**Adjusted Orange County termination probability:** 16% (national baseline) × 1.75 (aggravating factors multiplier) = **28% probability of termination by March 2028**.

**Consequences of Termination:**

**Medicare Termination (28% of revenue = $7.8M annually):**

When CMS terminates a facility's Medicare provider agreement, the facility can no longer participate in Medicare Part A (skilled nursing facility benefit).⁴⁹ Orange County derives $28M × 28% = $7.8M from Medicare. Post-termination, facility cannot admit Medicare beneficiaries or bill for services to existing Medicare residents (residents must transfer to other facilities or convert to private pay).

**Medicaid Termination (60% of revenue = $16.8M annually):**

Federal regulations tie Medicaid participation to Medicare certification. 42 C.F.R. § 442.12 requires nursing facilities to be Medicare-certified to participate in Medicaid.⁵⁰ California Medi-Cal (Medicaid) would automatically terminate if federal Medicare agreement terminated. Orange County derives $28M × 60% = $16.8M from Medi-Cal.

**Total Revenue Loss:** $7.8M (Medicare) + $16.8M (Medi-Cal) = **$24.6M annually (88% of total revenue)**

**Facility Closure Inevitability:**

Remaining revenue = $28M × 12% (private pay) = $3.36M annually. Orange County operating expenses estimated at $25M annually (based on 18.2% EBITDA margin: $28M revenue - $25M costs = $3M EBITDA normally). **Cannot operate on $3.36M revenue with $25M cost structure.** Facility would close within 30-90 days of termination, displacing 145 residents and 155 employees.

**Impact on Transaction:**

**Scenario Analysis:**

| Scenario | Probability | Outcome | Transaction Impact |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **A: March 2025 Survey Passes** | 60% | Orange County shows improvement, remains SFF Candidate, eventually graduates | **Proceed with acquisition including Orange County**, price reflects candidate status risk ($2.5M annual improvement costs) |
| **B: Full SFF Designation (Sept 2025)** | 28% (40% × 70%) | Survey fails, full SFF designated, facility improves over 3 years, avoids termination | **Proceed but require $2.5M escrow** for improvement plan, extended earn-out tied to graduation |
| **C: Termination (March 2028)** | 11.2% (40% × 28%) | Survey fails, full SFF designated, facility does not improve, terminated March 2028 | **$24.6M revenue loss, facility closure, $165M NPV loss** |
| **D: Immediate Termination (23-day)** | 5% | 4th immediate jeopardy citation triggers 23-day termination process | **Catastrophic loss, immediate closure** |

**Expected Value Calculation:**

- Scenario A: 60% × $0 loss = $0
- Scenario B: 28% × $2.5M annual costs × 3 years × 2.57 PV factor = $5.4M
- Scenario C: 11.2% × $165M NPV loss = $18.5M
- Scenario D: 5% × $165M loss = $8.25M
- **Total Expected Loss:** $0 + $5.4M + $18.5M + $8.25M = **$32.15M**

**Purchase Price Adjustment Recommendations:**

**Option 1: Exclude Orange County from Transaction (Cleanest Solution)**

Silver Oak should **exclude Orange County Care Center** from the acquisition, reducing purchase price by facility valuation:
- **Valuation:** $28M revenue × 3× revenue multiple (typical SNF M&A) = **$84M**
- **Price reduction:** **$84M**
- **Advantage:** Eliminates all SFF termination risk, regulatory complexity, reputational damage from 1-star facility
- **Disadvantage:** Loses upside if facility improves (though only 60% probability)

**Option 2: Include with Price Adjustment and Escrow**

If Silver Oak proceeds with Orange County:
- **Immediate price reduction:** $32.15M (expected value of termination risk)
- **Escrow:** $2.5M for 3-year improvement plan (released to seller only if substantial compliance achieved and full SFF avoided)
- **Contingent payment (earn-out):** Additional $10M payable to seller if Orange County graduates from SFF program within 24 months post-closing (incentivizes seller cooperation during transition)
- **Total price reduction:** **$32.15M** (expected value basis)

**Option 3: March 2025 Survey Contingency (Delays Closing)**

Make closing contingent on satisfactory March 2025 survey results:
- **Condition precedent:** Orange County must not receive any immediate jeopardy citations and must reduce total deficiencies to <8 (below national average 9.5)
- **Advantage:** Eliminates uncertainty, no closing until risk resolved
- **Disadvantage:** Delays closing by 3-4 months (March 2025 survey + results review), seller may reject delayed timeline

**Regulatory Approval Risk (Change of Ownership):**

**California CDPH CHOW Approval:**

SFF Candidate status creates **substantial risk of California CDPH denying or delaying license transfer approval** for Orange County facility. California Department of Public Health (CDPH) reviews applicant's ability to operate facilities in compliance with state and federal requirements.⁵¹ CDPH may:

1. **Deny transfer** until Orange County achieves substantial compliance (March 2025 survey must show improvement)
2. **Delay approval** pending additional background checks, financial capability review, management plan submission
3. **Impose conditions** such as mandatory temporary management, additional staffing requirements, improvement plan milestones

**Estimated CHOW delay for Orange County: 3-6 months** beyond standard 30-60 day CDPH review period.

**Other 11 facilities CHOW not affected** - Arizona DHS (6 facilities) and Nevada DHHS (3 facilities) approvals, plus 2 non-SFF California facilities, should proceed on normal timeline.

**Recommendation:** File CMS Form 855A and state CHOW applications for all 12 facilities simultaneously in January 2025 (60 days before March closing), but **bifurcate transaction structure** to allow closing on 11 facilities if Orange County CDPH approval delayed.

**SFF Improvement Plan Requirements (If Full SFF Designated):**

Based on CMS guidance and industry practice for SFF turnaround, Orange County would require:⁵²

**Leadership Changes:**
- **Replace Administrator:** Hire experienced turnaround administrator with SFF remediation track record ($150K-$200K annually, premium 30-40% above standard DON)
- **Replace or augment Director of Nursing:** DON with clinical quality improvement expertise
- **Add Assistant Director of Nursing (ADON):** Support DON with day-to-day operations

**Staffing Increases (+27 FTE):**
- **RN staff:** +5 FTE RNs for infection control, wound care, medication administration oversight
- **LPN staff:** +7 FTE LPNs for treatments, wound care
- **CNA staff:** +15 FTE CNAs to achieve 3.5 PPD California requirement and provide adequate resident care
- **Total staffing cost increase:** $1.3M annually (27 FTE × $48,000 average loaded cost)

**Specialist Staff:**
- **Infection Preventionist (IP):** Full-time IP ($95K annually) to prevent future COVID-19/infection control failures
- **Wound Care Nurse Specialist:** ($85K annually) to prevent pressure ulcer recurrence (current F686 substandard quality issue)

**Technology and Systems:**
- **Bar-Code Medication Administration (BCMA):** Prevent medication errors like Coumadin overdose ($200K upfront + $30K annually)
- **Electronic care planning system:** Improve care plan documentation, MDS accuracy ($50K upfront + $20K annually)
- **Fall detection sensors:** Prevent resident falls ($50K upfront)

**Consulting and Training:**
- **Quality improvement consultant:** Engage post-acute care quality consultant for 18-month engagement ($250K total)
- **Staff training:** Intensive training on infection control, pressure ulcer prevention, medication administration ($100K annually)

**Total SFF Improvement Plan Cost:**

| Category | Year 1 | Years 2-3 (Annual) |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Leadership | $450K | $400K |
| Staffing (+27 FTE) | $1.3M | $1.3M |
| Specialist staff | $180K | $180K |
| Technology | $300K upfront + $50K | $50K |
| Consulting/training | $350K | $100K |
| **TOTAL** | **$2.63M** | **$2.03M** |
| **3-Year Total** | | **$6.69M** |

**NPV of improvement investment (3 years, 8% discount):** $2.63M + $2.03M/1.08 + $2.03M/1.08² = $2.63M + $1.88M + $1.74M = **$6.25M**

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

**Investment:** $6.25M NPV (improvement plan) + $32.15M expected termination loss = **$38.4M total expected cost**

**Benefits of successful improvement:**
- **Avoid termination:** $165M NPV revenue preserved (72% probability if improvement plan implemented vs. 30% baseline)
- **Star rating improvement:** 1-star → 3-star = occupancy gain 88% → 92% = +6 beds × $192/day × 365 = **$421K annual revenue gain**
- **Avoid future DPNA:** Eliminate immediate jeopardy risk, avoid $990K/incident DPNA penalties = **$990K/year expected value**
- **Reputational recovery:** SFF graduation improves Silver Oak portfolio reputation, facilitates future acquisitions

**Net Benefit (if improvement succeeds):** $165M preserved - $38.4M cost = **+$126.6M NPV**

**However: Only 72% probability of success even with $6.25M investment.** Expected value = 72% × $126.6M = $91.2M benefit - 28% × $165M loss = -$46.2M loss = **+$45M net expected value**.

**Conclusion:** SFF improvement plan is **financially justified** but high-risk. 28% probability of failure and $165M loss is unacceptable for most acquirers.

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION:**

**Silver Oak should EXCLUDE Orange County Care Center from the acquisition**, reducing purchase price by $84M (3× revenue multiple valuation). The 28% termination probability, 88% revenue loss if terminated, March 2025 survey uncertainty, California CHOW delay risk, and $6.25M improvement investment required create unacceptable transaction risk.

**Alternative:** If Silver Oak has experience with SFF turnarounds and capacity to absorb $6.25M improvement investment, could proceed with Orange County but require:
1. **$84M purchase price reduction** (full facility value) OR
2. **$32M price reduction + $10M escrow + earn-out** tied to SFF graduation within 24 months
3. **Bifurcated closing structure:** Close on 11 facilities immediately, delay Orange County closing until March 2025 survey results known (if satisfactory, close on Orange County 30-60 days later with reduced price adjustment)

### D. CMS Proposed 2024 Minimum Staffing Requirements - **CRITICAL REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT: RULE REPEALED DECEMBER 2025**

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CRITICAL CHANGE:**

The CMS minimum staffing rule (CMS-3442-F), which would have required 3.5 hours PPD total nursing care (RN 0.55 PPD minimum, CNA 2.45 PPD minimum) by May 2026-2027, has been **REPEALED** effective December 3, 2025, pursuant to Public Law 119-21.¹¹ This repeal eliminates the primary regulatory driver for Sunset's projected $4.3M annual staffing cost increase, fundamentally changing the transaction risk profile.

**Timeline of Regulatory Action:**

| Date | Action | Authority | Impact |
|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| May 10, 2024 | Final rule published | 89 Fed. Reg. 39832 (CMS-3442-F)¹² | Established 3.48 PPD minimum (RN 0.55, NA 2.45, plus 24/7 RN onsite) |
| June 21, 2024 | Effective date | 42 C.F.R. § 483.35(b)(1), (c)(1) | Compliance deadline: May 11, 2026 (non-rural), May 10, 2027 (rural) |
| July 4, 2025 | Congressional moratorium | Pub. L. No. 119-21, § 71111¹³ | Prohibited CMS from implementing, administering, or enforcing rule until after Sept. 30, 2034 |
| December 3, 2025 | Repeal effective | 90 Fed. Reg. 55697¹⁴ | CMS removed 3.48 PPD, 0.55 RN, 2.45 NA requirements; removed 24/7 RN requirement |

**Statutory Authority for Repeal:**

Section 71111 of Public Law 119-21 (signed July 4, 2025) precludes CMS from "implementing, administering, or enforcing" the minimum staffing standards established in the May 2024 final rule until after September 30, 2034—effectively a 9-year moratorium.¹⁵ CMS issued an interim final rule with comment period on December 2, 2025, to align 42 CFR with the statutory moratorium.¹⁶

**Specific Requirements Removed:**

1. **Total Nursing Hours:** 3.48 hours per resident day minimum (REPEALED)
2. **Registered Nurse Hours:** 0.55 hours per resident day minimum (REPEALED)
3. **Nurse Aide Hours:** 2.45 hours per resident day minimum (REPEALED)
4. **24/7 RN Coverage:** Registered nurse onsite 24 hours/day, 7 days/week (REPEALED)

**Current Federal Staffing Requirements (Post-Repeal):**

Following the December 2025 repeal, skilled nursing facilities must comply with the following baseline 42 CFR § 483.35 requirements:

1. **RN Supervision 8 Hours/Day:** Registered nurse must be onsite at least 8 consecutive hours per day, 7 days per week.¹⁷

2. **Sufficient Staff Standard:** Facility must provide "sufficient staff" to meet the needs of all residents, based on resident assessments and case mix.¹⁸ This is a qualitative standard interpreted through CMS expected staffing calculations; facilities with actual staffing significantly below expected levels (e.g., Henderson 2.8 PPD vs. 3.6 PPD expected) are cited for F880 insufficient staffing.

3. **Director of Nursing:** Full-time director of nursing (DON), who may serve as charge nurse only in facilities with <60 beds.¹⁹

**Financial Impact on Transaction:**

| Scenario | Annual Cost | NPV (10 years, 8% discount) | Status |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Original Analysis (Rule Enforced)** | **$4.3M ongoing** | **$25.5M** | **NO LONGER APPLICABLE** |
| Phase-in Year 1 (90% standard) | $950K | N/A | ELIMINATED |
| Phase-in Year 2 (95% standard) | $1.97M incremental | N/A | ELIMINATED |
| Phase-in Year 3 (100% standard) | $4.3M full compliance | N/A | ELIMINATED |
| **Post-Repeal Scenario** | **$0 mandatory federal increase** | **$0** | **CURRENT LAW** |
| Voluntary quality improvement staffing | $2M-4M (discretionary) | $11.3M-$22.6M | Management decision |

**CRITICAL FINDING: $25.5M REGULATORY COST ELIMINATED**

The repeal of the CMS staffing rule eliminates the $25.5M net present value compliance cost that was the basis for research plan projections. Sunset Senior Living Group is **no longer required** to hire 26 additional FTE RNs and 65 additional FTE CNAs to meet federal minimums.

**Revised Risk Assessment:**

**BEFORE REPEAL (Research Plan Assumption):**
- **Compliance Gap:** RN 0.10 PPD shortfall (26 FTE RNs), CNA 0.25 PPD shortfall (65 FTE CNAs)
- **Mandatory Cost:** $4.3M annual ongoing (RN $1.9M, CNA $2.4M)
- **Risk Level:** HIGH - Federal regulatory compliance requirement
- **Timeline:** Phase-in 2026-2028 (non-negotiable)

**AFTER REPEAL (Current Regulatory Environment):**
- **Federal Requirement:** "Sufficient staff" qualitative standard only
- **Mandatory Cost:** $0 for federal compliance (current staffing 3.45 PPD adequate if meets resident needs)
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Must maintain sufficient staff to avoid F880 citations, but no numeric federal minimum
- **Timeline:** No federal deadline

**State-Level Staffing Requirements (Unaffected by Federal Repeal):**

While federal requirements were repealed, **California state law** independently mandates 3.5 PPD:

**California Health & Safety Code § 1276.5 (effective July 1, 2023):**²⁰
- **Minimum:** 3.5 hours direct care per resident day (RN, LVN, CNA combined)
- **CNA Component:** At least 2.4 hours provided by CNAs
- **Waiver Available:** Facilities may seek CDPH waiver to reduce to 3.2 hours PPD

**Sunset California Facilities Compliance:**

| Facility | Current Staffing | CA Requirement | Gap | Compliance Status |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-----|-------------------|
| Orange County Care Center | 3.35 PPD | 3.5 PPD | -0.15 PPD | **NON-COMPLIANT** (shortfall ~22 FTE) |
| Sunrise Manor (Riverside) | 3.6 PPD | 3.5 PPD | +0.1 PPD surplus | **COMPLIANT** ✓ |
| San Diego Bay SNF | 3.45 PPD | 3.5 PPD | -0.05 PPD | **BORDERLINE** (shortfall ~7 FTE) |

**California-Specific Cost (Unchanged by Federal Repeal):**

For the 3 California facilities (435 licensed beds, ~390 census at 90% occupancy):
- **Orange County shortfall:** 0.15 PPD × 390 resident days/day × 365 days = 21,353 hours annually = 10 FTE staff × $38,000 average = **$380K annually**
- **San Diego shortfall (if enforced):** 0.05 PPD × 365 × 390 = 7,118 hours = 3 FTE × $38,000 = **$114K annually**
- **Total California compliance cost:** **$494K annually** (vs. $4.3M for all 12 facilities under repealed federal rule)

**Arizona and Nevada (No State Minimums):**

Neither Arizona nor Nevada has enacted numeric minimum staffing requirements comparable to California.²¹ Facilities in these states need only comply with federal "sufficient staff" qualitative standard under 42 CFR § 483.35(a).

**Strategic Implications for Acquisition:**

1. **Purchase Price Adjustment:** The $4.3M annual staffing cost ($25.5M NPV) cited in research plan as basis for price reduction is **NO LONGER APPLICABLE**. If Silver Oak negotiated downward price adjustment based on this compliance cost, adjustment should be eliminated or reduced to $494K California-only exposure.

2. **EBITDA Projections:** Financial models assuming -$4.3M annual EBITDA reduction from staffing compliance should be **revised upward** by $3.8M (reflecting elimination of AZ/NV staffing costs, retention of $494K CA costs).

3. **Competitive Positioning:** Federal repeal levels playing field—low-staffed competitors no longer face mandatory increases. Sunset's decision to increase staffing voluntarily for quality improvement becomes **discretionary business decision**, not regulatory mandate.

4. **California Facilities:** Orange County and potentially San Diego still require staffing increases to meet CA state law, but cost is $494K annually (89% reduction from $4.3M federal estimate).

5. **Survey Vulnerability:** Even without federal numeric minimums, facilities providing insufficient staff relative to resident needs will continue to be cited for F880. Henderson Care (2.8 PPD vs. 3.6 expected) remains vulnerable regardless of federal rule repeal.

**CMS Cost-Benefit Analysis of Repeal:**

CMS estimates that removing the 3.48 PPD requirement will result in total savings of $315,672,322 over 10 years across the industry.²² This suggests substantial cost burden that would have affected Sunset's competitive position and profitability.

**Monitoring for Future Regulatory Changes:**

While Public Law 119-21 prohibits enforcement until September 30, 2034, Congress could:
1. Repeal the moratorium earlier (requires new legislation)
2. Enact different staffing standards post-2034
3. Condition future Medicare payment increases on staffing levels (indirect enforcement)

**Recommendation:** Transaction documents should acknowledge that federal staffing requirements may change post-closing, and allocate risk of future regulatory cost increases between buyer and seller (e.g., seller representations that current staffing complies with law as of closing date, buyer assumes risk of future law changes).

### E. Denial of Payment for New Admissions (DPNA) and Civil Monetary Penalties

**DPNA Regulatory Framework:**

Denial of Payment for New Admissions (DPNA) is one of the most severe non-termination enforcement remedies available to CMS.⁵³ Under 42 C.F.R. § 488.417, CMS or the State **must** deny payment for all new admissions when:

1. The facility is not in substantial compliance 3 months after the last day of the survey identifying noncompliance; **OR**
2. The State survey agency has cited a facility with substandard quality of care on the **last three consecutive standard surveys**.⁵⁴

DPNA may also be imposed for immediate jeopardy findings at CMS or State discretion.⁵⁵

**Scope of DPNA:**

DPNA applies to **Medicare Part A** and **Medicaid** new admissions only.⁵⁶ It does not affect:
- Private pay residents (not federally funded)
- Private insurance residents (non-Medicare Advantage)
- Residents already living in facility before DPNA effective date (grandfathered)
- Residents who were in facility, hospitalized, and return (considered continuing stay, not new admission)⁵⁷

**However:** Facility revenue is severely impaired because Medicare and Medicaid represent 86% of Sunset's revenue. Inability to admit new Medicare/Medicaid residents creates negative financial spiral: occupancy declines as grandfathered residents discharge → revenue falls → facility must reduce staffing → quality worsens → deficiencies persist → DPNA continues or worsens to termination.

**Sunset FY2024 DPNA History:**

**Desert Sun Care Center (Scottsdale, AZ):**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Survey Date** | November 2023 |
| **Deficiency** | F686 - Treatment/Services to Prevent/Heal Pressure Ulcers |
| **Scope/Severity** | Scope E (Pattern), Severity 2 (Actual Harm) = **Substandard Quality of Care** |
| **Findings** | 3 residents developed Stage 3-4 pressure ulcers; inadequate repositioning (q2h protocol not followed); documentation failures (no turning/repositioning logs); wound care not provided per physician orders |
| **DPNA Period** | January 2024 - May 2024 (**4 months**, 122 days) |
| **Admissions Blocked** | 30 Medicare admissions (estimated 7-8 admissions/month normal rate) |
| **Revenue Loss** | 30 admissions × $18,000 average Medicare stay = **$540,000** |
| **CMP** | $42,000 (per-day penalty: $6,418/day × 6.5 days from survey to correction) |
| **Removal** | Plan of Correction (POC) accepted May 2024, revisit survey confirmed substantial compliance |

**Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA):**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Survey Date** | March 2024 |
| **Deficiency** | F880 - Infection Prevention and Control Program - **Immediate Jeopardy** |
| **Findings** | COVID-19 outbreak affecting 12 residents; facility failed to isolate COVID-positive residents (remained in shared rooms); failed to test symptomatic residents for 3-5 days; failed to report outbreak to CDPH within 24 hours per CA regulations; inadequate PPE use by staff; no contact tracing |
| **DPNA Period** | April 2024 - October 2024 (**6 months**, 184 days) |
| **Admissions Blocked** | 45 Medicare admissions + 20 Medicaid admissions (estimated 7.5 Medicare + 3.3 Medicaid/month) |
| **Revenue Loss** | (45 Medicare × $18,000) + (20 Medicaid × $9,000) = $810,000 + $180,000 = **$990,000** |
| **CMP** | $95,000 (per-instance penalty for immediate jeopardy, higher penalty amount due to severity) |
| **Removal** | Immediate jeopardy removed within 2 weeks (implemented isolation protocols, testing, PPE compliance); DPNA continued until October 2024 to ensure sustained compliance; revisit survey October 2024 confirmed correction |

**Aggregate FY2024 DPNA Impact:**

| Metric | Desert Sun | Orange County | **Portfolio Total** |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| DPNA Duration | 4 months | 6 months | **10 months aggregate** |
| Admissions Blocked | 30 Medicare | 45 Medicare + 20 Medicaid | **95 total** |
| Revenue Loss | $540,000 | $990,000 | **$1,530,000** |
| CMP Penalties | $42,000 | $95,000 | **$137,000** |
| **Total Financial Impact** | **$582,000** | **$1,085,000** | **$1,667,000** |

**$1.667M enforcement impact represents 3.2% of $52M EBITDA** (FY2024), material reduction in profitability.

**Future DPNA Risk Modeling:**

**Recurrence Probability Analysis:**

Based on historical deficiency patterns and current compliance status, probability of future DPNA over next 24 months (post-closing):

| Facility | Current Status | DPNA Risk (24 months) | Estimated Duration | Expected Revenue Loss |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Orange County | SFF candidate, 1-star, 3× IJ | **60%** | 6-9 months | 60% × $1.2M = **$720K** |
| Desert Sun | 2-star, F686 history | **25%** | 3-4 months | 25% × $600K = **$150K** |
| Henderson | 2-star, understaffed 2.8 PPD | **20%** | 4-6 months | 20% × $700K = **$140K** |
| Other 9 facilities | 3-4 star, standard deficiencies | **5% each** | 3 months | 9 × 5% × $400K = **$180K** |
| **Portfolio Expected Value** | | | | **$1,190,000** |

[METHODOLOGY: Probability estimates based on: (1) Orange County 60% = SFF candidate with pattern of IJ citations + March 2025 survey 40% failure probability + 40% probability DPNA imposed vs. immediate termination = 40% × 40% + 20% baseline = 60% compound; (2) Desert Sun 25% = substandard quality history, if pressure ulcer issues recur DPNA reimposed; (3) Henderson 20% = severe understaffing (2.8 vs. 3.6 PPD) likely to generate F880 insufficient staffing citation, if scope/severity elevated could trigger DPNA; (4) Other facilities 5% = baseline risk for facilities with standard deficiency patterns]

**Expected Future DPNA Exposure (24 months post-closing):** $1,190,000

**Combined Historical + Future DPNA:** $1,667,000 (FY2024) + $1,190,000 (expected 24 months) = **$2,857,000 total DPNA exposure** over 30-month period (Jan 2024 - June 2027).

**Civil Monetary Penalties (CMP) Framework:**

**CMP Authority:** 42 C.F.R. § 488.438 authorizes CMS and State survey agencies to impose civil monetary penalties for Medicare/Medicaid participation requirement violations.⁵⁸

**CMP Penalty Ranges (2024 Inflation-Adjusted Amounts):**

Federal Register published annual inflation adjustment effective August 8, 2024:⁵⁹

**Per-Day Penalties:**

1. **Immediate Jeopardy (IJ):** $6,866 - $22,878 per day⁶⁰
   - Applied from date of noncompliance until date of correction
   - Higher range ($15,000-$22,878) for egregious violations
   - Lower range ($6,866-$14,999) for less severe IJ

2. **Non-Immediate Jeopardy (Actual Harm or Potential for More Than Minimal Harm):** $229 - $6,865 per day⁶¹
   - Scope D-L (pattern to widespread): typically $1,000-$3,000/day range
   - Scope A-C (isolated): typically $229-$1,000/day range

**Per-Instance Penalties:**

When penalties imposed for an instance of noncompliance (discrete event): $2,289 - $22,878 per instance⁶²
- Immediate jeopardy instances: $10,000-$22,878
- Actual harm instances: $2,289-$10,000

**CMP Calculation Methodology (42 C.F.R. § 488.438(f)):**

CMS and States consider following factors in determining penalty amount within statutory range:

1. **Seriousness of deficiency:** Scope (isolated to widespread) × Severity (1-4: no harm to immediate jeopardy)
2. **Relationship to quality of care:** Direct impact on resident outcomes vs. administrative/paperwork issues
3. **Whether deficiency was corrected:** Rapid correction (<24 hours) vs. prolonged noncompliance (weeks/months)
4. **Facility history:** First-time vs. repeat violations, past enforcement actions
5. **Facility financial condition:** Ability to pay (rarely reduces penalty significantly)⁶³

**Sunset CMP Analysis (FY2024):**

**Desert Sun CMP ($42,000):**
- **Per-day penalty:** $6,418/day (likely 2023 inflation-adjusted rate, slightly below 2024 $6,866 minimum for IJ)
- **Days assessed:** 6.5 days (from November 2023 survey date to correction)
- **Deficiency:** F686 substandard quality (Severity 2, Scope E) - NOT immediate jeopardy
- **Rate explanation:** $6,418/day is in upper range for non-IJ per-day penalties ($229-$6,865 range), justified by substandard quality designation (Scope E pattern + Severity 2 actual harm to multiple residents)

**Orange County CMP ($95,000):**
- **Per-instance penalty:** $95,000 (appears to be per-instance, not per-day, given only 2-week immediate jeopardy duration but $95K penalty)
- **Deficiency:** F880 infection control immediate jeopardy (COVID-19 outbreak 12 residents)
- **Rate explanation:** Per-instance IJ penalties range $10,000-$22,878 per instance under 2024 rates; $95,000 suggests either: (1) CMP imposed under 2023 rates before August 2024 adjustment, OR (2) multiple instances counted (e.g., 12 residents affected = 12 instances, but this would be unusually harsh) [MORE LIKELY: Per-instance penalty $95,000 reflects serious public health threat from COVID outbreak affecting 12 residents, falls within CMS discretion for egregious IJ]

**Comparison to National CMP Patterns:**

Average CMP for immediate jeopardy nationwide: $40,000-$60,000 per facility⁶⁴
Orange County $95,000 is **58-138% above national average**, indicating California CDPH or CMS assessed penalty at high end of range due to:
- Public health emergency (COVID outbreak)
- Multiple residents harmed (12 residents infected)
- Failure to report timely (regulatory violation beyond clinical failure)
- Repeat immediate jeopardy history (3rd IJ citation in 18 months)

**CMP Payment Status:**

CMPs are **NOT insurable** - insurance policies exclude fines and penalties imposed by government (against public policy to allow insurance to cover regulatory penalties).⁶⁵ Sunset must pay $137,000 out-of-pocket. CMPs are typically payable within 60 days of imposition; failure to pay can result in Medicare/Medicaid payment offset (CMS deducts from future Medicare reimbursements).

**Future CMP Risk:**

If DPNA recurs as modeled ($1,190,000 expected revenue loss over 24 months), accompanying CMPs estimated:

| DPNA Scenario | CMP Range | Expected Value |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Orange County future DPNA (60% probability, likely IJ if occurs) | $50,000-$100,000 | 60% × $75,000 = **$45,000** |
| Desert Sun recurrence (25% probability, non-IJ) | $20,000-$40,000 | 25% × $30,000 = **$7,500** |
| Henderson DPNA (20% probability, non-IJ) | $15,000-$30,000 | 20% × $22,500 = **$4,500** |
| Other facilities (45% aggregate probability) | $10,000-$25,000 each | 45% × $17,500 = **$7,875** |
| **Total Expected Future CMPs (24 months)** | | **$64,875** |

**Combined Historical + Future CMP:** $137,000 (FY2024) + $64,875 (expected 24 months) = **$201,875 total CMP exposure**.

**Remediation Timeline and Re-Admission to Medicare/Medicaid:**

**DPNA Removal Process:**

1. **Plan of Correction (POC) Submission:** Facility must submit POC within 10 days of survey, detailing how each deficiency will be corrected⁶⁶
2. **Implementation:** Facility implements corrective actions (typically 30-90 days for systemic issues like staffing, infection control programs)
3. **Revisit Survey:** State survey agency conducts revisit survey to verify substantial compliance achieved
4. **DPNA Removal:** If revisit confirms correction, CMS/State removes DPNA; facility can resume admitting Medicare/Medicaid residents⁶⁷

**Desert Sun Timeline:** November 2023 survey → POC submitted → corrections implemented → May 2024 revisit survey (6 months) → DPNA removed → **Total 6 months before new admissions resumed**

**Orange County Timeline:** March 2024 survey → immediate jeopardy removed within 2 weeks (rapid infection control implementation) → DPNA continued to ensure sustained compliance → October 2024 revisit survey (7 months) → DPNA removed → **Total 7 months**

**Working Capital Impact:**

DPNA creates severe working capital strain:
- **Revenue loss:** Immediate (no new Medicare/Medicaid admissions)
- **Expenses continue:** Must maintain staffing and operations for existing residents (cannot reduce costs proportionally)
- **Improvement costs:** Must invest in corrective actions (additional staff, consultants, technology) while revenue declining

**Desert Sun Working Capital Impact (4 months DPNA):**
- Revenue loss: $540,000
- Ongoing fixed costs: ~$580,000 (4 months × $145,000/month estimated fixed costs for 145-bed facility)
- Improvement investment: $100,000 (pressure ulcer prevention program, wound care specialist, staff training)
- **Net cash burn:** $540,000 loss + $100,000 investment - $580,000 (would have been incurred anyway) = **$640,000 total impact on facility cash flow**

**Orange County Working Capital Impact (6 months DPNA):**
- Revenue loss: $990,000
- Ongoing fixed costs: ~$870,000 (6 months × $145,000/month)
- Improvement investment: $200,000 (infection preventionist hire, PPE supplies, isolation room upgrades, testing equipment)
- **Net cash burn:** $990,000 loss + $200,000 investment = **$1,190,000 total impact**

**Portfolio-Wide Working Capital Reserves Needed:**

If future DPNA occurs as modeled ($1,190,000 expected loss + $300,000 improvement costs), Silver Oak should maintain **$1.5M-$2M liquidity reserve** to cover DPNA working capital needs without defaulting on debt covenants or reducing staffing (which would worsen quality and prolong DPNA).

**Covenant Compliance Risk:**

If Silver Oak finances acquisition with debt (typical PE acquisition 60-70% LTV), DPNA revenue losses could trigger EBITDA covenant violations:
- **Base EBITDA:** $52M (FY2024)
- **Post-DPNA EBITDA:** $52M - $1.19M expected future DPNA - $0.065M CMPs = **$50.74M** (-2.4% reduction)
- **Debt service coverage ratio (DSCR):** If debt service $20M annually, DSCR = $50.74M / $20M = **2.54×** (vs. 2.6× without DPNA)

Lenders typically require DSCR ≥2.0-2.5× for SNF portfolios. DPNA revenue losses could push facility toward covenant violation if combined with other adverse events (occupancy decline, reimbursement cuts, staffing cost increases).

**Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Price Adjustment:** Reduce purchase price by **$2.86M** (expected DPNA exposure) + $0.20M (expected CMP exposure) = **$3.06M total enforcement risk** over 30 months post-closing.

2. **Indemnification:** Seller should indemnify buyer for any DPNA or CMP imposed based on pre-closing surveys (surveys conducted before closing date, even if DPNA/CMP imposed post-closing). Research plan indicates FY2024 DPNA/CMPs already occurred and resolved, but if any surveys pending results as of closing, seller liability.

3. **Quality Improvement Investment:** Allocate $2M-$3M in Year 1 post-closing for pressure ulcer prevention, infection control programs, staffing increases at Orange County/Desert Sun/Henderson to prevent DPNA recurrence. ROI: Avoid $1.19M DPNA expected loss = **40-60% return on $2M investment**.

4. **Working Capital Reserve:** Maintain $2M facility-level liquidity reserve for DPNA working capital needs (do not distribute to equity holders or upstream to parent until portfolio achieves 12 consecutive months with no DPNA/IJ citations).

### F. Change of Ownership (CHOW) Requirements (42 CFR § 489.18)

**Federal CHOW Requirements:**

42 C.F.R. § 489.18 governs change of ownership for Medicare providers. When legal entity ownership changes, the existing provider agreement automatically assigns to the new owner, provided proper notice and documentation submitted.⁸⁰

**Key Requirements:**

1. **CMS Form 855A Submission:** New owner must submit enrollment application (CMS-855A) with SNF Attachment (effective October 1, 2024) at least 30 days before anticipated ownership transfer date.⁸¹

2. **SNF Attachment (NEW October 2024):** All SNFs enrolling, revalidating, reactivating, or undergoing CHOW must submit updated CMS-855A (09/24 version) with SNF Attachment completed, including:
   - Chart identifying all entities listed in Section A showing relationships with SNF and each other
   - Disclosure of all ownership, management, and control persons
   - Private equity company and REIT disclosures (if applicable)⁸²

3. **36-Month Lookback:** CMS reviews surveys, deficiencies, CMPs, and enforcement actions for 36 months preceding CHOW application.⁸³

4. **Automatic Assignment:** Upon approval, existing Medicare provider agreement assigns to new owner; no gap in Medicare certification or provider number change.⁸⁴

**Timing for Sunset Acquisition:**

**Expected closing:** March 2025
**CHOW filing deadline:** January 2025 (60 days advance notice recommended, minimum 30 days required)
**CMS processing time:** 30-60 days standard review

**Strategic Recommendation:** File CMS Form 855A for all 12 facilities **simultaneously in January 2025** to maximize processing time before March closing.

**State Licensing Change of Ownership Requirements:**

**Arizona (6 facilities):**

Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) requires:
- License transfer application submitted 30 days before closing⁸⁵
- Background checks: All owners >10% interest, administrators, directors
- Financial capability review: Demonstrate ability to operate facility, maintain adequate staffing
- Site inspection: ADHS may conduct pre-approval inspection
- Processing time: 30-60 days typical

**Arizona-Specific Considerations:**
- AB 1502-equivalent regulations do not exist (Arizona has less stringent ownership transfer requirements than California)
- 6 Sunset AZ facilities have mixed performance: Phoenix Valley, Mesa Heights, Tucson Ridge, Flagstaff Care, Yuma (3-star acceptable); Desert Sun (2-star with DPNA history may receive extra scrutiny)
- **Estimated approval timeline:** 45-60 days (January filing → February-March approval, aligns with closing)

**Nevada (3 facilities):**

Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) requires:
- Change of ownership notification 30 days prior
- Background checks via FBI fingerprinting for all officers/directors
- Financial statements demonstrating operational capacity
- Processing time: 30-45 days typical⁸⁶

**Nevada-Specific Considerations:**
- 3 Sunset NV facilities perform well: Silver Sage (4-star flagship), Reno Valley (3-star), Henderson (2-star but no enforcement history beyond understaffing)
- Nevada approval expected **without complications**
- **Estimated approval timeline:** 30-45 days (January filing → February-March approval)

**California (3 facilities) - AB 1502 ENHANCED REQUIREMENTS:**

California AB 1502 (Skilled Nursing Facility Ownership and Management Reform Act of 2022, effective July 1, 2023) substantially increased CDPH change of ownership review requirements.⁸⁷

**AB 1502 Enhanced Disclosure Requirements:**

1. **Expanded ownership disclosure:** All persons/entities with direct or indirect ownership ≥5% (vs. ≥10% federal requirement)
2. **Management company disclosure:** All management agreements, fees, related-party transactions
3. **Real estate ownership:** Disclose all real estate holding entities, ground leases, sale-leaseback arrangements
4. **Financial information:**
   - 3 years audited financial statements for applicant and all owners ≥10%
   - Pro forma operating budget for facility post-transfer
   - Demonstration of $1M minimum liquid assets per facility
5. **Criminal background checks:** All persons with ≥5% ownership, all officers/directors/managers
6. **Administrator qualifications:** Demonstrate administrator meets California licensure and experience requirements⁸⁸

**AB 1502 Review Process:**

**Standard timeline:** 60-90 days (longer than pre-AB 1502 30-60 days)

**CDPH Review Criteria:**
- Applicant's history operating healthcare facilities in California and other states
- Compliance history: Survey deficiencies, enforcement actions, license revocations
- Financial capacity: Adequate resources to maintain staffing, facility operations, capital improvements
- Administrator qualifications and track record⁸⁹

**Grounds for Denial:**
- Material misrepresentation in application
- Felony convictions related to healthcare fraud, elder abuse, patient harm
- Pattern of serious deficiencies or enforcement actions at applicant's other facilities
- **Inadequate financial capacity**
- **Pending serious deficiencies or enforcement actions at facility being acquired**⁹⁰

**Orange County SFF Candidate - CRITICAL CHOW BARRIER:**

Orange County's SFF candidate status and 1-star rating create **substantial risk** of CDPH denying or significantly delaying license transfer:

**CDPH Concerns:**
1. **Pending serious deficiencies:** Orange County designated SFF candidate September 2024, March 2025 survey pending; CDPH may require survey results before approving transfer
2. **Financial capacity:** CDPH may question whether Silver Oak has adequate resources to fund $2.5M annual SFF improvement plan while maintaining operations
3. **Management capability:** CDPH may require Silver Oak to demonstrate SFF turnaround experience, submit detailed improvement plan as condition of approval

**Likely CDPH Actions:**

**Scenario A (30% probability):** CDPH **denies transfer** until Orange County achieves substantial compliance
- Requires satisfactory March 2025 survey (no immediate jeopardy, substantial compliance achieved)
- Cannot close until survey complete and results reviewed by CDPH
- **Delay: 4-6 months** (March survey → May results → June-July CDPH review → August approval earliest)

**Scenario B (50% probability):** CDPH **conditionally approves** transfer with requirements
- Approval conditioned on: (1) $2.5M escrow for improvement plan; (2) mandatory quality improvement consultant; (3) temporary management if March 2025 survey shows continued serious deficiencies; (4) monthly reporting to CDPH
- Can close in March 2025 but subject to conditions
- **Delay: 30-45 days** for negotiation of conditions

**Scenario C (20% probability):** CDPH **approves without conditions**
- Silver Oak demonstrates adequate financial resources, submits credible improvement plan, no concerns about acquiring SFF candidate
- **No delay:** Standard 60-90 day processing

**Expected CHOW delay (probability-weighted):** 30% × 150 days + 50% × 37.5 days + 20% × 0 days = **64 days average delay** (approximately 2 months beyond standard timeline)

**Sunrise Manor and San Diego Bay (Non-SFF California Facilities):**

Sunrise Manor (Riverside, 3-star, complies with CA 3.5 PPD requirement) and San Diego Bay (San Diego, 3-star) expected to receive **standard CDPH approval** in 60-90 days without complications.

**Transaction Structure Recommendation - Bifurcated Closing:**

To avoid Orange County CHOW uncertainty delaying entire transaction:

**Phase 1 Closing (March 2025):**
- Close on **11 facilities:** 6 Arizona + 3 Nevada + 2 California (Sunrise Manor, San Diego Bay)
- Total purchase price Phase 1: **$341M** ($425M total - $84M Orange County)
- All Phase 1 facilities CHOW approvals expected by March 2025 (CMS Form 855A filed January, state approvals 60-90 days)

**Phase 2 Closing (Contingent on CDPH Approval):**
- **Option A:** If CDPH approves Orange County by March 2025 → Close simultaneously with Phase 1
- **Option B:** If CDPH delays Orange County → Phase 1 closes March, Phase 2 (Orange County) closes when CDPH approval received (estimated May-August 2025)
- **Option C:** If CDPH denies Orange County or requires satisfaction of March 2025 survey → Seller retains Orange County, no Phase 2 closing (already excluded from purchase price under recommended structure)

**Bifurcated Closing Advantages:**
1. **Eliminates transaction risk:** 11 facilities close on schedule regardless of Orange County CHOW status
2. **Preserves optionality:** If Orange County CDPH approves unexpectedly quickly or March 2025 survey passes, Silver Oak can still acquire
3. **Protects seller:** Seller receives $341M for 11 facilities in March 2025, not dependent on resolving Orange County regulatory issues

**CMS 36-Month Lookback Review:**

CMS reviews 36-month survey history for all facilities when processing Form 855A.⁹¹ Sunset's 36-month history (2022-2024) includes:

**Red Flags in CMS Review:**
- **Orange County:** 3 immediate jeopardy citations, DPNA 6 months, substandard quality, SFF candidate designation → **Highest scrutiny**
- **Desert Sun:** Substandard quality F686, DPNA 4 months → **Elevated scrutiny**
- **Other facilities:** Standard deficiency patterns, no termination risk → **Routine approval**

**CMS Denial Risk:**

CMS rarely denies CHOW applications unless applicant has history of Medicare/Medicaid fraud, program exclusions, or pattern of operating failed facilities.⁹² Silver Oak Healthcare's track record as established PE-backed post-acute operator should satisfy CMS financial/operational capability standards.

**However:** CMS may:
1. **Delay approval** pending resolution of Orange County SFF candidate status
2. **Impose enhanced monitoring** requiring quarterly compliance reports for Orange County, Desert Sun
3. **Require improvement plan** as condition of CHOW approval for Orange County

**Estimated CMS approval timeline:**
- **10 facilities (standard):** 30-45 days (January filing → February-March approval)
- **Orange County/Desert Sun:** 60-90 days (elevated scrutiny, possible conditional approval)

**Recommendation:** File Form 855A separately for Orange County to avoid single deficient facility delaying approval for other 11 facilities. Submit 11 "clean" facilities first (January 5, 2025), submit Orange County separately (January 15, 2025) after reviewing whether to include in transaction.

**Off-Cycle Revalidation Risk:**

CMS initiated off-cycle revalidations for all SNFs October-December 2024 requiring updated Form 855A with new SNF Attachment.⁹³ If Sunset facilities received revalidation notices in Q4 2024, seller should have submitted updated disclosures by December 2024. **Silver Oak should verify all 12 facilities completed off-cycle revalidation** before closing to avoid enrollment interruptions.

**Failure to complete revalidation** can result in:
- Decertification from Medicare
- Termination of Medicare billing privileges
- Revocation of Medicare enrollment⁹⁴

**Due Diligence Action Item:** Request copies of all CMS revalidation notices received by Sunset facilities in 2024 and confirmation of timely submission of updated Form 855A with SNF Attachment.

**Summary - CHOW Approval Timeline:**

| Facility/State | Expected Approval | Critical Issues | Mitigation |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Arizona (6)** | 45-60 days | Desert Sun DPNA history may receive extra scrutiny | Include Desert Sun improvement plan in CHOW application |
| **Nevada (3)** | 30-45 days | None - strong performance (Silver Sage 4-star) | Routine approval expected |
| **California - Sunrise Manor, San Diego** | 60-90 days | AB 1502 enhanced requirements, but no deficiency concerns | Standard approval |
| **California - Orange County** | **90-180 days** | **SFF candidate status, CDPH likely to delay pending March 2025 survey or impose conditions** | **Bifurcate closing: exclude from Phase 1 or make Phase 2 contingent** |

**Total CHOW Cost (All 12 Facilities):**

| Cost Category | Per Facility | 12 Facilities Total |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| CMS Form 855A filing fee | $0 (no fee) | $0 |
| State license transfer fees | $1,000-$3,000 | $18,000-$36,000 |
| Background checks (FBI, state) | $500-$1,000 per person × 5-10 persons/facility | $30,000-$60,000 |
| Legal/consulting fees (preparation) | $15,000-$25,000 per facility | $180,000-$300,000 |
| **Total CHOW Transaction Costs** | | **$228,000-$396,000** |

### B. Aggregate Expected Exposure Summary

**If Orange County EXCLUDED (RECOMMENDED):**

| Category | Expected Value | Mitigation Cost | Net Risk |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| SFF Termination | $0 (excluded) | $0 | **$0** |
| Federal Staffing | $0 (repealed) | $0 | **$0** |
| California Staffing (2 facilities) | $294K/year | $294K/year | **$0** (mandatory compliance) |
| Future DPNA (11 facilities, Orange County excluded) | $470K | $1.5M quality investment | **-$1.03M** (ROI positive) |
| Future CMPs | $20K | Included above | **$0** |
| Star Rating Improvement | $3M (2 facilities: Desert Sun, Henderson) | $10M investment over 3 years | **+$7M ROI** (positive Years 2-3) |
| Immediate Jeopardy Prevention | $1M (portfolio-wide risk) | $3.15M investment | **+$500K ROI** (positive) |
| Moderate Risks (LSC, OBRA, PDPM) | $645K | $500K | **$145K** |
| **TOTAL NET EXPECTED COST (11 facilities)** | | | **$145K** (minimal regulatory risk) |

**If Orange County INCLUDED (NOT RECOMMENDED):**

| Category | Expected Value | Mitigation Cost | Net Risk |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| SFF Termination | **$46.2M** | $6.25M improvement plan | **$39.95M** (unacceptable risk) |
| California Staffing (3 facilities) | $494K/year | $494K/year | **$0** |
| Future DPNA (12 facilities) | $1.19M | $2M quality investment | **-$810K** (ROI positive) |
| Future CMPs | $65K | Included above | **$0** |
| Star Rating Improvement | $6.7M (Year 1) | $15.8M over 3 years | **+$10.75M ROI** (positive Years 2-3) |
| Immediate Jeopardy | $3M | $3.15M | **+$500K ROI** |
| Moderate Risks | $1M | $500K | **$500K** |
| **TOTAL NET EXPECTED COST (12 facilities)** | | | **$40.14M** (unacceptable concentration in single facility) |

**Conclusion:** Excluding Orange County reduces net regulatory risk from **$40.14M to $145K** (99.6% risk reduction), eliminates transaction uncertainty, and converts regulatory compliance from **net cost to net ROI-positive investment** (+$7.2M cumulative ROI over 3 years for quality improvements).

### C. Red Flags Requiring Immediate Post-Closing Action

**If Silver Oak Proceeds with Acquisition (Excluding Orange County):**

1. **Desert Sun - Pressure Ulcer Prevention (Priority 1):**
   - **Issue:** F686 substandard quality November 2023, 3 residents Stage 3-4 ulcers, DPNA 4 months
   - **Immediate Action (Days 1-30):** Hire wound care specialist, implement q2h repositioning protocol with electronic tracking, purchase specialty mattresses for high-risk residents
   - **Investment:** $500K upfront + $185K annually
   - **Timeline:** 90 days to implement, next survey February-March 2026 must show zero new pressure ulcers

2. **Henderson - Staffing Crisis (Priority 1):**
   - **Issue:** 2.8 PPD actual vs. 3.6 PPD expected (22% understaffed), 85% occupancy, 1-star staffing rating

   - **Investment:** $200K consultant fees
   - **Timeline:** 6 months for comprehensive review, implement corrections before next PEPPER report (currently paused, expected resume 2025-2026)

### D. Ongoing Monitoring and Compliance Program

**Post-Closing Governance Structure:**

1. **Chief Quality Officer (Portfolio-Level):** Hire experienced SNF quality executive reporting to Silver Oak COO, responsible for:
   - Monthly review of all survey deficiencies across 11 facilities
   - Quarterly star rating monitoring and improvement plans
   - Annual QAPI program effectiveness assessment
   - Coordination with state survey agencies
   - **Compensation:** $250K-$300K annually + performance bonus tied to star rating improvement

2. **Facility-Level Quality Committees:** Each facility must have:
   - Monthly QAPI committee meetings (administrator, DON, medical director, resident/family representative)
   - Root cause analysis for all immediate jeopardy, actual harm, or substandard quality citations
   - 90-day improvement plans for facilities receiving DPNA or CMPs
   - Quarterly reporting to portfolio CQO

3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - Monthly Tracking:**

| KPI | Target | Alert Threshold | Action if Exceeded |
|-----|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Immediate jeopardy citations | 0 portfolio-wide | ≥1 in any month | Facility-level root cause analysis within 7 days, CQO site visit within 14 days |
| DPNA imposed | 0 facilities | ≥1 facility | Immediate intervention team deployed, administrator placed on performance improvement plan |
| Star rating decline | No facility drops ≥1 star | Any facility drops from 3→2 or 2→1 stars | 90-day turnaround plan required, monthly CQO oversight |
| Deficiencies per survey | ≤7.4 (national average) | ≥10 in single survey | Post-survey correction plan within 10 days, mock survey within 90 days |
| Occupancy decline | ≥90% portfolio average | <88% any facility for 2 consecutive months | Sales/marketing intervention, assess quality/reputation issues |

4. **Annual Budget for Regulatory Compliance:**

| Category | Annual Budget (11 Facilities) |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Chief Quality Officer compensation | $300K |
| Facility-level quality staff (IP, wound care) | $1.5M |
| Technology (BCMA, fall detection, EHR) | $500K (maintenance) |
| Consulting/training | $400K |
| Mock surveys/preparation | $200K |
| **Total Annual Compliance Budget** | **$2.9M** (1.1% of revenue) |

**ROI:** $2.9M annual investment prevents $3M-$5M expected losses from DPNA/CMPs/occupancy declines = **5-42% annual return.**

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. CRITICAL REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT: Federal Staffing Rule Repealed**

The CMS minimum staffing rule (3.48 PPD: RN 0.55, CNA 2.45) finalized May 2024 was **repealed December 3, 2025** pursuant to Congressional moratorium (Public Law 119-21, § 71111). This eliminates $25.5M NPV federal compliance cost that was foundational assumption in research plan. **Transaction impact: $25.5M regulatory cost exposure eliminated.** Residual California state requirement (3.5 PPD) affects only 3 facilities, reducing compliance cost from $4.3M annually (12 facilities) to $494K annually (2-3 CA facilities with shortfalls). **Recommendation: Revise purchase price to eliminate federal staffing adjustment; adjust financial models to reflect $3.8M annual EBITDA improvement.**

**2. ORANGE COUNTY SFF CANDIDATE STATUS IS DEAL-CRITICAL RISK**

Orange County Care Center (145 beds, $28M revenue, 1-star rating) designated Special Focus Facility Candidate September 2024, facing 28% probability of Medicare/Medicaid termination by March 2028 if designated full SFF and fails to improve. Termination eliminates 88% of revenue ($24.6M annually), forces facility closure, results in $165M NPV loss. **Expected exposure: $46.2M** (28% probability × $165M). March 2025 survey is critical milestone determining whether full SFF designation occurs (40% probability adverse outcome). SFF improvement plan requires $6.25M investment over 3 years with 72% success probability, but 28% termination risk remains unacceptable for most acquirers. **Recommendation: EXCLUDE Orange County from transaction, reduce purchase price by $84M (3× revenue multiple). Alternative: Bifurcate closing with Orange County contingent on satisfactory March 2025 survey results.**

**3. IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY PATTERN INDICATES SYSTEMIC QUALITY PROBLEMS**

Nine immediate jeopardy citations across 8 facilities (67% of portfolio) in 18 months substantially exceeds national rates (6.4% of facilities). Pattern spans medication errors (Coumadin overdose), infection control failures (COVID-19 outbreak 12 residents), resident assessment violations (PASARR), and life safety code (fire door propped open). Orange County accounts for 3 of 9 citations, but 5 other facilities also experienced immediate jeopardy, demonstrating **systemic quality management failures** rather than isolated facility problem. **Conclusion: Sunset's quality management systems are inadequate; Silver Oak must implement portfolio-wide quality improvement program immediately post-closing.** Investment required: $3.15M Year 1, $985K annually ongoing. ROI: Prevent 2-3 immediate jeopardy incidents annually worth $1.5M-$3M (DPNA, CMPs, reputational damage) = 50-200% return.

**4. BELOW-AVERAGE STAR RATINGS SUPPRESS OCCUPANCY AND REVENUE**

Portfolio averages 2.8 stars vs. 3.2 nationally; 33% of facilities rated 1-2 stars vs. 25% nationally; zero facilities achieve 5-star status vs. 18% nationally. All three component ratings (health inspections, staffing, quality measures) below national averages, indicating comprehensive quality deficits not isolated to single domain. Low star ratings directly correlate with occupancy suppression: Orange County declined 94%→88% (-6 points, $630K annual revenue loss) as rating fell from 3-star to 1-star. **Conclusion: Star rating improvement from 2.8→3.5 is financially justified.** Investment: $15.8M over 3 years. Benefits: $14.6M-$18.9M annually (occupancy gains 5-7 points, payer mix improvement Medicare 28%→32%, DPNA avoidance). **Net ROI: +$10.75M annually after stabilization,** but cash flow negative Year 1 (front-loaded investment $6.7M), positive Years 2-3.

**5. DPNA ENFORCEMENT HISTORY CREATES WORKING CAPITAL RISK**

FY2024 DPNA enforcement (Desert Sun 4 months, Orange County 6 months) resulted in $1.53M revenue loss + $137K CMPs = $1.667M total impact (3.2% of EBITDA). Future DPNA probability-weighted exposure: $1.19M over 24 months post-closing (Orange County 60%, Desert Sun 25%, Henderson 20%, others 5% each). Combined historical + future exposure: $2.86M over 30-month period. DPNA creates working capital strain (revenue loss immediate, expenses continue, improvement costs required). **Conclusion: Maintain $1.5M-$2M liquidity reserve** for DPNA working capital needs to avoid debt covenant violations. **Recommendation: Reduce purchase price by $3M (DPNA expected exposure) OR allocate $2M to quality improvement investment with demonstrable ROI (68% DPNA risk reduction).**

**6. CALIFORNIA AB 1502 CREATES ORANGE COUNTY CHOW BARRIER**

SFF candidate status creates substantial risk (80% probability) of California Department of Public Health (CDPH) denying or delaying license transfer approval 3-6 months. CDPH likely to require: (1) satisfactory March 2025 survey before approving transfer; (2) conditional approval with $2.5M escrowed improvement plan; or (3) temporary management/monthly reporting conditions. Expected delay: 64 days average (2 months beyond standard 60-90 day CDPH review). **Conclusion: Bifurcate transaction closing** to allow 11 facilities to close March 2025 regardless of Orange County CHOW status. **Recommendation: Close 11 facilities Phase 1 (March 2025, $341M), delay or exclude Orange County Phase 2 depending on CHOW approval and March 2025 survey outcome.**

**7. REGULATORY RISK CONCENTRATION IN SINGLE FACILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE**

Orange County represents **$46.2M of $50M total portfolio regulatory risk** (92% concentration). If Orange County excluded, portfolio regulatory risk reduces from $50M to $3.8M (92% reduction). Eleven facilities without Orange County have **minimal regulatory risk** ($145K net expected cost after quality improvement ROI), strong operational performance (Silver Sage 4-star flagship, 7 facilities 3-star average), and clear pathway to quality improvement with positive ROI. **Conclusion: Orange County is materially different risk profile from rest of portfolio; should not be underwritten using portfolio-average assumptions.** **Recommendation: Exclude Orange County to eliminate binary outcome risk (72% probability +$159M if improvement succeeds, 28% probability -$171M if terminates); transaction proceeds with 11 high-quality/improvable facilities at substantially reduced price ($341M vs. $425M) and minimal regulatory risk.**

### B. Recommended Transaction Structure

**STRUCTURE A (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED): EXCLUDE ORANGE COUNTY**

**Phase 1 Closing (March 2025):**
- **Facilities Acquired:** 11 facilities (6 Arizona, 3 Nevada, 2 California non-SFF)
- **Purchase Price:** **$341M** ($425M - $84M Orange County excluded)
- **Effective Valuation:** 3.0× revenue multiple on $285M - $28M = $257M eleven-facility revenue base
- **Regulatory Risk:** **$145K net** (after quality improvement ROI)
- **Quality Improvement Investment:** $12M over 3 years (Desert Sun, Henderson, portfolio-wide programs)
- **Expected ROI:** +$7.2M cumulative (positive Years 2-3)

**Orange County Excluded:**
- Seller retains Orange County Care Center
- Seller bears all SFF termination risk, March 2025 survey risk, California CHOW delay risk
- Silver Oak eliminates $46.2M expected SFF exposure, transaction uncertainty, reputational risk from 1-star facility

**Advantages:**
1. **Eliminates binary outcome risk:** No exposure to 28% termination probability with $165M loss
2. **Accelerates closing:** No dependency on California CHOW approval or March 2025 survey results
3. **Improves portfolio quality:** Eleven-facility portfolio averages 3.1 stars (vs. 2.8 with Orange County)
4. **Positive regulatory ROI:** Quality investment generates +$7.2M returns vs. -$40M net cost if Orange County included
5. **Preserves Silver Oak reputation:** Avoids association with SFF facility and potential closure in first year post-acquisition

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Foregoes upside:** If Orange County March 2025 survey passes (60% probability) and facility improves, Silver Oak loses opportunity to acquire turnaround asset
2. **Smaller portfolio:** 1,505 beds vs. 1,650 beds (9% smaller); $257M revenue vs. $285M (10% smaller)

**Pricing Impact vs. Original $425M:**
- Orange County excluded: -$84M
- Federal staffing cost eliminated: +$25.5M NPV (should have reduced price, now no reduction needed)
- **Net revised price: $366.5M** ($425M - $84M Orange County + $25.5M staffing cost that would have been adjustment)
- **However, recommend $341M** to reflect: (1) below-average portfolio quality 2.8 stars; (2) $12M quality improvement investment needed; (3) DPNA risk $2.86M; (4) 33% of portfolio 1-2 stars requiring remediation

**STRUCTURE B (ALTERNATIVE): BIFURCATED CLOSING WITH ORANGE COUNTY CONTINGENT**

**Phase 1 Closing (March 2025):**
- Close on 11 facilities: $341M
- Seller receives $341M cash at Phase 1 closing

**Phase 2 Closing (May-August 2025, Contingent):**
- **Condition Precedent:** Orange County March 2025 survey results satisfactory (no immediate jeopardy, <8 deficiencies, substantial compliance achieved)
- **Additional Conditions:** CDPH license transfer approved, CMS Form 855A approved
- **Purchase Price if Phase 2 Proceeds:** $30M (vs. $84M standalone valuation, reflects SFF candidate risk and improvement investment required)
- **Escrow:** $6.25M of Phase 2 price held in escrow for 36 months, released to seller only if Orange County achieves sustained substantial compliance (12 consecutive months no immediate jeopardy/substandard quality citations)

**If March 2025 Survey Fails:**
- Phase 2 does not close
- Seller retains Orange County
- No additional payment to seller beyond Phase 1 $341M

**Advantages:**
1. **Preserves optionality:** If Orange County improves, Silver Oak acquires at discount ($30M vs. $84M)
2. **Eliminates uncertainty:** Phase 1 closes regardless of Orange County outcome
3. **Risk-adjusted pricing:** $30M + $6.25M escrow = $36.25M total (57% discount to $84M standalone value) reflects 28% termination probability
4. **Seller incentive:** Seller cooperates during transition period (January-March 2025) to maximize probability of satisfactory survey and Phase 2 closing

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Seller unlikely to accept:** Bifurcated structure with deep discount and survey contingency shifts all risk to seller
2. **Complex mechanics:** Escrow administration, survey result evaluation criteria, CDPH approval timing uncertainty
3. **Delayed value realization:** Silver Oak cannot operate Orange County until May-August 2025 (4-6 month delay)

**STRUCTURE C (NOT RECOMMENDED): INCLUDE ORANGE COUNTY AT FULL PRICE WITH MINIMAL ADJUSTMENT**

Including Orange County at $425M purchase price (or with only $10M-$15M adjustment) is **NOT RECOMMENDED** because:
1. **Expected value analysis shows $46.2M exposure:** Price adjustment should be minimum $46.2M, not $10M-$15M
2. **Binary outcome creates unacceptable risk:** 72% probability of +$159M if succeeds, but 28% probability of -$171M if terminates (high variance inappropriate for portfolio acquisition)
3. **March 2025 survey in 60 days:** Closing March 2025 occurs before critical survey results known; buyer assumes full downside risk with no information advantage
4. **$6.25M improvement investment required immediately:** Cash outflow in first 90 days when facility highest risk

### C. Recommended Next Steps (60-Day Action Plan)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Days 1-14):**

1. **Executive Decision: Orange County In or Out** (Day 1-3)
   - Silver Oak senior management and board decide: Exclude Orange County (Structure A) OR proceed with bifurcated contingent (Structure B)
   - If exclude: Notify seller immediately, revise purchase agreement to remove Orange County, reduce price to $341M
   - If include: Notify seller of bifurcated structure, $30M Phase 2 price with contingency, $6.25M escrow requirement

2. **CMS Form 855A Filing** (Day 1-14)
   - Prepare and file Form 855A with SNF Attachment for all facilities being acquired
   - If Orange County excluded: File 11 facilities only (January 5, 2025)
   - If bifurcated: File 11 facilities Phase 1 (January 5), hold Orange County application until March 2025 survey results (late March/early April filing if survey passes)

### D. Final Recommendation

**Silver Oak should EXCLUDE Orange County Care Center from the acquisition, close on 11 facilities at $341M purchase price, and invest $12M over 3 years in quality improvement programs that generate +$7.2M ROI.** This structure:

1. **Eliminates unacceptable risk:** $46.2M SFF termination exposure eliminated (28% probability × $165M loss)
2. **Converts regulatory compliance from cost to ROI:** -$40M net cost (12 facilities with Orange County) becomes +$7M net benefit (11 facilities without Orange County)
3. **Accelerates transaction certainty:** No dependency on March 2025 survey, California CHOW approval, or SFF improvement plan success
4. **Improves portfolio quality:** 3.1 stars average (11 facilities) vs. 2.8 stars (12 facilities with Orange County)
5. **Delivers strong returns:** Silver Sage 4-star flagship + 7 solid 3-star facilities + 2 fixable 2-star facilities (Desert Sun, Henderson) with clear improvement pathway and positive ROI

**Orange County is a different business:** High-risk turnaround requiring specialized SFF remediation expertise, $6.25M investment, 28% probability of catastrophic failure. Should be evaluated as separate acquisition opportunity (if at all) rather than bundled with 11 performing/improvable facilities.
