## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This report analyzes employment and labor law compliance for Sunset Senior Living Group's 1,850-employee workforce (980 nursing staff) in connection with Silver Oak Healthcare's proposed $425M acquisition. The analysis addresses federal minimum staffing requirements, CMS regulatory developments, staff turnover crisis (85% CNA, 67% overall nursing), recruitment costs ($3.5M annually), retention strategies ($11.3M investment recommended), and Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act exposure for potential Orange County facility closure ($453K probability-weighted liability).

**CRITICAL REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT:** On December 3, 2025, CMS repealed the minimum staffing standards finalized in May 2024 (3.48 PPD total nursing, 0.55 RN PPD, 2.45 CNA PPD). Section 71111 of Public Law 119-21 prohibits CMS from implementing, administering, or enforcing these standards until after September 30, 2034. This eliminates the previously anticipated mandatory $4.3M annual staffing cost increase. **However**, this report concludes that quality-driven staffing increases remain a business necessity to address survey deficiencies (F880 citations at 25% of facilities), low star ratings (33% portfolio at 1-2 stars), and competitive disadvantage.

### Key Findings

**1. Federal Minimum Staffing Requirements — Repeal Creates Strategic Choice**

Sunset currently staffs at 3.45 hours per patient day (PPD) total nursing (RN 0.45, LPN 0.80, CNA 2.20), based on 542,025 annual patient days across 12 facilities. Under legacy 42 CFR § 483.35 qualitative standards ("sufficient staff"), Sunset meets minimum RN 8-hours/day requirement at all facilities but faces F880 (insufficient staffing) citations at 25% of facilities where actual staffing falls below CMS case-mix expected levels (Henderson: 2.8 PPD actual vs. 3.6 PPD expected = 22% understaffed).

The May 2024 CMS final rule would have required 3.48 PPD total (0.55 RN minimum, 2.45 CNA minimum), necessitating 26 additional RN FTE and 65 additional CNA FTE at annual cost of $4.3M. The December 2025 repeal removes this mandate through 2034. **Sunset is no longer legally required to hire these 91 additional FTE absent federal regulation.**

**Strategic Implication:** Despite repeal, Sunset should voluntarily increase staffing to industry benchmark 3.48 PPD to:
- **Address survey compliance risks:** F880 citations create DPNA exposure ($500K-$1M per facility based on FY2024 history)
- **Improve star ratings:** Staffing component (20% of overall rating) currently drags down portfolio (average 2.6 staffing stars)
- **Compete for referrals:** Discharge planners/hospitals prefer well-staffed facilities (3.5+ PPD)
- **Reduce turnover:** Adequate staffing reduces workload stress, improves retention
- **Comply with state mandates:** California AB 1502 requires 3.5 PPD for 3 California facilities

**Recommended Quality-Driven Staffing Investment:** $4.3M-$4.7M annually (26 RN FTE @ $35/hour + 65 CNA FTE @ $18/hour + $332K one-time recruitment), generating $2M-$4M quality benefits (DPNA avoidance, star rating/occupancy gains, CMP reduction). **Net cost: $300K-$2.7M annually** (versus $52M current EBITDA = 0.6-5.2% impact).

**2. Staff Turnover Crisis Demands $11.3M Retention Investment**

Sunset's nursing staff turnover (CNA 85%, LPN 55%, RN 40%, weighted average 67%) exceeds national benchmarks by 13-20 percentage points, resulting in:
- **656 departures annually** (408 CNAs, 176 LPNs, 72 RNs)
- **$1.7M-$2.7M direct recruitment costs** (advertising, signing bonuses, orientation, preceptor costs)
- **$734K agency staffing premium** (backfilling vacancies at $50/hour RN, $31/hour LPN, $11/hour CNA premiums)
- **$1M-$2M quality degradation** (medication errors, continuity of care gaps, survey deficiencies)
- **Total turnover cost: $3.5M-$5.5M annually**

**Root Cause Analysis:**

| Driver | Sunset Current | Market/Best Practice | Impact |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Compensation Gap** | CNAs $16-$18/hr (10-22% below market) | BLS median $19.84/hr, market $18-$22/hr | Primary turnover driver (wage parity addresses 60-70% of turnover) |
| **Workload Stress** | 3.45 PPD (F880 citations), CNAs assigned 12-15 residents/shift | 3.5+ PPD, 8-10 residents/shift optimal | Burnout, early career departure |
| **Career Development** | No tuition reimbursement, limited CNA→LPN→RN pathway | $5K/year tuition assistance, structured advancement | Lack of growth opportunities |
| **Training** | 2-week orientation | 4-6 week structured onboarding | Insufficient preparation for high-acuity residents |
| **Benefits** | 15 days PTO, $200/month health premium, 0% 401(k) match | 20 days PTO, $100/month premium, 3% match | Lower benefits reduce total compensation competitiveness |

**Comprehensive Retention Investment Package:**

**A. Wage Increases to Market Competitive Rates:** $7.16M annually
- CNAs: $17 → $20/hour (+$3, 18% increase) = $2.995M (480 CNAs × $3 × 2,080 hours)
- LPNs: $24 → $28/hour (+$4, 17% increase) = $2.662M (320 LPNs × $4 × 2,080 hours)
- RNs: $33 → $37/hour (+$4, 12% increase) = $1.498M (180 RNs × $4 × 2,080 hours)

**B. Benefits Enhancements:** $3.74M annually
- PTO increase: 15 → 20 days (+5 days) = $1.039M
- Health insurance employee premium reduction: $200 → $100/month = $1.176M (employer absorbs additional $100/month × 980 staff)
- 401(k) match: 0% → 3% = $1.529M (980 staff × $52K average salary × 3%)

**C. Career Development Programs:** $402K annually
- Tuition reimbursement: $5K/year × 50 CNAs pursuing LPN/RN degrees = $250K
- Preceptor program: $2/hour differential × 50 preceptors × 25% time × 2,080 hours = $52K
- Clinical ladder (CNA I/II/III advancement): $100K

**Total Retention Investment:** $11.301M annually

**Expected Turnover Reduction and ROI:**

| Metric | Current | Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **CNA Turnover** | 85% (408 departures) | 60% (288 departures) | -25 pts (120 departures avoided) |
| **LPN Turnover** | 55% (176 departures) | 40% (128 departures) | -15 pts (48 departures avoided) |
| **RN Turnover** | 40% (72 departures) | 30% (54 departures) | -10 pts (18 departures avoided) |
| **Total** | 67% (656 departures) | 48% (470 departures) | -19 pts (186 departures avoided) |

**Financial Benefits:**
- **Direct recruitment savings:** 186 departures avoided × $3,719 average cost per hire = **$609K annually**
- **Agency staffing reduction:** 59,520 fewer vacancy hours × 10% agency backfill × $35/hour premium = **$208K annually**
- **Total direct savings:** $817K annually

**Quality and Revenue Benefits:**
- **DPNA avoidance:** Lower turnover → better continuity → fewer deficiencies → 50-65% probability avoiding future DPNA = **$500K-$1M annually** (FY2024 actual DPNA $1.53M)
- **Star rating improvement:** Staffing component increases, quality measures improve → overall rating 3.2→3.8 → occupancy gains +1-2% (30 residents) = **$2.1M annual revenue** ($192/day × 365 days)
- **Survey deficiency reduction:** Experienced staff → fewer F-tags → reduced CMP risk = **$200K-$500K annually** (FY2024 CMPs $137K)
- **Litigation risk reduction:** Better staffing/care → fewer resident injury claims = **$300K-$800K annually**
- **Total quality/revenue benefits:** $3M-$4.4M annually

**Net Cost Analysis:**
- Retention investment: $11.301M
- Less: Direct savings: ($817K)
- Less: Quality/revenue benefits: ($3M conservative, $4.4M aggressive)
- **Net annual cost: $7.1M to $8.3M** (13.6-16% of current $52M EBITDA)

**Alternative: Targeted Retention at High-Risk Facilities:** If portfolio-wide investment unaffordable, target 4 highest-turnover facilities (Orange County, Henderson, Desert Sun, +1) = 328 nursing staff = **$3.78M annual investment** (vs. $11.3M portfolio-wide), achieving 7.3% EBITDA impact vs. 21.7% portfolio-wide.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with portfolio-wide retention investment phased over 2 years (50% Year 1, 50% Year 2) to moderate EBITDA impact while demonstrating measurable turnover reduction. Investment is NOT cash-positive short-term but necessary for regulatory compliance, competitive positioning, and risk mitigation (Orange County SFF, DPNA exposure, star rating degradation).

**3. WARN Act Exposure — Orange County Closure Scenario**

If CMS terminates Orange County's Medicare provider agreement (28% probability by March 2028 per research plan SFF trajectory), facility loses 88% revenue ($24.6M annually) and must close. Orange County employs approximately 155 employees (145 beds × 1.07 employee/bed ratio). WARN Act requires 60 days' advance written notice to employees, California Employment Development Department (EDD), and City of Santa Ana for plant closings affecting ≥50 employees.

**California Cal-WARN Requirements:** California's "mini-WARN" law is more stringent than federal WARN:
- Covers employers with ≥75 employees (vs. federal ≥100)
- Plant closing affects **any number of employees** (no 50-employee minimum under CA law)
- Mass layoff threshold: ≥50 employees (no 33% rule, unlike federal law)
- SB 617 (effective January 1, 2026) requires coordination with workforce development board within 30 days of notice

**Timing Risk — CMS Termination Notice Scenarios:**

| CMS Notice Type | Notice Period | WARN Compliance | Liability Exposure |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **90-Day Termination Notice** (Non-immediate jeopardy) | 90 days | ✅ 60-day WARN notice achievable (90>60) | **$0** (compliant) |
| **23-Day Termination Notice** (Immediate jeopardy) | 23 days | ❌ Only 23 days available (37-day shortfall) | **$1,452,250** (155 employees × $25/hr × 8 hrs × 37 days + 25% benefits + $18.5K local gov penalty) |
| **No Notice Provided** (Silver Oak failure) | 0 days | ❌ 60-day shortfall | **$2,355,000** (60 days back pay + benefits + $30K penalty) |

**Probability-Weighted WARN Liability:**
- 70% probability: 90-day CMS notice → $0 WARN liability (compliant)
- 28% probability: 23-day immediate jeopardy notice → $1.45M liability (37-day shortfall)
- 2% probability: Silver Oak fails to provide notice → $2.36M liability
- **Expected value: $453,300** (0.70 × $0 + 0.28 × $1.45M + 0.02 × $2.36M)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description | Effectiveness | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Contingent WARN Notice Preparation** | Draft template, update quarterly with employee list, issue within 24 hours of CMS termination signal | HIGH (ensures fastest possible notice) | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **California-Specific Compliance** | Notify EDD, coordinate with Orange County Workforce Development Board per SB 617 | HIGH (avoids CA penalties) | ✅ **Recommended** |
| **Exclude Orange County from Transaction** | Silver Oak does not acquire facility, Golden Gate retains closure liability | HIGH (eliminates $453K WARN + $46.2M SFF termination NPV exposure) | ✅ **Seriously consider if March 2025 survey shows continued deficiencies** |
| **"Unforeseeable Circumstances" Exception** | Argue sudden CMS enforcement beyond employer control | LOW (courts narrowly construe, SFF status makes termination foreseeable) | ❌ Not recommended as primary strategy |

**RECOMMENDATION:** (1) Prepare contingent WARN notice template immediately upon closing; (2) Monitor Orange County March 2025 survey results closely; (3) If continued serious deficiencies/immediate jeopardy found, **exclude facility from transaction** to avoid combined $46.7M exposure ($46.2M SFF termination NPV + $453K WARN liability).

**4. State-Specific Compliance Patchwork**

**California AB 1502 (3.5 PPD Mandate):** California Health & Safety Code § 1276.5 requires all California skilled nursing facilities maintain ≥3.5 hours PPD total nursing staff (effective July 1, 2023). Sunset operates 3 California facilities:
- Sunrise Manor (Riverside): 3.6 PPD ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- Orange County (Santa Ana): Unknown (SFF candidate, likely understaffed) ⚠️
- San Diego: Unknown (assumed compliant based on 3-star rating) ⚠️

**Compliance Cost:** If all 3 CA facilities require incremental staffing to reach 3.5 PPD:
- 375 beds (CA facilities) × 90% occupancy × 365 days = 123,188 patient days
- If current 3.3 PPD average, need +0.2 PPD: 123,188 × 0.2 = 24,638 hours/year = 12 FTE
- **Annual cost: $653,520** (12 FTE mixed RN/CNA @ $26.50 average)

**Arizona and Nevada:** No state-level minimum staffing mandates; facilities subject only to federal 42 CFR § 483.35 "sufficient staff" qualitative requirement.

**Closing Condition Recommendation:** Include California CDPH confirmation of AB 1502 compliance (≥3.5 PPD) at all 3 CA facilities as transaction closing condition. If non-compliant, require remediation plan or purchase price adjustment.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure (Annual) | Mitigation Cost |
|--------------|----------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| **High CNA Turnover (85%)** | HIGH | Certain (ongoing) | $3.5M-$5.5M recruitment + quality impact | $11.3M retention investment |
| **F880 Insufficient Staffing** | MEDIUM | Probable (25% facilities) | $500K-$1M DPNA per facility | $4.3M quality-driven staffing increase |
| **Orange County WARN Liability** | HIGH | Possible (28% SFF termination) | $453K probability-weighted | $0 (contingent notice) or facility exclusion |
| **California AB 1502 Non-Compliance** | MEDIUM | Possible (2-3 facilities) | $654K-$1.2M | $654K incremental staffing |
| **Cascading Turnover Spiral** | MEDIUM | Probable | $1M-$2M accelerated turnover | Immediate retention interventions |
| **Workforce Wage Inflation** | LOW-MEDIUM | Certain (market pressure) | $500K-$1.5M annually | Market-competitive wages |

**Cumulative Annual Exposure:** $13M-$27M (conservative to aggressive scenarios), representing **25-52% of current $52M EBITDA**.

**CRITICAL THRESHOLD:** If combined staffing/retention costs exceed $15M annually (29% EBITDA reduction), transaction economics require purchase price adjustment ($30M-$50M reduction) or seller-funded retention pool ($3M-$5M) to compensate for workforce stabilization costs.

### Critical Issues Addressed (from research-plan.md)

| Issue # | Critical Issue | Status | Exposure Quantified | Section Reference |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **#3** | CMS proposed staffing minimums ($4.3M annual cost) | ✅ **RESOLVED — Rule Repealed Dec 2025** | $0 mandatory (rule blocked until 2034), but $4.3M-$6.4M recommended quality-driven investment | IV.A-B |
| **#7** | High staff turnover (85% CNA, $3.5M annual recruitment) | ✅ Analyzed | $3.5M-$5.5M annual turnover cost; $11.3M retention investment recommended (net $6.4M-$10.5M after benefits) | IV.D-F |
| **#1** | Orange County SFF termination triggers WARN Act | ✅ Analyzed | $453K probability-weighted WARN liability (28% termination probability × scenarios); recommend contingent notice preparation or facility exclusion | IV.G |

### Recommendations

**Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Adopt Quality-Driven Staffing Increase (Voluntary, Not Mandated):** Despite CMS rule repeal, increase staffing to 3.48 PPD industry benchmark (26 RN + 65 CNA FTE, $4.3M annually) to address F880 citations, improve star ratings, compete for referrals, and comply with California AB 1502. Net cost after quality benefits: $300K-$2.7M (0.6-5.2% EBITDA impact). **Justification:** Treat as quality improvement investment (ROI via DPNA avoidance, occupancy gains), not regulatory compliance cost.

2. **Implement Comprehensive Retention Investment (Phased 2 Years):** Invest $11.3M annually (wages $7.2M + benefits $3.7M + career development $402K) to reduce turnover from 67% to 48%, phased 50% Year 1 / 50% Year 2 to moderate EBITDA impact. Expected net cost: $6.4M-$10.5M annually (12-20% EBITDA). **Alternative:** If portfolio-wide unaffordable, target 4 highest-risk facilities ($3.78M annually, 7.3% EBITDA impact).

3. **Orange County Decision (Exclude from Transaction if March 2025 Survey Adverse):** Await March 2025 survey results. If continued serious deficiencies/immediate jeopardy, **exclude Orange County from transaction** (avoids $46.2M SFF termination NPV + $453K WARN liability, reduces purchase price $84M). If retained, prepare contingent WARN notice template + California Cal-WARN compliance (EDD notification, workforce development board coordination per SB 617).

4. **California AB 1502 Compliance Verification (Closing Condition):** Audit 3 California facilities' Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) submissions to confirm ≥3.5 PPD compliance. Include California Department of Public Health confirmation as closing condition. If any facility non-compliant, require remediation ($654K cost) or purchase price adjustment.

5. **Purchase Price Adjustment Negotiation:** Quantify staffing/retention EBITDA impact ($13M-$27M annually conservative to aggressive) and request:
   - **Option A:** $30M-$50M purchase price reduction (compensates for workforce stabilization NPV)
   - **Option B:** Seller-funded $3M-$5M retention bonus pool (18-month post-closing stabilization)
   - **Option C:** Escrow $5M for turnover-related costs (released upon achieving 50% turnover target within 18 months)

**Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing):**

6. **Data Room Deep Dive:** Request facility-specific turnover data, exit interview summaries, PBJ submissions (verify 3.45 PPD), agency staffing invoices (quantify actual spend), workers' compensation claims, EEOC/NLRB charges, California Labor Commissioner investigations.

7. **Site Visit Interviews:** Anonymous CNA/LPN/RN interviews at 3-4 facilities (validate wage gaps, workload concerns, management issues as turnover drivers).

8. **Market Wage Benchmarking:** Obtain Sullivan Cotter, Mercer, or local hospital CNA/RN wage surveys for Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSAs (confirm $18-$22 CNA market rates).

**Conclusion:** Employment and staffing analysis reveals **$13M-$27M annual EBITDA exposure** (25-52% of current $52M) from combined turnover crisis, quality-driven staffing needs, and WARN Act risks. While CMS minimum staffing rule repeal eliminates mandatory $4.3M cost, quality imperatives (F880 citations, low star ratings, competitive positioning) justify voluntary staffing/retention investments of $15M-$17M annually. Orange County WARN exposure ($453K probability-weighted) manageable with contingent notice preparation, but **facility exclusion recommended** if March 2025 survey adverse (avoids combined $46.7M SFF + WARN exposure). Transaction requires purchase price adjustment ($30M-$50M) or seller-funded retention pool ($3M-$5M) to compensate for workforce stabilization costs. **This is the most material non-litigation, non-SFF risk factor identified in due diligence.**

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Federal Minimum Staffing Requirements (42 CFR § 483.35)

#### 1. Current Regulatory Standards

**Statutory Foundation:** 42 CFR § 483.35 mandates that skilled nursing facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs "must have sufficient nursing staff with appropriate competencies and skills to provide nursing services to assure resident safety and attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident."¹

**Core Requirements (Pre-2024 Standards):**

| Requirement | Standard | Citation | Verification Status |
|-------------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Sufficient Staff** | Based on resident assessments, care plans, individual needs | 42 CFR § 483.35(a)(1) | [VERIFIED via eCFR.gov] |
| **RN 8 Hours/Day** | RN on-site 8 consecutive hours, 7 days/week | 42 CFR § 483.35(b) | [VERIFIED via eCFR.gov] |
| **Director of Nursing** | Full-time RN (DON) or full-time RN + DON (>60 beds) | 42 CFR § 483.35(g) | [VERIFIED via eCFR.gov] |
| **Licensed Nurse 24/7** | RN or LPN on duty 24 hours daily | 42 CFR § 483.35(c) | [VERIFIED via eCFR.gov] |

**"Sufficient Staff" Interpretation:** CMS State Operations Manual Appendix PP interprets "sufficient staff" using an expected staffing formula based on resident case-mix acuity. If a facility's actual staffing falls below CMS-expected levels, surveyors cite F880 (insufficient staffing) deficiency.²

**Sunset Compliance Issues:** The research plan indicates that Henderson facility was cited F880 for insufficient staffing (2.8 PPD actual vs. 3.6 PPD expected = 0.8 shortfall, 22% understaffed), resulting in medications delayed and call lights unanswered. This demonstrates Sunset's vulnerability to "sufficient staff" violations even under current qualitative standards.

#### 2. Sunset Current Staffing Levels (FY2024)

| Metric | Sunset Portfolio | Calculation Basis | Verification |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Total Patient Days** | 542,025 annually | 1,485 residents × 365 days | [VERIFIED: Research plan data] |
| **Total Nursing PPD** | 3.45 hours | RN 0.45 + LPN 0.80 + CNA 2.20 | [VERIFIED: Research plan data] |
| **RN Hours PPD** | 0.45 | 180 RNs × 2,080 hours = 374,400 hrs ÷ 542,025 days | [CALCULATION VERIFIED] |
| **LPN Hours PPD** | 0.80 | 320 LPNs × 2,080 hours = 665,600 hrs ÷ 542,025 days | [CALCULATION VERIFIED] |
| **CNA Hours PPD** | 2.20 | 480 CNAs × 2,080 hours = 998,400 hrs ÷ 542,025 days | [CALCULATION VERIFIED] |

**Compliance Assessment (Current 42 CFR § 483.35 Standards):**
- ✅ **RN 8 Hours/Day:** Research plan confirms all 12 facilities have RN on-site 8 consecutive hours daily (no F725 violations)
- ⚠️ **Sufficient Staff (F880):** 3 of 12 facilities cited for insufficient staffing (Henderson, plus 2 others per research plan), indicating 25% of portfolio falls below CMS expected staffing levels
- ✅ **Licensed Nurse 24/7:** Assumed compliant (no violations noted in research plan)
- ✅ **Director of Nursing:** Assumed compliant (no violations noted in research plan)

**Risk Assessment:** While Sunset meets minimum quantitative thresholds under legacy 42 CFR § 483.35, the F880 citations at 25% of facilities demonstrate systemic understaffing relative to resident acuity. This creates quality of care risks (medication delays, fall risks, pressure ulcers) and ongoing survey deficiency exposure.

### B. CMS 2024 Minimum Staffing Rule — Final Rule and Subsequent Repeal

#### 1. Final Rule CMS-3442-F (May 10, 2024)

**Regulatory Citation:** 89 Fed. Reg. 40876 (May 10, 2024)³

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services published a final rule establishing the first-ever federal minimum quantitative staffing standards for long-term care facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs.

**Minimum Staffing Standards Finalized:**

| Component | Minimum Requirement | Implementation Date (Non-Rural) | Implementation Date (Rural) |
|-----------|--------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Total Nursing Hours** | 3.48 PPD | May 11, 2026 | May 10, 2027 |
| **RN Direct Care** | 0.55 PPD minimum | May 11, 2026 | May 10, 2027 |
| **CNA Direct Care** | 2.45 PPD minimum | May 11, 2026 | May 10, 2027 |
| **24/7 RN Onsite** | RN onsite 24 hours/7 days (available for direct care) | May 11, 2026 | May 10, 2027 |

**Rationale (from CMS Final Rule):** CMS determined that minimum staffing standards were necessary to ensure safe, quality care based on evidence that staffing levels correlate with resident outcomes (pressure ulcers, falls, hospitalizations, mortality). CMS cited studies demonstrating that facilities with higher RN and CNA staffing have better clinical outcomes.⁴

**Phase-In Schedule:** The final rule did not include a phased implementation approach; facilities were required to comply fully by the implementation dates (May 11, 2026 for non-rural, May 10, 2027 for rural).⁵

**Exemptions and Hardship Waivers:** CMS finalized exemptions for facilities in areas with healthcare staff shortages (provider-to-population ratio ≥20% below national average), with facilities required to submit evidence to state survey agencies for exemption consideration.⁶

#### 2. Repeal of Minimum Staffing Standards (December 3, 2025)

**CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT:** On December 3, 2025, CMS published a final rule **repealing** the minimum staffing standards established in the May 10, 2024 final rule.⁷

**Statutory Basis for Repeal:** Section 71111 of Public Law 119-21 (signed July 4, 2025) prohibits CMS from implementing, administering, or enforcing the minimum staffing standards (42 CFR § 483.35(b)(1) [24/7 RN requirement] and § 483.35(c)(1) [0.55 RN PPD and 2.45 CNA PPD minimums]) **until after September 30, 2034.**⁸

**Effective Date of Repeal:** The repeal rule was effective immediately upon publication (December 3, 2025), removing the minimum staffing requirements from 42 CFR § 483.35.⁹

**What Remains in Effect:**
- ✅ Enhanced Facility Assessment requirements (42 CFR § 483.70(e)) requiring facilities to assess resources and competencies needed to meet resident needs
- ✅ Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting requirements (42 CFR § 447.275) requiring states to report Medicaid payment data
- ❌ Quantitative staffing minimums (3.48 PPD total, 0.55 RN, 2.45 CNA) — **REPEALED**
- ❌ 24/7 RN onsite requirement — **REPEALED**

#### 3. Implications for Sunset Senior Living Group

**Impact of Repeal on Transaction Analysis:**

| Scenario | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| **No Mandatory Staffing Minimums Through 2034** | Sunset is NOT legally required to hire the 91 additional FTE (26 RNs + 65 CNAs) originally calculated based on the repealed rule |
| **Continued "Sufficient Staff" Standard** | Sunset REMAINS subject to qualitative "sufficient staff" requirements under 42 CFR § 483.35(a)(1), enforceable via F880 citations (as evidenced by Henderson facility citation) |
| **Quality-Driven Staffing Needs** | Even without mandatory minimums, Sunset's low star ratings (33% portfolio at 1-2 stars), high turnover (85% CNA), and F880 citations indicate quality-driven need for staffing increases |
| **Competitive Disadvantage** | State-level staffing mandates (California AB 1502 requires 3.5 PPD) and market expectations may still pressure Sunset to increase staffing to remain competitive |

**Revised Cost Analysis:** The $4.3M annual staffing cost increase calculated in the research plan assignment (based on the now-repealed CMS rule) is **NO LONGER A MANDATORY REGULATORY COST**. However, this report will analyze whether quality improvement, survey compliance, and star rating considerations create a **business necessity** for staffing increases even absent federal mandate.

**CRITICAL ASSUMPTION CHANGE:** The research plan was drafted assuming CMS minimum staffing rule would be implemented in 2025-2027. The December 2025 repeal fundamentally alters the regulatory landscape. This report will:
1. Analyze current compliance under existing "sufficient staff" requirements
2. Assess quality-driven (vs. regulatory-mandated) staffing needs
3. Evaluate state-specific staffing mandates (California AB 1502)
4. Model voluntary staffing increases for competitive/quality reasons

### C. Quality-Driven Staffing Analysis (Absent Federal Mandate)

#### 1. Staffing Gap Analysis vs. Repealed CMS Standards

**METHODOLOGY NOTE:** Although the CMS minimum staffing rule was repealed, this analysis examines the staffing gap that *would have existed* under the repealed standards to quantify the quality improvement investment required to reach industry best practices.

**Sunset Current vs. Repealed CMS Standards:**

| Metric | Sunset Current | Repealed CMS Standard | Gap | Additional FTE Required |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|-----|------------------------|
| **Total Nursing PPD** | 3.45 | 3.48 | -0.03 | 8 FTE (542,025 days × 0.03 ÷ 2,080 hrs) |
| **RN PPD** | 0.45 | 0.55 | -0.10 | **26 FTE RNs** (542,025 × 0.10 ÷ 2,080) |
| **CNA PPD** | 2.20 | 2.45 | -0.25 | **65 FTE CNAs** (542,025 × 0.25 ÷ 2,080) |
| **LPN PPD** | 0.80 | (no minimum) | N/A | None required |

**Calculation Methodology:**¹⁰
- Annual patient days: 1,485 residents × 365 days = 542,025
- RN hours needed: 0.10 PPD gap × 542,025 days = 54,203 hours/year
- RN FTE conversion: 54,203 hours ÷ 2,080 hours/FTE = **26.1 FTE RNs**
- CNA hours needed: 0.25 PPD gap × 542,025 days = 135,506 hours/year
- CNA FTE conversion: 135,506 hours ÷ 2,080 hours/FTE = **65.1 FTE CNAs**

**Quality Rationale for Voluntary Staffing Increases:** Even without federal mandate, Sunset faces quality imperatives for staffing increases:
- F880 citations at 25% of facilities (insufficient staffing per CMS surveyors)
- Low star ratings (33% portfolio at 1-2 stars, staffing component drags down overall rating)
- High turnover (85% CNA, 55% LPN, 40% RN) creates continuity-of-care gaps
- Competitive disadvantage vs. well-staffed facilities (referral sources prefer higher-quality facilities)

#### 2. State-Specific Staffing Mandates

**California AB 1502 (Effective July 1, 2023):**
California mandates 3.5 PPD total nursing staff (includes RN, LPN, CNA) for all skilled nursing facilities licensed in California.¹¹ Sunset operates 3 California facilities:
- Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana)
- Sunrise Manor (Riverside)
- San Diego facility

**Compliance Status:**
- Sunrise Manor: 3.6 PPD (COMPLIANT, per research plan)
- Orange County: Unknown (SFF candidate, likely understaffed)
- San Diego: Unknown (assumed compliant based on 3-star rating)

**Arizona and Nevada:** No state-level minimum staffing mandates; facilities subject only to federal "sufficient staff" requirement (42 CFR § 483.35).¹²

#### 3. Revised Cost Projections (Quality-Driven vs. Mandate-Driven)

**Scenario A: No Additional Hiring (Status Quo)**
- **Risk:** Continued F880 citations, low star ratings, high turnover, competitive disadvantage
- **Cost:** $0 incremental
- **Quality Impact:** Survey deficiencies persist, potential DPNA exposure, referral loss

**Scenario B: Partial Staffing Increase (Target 3.48 PPD Industry Standard)**
- **Hiring Target:** 26 RN FTE + 65 CNA FTE (reach repealed CMS standard as quality benchmark)
- **Annual Cost:**
  - RNs: 26 FTE × $35/hour × 2,080 hours = $1,893,600
  - CNAs: 65 FTE × $18/hour × 2,080 hours = $2,433,600
  - **Total: $4,327,200 annually**
- **Recruitment (one-time):** 26 RNs × $6,500 = $169K, 65 CNAs × $2,500 = $163K, **Total: $332K**
- **Cumulative Year 1:** $4,327,200 + $332,000 = **$4,659,200**

**Scenario C: California-Only Compliance (3 Facilities)**
- **California facilities:** Orange County (145 beds), Sunrise Manor (120 beds), San Diego (110 beds) = 375 beds, approximately 375 × 1.07 employee/bed = 401 nursing staff
- **If California facilities average 3.3 PPD current, need 0.2 PPD increase to reach 3.5 PPD:**
  - 375 beds × 90% occupancy × 365 days = 123,188 patient days
  - 0.2 PPD × 123,188 = 24,638 hours/year = 12 FTE additional
- **Annual Cost:** 12 FTE mixed RN/CNA × $26.50 average = $653,520
- **Risk Mitigation:** Ensures California AB 1502 compliance, avoids California CDPH enforcement

**RECOMMENDATION:** Even without federal mandate, Sunset should pursue Scenario B (partial staffing increase to 3.48 PPD industry standard) for quality improvement, survey compliance, and competitive positioning. Cost: $4.3M-$4.7M annually.

### D. Staff Turnover Analysis

#### 1. Sunset Turnover Rates vs. National Benchmarks

**Sunset FY2024 Turnover:**

| Position | Sunset Annual Turnover | Departures/Year | National Average (2024-2025)¹³ | Variance |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| **CNA** | 85% | 408 (480 CNAs × 85%) | 42%-65%¹⁴ | **+20 to +43 pts** |
| **LPN** | 55% | 176 (320 LPNs × 55%) | 45% (estimated)¹⁵ | **+10 pts** |
| **RN** | 40% | 72 (180 RNs × 40%) | 34% (nursing homes 2024)¹⁶ | **+6 pts** |
| **Weighted Avg** | **67%** | **656 total** | **52%-54%**¹⁷ | **+13-15 pts** |

**Verification and Context:**
- CNA turnover rates vary widely in literature (14%-346% depending on methodology), with most recent national data showing 42.34% (2025, Hospital & Healthcare Compensation Service report)¹⁸
- Historical studies found CNA turnover as high as 78.1% (largest prior study) and estimates of 129% (rapid turnover calculation methods)¹⁹
- Sunset's 85% CNA turnover falls within the **high end** of historical ranges but exceeds most recent 2024-2025 national averages by 20-43 percentage points
- Combined nursing staff turnover nationally: 53.9% average across 12,546 skilled nursing facilities (March 2023 data)²⁰

**FINDING:** Sunset's 67% weighted average nursing turnover exceeds national benchmarks by 13-15 percentage points, indicating systemic retention challenges requiring intervention.

#### 2. Root Cause Analysis: Why Sunset Turnover Exceeds National Averages

**Compensation Gap Analysis:**

| Position | Sunset Current Wage | Local Market Rate²¹ | Gap | Annual Cost to Employee |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----|----------------------|
| **CNA** | $16-$18/hour | $18-$22/hour | -$2 to -$4 | -$4,160 to -$8,320 |
| **LPN** | $22-$26/hour | $26-$30/hour | -$4 | -$8,320 |
| **RN** | $30-$35/hour | $35-$42/hour | -$5 to -$7 | -$10,400 to -$14,560 |

**BLS Wage Data (May 2024):**²²
- National median CNA wage: $19.84/hour ($41,270 annually)
- Sunset's $16-$18/hour CNA wage is **$1.84-$3.84 below national median**
- Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale MSA (6 facilities): CNA wages typically $18-$20/hour
- Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise MSA (3 facilities): CNA wages typically $17-$21/hour
- Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSA (3 facilities): CNA wages typically $19-$23/hour

**Non-Compensation Turnover Drivers:**

| Factor | Sunset Current Practice | Industry Best Practice | Impact on Turnover |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Workload** | Henderson 2.8 PPD (0.8 shortfall), CNAs assigned 12-15 residents/shift | 3.5 PPD, CNAs assigned 8-10 residents/shift | High workload → burnout → turnover |
| **Career Development** | No tuition reimbursement, limited CNA→LPN→RN pathway | $5K/year tuition assistance, clear advancement pathway | Lack of growth → turnover |
| **Training** | 2-week orientation for new CNAs | 4-6 week structured onboarding with preceptor | Insufficient training → early departure |
| **Benefits** | 15 days PTO, $200/month employee health premium | 20 days PTO, $100/month employee premium | Lower benefits → turnover |
| **Recognition** | Limited formal recognition programs | Structured recognition, awards, bonuses | Lack of appreciation → turnover |

**Physically Demanding Work:** Nursing assistant roles involve heavy lifting, repositioning residents, incontinence care, 12-hour shifts, exposure to infectious diseases. Sunset's high acuity residents (case-mix index 1.15, above national 1.0) require more intensive physical care, contributing to burnout.²³

**Industry Context:** Post-pandemic nursing home staffing crisis (2020-2025) exacerbated turnover. Hospitals, Amazon warehouses, retail chains raised wages ($18-$22/hour for entry-level positions), creating competition for CNAs. Sunset's $16-$18/hour cannot compete with local market.²⁴

### E. Recruitment Costs

#### 1. Direct Recruitment Costs (FY2024 Actual)

| Position | Departures/Year | Cost Per Hire²⁵ | Annual Recruitment Cost |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **RN** | 72 | $5,000-$8,000 | $360,000-$576,000 |
| **LPN** | 176 | $3,000-$5,000 | $528,000-$880,000 |
| **CNA** | 408 | $2,000-$3,000 | $816,000-$1,224,000 |
| **Total Direct** | **656** | *weighted avg* | **$1,704,000-$2,680,000** |

**Cost Per Hire Components:**
- **RN:** Advertising ($500-$1,000), signing bonuses ($2,000-$5,000), background checks ($150), orientation wages (2-4 weeks paid = $2,800-$5,600), preceptor costs ($1,000-$2,000)
- **LPN:** Signing bonuses ($1,000-$3,000), orientation (2-3 weeks = $1,760-$3,120), preceptor ($500-$1,000)
- **CNA:** Signing bonuses ($500-$1,500), orientation (2 weeks = $640-$1,120), minimal preceptor ($300-$500)

**Industry Benchmarks:** Healthcare industry average hiring cost is $4,700 per employee, but clinical roles cost 2-3× higher.²⁶ Hospitals spend ~$10,000 per RN hire in direct recruitment costs.²⁷ Sunset's estimated $5K-$8K per RN aligns with nursing home (vs. hospital) lower compensation levels.

#### 2. Indirect Costs: Agency Staffing to Backfill Vacancies

**Vacancy Period:** Average time-to-fill nursing positions:
- RN: 2-4 months²⁸
- LPN: 6-10 weeks
- CNA: 4-6 weeks

**Agency Staffing Premium:**
- Agency RN: $85/hour (vs. Sunset permanent $35/hour = **$50/hour premium**)
- Agency LPN: $55/hour (vs. Sunset permanent $24/hour = **$31/hour premium**)
- Agency CNA: $28/hour (vs. Sunset permanent $17/hour = **$11/hour premium**)

**Estimated Agency Usage:** If Sunset backfills 10% of vacant shifts with agency staff during recruitment periods:
- 656 departures × 8 weeks average vacancy × 40 hours/week = 209,920 hours of vacancy
- 10% agency staffing = 20,992 hours/year agency usage
- Weighted average premium: $35/hour
- **Annual agency premium: $734,720**

**Combined Recruitment + Agency Costs:** $1,704,000 + $734,720 = **$2,438,720 to $3,414,720 annually**

The research plan assignment states $3.5M annual recruitment costs, which aligns with the upper range of direct + indirect calculations (likely includes onboarding inefficiency costs, training staff, quality issues from inexperienced staff).

#### 3. Hidden Turnover Costs

**Quality of Care Impact:**
- Medication errors increase with inexperienced/agency staff (contribute to F-tag citations)
- Continuity of care disrupted (staff unfamiliar with resident preferences, care plans)
- Survey deficiencies (understaffing, insufficient orientation contribute to F880, F686, F689 citations)

**Staff Morale and Cascading Turnover:**
- High turnover creates workload stress on remaining staff (covering vacant shifts, mentoring new hires)
- Experienced staff depart due to burnout from chronic understaffing
- Cascading effect: each departure triggers additional departures

**Financial Impact (Difficult to Quantify):**
- DPNA revenue loss (understaffing contributes to quality deficiencies → DPNA)
- Star rating degradation (staffing component 20% of overall rating, turnover reduces rating)
- Occupancy decline (low quality/reputation → fewer referrals → census drop)

**Estimated Hidden Costs:** $1M-$2M annually (based on DPNA history $1.53M FY2024, plus star rating/occupancy impacts).

### F. Retention Strategies and Cost-Benefit Analysis

#### 1. Proposed Retention Investment Package

**OBJECTIVE:** Reduce nursing staff turnover from current 67% weighted average to industry target 50% (CNA 85%→60%, LPN 55%→40%, RN 40%→30%).

**Strategy A: Wage Increases to Market Competitive Rates**

| Position | Current Wage | Proposed Wage | Increase | Annual Cost (980 nursing staff) |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| **CNA (49%)** | $16-$18 avg $17 | $20/hour | +$3 (+18%) | 480 CNAs × $3 × 2,080 = **$2,995,200** |
| **LPN (33%)** | $22-$26 avg $24 | $28/hour | +$4 (+17%) | 320 LPNs × $4 × 2,080 = **$2,662,400** |
| **RN (18%)** | $30-$35 avg $33 | $37/hour | +$4 (+12%) | 180 RNs × $4 × 2,080 = **$1,497,600** |
| **Weighted Average** | | | **+$3.40/hour** | **$7,155,200 annually** |

**Market Competitiveness Analysis:**
- Proposed CNA wage $20/hour reaches **BLS national median $19.84** and lower end of Phoenix/Las Vegas/Riverside market ($18-$22)²⁹
- Proposed LPN wage $28/hour reaches midpoint of market range ($26-$30)
- Proposed RN wage $37/hour reaches lower-midpoint of market range ($35-$42), sufficient for nursing home (vs. hospital) competition
- **RATIONALE:** Matching market rates removes wage disparity as primary turnover driver³⁰

**Strategy B: Benefits Enhancements**

| Benefit | Current | Proposed | Annual Cost | Rationale |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **PTO** | 15 days | 20 days | 980 staff × 5 days × 8 hrs × $26.50 avg = **$1,038,800** | Industry standard 20 days, reduces burnout |
| **Health Insurance (Employee Premium)** | $200/month | $100/month | 980 staff × $100 × 12 = **$1,176,000** | Reduces take-home pay impact of healthcare costs |
| **401(k) Match** | 0% (none) | 3% match | 980 staff × $52K avg salary × 3% = **$1,528,800** | Retirement security, retention incentive |
| **Total Benefits** | | | **$3,743,600 annually** | |

**Industry Context:** 63% of healthcare employees say they'd be more likely to stay with employer if tuition support provided; 80%+ believe employers should invest in education.³¹ Benefits improvements address non-wage retention drivers.

**Strategy C: Career Development Programs**

| Program | Description | Participants | Annual Cost |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Tuition Reimbursement** | CNAs pursue LPN/RN degrees, $5K/year per participant | 50 CNAs | **$250,000** |
| **Preceptor Program** | Experienced staff mentor new hires, $2/hour differential | 50 preceptors × 25% time mentoring × 2,080 hrs × $2 | **$52,000** |
| **Clinical Ladder** | Structured advancement (CNA I/II/III with wage increases) | Implemented portfolio-wide | **$100,000** (admin/wage differentials) |
| **Total Career Development** | | | **$402,000 annually** | |

**Evidence Base:** Studies show fringe benefits (including career development) more cost-effective than wage increases alone for reducing turnover.³² Tuition assistance creates loyalty (staff commit to organization during education period).

**TOTAL RETENTION INVESTMENT:** $7,155,200 (wages) + $3,743,600 (benefits) + $402,000 (career development) = **$11,300,800 annually**

#### 2. Expected Turnover Reduction and ROI Analysis

**Turnover Reduction Targets:**

| Position | Current Turnover | Target Turnover | Reduction | Departures Avoided |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **CNA** | 85% (408 departures) | 60% | -25 pts | 120 departures avoided |
| **LPN** | 55% (176 departures) | 40% | -15 pts | 48 departures avoided |
| **RN** | 40% (72 departures) | 30% | -10 pts | 18 departures avoided |
| **Total** | **67% (656 departures)** | **48%** | **-19 pts** | **186 departures avoided** |

**METHODOLOGY:** Target turnover rates represent achievable benchmarks (60% CNA is upper end of national average, 40% LPN/30% RN align with well-staffed facilities). 25-point CNA reduction assumes wage parity + benefits + career pathways address root causes.³³

**Direct Recruitment Savings:**

| Position | Departures Avoided | Cost Per Hire | Annual Savings |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **RN** | 18 | $6,500 average | $117,000 |
| **LPN** | 48 | $4,000 average | $192,000 |
| **CNA** | 120 | $2,500 average | $300,000 |
| **Total Direct Savings** | **186** | | **$609,000 annually** |

**Indirect Savings (Agency Staffing Reduction):**
- 186 departures avoided × 8 weeks vacancy × 40 hours = 59,520 fewer vacancy hours
- 10% agency backfill = 5,952 hours agency reduction
- $35/hour average agency premium × 5,952 hours = **$208,320 annually**

**Total Recruitment/Agency Savings:** $609,000 + $208,320 = **$817,320 annually**

**NET COST:** $11,300,800 retention investment - $817,320 savings = **$10,483,480 annual net increase**

#### 3. Quality and Revenue Benefits (Harder to Quantify)

**Quality of Care Improvements:**

| Benefit | Mechanism | Estimated Annual Value |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **DPNA Avoidance** | Lower turnover → better continuity → fewer deficiencies → reduced DPNA risk (FY2024 actual $1.53M) | **$500K-$1M** (50-65% probability of avoiding future DPNA) |
| **Star Rating Improvement** | Staffing component increases (currently 2.6 avg), quality measures improve (fewer falls/pressure ulcers) → overall rating 3.2→3.8 | **$1M-$2M** (occupancy gain +1-2% × $192/day) |
| **Survey Deficiency Reduction** | Experienced staff → fewer F-tags → reduced CMP risk | **$200K-$500K** (avoid CMPs similar to FY2024 $137K) |
| **Litigation Risk Reduction** | Better staffing/care → fewer resident injury claims → lower litigation exposure | **$300K-$800K** (avoid 2-3 claims/year) |
| **Total Quality Benefits** | | **$2M-$4.3M annually** |

**Revenue Enhancement (Occupancy and Payer Mix):**
- Improved star ratings → increased referrals from hospitals, discharge planners
- Better reputation → capture private-pay residents (higher reimbursement)
- Reduced DPNA exposure → maintain Medicare revenue stream
- Estimated revenue gain: +2% occupancy (30 residents) × $192/day × 365 = **$2.1M annually**

**ADJUSTED NET COST:** $10,483,480 - $2M (quality benefits, conservative) - $2.1M (revenue gain) = **$6.4M annual net cost**

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- At current $52M EBITDA, $6.4M net cost = **12.3% EBITDA reduction**
- If quality benefits reach upper range ($4.3M), net cost reduces to $3.98M = **7.7% EBITDA reduction**
- Investment is **NOT cash-positive** in short term, but necessary for:
  - Regulatory compliance (avoid F880 citations, DPNA)
  - Competitive positioning (match market, improve star ratings)
  - Risk mitigation (reduce Orange County SFF termination risk, avoid additional deficiencies)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with retention investment phased over 2 years (50% Year 1, 50% Year 2) to moderate EBITDA impact while demonstrating quality improvement trajectory.

#### 4. Alternative: Targeted Retention at High-Risk Facilities

**Lower-Cost Option:** Focus retention investments on 4 facilities with highest turnover/lowest quality (Orange County, Henderson, Desert Sun, plus 1 other):
- 4 facilities × 82 nursing staff/facility = 328 nursing staff (vs. 980 portfolio-wide)
- Wage increases: $328 × $3.40 × 2,080 = $2.39M (vs. $7.16M portfolio-wide)
- Benefits: $328 × ($1,060 + $1,200 + $1,560) = $1.25M (vs. $3.74M portfolio-wide)
- Career development: $134K (vs. $402K portfolio-wide)
- **Total targeted investment: $3.78M annually (vs. $11.3M portfolio-wide)**

**Trade-Offs:**
- ✅ Lower cost, less EBITDA impact (7.3% vs. 21.7%)
- ✅ Addresses highest-priority facilities (SFF candidate, F880 citations)
- ❌ Creates wage disparities across portfolio (retention risk at non-targeted facilities)
- ❌ Misses opportunity for portfolio-wide star rating improvement

### G. WARN Act Analysis (Orange County Closure Scenario)

#### 1. Federal WARN Act Requirements (29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq.)

**Statutory Framework:** The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires covered employers to provide 60 days' advance written notice before:
1. **Plant closing:** Permanent or temporary shutdown of single site, results in employment loss for ≥50 employees during any 30-day period³⁴
2. **Mass layoff:** Employment loss at single site for (a) ≥50 employees (if ≥33% of workforce), or (b) ≥500 employees (regardless of percentage)³⁵

**Covered Employers:** Private businesses and nonprofits with ≥100 full-time employees (excluding employees who worked <6 months in last 12 months and employees working <20 hours/week average).³⁶

**"Employment Loss" Definition:**
- Termination (other than for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement)
- Layoff exceeding 6 months
- Reduction in hours of work >50% during each month of any 6-month period³⁷

**Notice Recipients:**
1. Each affected employee (written individual notice)
2. State dislocated worker unit (state workforce agency)
3. Chief elected official of local government (mayor, county executive)
4. Union representatives (if applicable)³⁸

**Exceptions to 60-Day Notice:**
- **Faltering company exception:** Company actively seeking capital/business to avoid closure, and advance notice would preclude obtaining capital (applies ONLY to plant closings, not mass layoffs)³⁹
- **Unforeseeable business circumstances:** Sudden, dramatic, unexpected events beyond employer's control⁴⁰
- **Natural disaster:** Flood, earthquake, drought, storm, similar natural disaster⁴¹

**Penalties for Noncompliance:**
- **Back pay:** Up to 60 days' wages for each affected employee (covering period of violation, max 60 days)
- **Benefits:** Value of benefits employee would have received during violation period (health insurance, pension contributions, etc.)
- **Civil penalty:** Up to $500/day (payable to local government) if employer failed to notify local government⁴²

#### 2. State WARN Act Requirements — California, Arizona, Nevada

**California WARN Act (Cal. Health & Safety Code § 1400 et seq., Labor Code § 1400-1408):**

| Element | Federal WARN | California WARN (Cal-WARN) | Key Differences |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Employer Coverage** | ≥100 employees | ≥75 employees (in preceding 12 months) | CA covers smaller employers |
| **Plant Closing Threshold** | ≥50 employees affected | **ANY number of employees** (no minimum) | CA broader trigger |
| **Mass Layoff Threshold** | ≥50 (if 33% workforce) or ≥500 | ≥50 employees (no 33% rule) | CA eliminates percentage exemption |
| **Notice Period** | 60 days | 60 days | Same |
| **Relocation** | Not covered (unless meets closing/layoff thresholds) | **Yes** (removal of operations ≥100 miles away) | CA adds relocation trigger |
| **Penalties** | Back pay + benefits + $500/day local gov penalty | Back pay + benefits (no local gov penalty) | Similar remedies |

**California-Specific Requirements:**⁴³
- Employer must notify California Employment Development Department (EDD)
- Notice must include contact information for coordinating services with local workforce development board (effective January 1, 2026, per SB 617)
- "Industrial or commercial facility" includes healthcare facilities with ≥75 employees

**Arizona and Nevada:** No state-level mini-WARN Acts; facilities subject only to federal WARN requirements.⁴⁴

#### 3. Orange County Care Center Closure Scenario Analysis

**Triggering Event:** If CMS terminates Orange County's Medicare provider agreement (potential outcome if SFF designation leads to ≥3 years without improvement per 42 CFR § 488.404), facility loses 88% revenue ($24.6M annually = $7.84M Medicare + $16.8M Medicaid).⁴⁵ Facility cannot operate on remaining 12% revenue (private pay), requiring closure.

**Employee Count:** Orange County Care Center employs approximately **155 employees** (145 licensed beds × 1.07 employees/bed, typical SNF ratio per research plan).

**WARN Act Applicability:**

| Jurisdiction | Applicable? | Analysis |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Federal WARN** | **YES** | Sunset Senior Living Group employs 1,850 total (≥100 threshold ✓), Orange County closure affects 155 employees (≥50 threshold ✓), constitutes "plant closing" (single-site permanent shutdown) |
| **California Cal-WARN** | **YES** | Sunset employs ≥75 in California within preceding 12 months ✓, closure affects ANY number of employees (no minimum threshold under CA law), Orange County is "industrial or commercial facility" |

**Notice Timing Critical Path:**

| Event | Date | WARN Notice Trigger |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| **CMS Survey (Next)** | March 2025 | If continued serious deficiencies/immediate jeopardy found |
| **SFF Full Designation** | September 2025 (estimated) | If March 2025 survey shows no improvement (9-18 month candidate period) |
| **Improvement Period** | September 2025 - March 2028 | ≥3 years without improvement triggers mandatory termination consideration |
| **CMS Termination Notice** | March 2028 (estimated) | CMS issues 23-day notice (immediate jeopardy) or 90-day notice (other violations)⁴⁶ |
| **Facility Closure Date** | April-June 2028 (23-90 days after termination notice) | **WARN notice must be issued 60 days before closure** |

**CRITICAL TIMING ISSUE:** If CMS issues 23-day immediate jeopardy termination notice, only 23 days available between termination notice and effective closure date. WARN Act requires 60 days' advance notice. **Silver Oak cannot comply with full 60-day WARN notice if CMS termination occurs on 23-day immediate jeopardy basis.**

**Shortfall Liability Calculation:**
- Notice shortfall: 60 days required - 23 days provided = **37 days' pay owed**
- If 90-day CMS notice: 60 days WARN notice achievable (90 days > 60 days), **no shortfall liability**

#### 4. WARN Act Liability Quantification

**Scenario A: 23-Day CMS Termination (Immediate Jeopardy)**

| Component | Calculation | Liability |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Back Pay** | 155 employees × $25/hour avg × 8 hours/day × 37 days shortfall | **$1,147,000** |
| **Benefits** | Health insurance, PTO accrual, 401(k) match (25% of wages)⁴⁷ | **$286,750** |
| **Local Government Penalty** | $500/day × 37 days (federal only; CA has no local gov penalty) | **$18,500** |
| **Total Liability** | | **$1,452,250** |

**Scenario B: 90-Day CMS Termination (Non-Immediate Jeopardy)**

| Component | Calculation | Liability |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Back Pay** | $0 (60-day notice provided within 90-day window) | **$0** |
| **Benefits** | $0 | **$0** |
| **Local Government Penalty** | $0 (notice compliant) | **$0** |
| **Total Liability** | | **$0** |

**Scenario C: Complete Failure to Provide Notice**

| Component | Calculation | Liability |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Back Pay** | 155 employees × $25/hour avg × 8 hours/day × 60 days | **$1,860,000** |
| **Benefits** | 25% of wages | **$465,000** |
| **Local Government Penalty** | $500/day × 60 days | **$30,000** |
| **Total Liability** | | **$2,355,000** |

**Probability-Weighted WARN Exposure:**
- 70% probability CMS issues 90-day termination notice (Scenario B, $0 liability)
- 28% probability CMS issues 23-day immediate jeopardy termination (Scenario A, $1.45M liability)⁴⁸
- 2% probability Silver Oak fails to provide any notice (Scenario C, $2.36M liability)
- **Expected value:** (0.70 × $0) + (0.28 × $1.45M) + (0.02 × $2.36M) = **$453,300**

#### 5. Mitigation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Immediate WARN Notice Upon SFF Full Designation**
- If Orange County designated full SFF (September 2025), issue WARN notice immediately warning of potential closure in 2028
- Provides maximum advance notice (30+ months), exceeds 60-day requirement
- **Risk:** Triggers immediate employee exodus, exacerbates staffing challenges, accelerates facility deterioration
- **Not recommended** (premature, creates self-fulfilling prophecy)

**Strategy 2: Contingent WARN Notice Preparation**
- Draft WARN notice template, update quarterly with employee list
- If March 2025 survey shows continued serious deficiencies, prepare to issue notice within 24 hours of CMS signaling termination intent
- Monitor CMS correspondence closely (statement of deficiencies, informal dispute resolution, termination warnings)
- **Recommended** (proactive without triggering premature employee departures)

**Strategy 3: Exclude Orange County from Transaction**
- Silver Oak does not acquire Orange County Care Center, avoiding WARN liability entirely
- Reduces purchase price by $84M (estimated facility valuation: $28M revenue × 3× multiple)
- Golden Gate Capital retains Orange County, absorbs closure/WARN costs
- **Trade-off:** Loses 145-bed facility (8.8% of portfolio capacity), but eliminates $46.2M SFF termination NPV exposure (per financial-analyst T6 calculations in research plan)

**Strategy 4: California-Specific Compliance Enhancements**
- California Cal-WARN requires notice to EDD and coordination with local workforce development board
- Engage Orange County Workforce Development Board proactively (provide advance notice of potential layoff, coordinate displaced worker services)
- SB 617 (effective January 1, 2026) requires employer arrange services within 30 days of Cal-WARN notice⁴⁹
- **Recommended** (ensures California-specific compliance, reduces penalty risk)

**Strategy 5: Natural Disaster/Unforeseeable Circumstances Exception**
- If CMS issues 23-day termination notice, argue "unforeseeable business circumstances" exception (sudden CMS enforcement action beyond employer control)
- **Likelihood of success: LOW** (courts narrowly construe exceptions, CMS termination foreseeable given SFF candidate status, March 2025 survey outcome predictable)⁵⁰
- **Not recommended as primary strategy** (use only as litigation defense if WARN notice shortfall occurs)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Adopt Strategy 2 (contingent WARN notice preparation) + Strategy 4 (California-specific compliance) + consider Strategy 3 (exclude Orange County from transaction) if March 2025 survey results indicate high termination probability.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **High CNA Turnover (85%)** | HIGH | Certain (ongoing) | $3.5M annually recruitment + $2M quality impact | Wage increases to $20/hour, benefits enhancements, career development ($11.3M investment) |
| **F880 Insufficient Staffing Citations** | MEDIUM | Probable (25% facilities cited) | DPNA risk $500K-$1M per facility | Hire 26 RN + 65 CNA FTE to reach 3.48 PPD ($4.3M annually) |
| **Orange County WARN Act Liability** | HIGH | Possible (28% SFF termination) | $1.45M (23-day notice) to $2.36M (no notice) | Contingent WARN notice preparation, consider facility exclusion |
| **Cascading Turnover (Experienced Staff Burnout)** | MEDIUM | Probable | $1M-$2M (accelerated turnover spiral) | Immediate retention interventions at high-turnover facilities |
| **California AB 1502 Non-Compliance** | MEDIUM | Possible (Orange County risk) | State enforcement, license sanctions | Ensure 3 CA facilities maintain ≥3.5 PPD |
| **Workforce Shortage (National CNAs)** | MEDIUM | Ongoing (industry-wide) | Wage inflation pressure, recruitment difficulty | Market-competitive wages, pipeline development (tuition reimbursement) |
| **CMS Staffing Rule Uncertainty (Post-2034)** | LOW | Uncertain (post-2034) | Potential $4.3M if rule reinstated | Monitor regulatory developments, maintain quality-driven staffing |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

**Data Room Document Requests:**
1. **Facility-specific turnover data:** Obtain turnover rates by facility (identify highest-risk facilities beyond Henderson/Desert Sun/Orange County noted in research plan)
2. **Exit interview summaries:** Review reasons for departure (validate wage/workload/career development hypotheses)
3. **Wage scales by facility and market:** Confirm $16-$18 CNA wages across all 12 facilities (some markets may have higher/lower gaps)
4. **PBJ data submissions:** CMS Payroll-Based Journal reports (verify actual hours worked, validate 3.45 PPD calculation)
5. **Agency staffing usage and costs:** Quantify actual agency RN/LPN/CNA usage (validate $734K agency premium estimate)
6. **Workers' compensation claims:** Injury rates (high turnover correlates with injuries, CNAs lifting/repositioning risks)
7. **Union activity:** Any organizing campaigns, NLRB elections, unfair labor practice charges at any facilities
8. **EEOC charges:** Employment discrimination complaints (wage disparities, retaliation for complaints)
9. **State wage/hour investigations:** California Labor Commissioner, Arizona Industrial Commission, Nevada Labor Commissioner (overtime violations, meal/rest break violations common in nursing homes)
10. **Pending WARN notices:** Any facilities Silver Oak/Golden Gate considering closure beyond Orange County

**Follow-Up Due Diligence:**
- **Site visits:** Interview CNAs/LPNs/RNs at 3-4 facilities (anonymous feedback on wages, workload, management)
- **Market wage surveys:** Obtain Sullivan Cotter, Mercer, or local hospital CNA/RN wage data for Phoenix/Las Vegas/Riverside MSAs (validate competitive gaps)
- **California CDPH licensing files:** Review any investigations, complaints, staffing-related citations at 3 CA facilities
- **Background checks on DONs/administrators:** Verify qualifications, any prior employment issues, survey performance history

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

| Exposure Category | Conservative Estimate | Aggressive Estimate | Basis |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Retention Investment (Voluntary)** | $6.4M annually net | $10.5M annually net | After $817K recruitment savings + $2M-$4M quality benefits |
| **Quality-Driven Staffing Increase** | $4.3M annually | $4.7M annually (w/ recruitment) | 26 RN + 65 CNA FTE to reach 3.48 PPD benchmark |
| **WARN Act (Orange County Closure)** | $453K (probability-weighted) | $2.36M (worst-case no notice) | 28% termination probability × scenarios |
| **California AB 1502 Compliance** | $654K annually (3 facilities) | $1.2M annually (if all 3 non-compliant) | Reach 3.5 PPD at CA facilities |
| **Agency Staffing Premium (Ongoing)** | $734K annually | $1.2M annually (if turnover worsens) | 10%-15% vacancy backfill |
| **DPNA Revenue Loss (Staffing-Related)** | $500K-$1M annually | $2M-$3M annually (multiple facilities) | Future F880 → substandard quality → DPNA |
| **Wage Inflation (Market Pressure)** | $500K annually (2-3% raises) | $1.5M annually (5% raises) | Competitive pressure even without retention plan |
| **CUMULATIVE ANNUAL EXPOSURE** | **$13M-$15M** | **$23M-$27M** | Ranges reflect conservative vs. aggressive scenarios |

**Transaction EBITDA Impact:**
- Current EBITDA: $52M (18.2% margin on $285M revenue)
- Conservative staffing/retention costs: $13M annual = **25% EBITDA reduction** (EBITDA → $39M, 13.7% margin)
- Aggressive staffing/retention costs: $23M annual = **44% EBITDA reduction** (EBITDA → $29M, 10.2% margin)

**Critical Threshold:** If combined staffing/retention costs exceed $15M annually (29% EBITDA impact), transaction economics become challenged. Silver Oak should:
1. Model purchase price adjustment ($30M-$50M reduction to compensate for staffing EBITDA drag)
2. Negotiate seller-funded retention bonus pool ($2M-$3M) to stabilize workforce during transition
3. Consider excluding highest-cost facilities (Orange County + 1-2 others) to reduce exposure

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. CMS Minimum Staffing Rule Repeal Eliminates Mandatory $4.3M Annual Cost**

The December 2025 repeal of CMS minimum staffing standards (blocked until September 2034 by Public Law 119-21 § 71111) removes the previously anticipated regulatory mandate to hire 26 RN FTE + 65 CNA FTE. **However**, this does NOT eliminate the quality-driven business necessity for staffing increases. Sunset's F880 citations (insufficient staffing at 25% of facilities), low star ratings (33% at 1-2 stars), and high turnover (67% vs. 52% national) demonstrate that staffing deficiencies create survey compliance risks, occupancy loss, and competitive disadvantage **independent of federal mandate**.

**IMPLICATION:** Staffing increases should be treated as **quality improvement investment** (not regulatory compliance cost), with ROI measured via DPNA avoidance, star rating improvement, and occupancy gains. Estimated net cost: $4.3M-$6.4M annually after benefits.

**2. Turnover Crisis Demands Immediate Retention Intervention**

Sunset's 85% CNA turnover (vs. 42%-65% national) and 67% overall nursing turnover (vs. 52%-54% national) cost $3.5M annually in recruitment + agency staffing, plus unmeasured quality degradation. Root causes:
- **Wage gaps:** CNAs earn $16-$18/hour vs. $18-$22 market (10-22% below market)
- **Workload stress:** F880-cited facilities understaffed (2.8 PPD vs. 3.6 expected at Henderson)
- **Lack of career development:** No tuition reimbursement, limited CNA→LPN→RN pathways
- **Inadequate training:** 2-week orientation insufficient for high-acuity residents

**Retention investment of $11.3M annually** (wages $7.2M + benefits $3.7M + career development $402K) would reduce turnover to industry norms (60% CNA, 40% LPN, 30% RN), saving $817K recruitment costs + $2M-$4M quality benefits. **Net cost: $6.4M-$10.5M annually** (12-20% EBITDA impact).

**RECOMMENDATION:** Phase retention investment over 2 years (50% Year 1, 50% Year 2) to moderate EBITDA impact while demonstrating measurable turnover reduction to lenders/investors.

**3. Orange County WARN Act Exposure Manageable with Proper Planning**

If Orange County terminates (28% probability by March 2028 per SFF trajectory), Silver Oak faces WARN Act notice requirements for 155 employees. **Key risk:** CMS may issue 23-day immediate jeopardy termination notice, leaving insufficient time for 60-day WARN notice (shortfall liability $1.45M). **Probability-weighted WARN exposure: $453K.**

**MITIGATION:**
- Prepare contingent WARN notice template (update quarterly with employee list)
- Issue notice immediately upon CMS signaling termination intent (monitor March 2025 survey results closely)
- California Cal-WARN requires EDD notification + workforce development board coordination within 30 days (SB 617)
- **Alternative:** Exclude Orange County from transaction (avoids $46.2M SFF termination NPV + $453K WARN exposure, reduces purchase price $84M)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Adopt contingent WARN preparation strategy + seriously consider Orange County exclusion if March 2025 survey shows continued serious deficiencies.

**4. State Staffing Mandates Create Patchwork Compliance Obligations**

California AB 1502 mandates 3.5 PPD for all California SNFs (effective July 2023). Sunset's 3 California facilities must maintain compliance (Sunrise Manor 3.6 PPD compliant, Orange County/San Diego status uncertain). **Cost to ensure compliance:** $654K annually (if all 3 facilities need incremental staffing). Arizona and Nevada have no state mandates (federal "sufficient staff" only).

**Compliance Strategy:**
- Audit PBJ submissions for 3 CA facilities (verify ≥3.5 PPD)
- If any CA facility <3.5 PPD, hire immediately (California CDPH enforcement risk)
- Portfolio-wide staffing increase to 3.48 PPD would exceed California 3.5 PPD requirement (Strategy B in Section IV.C accomplishes both federal quality and California regulatory objectives)

**5. Workforce Market Pressures Will Drive Wage Inflation Regardless of Retention Plan**

National CNAs shortage, hospital/Amazon/retail wage competition ($18-$22/hour), and post-pandemic labor market tightness create upward wage pressure. **Even without formal retention plan, Sunset must raise wages 2-3% annually** (~$500K) to avoid accelerated turnover. Proactive retention investment ($7.2M wage increases to $20/$28/$37 target) represents **strategic leap to market leadership** (vs. reactive incremental adjustments that fail to stabilize workforce).

**Investment Framing:** Present retention plan as **offensive strategy** (improve quality, capture market share, increase star ratings) rather than defensive cost (respond to turnover crisis). Quality facilities command occupancy premiums, attract private-pay residents, avoid DPNA/CMPs.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing, 0-60 Days):**

1. **Data Room Deep Dive:**
   - Request facility-specific turnover data (identify worst performers)
   - Obtain exit interview summaries (validate root cause hypotheses)
   - Review PBJ submissions (verify 3.45 PPD calculation, identify facility-level variances)
   - Analyze agency staffing costs (quantify actual spend, compare to $734K estimate)

2. **Orange County Decision:**
   - Await March 2025 survey results (due approximately 30-45 days post-survey)
   - If continued serious deficiencies/immediate jeopardy → **recommend facility exclusion** from transaction
   - If improvement demonstrated → retain in transaction but prepare contingent WARN notice

3. **California AB 1502 Compliance Verification:**
   - Audit 3 CA facilities' PBJ data (confirm ≥3.5 PPD)
   - If any facility non-compliant → include closing condition requiring California CDPH confirmation of compliance

4. **Purchase Price Adjustment Negotiation:**
   - Quantify staffing/retention EBITDA impact: $13M-$23M annually (conservative to aggressive)
   - Request $30M-$50M purchase price reduction OR seller-funded $3M retention bonus pool
   - Alternative: Escrow $5M for 18-month post-closing turnover stabilization costs

**Short-Term Actions (Post-Closing, 60-180 Days):**

5. **Phase 1 Retention Investment (High-Priority Facilities):**
   - Implement wage increases at 4 highest-turnover facilities (Orange County if retained, Henderson, Desert Sun, +1)
   - Cost: $3.78M annually (vs. $11.3M portfolio-wide)
   - Demonstrate measurable turnover reduction within 6 months (85%→70% CNA, 55%→45% LPN, 40%→35% RN)

6. **Tuition Reimbursement Pilot:**
   - Launch 50-participant CNA→LPN/RN tuition assistance program ($250K annually)
   - Creates career pathways, generates loyalty, addresses RN shortage long-term
   - Partner with local community colleges (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Riverside)

7. **PBJ Monitoring System:**
   - Implement real-time PBJ dashboard (track hours per resident day by facility, flag non-compliance)
   - Early warning system for F880 risk (if facility drops below CMS expected staffing, intervene immediately)

**Long-Term Actions (180+ Days):**

8. **Phase 2 Retention Investment (Portfolio-Wide):**
   - Extend wage increases + benefits enhancements to remaining 8 facilities
   - Total investment: $11.3M annually portfolio-wide
   - Target portfolio-wide turnover: 50% (vs. current 67%)

9. **Star Rating Quality Initiative:**
   - Pair staffing increases with quality interventions (pressure ulcer prevention, fall reduction, medication management technology)
   - Target star rating improvement: 3.2 average → 3.8 average within 24 months
   - Estimated occupancy gain: +2% (30 residents) = $2.1M annual revenue

10. **Workforce Pipeline Development:**
    - Partner with high schools, workforce development boards (CNA training programs)
    - Offer paid CNA certification (recruit from community, certify in-house, guarantee employment)
    - Reduces reliance on external recruitment, improves cultural fit

### C. Outstanding Questions

**Questions for Seller (Golden Gate Capital) / Management:**

1. What specific retention initiatives has Sunset implemented 2022-2024 to address 85% CNA turnover? (Document prior interventions, assess why ineffective)

2. What is facility-specific turnover data for all 12 facilities? (Identify outliers, target highest-risk facilities first)

3. What percentage of CNA/LPN/RN departures are voluntary vs. termination for cause? (High involuntary turnover may indicate quality-of-hire issues vs. retention issues)

4. What wage increases has Sunset implemented 2022-2024? (If already raised wages without turnover reduction, may indicate non-wage drivers more significant)

5. Are any facilities subject to union organizing campaigns, NLRB elections, or unfair labor practice charges? (Union activity complicates wage/benefit changes, requires bargaining)

6. What is actual agency staffing spend FY2024? (Validate $734K estimate, may be significantly higher)

7. What retention bonuses, if any, are offered to staff during ownership transitions? (Change of control creates additional turnover risk, need stabilization plan)

8. What is plan for Orange County if designated full SFF? (Close, sell separately, attempt turnaround?)

**Questions for Legal Counsel:**

9. Does transaction structure (asset vs. stock purchase) affect WARN Act liability? (Asset purchases generally do not transfer WARN liability, but "successor employer" doctrine may apply if substantial continuity of operations)

10. Are there pending or threatened wage/hour class actions? (California meal/rest break, off-the-clock work, misclassification common in nursing homes)

11. Do any facilities have collective bargaining agreements? (If union-represented, wage/benefit changes require bargaining, may delay implementation)

12. What indemnification provisions address WARN Act liability? (If Orange County terminates post-closing, who bears $453K-$2.36M liability?)

**Questions for Lenders / Investors:**

13. What EBITDA covenants apply to acquisition financing? (If staffing/retention costs reduce EBITDA 25-44%, may breach covenants, require amendments)

14. What purchase price adjustment mechanisms exist for post-closing staffing cost increases? (Working capital adjustments, earnouts, escrows)

15. What budget has Silver Oak allocated for post-closing workforce stabilization? (If <$5M, insufficient for retention plan implementation)

## IX. APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Phased Hiring Timeline Model (Quality-Driven Scenario)

| Phase | Timeline | Hiring Target | Annual Cost | Cumulative Investment | Quality Milestone |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Pre-Closing** | Months 0-2 | California facilities only (12 FTE) | $653K | $653K | California AB 1502 compliance verified |
| **Year 1 Q1-Q2** | Months 3-6 | High-priority facilities (Orange County/Henderson/Desert Sun, 40 FTE) | $1.8M | $2.45M | Reduce F880 citations from 3 facilities to 1 facility |
| **Year 1 Q3-Q4** | Months 7-12 | Portfolio expansion (25 FTE) | $1.1M | $3.55M | Portfolio average 3.35 PPD (from 3.45 current, net of turnover) |
| **Year 2 Q1-Q2** | Months 13-18 | Complete to 3.48 PPD target (26 FTE) | $1.2M | $4.75M | All facilities ≥3.4 PPD, zero F880 citations |
| **Year 2 Q3-Q4** | Months 19-24 | Stabilization and backfill (turnover replacement) | $330K | $5.08M | Staffing star rating improves 2.6→3.2 portfolio average |
| **Ongoing (Year 3+)** | Steady state | Maintain 3.48 PPD + turnover replacement | $4.3M annually | | Overall star rating 3.2→3.8, occupancy +2% |

### Appendix B: Turnover Cost Calculations (Detailed)

**Direct Recruitment Costs (FY2024 Actual):**

| Position | Departures | Cost Per Hire Breakdown | Total Annual Cost |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **RN** | 72 | Advertising $750 + Signing bonus $3,500 + Background $150 + Orientation (3 weeks @ $35/hr × 120 hrs = $4,200) + Preceptor $1,000 = **$9,600** | $691,200 |
| **LPN** | 176 | Advertising $500 + Signing bonus $2,000 + Background $150 + Orientation (2.5 weeks @ $24/hr × 100 hrs = $2,400) + Preceptor $750 = **$5,800** | $1,020,800 |
| **CNA** | 408 | Advertising $300 + Signing bonus $1,000 + Background $100 + Orientation (2 weeks @ $17/hr × 80 hrs = $1,360) + Preceptor $400 = **$3,160** | $1,289,280 |
| **TOTAL** | **656** | Weighted average **$4,577** | **$3,001,280** |

**Note:** User research plan states $3.5M annually, which likely includes additional indirect costs (onboarding inefficiency, training staff time, quality issues from inexperienced staff) beyond direct recruitment costs calculated above. Direct + indirect = $3M-$3.5M range.

**Indirect Costs (Agency Staffing Premium):**

| Position | Vacancy Hours (656 departures × 8 weeks × 40 hrs) | Agency Backfill % | Agency Hours | Agency Rate | Permanent Rate | Premium | Total Cost |
|----------|------------|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| **RN** | 23,040 (72 × 320) | 10% | 2,304 | $85/hr | $35/hr | $50/hr | $115,200 |
| **LPN** | 56,320 (176 × 320) | 10% | 5,632 | $55/hr | $24/hr | $31/hr | $174,592 |
| **CNA** | 130,560 (408 × 320) | 10% | 13,056 | $28/hr | $17/hr | $11/hr | $143,616 |
| **TOTAL** | **209,920** | 10% average | **20,992** | | | **weighted $35/hr** | **$433,408** |

**Note:** Conservative 10% agency backfill assumption. If actual agency usage 15-20% (common during high-turnover periods), premium increases to $650K-$867K annually.

### Appendix C: Wage Market Comparison Tables (Metro Area Analysis)

**Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ MSA (6 Sunset facilities):**

| Position | Sunset Current | BLS OEWS May 2024 (Phoenix MSA) | Market Range (Survey Data) | Gap |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-----|
| **CNA** | $16-$18 ($17 avg) | $18.50 median (SOC 31-1131) | $17-$20 (SNF), $19-$22 (hospital) | -$1.50 to -$4 |
| **LPN** | $22-$26 ($24 avg) | $26.80 median (SOC 29-2061) | $25-$29 (SNF) | -$2 to -$5 |
| **RN** | $30-$35 ($33 avg) | $38.20 median (SOC 29-1141) | $34-$40 (SNF), $40-$45 (hospital) | -$5 to -$7 |

**Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV MSA (3 Sunset facilities):**

| Position | Sunset Current | BLS OEWS May 2024 (Las Vegas MSA) | Market Range | Gap |
|----------|---------------|------------------------------|--------------|-----|
| **CNA** | $16-$18 ($17 avg) | $19.20 median | $18-$21 (SNF) | -$2 to -$4 |
| **LPN** | $22-$26 ($24 avg) | $28.50 median | $27-$31 (SNF) | -$5 to -$7 |
| **RN** | $30-$35 ($33 avg) | $40.10 median | $36-$43 (SNF) | -$6 to -$10 |

**Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA MSA (1 Sunset facility - Sunrise Manor):**

| Position | Sunset Current | BLS OEWS May 2024 (Riverside MSA) | Market Range | Gap |
|----------|---------------|------------------------------|--------------|-----|
| **CNA** | $16-$18 ($17 avg) | $20.40 median | $19-$23 (SNF) | -$3 to -$6 |
| **LPN** | $22-$26 ($24 avg) | $30.20 median | $28-$32 (SNF) | -$6 to -$8 |
| **RN** | $30-$35 ($33 avg) | $42.50 median | $38-$46 (SNF) | -$8 to -$13 |

**Orange County-Anaheim-Irvine, CA Metro Division (1 Sunset facility - Orange County Care Center):**

| Position | Sunset Current | BLS OEWS May 2024 (Orange County) | Market Range | Gap |
|----------|---------------|------------------------------|--------------|-----|
| **CNA** | $16-$18 ($17 avg) | $21.30 median | $20-$24 (SNF) | -$4 to -$7 |
| **LPN** | $22-$26 ($24 avg) | $31.80 median | $30-$34 (SNF) | -$8 to -$10 |
| **RN** | $30-$35 ($33 avg) | $48.20 median | $42-$52 (SNF) | -$14 to -$19 |

**Finding:** Orange County and Riverside (California) facilities have largest wage gaps (CNAs -$4 to -$7/hour, RNs -$8 to -$19/hour below market), explaining high turnover and contributing to quality deficiencies. California facilities should be **prioritized** for wage increases in retention plan implementation.

### Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis | Sources |
|---------|------------|-------|---------|
| **CMS Staffing Rule Repealed Dec 2025** | **HIGH** | Statutory certainty (Public Law 119-21 § 71111, 90 Fed. Reg. 55687) | Federal Register, Congress.gov, CMS announcements (3 independent sources) |
| **Sunset 3.45 PPD Current Staffing** | **HIGH** | Research plan data (980 nursing staff, 542,025 patient days, calculation verified) | Research plan factual background, calculation methodology validated |
| **CNA Turnover 85% vs. 42-65% National** | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Research plan states 85%, national range 42%-78% across multiple studies (wide variance in literature) | CareListings 53.9%, Skilled Nursing News 42.34%, Health Affairs 78.1% historical (4 sources) |

### Known Limitations

**1. Facility-Specific Data Unavailable:**
- Research plan provides **portfolio-level** staffing (3.45 PPD average), turnover (67% weighted average), and wages ($16-$18 CNA), but not facility-by-facility breakdowns
- **Impact:** Cannot identify specific high-risk facilities beyond those named in research plan (Henderson F880, Orange County SFF, Desert Sun DPNA)
- **Mitigation:** Recommended data room requests in Section V.B for facility-specific turnover, wages, PBJ submissions

**2. Turnover Rate Variability in Literature:**
- Published CNA turnover rates range 14%-346% depending on calculation methodology (annualized vs. raw departures, full-time equivalent vs. headcount, voluntary vs. involuntary)
- Sunset 85% CNA turnover (research plan) exceeds most recent 2024-2025 national averages (42%-65%) but falls within historical ranges (78%-129%)
- **Impact:** National benchmark comparison subject to 10-15 percentage point uncertainty
- **Mitigation:** Used multiple sources (CareListings, Skilled Nursing News, Health Affairs, PMC) to triangulate reasonable range

**3. Quality Benefits Quantification Uncertainty:**
- Retention investment quality benefits ($2M-$4M estimated) include DPNA avoidance, star rating improvement, litigation reduction — inherently difficult to quantify
- **Impact:** ROI analysis includes soft benefits that may not materialize or may take longer than projected (24 months to achieve star rating improvement)
- **Mitigation:** Provided conservative ($2M) and aggressive ($4M) scenarios; emphasized that investment is **quality necessity** (not purely financial ROI)

**4. California Facility AB 1502 Compliance Status Unknown:**
- Research plan confirms Sunrise Manor 3.6 PPD (compliant), but Orange County and San Diego 3.5 PPD compliance status not verified
- **Impact:** Cannot definitively state whether $654K incremental California staffing cost required
- **Mitigation:** Recommended closing condition requiring California CDPH confirmation of compliance (Section VI.B)

**5. CMS Staffing Rule Uncertainty Post-2034:**
- Public Law 119-21 § 71111 blocks CMS staffing standards until September 30, 2034, but does not prohibit re-implementation thereafter
- **Impact:** Long-term regulatory landscape uncertain (10-year horizon)
- **Mitigation:** Recommended quality-driven staffing increases (3.48 PPD) regardless of federal mandate, positioning Sunset for future regulatory changes
