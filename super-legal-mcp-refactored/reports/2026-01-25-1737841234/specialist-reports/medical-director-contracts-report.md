## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This report analyzes medical director arrangements at Sunset Senior Living Group's 12 skilled nursing facilities for compliance with the Stark Law (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn) and Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)). The analysis is conducted in connection with Silver Oak Healthcare LLC's proposed $425 million acquisition and addresses Critical Issue #8 from the research plan: whether medical director compensation, particularly **Dr. Robert Johnson's $180,000 annual fee**, constitutes fair market value or an illegal kickback to induce referrals.

**Key Finding:** Of Sunset's 12 medical director contracts (totaling $1.55 million annually), **11 appear within fair market value ranges** (40th-65th percentile), but **Dr. Johnson's arrangement presents HIGH RISK** of Anti-Kickback Statute violation due to compensation at the **75th-90th percentile** combined with alleged 150+ annual referrals and potential lack of time documentation. This arrangement is the subject of specific allegations in the pending FCA qui tam litigation (*Martinez v. Sunset*, filed May 2023, unsealed December 2024).

**Exposure:** If Dr. Johnson's arrangement is determined to constitute a kickback, it contributes **$3-8 million** to the overall FCA settlement (component of the estimated $8-15 million total settlement range). In a worst-case treble damages scenario, Dr. Johnson's referrals alone could generate **$30.6-36.9 million** in liability (450 patients × $18,000 average claim × 3 + penalties).

**Recommendation:** **Immediate remediation required** — either renegotiate Dr. Johnson's compensation downward to $150,000-162,000 (50th-65th percentile) or document expanded duties justifying the premium, implement time tracking for all 12 medical directors, and amend contracts to include explicit anti-referral language.

### Material Findings

#### Finding 1: Dr. Johnson Compensation Exceeds Typical SNF Medical Director FMV Benchmarks

**Compensation:** $15,000/month ($180,000 annually) for medical director services at Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ, 165 beds)

**Fair Market Value Assessment:**

Based on industry benchmarking proxies (Sullivan Cotter, MGMA, healthcare compensation consulting firm standards), typical SNF medical director compensation for a 150-175 bed facility ranges:
- **50th percentile (median):** $150,000
- **75th percentile:** $180,000
- **90th percentile:** $210,000

**Dr. Johnson's $180,000 compensation is at the upper boundary of the 75th percentile or into the 90th percentile**, placing it in a high-scrutiny zone for federal healthcare fraud enforcement.

**Hourly Rate Analysis:**
- **If 10 hours/month** (Sunset's likely claim): $180,000 ÷ 120 hours/year = **$1,500/hour** (5-10× typical physician rates of $150-300/hour) — **EXCESSIVE**
- **If 1 hour/month** (FCA relator's allegation): $180,000 ÷ 12 hours/year = **$15,000/hour** — **GROSSLY EXCESSIVE**
- **To achieve reasonable $150-180/hour rate:** Would require 30-40 hours/month (1,000+ hours/year), which is implausible for a part-time medical director role

**Comparison to Halifax/Tuomey Precedents:**
- **Halifax Hospital:** Neurosurgeons compensated at **more than 2× 90th percentile** despite below-90th percentile productivity → $85 million settlement
- **Tuomey Healthcare:** Physicians compensated **far above FMV** with exclusive referral requirements → $237 million judgment (settled $72.4 million after bankruptcy)
- **Dr. Johnson:** Compensation at **75th-90th percentile** with 150+ referrals/year → distinguishable (not as egregious as Halifax/Tuomey) but still concerning

---

#### Finding 2: OIG 2024 Nursing Facility Compliance Guidance Mandates Time Documentation

On **November 20, 2024**, the Office of Inspector General issued updated **Nursing Facility Industry Segment-Specific Compliance Program Guidance** (first update since 2008), which places significant emphasis on medical director arrangements.

**Key OIG Requirements:**

**a. Periodic Contract Review**
Nursing facilities must periodically review physician contracts to ensure:
- Legitimate need for services exists
- Services are actually provided
- **Compensation is at fair market value** in arm's-length transaction
- Arrangement is **not related to volume or value of federal healthcare program business**

**b. Documentation Requirements**
Facilities must maintain:
- **Time logs or other accounts of services rendered** (contemporaneous documentation of hours worked)
- Basis for determining compensation (FMV analysis, survey data)
- Compensation terms (contract provisions)

**c. High-Risk Relationship Indicators**
OIG identifies medical directors as high-risk because they:
- Refer federal healthcare program patients for admission
- Certify/recertify patients' need for skilled services (Medicare eligibility)
- Order separately billable items and services
- Have dual clinical and financial relationships with facilities

**Application to Sunset:**
Sunset likely **lacks contemporaneous time logs** for medical directors (typical deficiency in SNF industry prior to OIG's 2024 guidance). This undermines fair market value defenses:
- If Dr. Johnson has no time logs showing 10-12 hours/month, the FCA relator's "1 hour/month" allegation becomes more credible
- Without documentation, Sunset cannot rebut government's assertion that compensation is excessive

---

#### Finding 3: STARK Law and AKS Impose Overlapping but Distinct Requirements

Medical director arrangements must satisfy **both** STARK Law exceptions **and** AKS safe harbors to minimize compliance risk.

**STARK Law (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn):**
- **Prohibition:** Physician cannot refer Medicare/Medicaid patients to entity with which physician has compensation arrangement, unless exception applies
- **Relevant Exceptions:**
  - **Employment Exception (42 CFR § 411.357(c)):** For W-2 employees
  - **Personal Services Exception (42 CFR § 411.357(d)):** For independent contractors
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Written agreement, ≥1 year term (PSA exception)
  - Services specified, compensation set in advance
  - **Fair market value** and **not based on referrals**
  - Commercially reasonable
- **Liability:** Strict liability (no intent required); tainted claims not payable; refund obligation + FCA exposure

**Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)):**
- **Prohibition:** Criminal felony to knowingly and willfully offer/pay remuneration to induce referrals
- **Relevant Safe Harbors:**
  - **Employment Safe Harbor (42 CFR § 1001.952(i)):** Bona fide employees
  - **Personal Services Safe Harbor (42 CFR § 1001.952(d)):** Independent contractors
- **Key Requirements:**
  - Same as STARK (written agreement, FMV, not based on referrals)
  - Additional: Commercially reasonable, reasonably necessary
- **Liability:** Criminal prosecution (up to 10 years prison) + exclusion from federal programs + FCA predicate (AKS violations are automatic false claims)

**"One Purpose" Test:**
AKS is violated if **one purpose** of the remuneration is to induce referrals, even if other legitimate purposes exist. This is more stringent than STARK Law's "determined by" standard.

**Practical Compliance Strategy:**
Structure all medical director arrangements to satisfy:
1. STARK Personal Services Exception requirements (most Sunset contracts are 1099 independent contractors)
2. AKS Personal Services Safe Harbor requirements
3. OIG 2024 guidance (time logs, FMV documentation, anti-referral language)

**[VERIFIED: Statutory Authority]** 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), 42 C.F.R. §§ 411.357, 1001.952

#### Finding 4: 11 of 12 Medical Director Contracts Appear Compliant with FMV Standards

**Portfolio Overview:**
- **Total facilities:** 12 SNFs (6 Arizona, 3 Nevada, 3 California)
- **Total licensed beds:** 1,650
- **Total medical director compensation:** $1,546,000 annually (average $128,833 per facility)
- **Compensation range:** $90,000 (Flagstaff Pines, 95 beds) to $180,000 (Desert Sun, 165 beds)

**Compliance Assessment:**

| Facility | Beds | Compensation | FMV Percentile | Status |
|----------|------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Phoenix Palms | 145 | $120,000 | 50th | ✓ Compliant |
| **Desert Sun** | 165 | **$180,000** | **75th-90th** | **⚠ High Risk** |
| Mesa Springs | 135 | $108,000 | 40th | ✓ Compliant |
| Tucson Gardens | 155 | $132,000 | 40th | ✓ Compliant |
| Flagstaff Pines | 95 | $90,000 | 40th | ✓ Compliant |
| Tempe Oasis | 125 | $100,000 | 35th | ✓ Compliant |
| Silver Sage LV | 175 | $150,000 | 50th | ✓ Compliant |
| Henderson Valley | 140 | $126,000 | 60th | ✓ Compliant |
| Reno Summit | 110 | $96,000 | 50th | ✓ Compliant |
| Sunrise Manor | 180 | $162,000 | 65th | ✓ Compliant |
| San Diego Shores | 160 | $144,000 | 45th | ✓ Compliant |
| Orange County | 145 | $138,000 | 40th | ✓ Compliant |

**Key Observations:**
1. **11 of 12 contracts** fall within 35th-65th percentile (conservative compliance zone)
2. **Consistency across portfolio:** Larger facilities (175-180 beds) receive $150,000-162,000; Dr. Johnson's $180,000 for 165-bed facility is **12-20% higher** than comparable facilities
3. **No contracts exceed 90th percentile** (which would constitute very high risk)
4. **Geographic variations:** California facilities slightly higher (cost-of-living adjustment), but Dr. Johnson (Arizona) exceeds larger California facilities

**Distinguishing Factor Analysis:**
If Dr. Johnson's compensation is justified by:
- **Board certification in geriatrics** (specialty expertise)
- **Quality improvement leadership** (Desert Sun has DPNA history, needs intensive oversight)
- **Expanded duties beyond standard medical director** (direct patient care, extensive staff education)
- **Multiple facilities** (if Dr. Johnson serves more than one Sunset facility, aggregate $180K may be split)

...then compensation may be defensible. **However, these justifications must be documented and contemporaneous**, not retrofitted post-FCA allegations.

**[HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO — DATA ROOM VERIFICATION REQUIRED]**

---

#### Finding 5: Referral Patterns and Clinical Discharge Planning Distinguish Sunset from Halifax/Tuomey

**Dr. Johnson's Referral Relationship:**

**Alleged Facts:**
- Dr. Johnson is a **hospital-employed physician** (or employed by hospital-affiliated medical group)
- Refers **150+ Medicare patients annually** to Sunset facilities
- Referrals occur through **discharge planning process** (post-acute care following hospitalization)

**Legal Distinction from Halifax/Tuomey:**

**Halifax/Tuomey Arrangements (Illegal Kickbacks):**
- **Exclusive referral requirements:** Physicians contractually required to refer outpatient procedures exclusively to hospital
- **Quid pro quo:** Hospital paid above-FMV compensation explicitly to secure referral stream
- **Steering commercial patients:** Physicians diverted lucrative self-pay/private insurance patients to hospital instead of competing providers

**Dr. Johnson Arrangement (Potentially Lawful):**
- **Discharge planning referrals:** Physicians make post-acute SNF placement recommendations based on:
  - Clinical needs (rehab services, wound care, IV antibiotics, complex medical management)
  - Patient/family preferences
  - Insurance coverage
  - Geographic proximity
- **No exclusive requirement:** Dr. Johnson presumably refers to multiple SNFs based on bed availability and clinical appropriateness, not exclusive contract with Sunset
- **No direct financial benefit from referrals:** Compensation is **fixed monthly retainer**, not variable based on referral volume

**CMS Discharge Planning Requirements (42 CFR § 482.43):**
Hospitals must:
- Provide list of available SNFs to patients
- Disclose financial interests in referred SNFs
- Honor patient choice
- Base recommendations on clinical appropriateness, not financial relationships

**If Dr. Johnson's referrals comply with CMS discharge planning regulations** and are based on clinical factors, this distinguishes Sunset from the quid pro quo kickback schemes in Halifax/Tuomey.

**However, the 150+ referrals annually create an inference of financial inducement**, particularly if:
- Dr. Johnson refers to Sunset facilities at **significantly higher rates** than other hospital physicians
- Referrals increased after medical director arrangement commenced
- Compensation increased when referrals increased

**Mitigation Strategy:**
Conduct **referral pattern analysis** comparing Dr. Johnson to peer hospital physicians' SNF referral patterns. If Dr. Johnson's referral rate to Sunset is within normal range (not an outlier), this supports clinical appropriateness defense.

### Key Authorities and Precedents

**Statutory Framework:**
- **42 U.S.C. § 1395nn** (Stark Law): Prohibition on physician self-referrals for designated health services unless exception applies
- **42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)** (Anti-Kickback Statute): Criminal prohibition on remuneration to induce referrals; AKS violations are FCA predicates

**Regulatory Framework:**
- **42 C.F.R. § 411.357(c)** (Stark employment exception), **(d)** (personal services exception)
- **42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(i)** (AKS employment safe harbor), **(d)** (personal services safe harbor)
- **42 C.F.R. § 483.70(g)** (SNF medical director regulatory requirements)

**Landmark Precedents:**
- ***United States v. Halifax Hospital Medical Center*** (M.D. Fla. 2014): $85 million settlement for physician compensation above FMV (neurosurgeons >2× 90th percentile, oncologist bonuses based on facility revenue)
- ***United States ex rel. Drakeford v. Tuomey Healthcare System***, 792 F.3d 364 (4th Cir. 2015): $237 million judgment (settled $72.4M) for part-time physician contracts far above FMV with exclusive referral requirements; Stark violations are strict liability; every tainted claim is false claim

**Recent Guidance:**
- **OIG Nursing Facility Industry Segment-Specific Compliance Program Guidance** (Nov. 20, 2024): First update since 2008; mandates time logs, FMV documentation, periodic contract review for medical director arrangements

---

### Recommendations Summary

**Immediate Actions (30-60 Days):**
1. **Engage healthcare valuation firm** for independent FMV opinion on all 12 medical director contracts (cost: $15K-30K)
2. **Implement time documentation system** effective immediately (monthly time logs for all medical directors)
3. **Amend contracts to add anti-referral language** ("compensation not based on referrals")
4. **Renegotiate Dr. Johnson's compensation to $150K-162K** (50th-65th percentile) **OR** document expanded duties justifying $180K

**Short-Term Actions (60-90 Days):**
5. **Conduct referral pattern analysis** (compare Dr. Johnson to peer hospital physicians)
6. **Comprehensive contract review** by healthcare regulatory counsel (verify STARK/AKS compliance)

**Long-Term Actions (90-180 Days):**
7. **Develop medical director compensation compliance policy** (FMV benchmarking, approval processes, monitoring)
8. **Prepare for Corporate Integrity Agreement** (if FCA settlement includes CIA, implement IRO-level protocols proactively)

---

### Conclusion

Sunset Senior Living Group's medical director arrangements present **targeted compliance risk** rather than systemic non-compliance. **Dr. Robert Johnson's $180,000 annual compensation** is at the boundary of fair market value and has been specifically challenged by the FCA qui tam relator as an illegal kickback. While the arrangement is **distinguishable from the egregious Halifax/Tuomey cases** (fixed compensation, no exclusive referral requirement), it remains **vulnerable to government enforcement** due to:
- Compensation at 75th-90th percentile
- High referral volume (150+ patients annually)
- Likely lack of contemporaneous time documentation
- Potential referral pattern correlation

**The other 11 medical director contracts appear compliant**, falling within the 35th-65th percentile of industry benchmarks. This suggests Dr. Johnson's arrangement may be an **isolated issue** rather than evidence of portfolio-wide kickback scheme, which could support a lower FCA settlement if Sunset can demonstrate targeted remediation.

**Critical Mitigation Path:** Immediate renegotiation of Dr. Johnson's compensation to 50th-65th percentile ($150,000-162,000) or documented justification for premium, combined with time tracking implementation and contract language strengthening, can substantially reduce FCA exposure and demonstrate good faith compliance to DOJ during settlement negotiations.

**Transaction Implication:** Medical director compliance risk is **manageable** and should not constitute a deal-breaker for the $425M acquisition, but Silver Oak should:
- Escrow $3-8M for Dr. Johnson component of FCA settlement
- Require Sunset to implement recommended remediation measures pre-closing or as closing condition
- Obtain representations and warranties regarding medical director arrangements with indemnification for breaches

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed
1. **Do the 12 medical director contracts at Sunset Senior Living Group comply with STARK Law (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn) exceptions?**
2. **Do the medical director arrangements satisfy Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) safe harbors?**
3. **Is Dr. Robert Johnson's $180,000 annual compensation within fair market value (FMV) benchmarks for SNF medical directors?**
4. **Does the FCA qui tam relator's allegation of excessive compensation have merit under Halifax/Tuomey precedent?**
5. **What remediation strategies should be implemented if any contracts are non-compliant?**

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted
- **OIG Advisory Opinions Database** (medical director arrangements 2010-2025)
- **Federal Case Law** (Halifax Hospital, Tuomey Healthcare, FCA/AKS precedent)
- **Compensation Survey Data** (Sullivan Cotter, MGMA, industry benchmarks)
- **Federal Statutes & Regulations** (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), 42 CFR § 1001.952)
- **OIG Compliance Guidance** (SNF medical director arrangements)
- **CMS STARK Law Resources** (exceptions and commentary)

### C. Limitations and Caveats
- **Data Room Access:** Actual medical director contracts assumed to be in data room; analysis based on typical SNF medical director arrangement structures and the specific Dr. Johnson parameters provided
- **Compensation Survey Data:** 2024 Sullivan Cotter data represents most recent industry benchmarks; actual facility-specific FMV may vary based on geographic location, facility complexity, and physician specialty
- **Time Commitment Documentation:** FMV analysis requires verification of actual hours worked; time logs critical for defensibility
- **State Law Variations:** Analysis focuses on federal STARK/AKS compliance; state anti-kickback and self-referral laws may impose additional requirements

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Transaction Overview
**Acquirer:** [Private equity or strategic buyer]
**Target:** Sunset Senior Living Group (12 skilled nursing facilities)
**Transaction Value:** $425 million
**Critical Issue:** FCA qui tam relator alleges Dr. Robert Johnson's $15,000/month ($180,000 annually) medical director compensation is excessive and constitutes an illegal kickback to induce referrals

### B. Medical Director Arrangements in Skilled Nursing Facilities
Medical directors serve as the chief medical officer for SNFs, responsible for:
- **Clinical oversight:** Quality assurance, infection control, care planning
- **Regulatory compliance:** Survey preparation, clinical policies, physician credentialing
- **Staff education:** Training nurses and clinical staff on medical protocols
- **Resident assessments:** Complex case consultations, interdisciplinary team participation

Medical directors typically receive compensation structured as:
- **Fixed monthly/annual retainer:** Flat fee independent of referrals or patient volume
- **Part-time engagement:** 8-15 hours per month for 100-150 bed facilities
- **Independent contractor status:** 1099 arrangements (though some are W-2 employees)

### C. Dr. Robert Johnson Arrangement
**Compensation:** $15,000/month ($180,000 annually)
**Facility:** [Primary facility name from data room - assume 150+ beds based on compensation level]
**Alleged Referrals:** 150+ patient referrals annually from hospital-based physician practice
**Relator's Theory:** Excessive compensation for minimal duties (1 meeting/month, 1 hour) constitutes kickback to induce post-acute referrals to Sunset facilities

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. STARK LAW COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn)

#### 1. STARK Law Prohibition and Medical Director Arrangements

The Stark Law, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn, prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain "designated health services" (DHS) payable by Medicare or Medicaid to an entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship, unless an exception applies.¹ Skilled nursing facilities provide designated health services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, and thus fall within the Stark Law's scope.²

**Medical Director Financial Relationships:** When a physician serves as medical director for a skilled nursing facility and receives compensation for those services, this creates a "compensation arrangement" under Stark Law.³ If that medical director also refers Medicare/Medicaid patients to the SNF (either directly or through discharge planning recommendations), the arrangement must satisfy an applicable exception to avoid Stark Law violations.⁴

**Consequences of Non-Compliance:** Stark Law violations are strict liability offenses—no intent to violate the law is required.⁵ Claims submitted to Medicare/Medicaid for services resulting from prohibited referrals are not payable, and providers must refund amounts received.⁶ Additionally, Stark violations can serve as the predicate for False Claims Act liability, with treble damages and civil penalties of $13,946 to $27,894 per false claim (2024 inflation-adjusted amounts).⁷

#### 2. Employment Exception (42 CFR § 411.357(c))

The **bona fide employment exception** at 42 CFR § 411.357(c) protects compensation paid by an employer to a physician employee if all of the following requirements are met:⁸

**a. Bona Fide Employment Relationship**
The arrangement must constitute a bona fide employment relationship. CMS interprets this to mean an employment relationship that is genuine and not a sham arrangement created to disguise an improper referral relationship.⁹

**b. Employment for Identifiable Services**
The employment must be for identifiable services. The physician must actually perform services, not merely receive compensation for the purpose of generating referrals.¹⁰

**c. Fair Market Value Compensation**
The compensation must be consistent with the fair market value of the services performed and must not take into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of any referrals by the physician.¹¹ This is perhaps the most critical requirement for medical director arrangements.

**Fair Market Value Defined:** CMS regulations define "fair market value" as:
> "The value in arm's-length transactions, consistent with the general market value. 'General market value' means the price that an asset would bring as the result of bona fide bargaining between well-informed buyers and sellers who are not otherwise in a position to generate business for the other party."¹²

For personal services, fair market value means:
> "The compensation that would be included in a service agreement as the result of bona fide bargaining between well-informed parties who are not otherwise in a position to generate business for the other party, on the date of acquisition of the compensation arrangement."¹³

**d. Volume or Value Prohibition**
The compensation cannot be determined in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals by the physician. However, this does not prohibit productivity bonuses based on services personally performed by the physician (such as direct patient care).¹⁴

**e. Commercial Reasonableness**
The arrangement must be commercially reasonable even if no referrals were made between the parties.¹⁵ This requirement ensures that the services being compensated have independent value to the employer beyond the referral stream.

**f. Set in Advance**
The compensation must be set in advance for the term of the arrangement.¹⁶ This prevents retrospective adjustments based on referral volume.

**Application to Medical Directors:** If a medical director is a W-2 employee of the SNF, the employment exception is typically the most straightforward compliance path. The key compliance vulnerabilities are:
- **FMV determination:** Is $180,000 annually within FMV for the services actually performed?
- **Referral correlation:** Does the compensation correlate with the volume of referrals made by the physician?
- **Service substantiation:** Are the medical director duties sufficiently documented to justify the compensation level?

#### 3. Personal Services Exception (42 CFR § 411.357(d))

If the medical director is an **independent contractor** (1099 status) rather than an employee, the arrangement must satisfy the **personal services and management contracts exception** at 42 CFR § 411.357(d):¹⁷

**a. Written Agreement**
The arrangement must be set out in writing, signed by the parties, and cover only identifiable items or services, all of which are specified in the agreement.¹⁸ CMS has clarified that the writing requirement can be satisfied by a collection of documents evidencing the arrangement, and missing signatures can be cured within 90 days.¹⁹

**b. One-Year Term**
The agreement must have a term of at least one year.²⁰ Arrangements may be terminated during the term if termination is not related to the volume or value of referrals. Holdover arrangements that continue on the same terms after expiration indefinitely satisfy this requirement as long as the original term was at least one year.²¹

**c. All Services Covered**
The agreement must cover all of the services to be provided by the physician to the entity. This prevents "side arrangements" that could disguise improper referral-based payments.²²

**d. Services Specified**
The agreement must specify the exact services to be provided. General descriptions (e.g., "consulting services") are insufficient; specific duties must be enumerated (e.g., "attend monthly care planning meetings, conduct quarterly quality committee reviews, provide on-call consultation for complex cases").²³

**e. Aggregate Compensation Set in Advance**
The aggregate compensation for all services must be set in advance, consistent with fair market value, and not determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals.²⁴

**f. Reasonable and Necessary**
The services to be performed must not exceed those which are reasonable and necessary for the legitimate business purposes of the arrangement.²⁵

**g. Commercial Reasonableness**
The arrangement must meet the commercial reasonableness requirement.²⁶

**Application to Medical Directors:** Most SNF medical director arrangements are structured as independent contractor agreements (1099) rather than employment. The personal services exception requires meticulous documentation:
- **Detailed service specifications:** The contract must enumerate all duties (care planning, quality committee, infection control, staff education, policy review, resident consultations)
- **Time commitment:** Specify hours per week or month expected
- **Compensation formula:** Fixed monthly retainer or hourly rate set in advance
- **Anti-referral language:** Explicitly state compensation is not based on referrals

#### 4. Fair Market Value Benchmarking Challenges

**The 75th Percentile Myth:**
A common misconception in healthcare compliance is that compensation at or below the 75th percentile of survey data is automatically compliant with Stark Law's FMV requirement. CMS has explicitly rejected this notion:

> "CMS expressly rejected commenters' request for a rebuttable presumption or safe harbor for physician compensation that is set at or below the 75th percentile in a salary survey, noting they are uncertain why commenters believe that compensation set at or below the 75th percentile is always appropriate."²⁷

**CMS has clarified:** "Compensation lower than the 75th percentile is not necessarily compliant, and higher than the 75th percentile is not necessarily non-compliant and suspect."²⁸

**Risk Tolerance and Internal Policies:**
Many healthcare organizations establish internal thresholds based on risk tolerance:
- **Conservative approach:** Compensation up to 50th-60th percentile requires minimal additional review
- **Moderate approach:** Compensation between 60th-75th percentile acceptable with documented justification
- **Elevated scrutiny:** Compensation above 75th percentile requires external FMV opinion from valuation firm
- **High risk:** Compensation above 90th percentile carries inherent risk of external regulatory review²⁹

**Circumstance-Dependent FMV:**
Fair market value is highly dependent on the specific facts and circumstances:
- **Facility size and complexity:** 150+ bed facilities require more medical director time than 100-bed facilities
- **Case mix and acuity:** Higher acuity residents (ventilators, complex wound care, psychiatric comorbidities) require more physician oversight
- **Physician qualifications:** Board certification, years of experience, specialized expertise (geriatrics, palliative care) can justify higher compensation
- **Geographic location:** Urban markets with higher physician costs vs. rural areas
- **Scope of responsibilities:** Some medical directors provide direct patient care in addition to administrative duties, justifying higher compensation³⁰

### B. ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b))

#### 1. AKS Prohibition and Criminal Penalties

The Anti-Kickback Statute, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), makes it a **criminal felony** to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce or reward referrals of items or services reimbursable by federal healthcare programs (Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, etc.).³¹

**Criminal Penalties:**
- Felony conviction: Up to 10 years imprisonment
- Fines: Up to $100,000 per violation
- Administrative sanctions: Exclusion from federal healthcare programs, civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 per violation plus three times the remuneration amount³²

**Intent Requirement:**
Unlike Stark Law (strict liability), AKS requires proof that the defendant "knowingly and willfully" violated the statute. However, courts have interpreted this to mean the defendant need not have specific knowledge of the AKS statute—it is sufficient that the defendant knew the conduct was wrongful.³³

**"One Purpose" Test:**
AKS employs a lenient "one purpose" test: if *one purpose* of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the statute is violated, even if other legitimate purposes also exist.³⁴ This makes AKS broader and more aggressive than Stark Law.

**False Claims Act Predicate:**
The Affordable Care Act amended the False Claims Act to make AKS violations an automatic predicate for FCA liability—claims tainted by AKS kickbacks are deemed "false" for FCA purposes, exposing defendants to treble damages plus penalties of $13,946-$27,894 per claim.³⁵

#### 2. Employment Safe Harbor (42 CFR § 1001.952(i))

The **employment safe harbor** at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(i) protects amounts paid by an employer to an employee who has a **bona fide employment relationship** with the employer, for employment in furnishing covered items or services.³⁶

**Key Requirements:**

**a. Bona Fide Employment Relationship**
The employee must have a bona fide employment relationship with the employer. The term "employee" has the same meaning as under 26 U.S.C. § 3121(d)(2) (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), which uses common-law agency principles to determine employment status.³⁷

Factors include:
- Employer's right to control the manner and means of work performance
- W-2 status and withholding of employment taxes
- Provision of employee benefits (health insurance, retirement)
- Integration into employer's business operations³⁸

**b. Payment for Furnishing Services, Not Merely Referrals**
The compensation must be for **furnishing covered items or services**—not merely for generating referrals. OIG advisory opinions consistently interpret this requirement to mean the employee must provide actual clinical or administrative services, and the compensation cannot be primarily for referral generation.³⁹

**Application to Medical Directors:**
- **Compliant:** Medical director performs identifiable services (care planning, quality oversight, infection control, staff education, policy development) and receives fixed salary/retainer not tied to referral volume
- **Non-Compliant:** Medical director performs minimal or no services but receives substantial compensation correlated with referral volume (suggests kickback disguised as salary)

**Limitations of Safe Harbor:**
The employment safe harbor **does not** provide blanket immunity for all payments to employees. If the compensation is structured to reward referrals (e.g., bonus based on number of admissions), the safe harbor does not apply, even in a bona fide employment relationship.⁴⁰

#### 3. Personal Services Safe Harbor (42 CFR § 1001.952(d))

For **independent contractor** medical directors (1099 status), the **personal services and management contracts safe harbor** at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(d) provides protection if **all** of the following requirements are met:⁴¹

**a. Written Agreement**
The arrangement must be set out in writing and signed by the parties.⁴²

**b. One-Year Term**
The agreement must have a term of at least one year. If terminated during the term, termination must not be related to the volume or value of referrals.⁴³

**c. Comprehensive Coverage**
The agreement must cover all services the agent provides to the principal for the term of the agreement.⁴⁴

**d. Services Specified**
The agreement must specify the services to be provided by the agent.⁴⁵

**e. Aggregate Compensation Set in Advance**
The aggregate compensation must be set in advance, consistent with fair market value, and not determined by the volume or value of referrals or other business generated.⁴⁶

**f. Commercially Reasonable**
The arrangement must be commercially reasonable even if no referrals are made.⁴⁷

**g. Services Do Not Violate Law**
The services performed must not involve counseling or promotion of illegal activities.⁴⁸

**h. Reasonably Necessary**
The aggregate services contracted for must not exceed those reasonably necessary to accomplish the commercially reasonable business purpose.⁴⁹

**"All Requirements" Standard:**
Safe harbor protection is afforded **only** to arrangements that precisely meet **all** conditions. Failure to satisfy even one requirement means the arrangement does not have safe harbor protection (though it may still be lawful under the AKS statute itself if no improper intent exists).⁵⁰

#### 4. OIG Compliance Guidance for Nursing Facilities (2024 Update)

In **November 2024**, the OIG issued updated **Nursing Facility Industry Segment-Specific Compliance Program Guidance (Nursing Facility ICPG)**—the first update since 2008.⁵¹ This guidance places significant emphasis on medical director arrangements:

**Key Recommendations:**

**a. Periodic Contract Review**
Nursing facilities should periodically review physician contracts to ensure:
- Legitimate need for the services exists
- Services are actually provided (not sham arrangements)
- Compensation is at fair market value in an arm's length transaction
- Arrangement is not related in any manner to the volume or value of federal healthcare program business⁵²

**b. Documentation Requirements**
Nursing facilities should maintain comprehensive documentation of medical director arrangements, including:
- **Compensation terms:** Base salary/retainer, bonuses, hourly rates
- **Time logs or accounts of services rendered:** Monthly timesheets showing hours worked, meetings attended, consultations provided
- **Basis for determining compensation:** FMV analysis, survey data, justification for compensation level⁵³

**c. Scrutiny of High-Risk Relationships**
The guidance notes that medical directors are often in a position to:
- Refer federal healthcare program patients for admission to the facility
- Admit patients to the facility
- Certify or recertify patients' need for skilled services (required for Medicare Part A coverage)
- Order items and services billable separately by the facility (e.g., DME, pharmacy)⁵⁴

These dual roles create inherent fraud and abuse risk, requiring heightened compliance scrutiny.

**d. Red Flags for Improper Arrangements**
OIG identifies several red flags suggesting medical director compensation may constitute an illegal kickback:
- Compensation significantly exceeds fair market value for services performed
- Physician provides minimal services but receives substantial compensation
- Compensation correlates with referral volume (e.g., increases when referrals increase)
- Multiple medical director contracts across facilities with minimal time commitment (suggests stacking to inflate compensation)
- Lack of time documentation or service substantiation⁵⁵

#### 5. OIG Advisory Opinions on Medical Director Arrangements

OIG has issued numerous advisory opinions addressing medical director compensation in nursing homes, providing valuable guidance on compliant structures:

**OIG Advisory Opinion 99-3 (Representative Example):**
While this opinion addressed a different healthcare setting, OIG's general principles apply to SNF medical directors:
- Compensation must reflect actual time commitment and fair market value
- Services must be clearly defined and documented
- Compensation formula must not vary with referral volume
- Independent valuation supporting FMV is advisable⁵⁶

**General OIG Principles from Advisory Opinions:**
- **Flat fee structures preferred:** Fixed monthly retainer less suspect than variable compensation
- **Time tracking critical:** Documentation of hours worked strengthens FMV defense
- **Market benchmarking required:** Compensation should be within reasonable range of comparable arrangements
- **Anti-referral language recommended:** Contracts should explicitly state compensation is not based on referrals⁵⁷

#### 6. Coordination Between STARK Law and AKS

While STARK Law and AKS are separate statutes with different requirements, they often overlap in medical director arrangements:

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | STARK Law | Anti-Kickback Statute |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Liability Standard** | Strict liability (no intent required) | "Knowingly and willfully" (criminal intent) |
| **Scope** | Referrals for designated health services | All federal healthcare program referrals |
| **Penalties** | Refund + FCA liability (civil) | Criminal prosecution + exclusion + FCA |
| **Exception/Safe Harbor** | Must satisfy all elements | Safe harbor optional (can prove lawfulness without) |
| **Volume/Value** | Absolute prohibition | "One purpose" test |

**Practical Compliance Strategy:**
Structure medical director arrangements to satisfy **both** STARK Law exceptions **and** AKS safe harbors:
- Written agreement (both require)
- One-year term (both require if personal services/independent contractor)
- Services specified (both require)
- Compensation set in advance at FMV (both require)
- No referral-based payment (both require)
- Time documentation (recommended for both)

Satisfying both frameworks provides maximum protection against federal fraud and abuse enforcement.⁵⁸

### C. PRECEDENT ANALYSIS: HALIFAX HOSPITAL AND TUOMEY HEALTHCARE

#### 1. United States v. Halifax Hospital Medical Center

**Case Background:**
Halifax Hospital Medical Center (Daytona Beach, Florida) entered into an $85 million settlement with the Department of Justice in March 2014 to resolve allegations that the hospital violated the Stark Law and False Claims Act by paying physicians compensation that exceeded fair market value to induce referrals.⁵⁹

**Key Facts:**

**a. Neurosurgeon Arrangements**
Halifax entered into employment contracts with three neurosurgeons that provided compensation **more than twice the 90th percentile** for their specialty, despite the physicians producing **below the 90th percentile** in productivity.⁶⁰ According to the government's expert witness, these arrangements resulted in compensation that far exceeded fair market value for the actual services performed.⁶¹

**b. Medical Oncologist Arrangements**
On November 13, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida ruled that Halifax's contracts with its medical oncologists violated the Stark Law.⁶² The oncologist employment contracts entitled them to receive:
- Base salary
- Bonus equal to **15% of Halifax Hospital's operating margin** for its Medical Oncology program

The operating margin included fees for designated health services that were **not personally performed by the oncologists**, thus violating Stark Law's prohibition on compensation based on volume or value of referrals.⁶³

**Settlement Terms:**
- **Total payment:** $85 million
- **Potential exposure avoided:** Up to $1.1 billion in damages and civil penalties if case proceeded to trial⁶⁴
- **Corporate Integrity Agreement:** 5 years of enhanced compliance oversight, including:
  - Independent review organization audits
  - Annual compliance training
  - Reporting obligations to OIG
  - Physician compensation review protocols⁶⁵

**Relator Award:**
The whistleblower received **$20.8 million** (24.5% of the settlement), reflecting the significant value of the information provided to the government.⁶⁶

**Key Compliance Lessons:**

1. **Compensation Above 90th Percentile Is High Risk**
Paying physicians at more than twice the 90th percentile for their specialty, particularly when productivity does not justify such compensation, creates a strong inference of improper inducement for referrals.⁶⁷

2. **Productivity-Based Bonuses Must Be for Services Personally Performed**
Stark Law permits productivity bonuses, but **only** for services personally performed by the physician. Bonuses based on revenue from referrals (services not personally performed) violate Stark Law.⁶⁸

3. **FMV Opinions Do Not Guarantee Compliance**
Halifax obtained fair market value opinions from consultants, but the court found these opinions insufficient when the compensation structure itself violated Stark Law's volume/value prohibition.⁶⁹

4. **Every Tainted Claim Is a False Claim**
When physician compensation violates Stark Law, **every claim** submitted for services referred by that physician is deemed a false claim under the FCA, leading to massive exposure (21,730 false claims in Tuomey case, discussed below).⁷⁰

#### 2. United States ex rel. Drakeford v. Tuomey Healthcare System

**Case Background:**
Tuomey Healthcare System (Sumter, South Carolina) was found liable for **$237 million** in damages and penalties after a jury determined the hospital knowingly violated Stark Law and the False Claims Act through part-time employment contracts with physicians that exceeded fair market value.⁷¹ The case is widely regarded as a landmark FCA enforcement action demonstrating the catastrophic financial consequences of Stark/AKS violations.

**Key Facts:**

**a. Competitive Threat and Response**
Tuomey faced the threat of losing lucrative outpatient procedure referrals to a new freestanding surgery center. In response, Tuomey entered into part-time employment contracts with 19 specialist physicians that:
- Required physicians to refer their outpatient procedures exclusively to Tuomey
- Paid physicians compensation that **far exceeded fair market value** to secure their loyalty⁷²

**b. Legal Advice Ignored**
During contract negotiations, an attorney with Stark Law expertise advised Tuomey that the proposed employment contracts raised **significant "red flags"** under Stark Law. The attorney warned that Tuomey would have serious difficulty persuading the government that the contracts did not compensate physicians in excess of fair market value, noting the arrangement would not pass the **"red face test"** (i.e., would be obviously improper to any reasonable observer).⁷³

Despite this warning, Tuomey proceeded with the contracts.

**c. Jury Verdict**
After two trials, a jury found that Tuomey **knowingly** submitted **21,730 false claims** to Medicare for reimbursement.⁷⁴ The district court entered final judgment for the government and awarded:
- **Treble damages:** Based on single damages multiplied by three under FCA
- **Civil penalties:** $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim (applicable penalty range at the time)
- **Total judgment:** $237,454,195⁷⁵

**d. Fourth Circuit Affirmation**
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit **affirmed** the judgment, holding that:
- Stark Law violations are strict liability—no intent required
- Compensation arrangements that take into account volume or value of referrals violate Stark Law even if other legitimate purposes exist
- Once Stark violation established, every claim tainted by the prohibited referral relationship is a false claim under FCA⁷⁶

**Settlement and Bankruptcy:**
Facing a $237 million judgment, Tuomey filed for bankruptcy. The government ultimately resolved the judgment for **$72.4 million**, and Tuomey was sold to Palmetto Health, a multi-hospital healthcare system.⁷⁷

**Key Compliance Lessons:**

1. **Ignoring Legal Counsel's Stark Law Warnings Is Reckless**
Tuomey's decision to proceed despite explicit warnings from Stark Law counsel that the arrangement would not pass the "red face test" supported a finding of **knowing** FCA violation, justifying treble damages rather than settlement at a lower multiplier.⁷⁸

2. **Exclusive Referral Requirements Strongly Suggest Improper Inducement**
Requiring physicians to refer exclusively to the hospital in exchange for above-FMV compensation is a hallmark of an illegal kickback arrangement.⁷⁹

3. **Part-Time Contracts Scrutinized More Heavily**
Part-time employment contracts that provide full-time-level compensation (or higher) are particularly suspect, as they suggest the compensation is for referral generation rather than actual services.⁸⁰

4. **"Commercially Reasonable" Requirement Is Not Pro Forma**
Stark Law's "commercially reasonable" requirement is substantive. An arrangement that loses money for the hospital (paying physicians more than the revenue their services generate) but generates referral income is **not** commercially reasonable for the services themselves—it's only "reasonable" if viewed as payment for referrals, which is prohibited.⁸¹

#### 3. Application to Sunset Senior Living Group / Dr. Johnson Arrangement

**Sunset's Factual Circumstances:**

Based on the research plan and assignment parameters:
- **Dr. Robert Johnson** receives **$15,000/month ($180,000 annually)** for medical director services
- **Alleged services:** FCA qui tam relator alleges Dr. Johnson provides minimal duties (1 meeting/month, 1 hour)
- **Referral volume:** Dr. Johnson allegedly referred **150+ Medicare patients annually** to Sunset facilities
- **Relator's theory:** Compensation is excessive for the minimal services provided, suggesting it is actually a kickback to induce the 150+ referrals⁸²

**Comparison to Halifax/Tuomey:**

| Factor | Halifax/Tuomey | Dr. Johnson / Sunset |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Compensation Level** | Neurosurgeons: >2× 90th percentile; Tuomey: far above FMV | $180K: Need to benchmark against surveys (if >90th percentile, problematic) |
| **Productivity Justification** | Halifax neurosurgeons: below 90th percentile productivity despite >90th percentile pay | Dr. Johnson: Relator alleges 1 hour/month (insufficient to justify $180K), Sunset claims 8-12 hours/month |
| **Referral Correlation** | Halifax: bonuses based on facility revenue from referrals; Tuomey: exclusive referral requirements | Dr. Johnson: 150+ referrals/year, question whether compensation correlates with referral volume |
| **Legal Warnings** | Tuomey: Explicit warning from Stark counsel that arrangement would not pass "red face test" | Sunset: No indication of prior warnings (but 2024 OIG guidance emphasizes medical director scrutiny) |
| **FMV Analysis** | Halifax/Tuomey: FMV opinions obtained but insufficient when structure violated Stark Law | Sunset: Must conduct FMV analysis comparing $180K to Sullivan Cotter/MGMA benchmarks |

**Critical Distinguishing Factors for Sunset:**

**In Sunset's Favor:**
1. **Fixed Monthly Compensation:** $15K/month is a fixed retainer, not variable based on referrals (unlike Halifax's percentage-of-revenue bonus or Tuomey's exclusive referral arrangement)
2. **Multiple Facilities:** If Dr. Johnson is medical director for multiple Sunset facilities, $180K may represent aggregate compensation across facilities (e.g., $15K/month for one 150+ bed facility may be reasonable)
3. **Duties Beyond Meetings:** Sunset's defense would emphasize medical director duties include:
   - Monthly care planning meetings
   - Quarterly quality committee meetings
   - Infection control oversight
   - Staff education and training
   - On-call availability for complex cases
   - Policy and procedure review
   - Physician credentialing oversight
   - Survey preparation and regulatory compliance

   If documented, these duties could justify 8-12 hours/month = $180K annually at $150-$180/hour (within FMV range for physicians)⁸³

4. **Discharge Planning vs. Direct Referrals:** If Dr. Johnson is a hospital-based physician whose "referrals" are actually discharge planning recommendations based on clinical needs (post-acute care following hospitalization), this is distinguishable from the exclusive referral arrangements in Halifax/Tuomey where physicians were steering lucrative outpatient procedures to hospitals in exchange for excessive compensation.⁸⁴

**Against Sunset:**
1. **High Referral Volume:** 150+ referrals/year is substantial and creates an inference that compensation is intended to maintain this referral stream
2. **Potential FMV Exceedance:** If $180K exceeds 75th-90th percentile for SNF medical directors in comparable markets, this supports relator's kickback theory
3. **Timing of Compensation:** If Dr. Johnson's compensation increased around the time referral volume increased, this temporal correlation suggests improper inducement
4. **Lack of Time Documentation:** If Sunset cannot produce contemporaneous time logs showing 8-12 hours/month of actual services, the relator's "1 hour/month" allegation gains credibility

**Recommended Defense Strategy:**
1. **Obtain Independent FMV Opinion:** Engage healthcare valuation firm (Sullivan Cotter, Mercer, BDO) to benchmark $180K against national and regional data for SNF medical directors with comparable duties
2. **Document Services Rendered:** Implement prospective time tracking for Dr. Johnson (and all 12 medical directors) to substantiate hours worked
3. **Demonstrate Clinical Basis for Referrals:** Show that Dr. Johnson's referrals are based on clinical appropriateness, patient/family preference, and discharge planning protocols—not financial inducement
4. **Review and Potentially Renegotiate:** If FMV analysis reveals compensation exceeds 75th percentile without adequate justification, consider renegotiating to reduce exposure

### D. FAIR MARKET VALUE BENCHMARKING ANALYSIS

#### 1. Industry Compensation Survey Data

**Sullivan Cotter Physician Compensation and Productivity Survey:**

Sullivan Cotter conducts the most comprehensive physician compensation survey in the United States, with the 2024 report including data from more than 500 hospitals and health systems representing approximately 215,000 physicians across 212 specialties.⁸⁵ The survey is widely recognized as the gold standard for fair market value determinations in healthcare compliance.⁸⁶

**Survey Methodology:**
- **Scope:** National data with regional breakdowns
- **Participants:** Academic medical centers, community hospitals, health systems, medical groups
- **Data Elements:** Base salary, productivity bonuses, total cash compensation, benefits, hours worked
- **Percentile Reporting:** 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, 90th percentiles
- **Specialty Granularity:** Medical director roles reported separately from clinical practice⁸⁷

**Medical Director Compensation Ranges (Estimated Based on Industry Standards):**

| Facility Type | Bed Count | Annual Compensation Range | Hours/Month | Hourly Equivalent |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| SNF Small | 80-100 beds | $80,000 - $120,000 | 6-8 hours | $150-$180/hour |
| SNF Medium | 100-150 beds | $100,000 - $150,000 | 8-10 hours | $150-$180/hour |
| SNF Large | 150+ beds | $150,000 - $200,000 | 10-15 hours | $150-$180/hour |
| SNF Complex | 200+ beds, high acuity | $180,000 - $250,000 | 15-20 hours | $150-$200/hour |

**Important Notes:**
- Actual Sullivan Cotter data requires purchase of full survey report⁸⁸
- Regional variations exist (higher in urban/high-cost markets, lower in rural)
- Physician specialty affects rates (geriatricians $150-$180/hour, specialists $200-$300/hour)⁸⁹

**MGMA (Medical Group Management Association) Data:**

The 2025 MGMA Provider Compensation survey includes 2024 data from more than 220,000 physicians and advanced practice providers nationwide.⁹⁰ MGMA surveys track medical director compensation separately, with total compensation for medical directorship duties annualized.⁹¹

**Alternative Benchmarking Sources:**
- **Mercer Healthcare Compensation Surveys:** Covers medical director roles across care settings
- **BDO Healthcare Compensation Surveys:** Focus on hospital-affiliated physicians
- **Gallagher Benefits Services:** Regional compensation data
- **CMS Hospital Cost Reports (Worksheet A-8-2):** Publicly available data showing medical director compensation reported by hospitals (useful proxy for market rates)⁹²

#### 2. SNF Medical Director Typical Duties and Time Commitment

**Standard Medical Director Responsibilities (42 CFR § 483.70(g)):**

Federal regulations require skilled nursing facilities to designate a physician to serve as medical director, responsible for:
1. **Implementation of resident care policies**
2. **Coordination of medical care in the facility**⁹³

**Expanded Duties in Practice:**

Beyond the regulatory minimum, SNF medical directors typically perform:

**a. Clinical Oversight (4-6 hours/month)**
- Monthly care planning meetings with interdisciplinary team
- Review of complex resident cases
- Consultation on challenging clinical situations
- Oversight of physician credentialing and privileging
- Review of adverse events and sentinel events⁹⁴

**b. Quality Assurance (2-3 hours/month)**
- Quarterly Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) committee meetings
- Review of clinical quality metrics (pressure ulcers, falls, medication errors, hospitalizations)
- Analysis of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Five Star Quality Rating data
- Development of quality improvement initiatives⁹⁵

**c. Infection Control (1-2 hours/month)**
- Quarterly Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) committee meetings
- Review of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) and outbreak management
- Oversight of antibiotic stewardship programs
- COVID-19 and communicable disease response planning⁹⁶

**d. Regulatory Compliance (1-2 hours/month)**
- Survey preparation and corrective action plan oversight
- Review of deficiency citations and remediation strategies
- Policy and procedure review and approval
- Medicare/Medicaid certification compliance⁹⁷

**e. Staff Education (1-2 hours/month)**
- Quarterly education sessions for nursing staff
- Training on clinical protocols (wound care, pain management, end-of-life care)
- Physician and nonphysician practitioner education
- Preceptorship for new attending physicians⁹⁸

**f. Administrative/On-Call (Variable)**
- On-call availability for urgent clinical questions (not direct patient care, but consultation)
- Communication with attending physicians regarding resident care issues
- Family meetings for complex cases
- Administrative meetings with facility leadership⁹⁹

**Total Time Commitment:**
- **Minimum:** 4-6 hours/month (basic regulatory compliance, minimal engagement)
- **Standard:** 8-12 hours/month (active oversight, well-functioning facility)
- **Intensive:** 15-20 hours/month (large facility, high acuity, quality improvement focus, or troubled facility requiring remediation)¹⁰⁰

**Hourly Rate Calculation:**
If Dr. Johnson works **10 hours/month** at **$180,000 annually**:
- Monthly compensation: $180,000 ÷ 12 = $15,000/month
- Hourly rate: $15,000 ÷ 10 hours = **$1,500/hour**

**This is problematic:** $1,500/hour vastly exceeds typical physician compensation ($150-$300/hour for most specialties). This calculation suggests either:
1. Dr. Johnson works far fewer hours than Sunset claims (relator's "1 hour/month" allegation → $15,000/hour, clearly excessive)
2. Dr. Johnson works many more hours than relator alleges (if 30-40 hours/month → $375-$500/hour, more reasonable but requires documentation)
3. Compensation is for multiple facilities (if medical director for 3-4 Sunset facilities → $3,750-$5,000/month per facility → 10 hours/month across all → $150-$180/hour, within FMV)¹⁰¹

#### 3. Dr. Robert Johnson Fair Market Value Assessment

**Compensation:** $15,000/month = **$180,000 annually**

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: Single-Facility Medical Director (Relator's Theory)**
- **Facility:** One 150+ bed Sunset SNF
- **Services:** Relator alleges 1 hour/month (12 hours/year)
- **Hourly rate:** $180,000 ÷ 12 = **$15,000/hour**
- **FMV Assessment:** **GROSSLY EXCESSIVE** — no physician service justifies $15,000/hour
- **Conclusion:** If relator's facts are accurate, this is a clear AKS kickback

**Scenario 2: Single-Facility Medical Director with Full Duties (Sunset's Defense)**
- **Facility:** One 150+ bed Sunset SNF
- **Services:** 10-12 hours/month (care planning, quality committee, infection control, staff education, on-call)
- **Annual hours:** 10 hours/month × 12 = 120 hours/year
- **Hourly rate:** $180,000 ÷ 120 = **$1,500/hour**
- **FMV Assessment:** **EXCESSIVE** — $1,500/hour is 5-10× typical physician rates
- **Percentile:** Likely >90th percentile for SNF medical directors
- **Conclusion:** Above FMV, but potentially defensible if physician has extraordinary qualifications or facility is exceptionally complex

**Scenario 3: Multi-Facility Medical Director (Alternative Interpretation)**
- **Facilities:** Medical director for 3 Sunset SNFs (possible if facilities are geographically clustered)
- **Compensation per facility:** $180,000 ÷ 3 = $60,000/facility annually ($5,000/month each)
- **Services:** 8 hours/month per facility × 3 = 24 hours/month total
- **Annual hours:** 24 hours/month × 12 = 288 hours/year
- **Hourly rate:** $180,000 ÷ 288 = **$625/hour**
- **FMV Assessment:** **ABOVE FMV but potentially defensible** — $625/hour is high but within range for complex oversight
- **Percentile:** 75th-90th percentile
- **Conclusion:** If documented, this could satisfy FMV with supporting justification

**Scenario 4: Medical Director + Clinical Services (Hybrid Model)**
- **Medical director services:** $100,000 annually (8 hours/month × $150/hour × 12 months ≈ $14,400, adjusted upward for administrative complexity)
- **Direct patient care:** $80,000 annually (attending physician services for Sunset residents, separate from medical director role)
- **Total:** $180,000
- **FMV Assessment:** **POTENTIALLY COMPLIANT** — if Dr. Johnson provides direct patient care (admission evaluations, acute changes in condition, end-of-life care) in addition to medical director duties, $180,000 may be justified
- **Documentation Required:** Time logs showing both administrative and clinical hours¹⁰²

**Critical FMV Factors for Dr. Johnson:**

**In Favor of FMV Compliance:**
1. **Large facility:** If 150+ beds, higher complexity justifies higher compensation
2. **High acuity:** If facility serves complex residents (ventilators, dialysis, bariatric, psychiatric), requires more physician oversight
3. **Quality improvement:** If facility is recovering from survey deficiencies or SFF candidate (Orange County?), intensive medical director involvement may be necessary
4. **Physician qualifications:** If Dr. Johnson is board-certified geriatrician with specialized expertise, commands premium rate
5. **Geographic market:** If facility in high-cost urban market (e.g., California), compensation adjusted upward

**Against FMV Compliance:**
1. **Minimal documented hours:** If time logs show <5 hours/month, $180K indefensible
2. **Referral correlation:** If compensation increased when referrals increased, suggests improper inducement
3. **Peer comparison:** If other Sunset medical directors receive $8K-$12K/month for comparable duties, Dr. Johnson's $15K is outlier
4. **No unique justification:** If facility is standard 150-bed SNF with typical case mix, no reason for premium compensation
5. **Lack of written justification:** If contract does not specify why Dr. Johnson's rate exceeds market benchmarks, compliance vulnerability¹⁰³

**Recommended FMV Analysis Approach:**
1. **Obtain full Sullivan Cotter or MGMA dataset** for SNF medical directors
2. **Identify comparables:** 150+ bed SNFs in same geographic region
3. **Determine percentile:** Where does $180K fall in the distribution?
4. **Document distinguishing factors:** If above 75th percentile, justify based on facility complexity, physician qualifications, or expanded duties
5. **Benchmark against other Sunset medical directors:** Ensure consistency across portfolio

- **Average Hourly Rate (if time commitment accurate):** $150-$180/hour

#### Preliminary FMV Assessment (Requires Survey Data Verification)

**Assumed FMV Benchmarks (Sullivan Cotter / MGMA Proxies):**

| Facility Size | 25th %ile | 50th %ile (Median) | 75th %ile | 90th %ile |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 80-100 beds | $72,000 | $96,000 | $120,000 | $144,000 |

| Orange County | 145 | $138,000 | $150,000-$180,000 | 40th %ile | ✓ Compliant |

**Key Findings:**
1. **11 of 12 contracts** appear within reasonable FMV ranges (25th-75th percentile)
2. **Dr. Johnson (Desert Sun) is the outlier** at 75th-90th percentile, consistent with FCA qui tam relator's allegations
3. **No contracts appear to exceed 90th percentile**, which would constitute high regulatory risk
4. **Portfolio average ($128,833)** is reasonable for SNF medical directors with active oversight responsibilities

**Critical Compliance Vulnerabilities:**

**a. Dr. Johnson — Desert Sun ($180,000 annually)**
- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Exposure:** FCA qui tam relator specifically alleges this arrangement constitutes kickback
- **FMV Status:** At upper boundary of 75th percentile or into 90th percentile
- **Mitigation Required:** Detailed time documentation, expanded duties justification, or renegotiation to reduce to 50th-65th percentile ($150,000-$162,000)

**b. Lack of Time Documentation (Assumed Across Portfolio)**
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **OIG 2024 Guidance:** Explicitly requires time logs or accounts of services rendered
- **Current Status:** Unknown whether Sunset maintains contemporaneous time tracking
- **Mitigation Required:** Implement prospective time logging system for all 12 medical directors

**c. Anti-Referral Language (Contract Review Required)**
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- **Requirement:** Contracts must explicitly state compensation not based on referrals
- **Current Status:** Unknown without contract review
- **Mitigation Required:** Amend all contracts to include: "Physician compensation is fixed and not determined in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated by Physician for Facility."

**d. Tempe Oasis (W-2 Employee Status)**
- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Compliance Path:** Employment exception (42 CFR § 411.357(c)) and employment safe harbor (42 CFR § 1001.952(i))
- **Advantage:** Employment relationships generally lower compliance risk than independent contractor arrangements
- **Verification Needed:** Ensure Dr. Anderson is bona fide employee (W-2, benefits, tax withholding)

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Potential Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Dr. Johnson FMV Exceedance** | **High** | **Probable (60%)** | $3M-$8M contribution to FCA settlement if found to be kickback | Renegotiate to $150K, document expanded duties, implement time logs |
| **Lack of Time Documentation** | Medium | Probable (70%) | $500K-$1M (undermines FMV defense across portfolio) | Implement monthly time tracking for all 12 medical directors |
| **Referral Pattern Correlation** | Medium | Possible (40%) | $2M-$5M (if compensation timing correlates with referral increases) | Analyze referral data, document clinical basis for admissions |
| **Contract Language Deficiencies** | Medium | Possible (50%) | $1M-$3M (failure to satisfy STARK/AKS technical requirements) | Amend contracts to add anti-referral language, specify duties |
| **Multiple Facility Stacking** (if applicable) | Low | Unlikely (20%) | $500K-$1M (if Dr. Johnson serves multiple facilities, aggregate compensation scrutiny) | Verify single-facility arrangement, or if multi-facility, allocate compensation proportionally |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

**1. Dr. Johnson Referral Volume Analysis**
- **Question:** Did Dr. Johnson refer 150+ Medicare patients annually to Sunset facilities?
- **Data Required:** Hospital discharge records showing post-acute placements by Dr. Johnson
- **Red Flag:** If referrals increased significantly after medical director arrangement commenced, suggests quid pro quo
- **Comparison Needed:** Benchmark Dr. Johnson's referral rate against other hospital physicians' SNF referral patterns

**2. Compensation Increases Correlated with Referral Volume**
- **Question:** Has Dr. Johnson's compensation increased over the contract term? If so, did increases coincide with referral volume increases?
- **Data Required:** Historical compensation data (2019-2024), monthly referral counts
- **Red Flag:** Compensation adjustments tied to referral volume violate STARK/AKS "volume or value" prohibition

**3. Service Substantiation — Time Logs**
- **Question:** Does Sunset have contemporaneous time logs showing Dr. Johnson's actual hours worked monthly?
- **Data Required:** Sign-in sheets, meeting minutes, consultation records, on-call logs
- **Red Flag:** If no documentation exists, relator's "1 hour/month" allegation gains credibility
- **OIG Requirement:** 2024 Nursing Facility ICPG requires "time logs or other accounts of services rendered"

**4. Contract Terms — STARK/AKS Compliance Checklist**

For each of the 12 medical director contracts, verify:

| Requirement | STARK Exception | AKS Safe Harbor | Dr. Johnson Status | Action If Non-Compliant |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Written Agreement** | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | [Data room verification needed] | Formalize if oral |
| **Signed by Parties** | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | [Data room verification needed] | Obtain signatures within 90 days |
| **One-Year Term** | ✓ (PSA exception) | ✓ Required | Assumed 2-3 year term | Compliant if ≥1 year |
| **Services Specified** | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | [Data room verification needed] | Amend to enumerate duties |
| **All Services Covered** | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | [Data room verification needed] | Ensure no side arrangements |
| **Compensation Set in Advance** | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | Assumed fixed monthly | Compliant if fixed |
| **Fair Market Value** | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | **$180K questionable** | Reduce or justify |
| **Not Based on Referrals** | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | [Data room verification needed] | Add explicit language |
| **Commercially Reasonable** | ✓ Required | ✓ Required | [Analysis needed] | Document business justification |
| **Reasonably Necessary** | [N/A for employment] | ✓ Required | [Analysis needed] | Justify medical director need |

**5. Comparative Analysis — Dr. Johnson vs. Other Medical Directors**

**Potential Inconsistency:**
If Dr. Johnson receives $180,000 for a 165-bed facility while other medical directors receive:
- Silver Sage Las Vegas (175 beds, larger): $150,000 (16.7% less than Dr. Johnson despite more beds)
- Sunrise Manor (180 beds, larger): $162,000 (10% less than Dr. Johnson despite more beds)

**Red Flag Implication:** Dr. Johnson's compensation is inconsistent with Sunset's compensation structure for comparably-sized or larger facilities, suggesting compensation may be inflated to reward referrals rather than reflecting FMV for services.

**Required Analysis:** Document distinguishing factors justifying Dr. Johnson's premium (e.g., geriatric board certification, specialized training, higher acuity at Desert Sun, quality improvement leadership role).

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Scenario 1: Dr. Johnson Arrangement Found to Be AKS Kickback**

**FCA Liability Calculation:**
- **Referrals:** 150 Medicare patients/year × 3 years (2021-2023) = 450 patients
- **Average Medicare payment per resident:** $18,000 (25-day stay × $625/day PDPM rate + therapy)
- **Total claims tainted by kickback:** 450 patients × $18,000 = **$8.1M**
- **Treble damages:** $8.1M × 3 = **$24.3M**
- **Civil penalties:** 450 claims × $13,946-$27,894 per claim = **$6.3M-$12.6M**
- **Total maximum exposure (Dr. Johnson alone):** **$30.6M-$36.9M**
- **Settlement range (Dr. Johnson component):** **$3M-$8M** (single damages $2.7M-$4M × 1.5-2 multiplier)

**Note:** This calculation assumes Dr. Johnson's kickback is established. If the arrangement is found compliant with FMV, exposure is $0.

**Scenario 2: All 12 Medical Director Contracts Found Non-Compliant (Worst Case)**

**Highly Unlikely Scenario** — Only if systematic deficiencies across portfolio (e.g., all contracts lack time documentation, all lack anti-referral language, all exceed FMV):
- Extend FCA liability to all admissions influenced by medical director referrals
- Potential exposure: **$50M-$100M+** (portfolio-wide referral stream tainted)

**Realistic Assessment:** Only Dr. Johnson arrangement presents significant exposure; other 11 contracts appear compliant.

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Dr. Robert Johnson Arrangement Presents Material Compliance Risk**

The $180,000 annual compensation paid to Dr. Robert Johnson for medical director services at Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ) is at the **upper boundary of fair market value** (75th-90th percentile) for SNF medical directors. While not per se non-compliant, this compensation level combined with:
- FCA qui tam relator's specific allegations
- Alleged 150+ referrals annually
- Potential lack of time documentation
- Possible referral volume correlation

...creates **HIGH RISK** of government finding this arrangement constitutes an Anti-Kickback Statute violation, which would support FCA liability of **$3M-$8M** (Dr. Johnson component of overall settlement).

**2. Remaining 11 Medical Director Contracts Appear Compliant**

The other 11 medical director arrangements at Sunset facilities range from $90,000 to $162,000 annually, with most falling within the **40th-65th percentile** of industry benchmarks. Absent evidence of referral-based payment or inadequate service performance, these contracts present **LOW TO MEDIUM** risk.

**3. Portfolio-Wide Documentation Deficiencies Likely**

Based on OIG's 2024 Nursing Facility ICPG emphasizing time logs and service documentation, Sunset likely has **inadequate contemporaneous documentation** of medical director hours worked. This undermines fair market value defenses across the portfolio, though it is remediable through prospective compliance measures.

**4. STARK Law and AKS Compliance Frameworks Require Parallel Satisfaction**

Medical director arrangements must satisfy **both** STARK Law exceptions (employment or personal services) **and** AKS safe harbors to minimize compliance risk. Sunset's contracts (assumed to be independent contractor 1099 arrangements) must meet:
- **STARK Personal Services Exception (42 CFR § 411.357(d)):** Written agreement, ≥1 year term, services specified, compensation set in advance at FMV, not based on referrals
- **AKS Personal Services Safe Harbor (42 CFR § 1001.952(d)):** Same requirements plus commercially reasonable and reasonably necessary standards

**5. Halifax and Tuomey Precedents Provide Cautionary Lessons**

The $85 million Halifax settlement and $237 million Tuomey judgment demonstrate that:
- Compensation above 90th percentile with insufficient productivity justification creates strong inference of kickback
- Referral-based bonuses (Halifax) or exclusive referral requirements (Tuomey) are deal-breakers
- Ignoring legal counsel's Stark Law warnings (Tuomey "red face test") supports knowing FCA violation
- Every claim tainted by kickback is a false claim, leading to catastrophic exposure

Sunset's situation is **distinguishable** from Halifax/Tuomey because:
- Dr. Johnson's compensation is not based on a percentage of facility revenue
- No exclusive referral requirement (to our knowledge)
- Compensation is fixed monthly, not variable with referrals
- If Dr. Johnson's referrals are discharge planning recommendations based on clinical needs (not financial inducement), this differs from the quid pro quo arrangements in Halifax/Tuomey

However, the **similarity** is troubling: if Dr. Johnson provides minimal services but receives substantial compensation while referring 150+ patients annually, this replicates the kickback pattern that resulted in the $85M/$237M settlements/judgments.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### Immediate Actions (30-60 Days)

**1. Engage Healthcare Valuation Firm for Independent FMV Opinion**

Retain Sullivan Cotter, Mercer, BDO, or comparable healthcare compensation consulting firm to conduct independent fair market value analysis of **all 12 medical director contracts**, with specific focus on Dr. Johnson arrangement.

**FMV Opinion Should Include:**
- National and regional benchmarking for SNF medical directors
- Percentile analysis (where does each contract fall in distribution?)
- Comparison to Sunset's internal compensation structure
- Justification for any compensation above 75th percentile
- Recommended adjustments to achieve 50th-65th percentile positioning

**Cost:** $15,000-$30,000 per comprehensive valuation (may be lower for portfolio analysis)

**2. Implement Time Documentation System**

Effective immediately, require all 12 medical directors to complete **monthly time logs** documenting:
- Date and time of each service activity
- Meeting attendance (care planning, quality committee, infection control)
- Consultation hours (resident case reviews, complex cases)
- Administrative tasks (policy review, survey preparation)
- On-call availability (even if not actively providing service)
- Total hours per month

**Format:** Standardized timesheet template approved by compliance counsel
**Submission:** Due by 5th business day of following month
**Review:** Facility administrator reviews for reasonableness, compliance officer audits quarterly

**OIG 2024 Guidance Compliance:** This satisfies OIG Nursing Facility ICPG requirement for "time logs or other accounts of services rendered."

**3. Contract Amendment — Anti-Referral Language**

Amend all 12 medical director contracts to add explicit anti-referral language:

> **"Compensation Not Based on Referrals.** The parties acknowledge and agree that Physician's compensation under this Agreement is fixed and is not determined in any manner that takes into account (directly or indirectly) the volume or value of any referrals or other business generated by Physician for Facility. Physician's compensation reflects solely the fair market value of the medical director services specified in this Agreement and is consistent with the compensation that would be paid for such services in an arm's-length transaction between parties not in a position to generate business for each other."

**Implementation:** Circulate amendment to all medical directors for signature within 30 days. Under CMS Stark Law guidance, missing signatures can be cured within 90 days without jeopardizing exception compliance.¹⁰⁴

**4. Dr. Johnson Arrangement — Renegotiation or Enhanced Justification**

**Option A: Renegotiate Compensation Downward (Preferred)**
- Reduce Dr. Johnson's compensation from $180,000 to **$150,000-$162,000** (50th-65th percentile)
- Frame as portfolio-wide compensation standardization, not targeting Dr. Johnson specifically
- Effective date: Upon contract renewal or via amendment

**Advantages:**
- Removes FCA qui tam relator's strongest evidence of excessive compensation
- Aligns Dr. Johnson with Silver Sage Las Vegas ($150K, 175 beds) and Sunrise Manor ($162K, 180 beds)
- Demonstrates good faith compliance effort

**Disadvantages:**
- May anger Dr. Johnson, potentially disrupting referral relationship
- Could be interpreted as admission that prior compensation was improper

**Option B: Document Enhanced Duties to Justify $180K (If Renegotiation Not Feasible)**
- Expand Dr. Johnson's responsibilities to justify premium compensation:
  - **Quality Improvement Leadership:** Desert Sun has DPNA history (November 2023 pressure ulcers, $540K revenue loss); appoint Dr. Johnson as clinical quality champion with enhanced oversight
  - **Staff Education Program:** Implement quarterly grand rounds for nursing staff on geriatric syndromes, infection control, wound care (add 3-4 hours/month)
  - **Attending Physician Services:** If not already providing, add direct patient care for complex residents (separate from medical director duties)
- Document time commitment increases from 10 hours/month to **15-18 hours/month**
- Obtain independent FMV opinion confirming $180K justified for expanded duties

**Advantages:**
- Preserves Dr. Johnson relationship
- Creates legitimate business justification for higher compensation
- Demonstrates services commensurate with payment

**Disadvantages:**
- Retrospective justification may not cure prior non-compliance
- Requires Dr. Johnson's willingness to expand duties
- Does not address relator's allegation that historical compensation (2019-2023) was excessive

#### Short-Term Actions (60-90 Days)

**5. Referral Pattern Analysis**

Conduct data analysis to assess whether Dr. Johnson's referrals to Sunset facilities correlate with compensation:

**Data to Collect:**
- Monthly referral counts from Dr. Johnson to all Sunset facilities (2019-2024)
- Dr. Johnson's compensation history (any increases? timing?)
- Comparison: Other hospital physicians' SNF referral patterns (is Dr. Johnson an outlier?)
- Clinical justification: Case mix, patient preferences, discharge planning protocols

**Objective:** Demonstrate referrals are based on **clinical appropriateness**, not financial inducement. If data shows:
- Dr. Johnson refers to Sunset facilities no more frequently than other comparable hospital physicians → supports legitimate discharge planning
- Referrals increased significantly after medical director arrangement commenced → red flag for government

**6. Comprehensive Contract Review**

Retain healthcare regulatory counsel to review **all 12 medical director contracts** for STARK/AKS compliance:

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Written and signed agreements
- [ ] One-year minimum term
- [ ] Services specifically enumerated
- [ ] All services covered (no side arrangements)
- [ ] Compensation set in advance
- [ ] Fair market value determination documented
- [ ] Anti-referral language included
- [ ] Commercially reasonable justification
- [ ] Reasonable necessity for medical director services

**Deliverable:** Compliance memorandum identifying deficiencies and recommended corrections

#### Long-Term Actions (90-180 Days)

**7. Develop Compliance Policies and Procedures**

Formalize medical director compensation compliance program:

**Policy Components:**
- **FMV Benchmarking Requirement:** All medical director compensation must be benchmarked against Sullivan Cotter or MGMA surveys annually
- **Compensation Approval Process:** Medical director contracts exceeding 65th percentile require:
  - Written justification from facility administrator
  - Independent FMV opinion from external valuation firm
  - Approval by Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel
- **Time Documentation Mandate:** Monthly time logs required, reviewed quarterly by compliance
- **Referral Monitoring:** Annual analysis of referral patterns to identify outliers
- **Contract Review Cycle:** All medical director contracts reviewed biennially for STARK/AKS compliance

**8. Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) Preparation**

If FCA settlement includes CIA (highly likely), Sunset will be required to:
- Engage Independent Review Organization (IRO) to audit claims
- Implement compliance training program
- Establish physician compensation review protocols
- Report material overpayments and deficiencies to OIG

**Proactive Preparation:**
- Implement IRO-level audit protocols now (pre-CIA) to identify and self-disclose any overpayments
- Develop compliance training curriculum on STARK/AKS for medical directors
- Establish reporting hotline for compliance concerns

**Cost Savings:** Early implementation may reduce CIA costs and demonstrate good faith compliance, potentially reducing settlement amount.

### C. Outstanding Questions Requiring Data Room Review

**1. Medical Director Contract Terms**
- Are contracts written and signed by both parties?
- Do contracts specify exact duties or use general language?
- Do contracts include anti-referral provisions?
- Are contracts employment (W-2) or independent contractor (1099)?
- What are termination provisions?

**2. Time Documentation**
- Does Sunset maintain time logs for medical directors?
- If so, what do logs show for Dr. Johnson's monthly hours?
- Are time logs contemporaneous or reconstructed?

**3. Compensation History**
- Has Dr. Johnson's compensation increased since arrangement commenced?
- If so, what was the justification for increases?
- Did increases coincide with referral volume changes?

**4. Referral Data**
- How many patients did Dr. Johnson refer to Sunset facilities annually (2019-2024)?
- To which Sunset facilities does Dr. Johnson refer? (Only Desert Sun? Multiple?)
- What is Dr. Johnson's professional relationship to Sunset? (Hospital-employed physician? Private practice? Medical group?)

**5. FMV Opinions**
- Did Sunset obtain independent FMV opinions when entering medical director contracts?
- If so, from whom? What methodology? What conclusions?

**6. FCA Qui Tam Complaint**
- What specific allegations does relator Sarah Martinez make regarding Dr. Johnson?
- Does complaint include billing records, referral data, or internal communications supporting kickback allegations?
- What is relator's basis for claiming "1 hour/month" time commitment?
