## BLOCKING ISSUES (2)

### CRITICAL-APPLY-001: Questions Presented Edit Application Failure
- **Section**: II. Questions Presented (lines 416-439)
- **Issue**: W4-002 remediation output contains complete Under/Does/When formatted questions, but edits were not successfully merged into final document
- **Current State**: "[Omitted long context line]" placeholders remain
- **Impact**: Section appears incomplete to readers; professional presentation compromised
- **Root Cause**: Wave 6 edit application script failed text matching
- **Remediation**: Apply W4-002 EDITED_START to EDITED_END content to Section II
- **Estimated Time**: 5 minutes

### CRITICAL-APPLY-002: Brief Answers Edit Application Failure
- **Section**: III. Brief Answers (lines 444-468)
- **Issue**: W2-001 remediation output contains complete narrative brief answers with Answer/Because/Section format, but edits were not successfully merged into final document
- **Current State**: "[Omitted long context line]" placeholders remain
- **Impact**: Section appears incomplete; analytical continuity broken
- **Root Cause**: Wave 6 edit application script failed text matching
- **Remediation**: Apply W2-001 EDITED_START to EDITED_END content to Section III
- **Estimated Time**: 5 minutes

**Total Blocking Issues**: 2 (both technical edit application failures, not content deficiencies)

## MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS (CYCLE 2)

The Cycle 2 remediation successfully addressed **both Cycle 1 red flag issues** and achieved substantial improvements across multiple dimensions:

### 1. CREAC Structure (Dimension 1): +5.0 points
- **Before**: 3/10 (0 CREAC headers)
- **After**: 8/10 (56 CREAC headers)
- **Improvement**: 23 existing + 27 enhanced + 6 new = 56 total headers
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (exceeds 50-header minimum threshold)

### 2. Draft Contract Language (Dimension 9): +6.5 points
- **Before**: 2/10 (0 draft provisions)
- **After**: 8.5/10 (comprehensive provisions for 1 CRITICAL + 5 HIGH findings)
- **Provisions Added**:
  - Orange County SFF: Closing condition, seller intervention obligation, $12M escrow
  - Martinez FCA: Indemnification, $10M escrow, CIA compliance
  - SB 525 wages: Representation, pre-closing compliance, price adjustment
  - D&O coverage: Tail policy requirement, tender obligation
  - Medical director FMV: Renegotiation requirement, FMV validation
  - Plus 7 additional provisions for MEDIUM/HIGH findings
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (professional-quality draft language)

### 3. Risk Assessment Tables (Dimension 8): +1.0 point
- **Before**: 6/8 (summary table only)
- **After**: 7/8 (summary table + 7 section-specific tables)
- **Status**: ⚠️ IMPROVED (minor gaps in mitigation strategies)

### 4. Questions Presented (Dimension 0): +0.3 points
- **Before**: 4.5/5 (10 of 12 used "Whether" format)
- **After**: 4.8/5 (all 12 reformatted to Under/Does/When structure IN REMEDIATION OUTPUT)
- **Status**: ⚠️ CONTENT READY (pending edit application)

### 5. Brief Answers (Dimension 3): +0.3 points

- **Red Flag 2**: Missing draft provisions (-3%) → ✅ RESOLVED
- **Net Gain**: +6.0 percentage points from red flag elimination alone

**Total Base Score Improvement**: +13.6 points (79.0% → 92.6%)
**Total Final Score Improvement**: +13.0 points (73% → 86%)

## REMAINING LIMITATIONS

### Technical Issues (Blocking Certification)
1. Questions Presented section contains placeholders (CRITICAL-APPLY-001)
2. Brief Answers section contains placeholders (CRITICAL-APPLY-002)

### Quality Gaps (Non-Blocking)
3. Risk table mitigation strategies incomplete in some sections (Dim 8: -1 point)
4. 5-10% of case citations lack pincites (Dim 5: -1 point)
5. Single instance of advocacy language "clearly" (Dim 2: -0.5 points)

**Total Points to Certification Threshold**: 2.0 points
**Achievable in Cycle 3**: Yes (technical issues only)

---

## CYCLE 3 STRATEGY

### Scope: Targeted Edit Application (Minimal Intervention)

**Tasks**:
1. Apply W4-002 edits to Section II (Questions Presented)
2. Apply W2-001 edits to Section III (Brief Answers)
3. Validate zero placeholders remain
4. Re-score Dimensions 0, 3, 10, 11

**Estimated Time**: 10-15 minutes
**Expected Gain**: +1.4 to +2.0 percentage points
**Projected Post-Cycle 3 Score**: 87.4% to 88.0%

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Remediation outputs already exist and are high-quality
- **High Confidence**: Technical issue (edit application), not analytical deficiency
- **No Regression Risk**: Minimal scope, targeted changes only

---

## NEXT ACTION

**Action**: **LOOP_REMEDIATION**

**Orchestrator Instructions**:
1. Invoke diagnostic agent to create Cycle 3 remediation plan
2. Execute targeted edit application for Sections II and III only
3. Run validation checks (zero placeholders, format compliance)
4. Re-invoke certification agent for final assessment

**Expected Timeline**:
- Cycle 3 Remediation: 15 minutes
- Cycle 3 Certification: 10 minutes
- **Total to Delivery**: 25 minutes
