## 20. CONFLICTS DETECTED & RESOLVED

### Conflict #1: Martinez Qui Tam Filing Date

**Conflicting Values:**
- Value A: May 2023 (fca-litigation-report.md § I.A.1, § III.C - multiple references)
- Value B: August 15, 2022 (user query mentioned this date)

**Resolution:**
- **Canonical Value:** May 2023
- **Reasoning:** FCA litigation report consistently references "May 2023" filing with "19-month seal period May 2023-December 2024" unsealing. Multiple cross-references support May 2023. August 2022 appears to be error or refers to different event.
- **Confidence:** MEDIUM (pending PACER confirmation)

### Conflict #2: San Diego Facility - Owned vs Leased

**Conflicting Values:**
- Listed in both owned facilities section and leased facilities table

**Resolution:**
- **Canonical Value:** LEASED facility
- **Reasoning:** Commercial-contracts-report.md § IV.E provides definitive lease table with San Diego listed at 120 beds, $800,000/year rent, $6,667/bed rate. Lease detail trumps ambiguous ownership references.
- **Confidence:** HIGH
