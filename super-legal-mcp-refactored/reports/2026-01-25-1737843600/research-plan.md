## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Target is Sunset Senior Living Group, LLC (12 SNFs) | User-provided transaction overview | If additional undisclosed facilities, scope expands |
| Closing target March 2025 | Inferred from 18 business days + CHOW 60-day notice | If earlier/later, CHOW timeline shifts |
| Martinez qui tam DOJ decision Q1-Q2 2025 | Typical 6-12 months unsealing to intervention | If intervenes sooner, settlement accelerates |
| Orange County next survey March 2025 | Annual survey cycle from prior March 2024 | If survey delayed/advanced, SFF timeline shifts |
| CMS staffing minimums finalized 2025 | Proposed rule 2024, typical finalization 12-18 months | If delayed, compliance timeline extends |
| No other pending qui tam under seal | Assumption, FCA seal means unknown | If additional qui tam, exposure multiplies |
| No undisclosed survey deficiencies | Data room provides complete survey history | If surveys missing, risk underestimated |
| Financial statements accurate | Reliance on Sunset-provided FY2024 financials | If financials misstated, valuation/EBITDA wrong |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual medical director contract terms not provided (using alleged $15K/month from qui tam complaint)
- Detailed therapy contract terms not disclosed (relying on qui tam allegations of pre-PDPM upcoding)
- Specific CIA terms if FCA settles (using industry standard IRO audit/training/reporting requirements)
- Insurance policy limits/retentions not provided (using typical SNF professional liability $1M-$3M per occurrence, D&O $5M-$10M)

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:**
1. T1-T6 parallel execution (CMS regulatory is foundation, FCA litigation is highest dollar exposure, employment is second-highest cost)
2. T7 sequential (privacy lower priority than core regulatory/litigation)
3. Financial-analyst triggered after T1-T6 complete (aggregate $37M-$44M quantified exposure confirmed)
4. Validation phase critical to verify Orange County SFF improvement plan feasibility, FCA settlement range reasonableness

**Potential Issues:**
- If Orange County March 2025 survey shows continued immediate jeopardy, full SFF designation likely September 2025 → deal structure may need to exclude Orange County facility ($28M revenue, 145 beds, 10% of portfolio)
- If DOJ intervenes Martinez qui tam and demands >$15M settlement, may trigger purchase price adjustment or closing condition failure
- If CMS finalizes staffing minimums with <3 year phase-in, $4.3M annual cost accelerates (Year 1 could be $3M-$4M vs planned $1.3M)

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If any specialist finds >$50M exposure beyond already-identified risks (FCA $8M-$15M, SFF $24.6M, staffing $4.3M annual = $12.9M over 3 years cumulative), flag immediately for purchase price adjustment analysis
- If CHOW delay likely >6 months (California CDPH requires Orange County SFF improvement before transfer), deal timeline at risk
- If turnover/staffing analysis shows compliance with 3.5 PPD impossible in 3-year phase-in (labor market constraints, cannot hire 91 FTEs), may need regulatory waiver or rural/underserved exception

| # | Finding | Source | Domain | Gross | Prob | Method | Weighted | Mitigation | Cross-Sections |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------|------|--------|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Orange County SFF Termination Risk** | cms-regulatory-compliance-report.md | Regulatory | $24.6M annual revenue | 30-40% | Revenue loss (Medicare 28% + Medicaid 60%) | $7.4M-$9.8M | Mock survey, interim management, staffing surge 3.6 PPD, zero-tolerance QA | IV.A, IV.D (CHOW), IV.E (WARN Act) |
| 2 | **Martinez FCA Settlement + CIA** | fca-litigation-report.md | Litigation | $19M-$31M (settlement $8M-$15M + CIA $11M-$16M over 5 years) | 55-65% DOJ intervention | Expected value: (60% × $28.5M) + (40% × $10M) = $21.1M | $21.1M | Engage FCA defense counsel, initiate settlement negotiations, pursue cooperation credit | IV.B, IV.C (AKS), IV.H (medical director FMV) |
| 3 | **CMS Staffing Minimums (REPEALED)** | employment-labor-report.md | Employment/Regulatory | $4.3M annually (26 RN FTEs + 65 CNA FTEs) | 0% (REPEALED Dec 2025) | Cost avoidance NPV | $0 (AVOIDED) | California AB 1502 compliance only (3 facilities, $86K annually) | IV.A (Five Star staffing domain), IV.E |
| 4 | **Union Organizing Risk (SEIU-UHW)** | employment-labor-report.md | Employment | $20M annually (wages $11.3M + benefits $2.9M + staffing ratios $5.7M) | MODERATE-HIGH if no pre-emptive action | Labor cost increase: 38% EBITDA reduction ($52M → $32M) | $20M contingent | Pre-emptive retention strategy ($11M investment, net cost $8.5M after revenue/savings) | IV.E, IV.A (turnover → quality measures) |
| 5 | **Uninsured FCA/Regulatory Exposure** | insurance-coverage-report.md | Insurance | $20.9M-$34.4M (FCA $4.8M-$10.5M + DPNA $1.5M-$3M + CIA $3.5M-$6M + WARN Act $8.7M + CMPs $214K-$1.07M) | 40-60% (varies by category) | Uninsured exposure analysis | $20.9M-$34.4M | Escrow holdback, tender D&O claim, purchase price adjustment, WARN Act 60-day notice compliance | IV.I, IV.B (FCA), IV.E (WARN) |
| 6 | **Ransomware Attack Risk** | privacy-data-protection-report.md | Privacy/Cyber | $15.0M-$57.8M per incident (downtime $13.3M-$51.3M + breach notification $222K-$445K + forensics $250K-$750K + OCR penalties $1.0M-$4.5M) | 8.2% annually = 35% over 5 years | Industry statistics: SNF sector 4% of healthcare ransomware targets, avg downtime 17 days at $1.9M/day | $1.23M-$4.74M annual expected value | Enhanced cybersecurity controls (EDR/XDR, MFA, email security), incident response plan, cyber insurance $5M-$10M, offline backups | IV.K, IV.I (cyber insurance), IV.A (EHR system downtime → survey deficiencies) |
| 7 | **DPNA Revenue Loss (FY2024 + Future)** | cms-regulatory-compliance-report.md | Regulatory | $1.53M FY2024 (Desert Sun $540K + Orange County $990K) + $1.5M-$3M future (Orange County recurrence 30-40% probability) | 30-40% recurrence | Revenue loss calculation: Medicare/Medicaid admissions blocked | $735K weighted future exposure | Wound care specialist retention (Desert Sun), infection control program (Orange County), quality assurance oversight | IV.A, IV.F, IV.I (professional liability coverage) |
| 8 | **California SB 525 Wage Non-Compliance** | employment-labor-report.md | Employment | $1.2M-$1.5M annually (144 CNAs × $4/hour increase to $21/hour minimum by June 1, 2025) + $2.7M-$4.5M class action exposure (3-year lookback) | 100% (statutory requirement effective June 2025) | Wage calculation: $17 current → $21 required × 2,080 hours | $1.2M-$1.5M annually + $2.7M-$4.5M class action | Immediate wage increase June 2025, meal/rest break compliance (duty-free breaks, no understaffing violations) | IV.E, IV.A (California AB 1502 3.5 PPD) |

**Usage:** memo-executive-summary-writer and memo-section-writers should reference this table directly rather than re-extracting from specialist reports.

**Key Insight:** CMS staffing minimums REPEALED (Public Law 119-21, December 2025) eliminates $4.3M annual cost identified in research plan. California AB 1502 remains in effect (3.5 PPD for California facilities only, $86K annually vs portfolio-wide $4.3M).

### FINANCIAL PRE-AGGREGATION (Board Briefing Ready)

| Category | Gross | Probability | Weighted | Method | Sources |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Litigation (FCA)** | $19M-$31M | 55-65% DOJ intervention | $21.1M | Expected Value: (60% × $28.5M) + (40% × $10M) | fca-litigation-report.md |
| **Regulatory (SFF + DPNA + CMPs)** | $26.13M-$42.3M ($24.6M SFF + $1.53M DPNA + $137K CMPs) | 30-40% SFF, 30% DPNA recurrence | $7.4M-$10.5M | Revenue loss calculation + probability weighting | cms-regulatory-compliance-report.md |
| **Employment (Union + WARN + CA Wage)** | $24.95M-$29.9M ($20M union + $3.75M WARN + $1.2M-$1.5M CA wage + $2.7M-$4.5M CA class action) | Union: MODERATE-HIGH (contingent), WARN: 30-40%, CA wage: 100% | $1.2M-$1.5M (CA wage certain) + $3.75M-$4.5M (WARN if no notice) + $20M (union contingent) | Statutory penalties + labor cost increase | employment-labor-report.md |
| **Insurance Coverage Gaps** | $20.9M-$34.4M (uninsured FCA + DPNA + CIA + WARN + CMPs) | 40-60% (varies) | $20.9M-$34.4M | Uninsured exposure analysis | insurance-coverage-report.md |
| **Cyber/Privacy** | $15.0M-$57.8M (ransomware incident) + $2.0M-$6.7M (multi-state breach) | 8.2% annually ransomware, 5% annually breach | $1.23M-$4.74M annually (ransomware EV) + $2.0M-$6.7M (breach) | Industry statistics: SNF sector ransomware rate, avg downtime cost $1.9M/day | privacy-data-protection-report.md |
| **Commercial Contracts** | $7.9M (medical director FMV $630K + therapy assignment fees $600K-$2.4M + therapy termination $4.5M-$6M + vendor $500K + leases $500K) | 60-70% (varies by category) | $7.9M | Expected value aggregation | commercial-contracts-report.md |
| **Tax/Structure (Sale-Leaseback)** | EBITDA reduction $7M-$11M annually, EV destruction $63M-$90M | ELECTIVE (not risk, strategic decision) | NPV +$108M-$120M benefit (7-year hold) | DCF analysis: sale proceeds $175M vs. cumulative rent $70M + tax savings $7M-$9M - EV loss $120M | tax-structure-report.md |
| **TOTAL RISK EXPOSURE** | **$92.5M-$157.1M gross** | — | **$92.5M-$124.3M weighted** | — | — |

**Aggregate Exposure as % of Deal Value:** $92.5M-$124.3M weighted exposure ÷ $425M purchase price = **21.8%-29.2% of transaction value**

#### Liability Methodology Corrections Applied

| Finding | Original | Corrected | Adjustment |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|
| CMS Staffing Minimums | $4.3M annually ongoing (research plan estimate) | $0 (REPEALED December 2025) | **-$4.3M annual cost AVOIDED** |
| Sale-Leaseback | EBITDA reduction $7M-$11M (negative framing) | NPV +$108M-$120M benefit over 7 years (DCF analysis) | **Strategic option, not liability** |
| Union Organizing | $20M annual labor cost (if union wins) | **Contingent risk** - avoidable via pre-emptive retention strategy ($11M investment, net cost $8.5M) | **Contingent, not certain** |

**Total Adjustment:** CMS staffing repeal = **-$4.3M annual cost avoided** (material positive development post-research plan creation)

#### Recommended Purchase Price Impact

| Component | Amount | Basis |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **FCA Settlement Escrow** | $21M | Expected value of settlement + CIA (60% DOJ intervention × $28.5M midpoint) |
| **Orange County SFF Escrow** | $9.8M | 40% probability × $24.6M revenue loss (if termination occurs March 2028) |
| **Uninsured Exposure Reserve** | $25M | Insurance coverage gaps (FCA, DPNA, WARN Act, CMPs uninsured) |
| **WARN Act Compliance** | $0 | Provide 60-day notice if Orange County closes → eliminates $8.7M penalty |
| **Total Recommended Escrow/Holdback** | **$55.8M** (13.1% of purchase price) | Held for 18-24 months until FCA resolved, Orange County stabilized |

#### Escrow Recommendations

| Matter | Amount | Release Condition |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **FCA Settlement (Martinez Qui Tam)** | $21M | DOJ intervention decision + settlement executed OR 24 months if DOJ declines |
| **Orange County SFF** | $9.8M | March 2025 survey passed without immediate jeopardy + CHOW approved OR excluded from transaction |
| **Uninsured Regulatory/Employment** | $25M | 18-month time release (covers DPNA, WARN Act, CA wage class action, CMPs during transition) |
| **Total Escrow** | **$55.8M** (released in tranches) | Staged release over 18-24 months as risks resolve |

**Usage:** memo-executive-summary-writer should copy this table to Board Briefing Section II.

**Critical Insight:** Total escrow $55.8M (13.1% of $425M purchase price) is HIGHER than typical M&A holdbacks (3-10%) due to:
1. Active FCA qui tam with DOJ intervention decision pending Q1-Q2 2025
2. Orange County SFF candidate status with March 2025 survey determining facility viability
3. $20.9M-$34.4M uninsured exposure (D&O fraud exclusion, EPLI WARN Act exclusion, professional liability regulatory fines exclusion)

### CROSS-REFERENCE PATTERNS (Mandatory in Memorandum)

Based on HIGH severity findings, these cross-domain connections MUST appear:

| # | Source Finding | Source Section | Target Section | Doctrine | Contract Provision |
|---|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Martinez FCA Settlement → CIA Compliance** | IV.B (FCA Litigation) | IV.A (CMS Regulatory) | FCA settlement triggers 5-year CIA → enhanced survey scrutiny, IRO audits, mandatory overpayment reporting | N/A |
| 2 | **Orange County SFF → CHOW Delay** | IV.A (CMS Regulatory) | IV.D (Facility Licensing) | SFF candidate status delays California CDPH license transfer (will not approve CHOW for facility under termination threat) | Purchase Agreement closing condition |
| 3 | **Medical Director FMV → FCA Kickbacks** | IV.H (Commercial Contracts) | IV.B (FCA), IV.C (AKS) | Dr. Johnson $180K compensation (2-3× FMV) creates AKS violation → all claims from referred patients "false" under FCA | Medical director agreement termination/renegotiation |
| 4 | **CMS Staffing Minimums REPEALED → Star Ratings** | IV.E (Employment) | IV.A (CMS Regulatory) | Federal repeal eliminates $4.3M cost, but California AB 1502 (3.5 PPD) remains → staffing domain improvement possible with targeted investment | California facilities only |
| 5 | **DPNA/CMPs Uninsured → EBITDA Impact** | IV.F (Civil Monetary Penalties) | IV.I (Insurance Coverage) | Professional liability policies exclude regulatory fines → $1.67M FY2024 uninsured absorbed from operating cash flow (reduces $52M EBITDA to $50.33M) | Insurance policy exclusions |
| 6 | **Staff Turnover 85% CNAs → Quality Measures** | IV.E (Employment) | IV.A (CMS Regulatory) | High turnover → continuity of care gaps → pressure ulcers (12% vs 6% national), falls (8% vs 4%) → low star ratings (1-star Orange County, 2.6-star portfolio avg) | Retention bonus programs |
| 7 | **Sale-Leaseback EBITDA Impact → Valuation** | IV.J (Tax Structure) | Purchase Price Negotiations | Rent $12M-$16M annually vs depreciation add-back $5M-$6M = $7M-$11M EBITDA reduction → EV decline $63M-$90M (9× multiple) at exit | Sale-leaseback timing (defer to Year 2-3) |
| 8 | **Orange County SFF → WARN Act** | IV.A (CMS Regulatory) | IV.E (Employment) | If SFF termination March 2028, 290 employees laid off → WARN Act 60-day notice required or $8.7M penalty ($3.75M back pay + $464K benefits) | WARN Act procedural compliance |
| 9 | **Ransomware Risk → EHR Downtime → Survey Deficiencies** | IV.K (Privacy/Cyber) | IV.A (CMS Regulatory) | Ransomware avg 17 days downtime → cannot access resident records → medication errors, care plan gaps → immediate jeopardy K-tags | EHR backup/recovery procedures |
| 10 | **FCA D&O Insurance → Uninsured Exposure** | IV.I (Insurance Coverage) | IV.B (FCA Litigation) | D&O fraud exclusion may apply if "knowing" false claims proven (40-60% coverage probability) → $4.8M-$10.5M uninsured FCA exposure | Tender claim to D&O insurer immediately |
| 11 | **Union Organizing → EBITDA Reduction** | IV.E (Employment) | Purchase Price Negotiations | SEIU-UHW organizing success → $20M annual labor cost (wages $11.3M + benefits $2.9M + staffing ratios $5.7M) → 38% EBITDA reduction ($52M → $32M) | Pre-emptive retention strategy |
| 12 | **California SB 525 Wage → Class Action** | IV.E (Employment) | IV.A (CMS Regulatory) | CNAs $17 current vs $21 required June 2025 → $6,240-$10,400 per CNA underpayment × 144 CNAs × 3-year lookback = $2.7M-$4.5M class action exposure | Immediate wage increase + meal/rest break compliance |

**Cross-Reference Checklist for Section Writers:**

- [ ] IV.B → IV.A: FCA CIA compliance monitoring creates enhanced CMS survey scrutiny risk
- [ ] IV.A → IV.D: Orange County SFF candidate delays California CHOW approval (must pass March 2025 survey first)
- [ ] IV.H → IV.B/IV.C: Medical director $180K compensation 2-3× FMV creates kickback inference (strengthens DOJ settlement leverage)
- [ ] IV.E → IV.A: CMS staffing minimums REPEALED federally (cost avoidance $4.3M), California AB 1502 3.5 PPD remains
- [ ] IV.F → IV.I: DPNA $1.53M FY2024 + CMPs $137K uninsured (professional liability excludes regulatory fines)
- [ ] IV.E → IV.A: Staff turnover 85% CNAs → pressure ulcers 12% vs 6% national → low star ratings
- [ ] IV.J → Purchase Price: Sale-leaseback reduces EBITDA $7M-$11M annually → EV decline $63M-$90M at exit
- [ ] IV.A → IV.E: Orange County SFF termination → 290 employee layoff → WARN Act 60-day notice or $8.7M penalty
- [ ] IV.K → IV.A: Ransomware 17-day avg downtime → EHR access loss → medication errors → immediate jeopardy
- [ ] IV.I → IV.B: D&O fraud exclusion 40-60% coverage → $4.8M-$10.5M uninsured FCA exposure
- [ ] IV.E → Purchase Price: Union organizing $20M labor cost → 38% EBITDA reduction → valuation impact
- [ ] IV.E → IV.A: California SB 525 $21/hour minimum June 2025 + meal/rest break compliance (understaffing 3.45 PPD prevents duty-free breaks)

**Pattern Count:** 12 mandatory cross-references identified

**Usage:** memo-section-writers should check off these cross-references as they write. memo-executive-summary-writer should verify all are present.

### DEAL-BLOCKING ISSUE DETECTION

**Status:** ⚠️ ONE DEAL-BLOCKING ISSUE IDENTIFIED

#### Deal-Blocking Issue #1: Orange County SFF March 2025 Survey

**Trigger Type:** CLOSING_CONDITION_FAILURE (Regulatory Approval at Risk)

**Finding Description:**
Orange County Care Center designated SFF candidate September 2024 following two immediate jeopardy citations within 24 months (March 2023 Coumadin error, March 2024 COVID-19 outbreak). March 2025 survey is CRITICAL decision point:
- If immediate jeopardy cited AGAIN (third IJ within SFF program) → automatic provider agreement termination within 23 days (no appeal, no cure period per CMS policy)
- If full SFF designation (persistent substandard quality without improvement) → mandatory termination March 2028 if sustained compliance not achieved

**Source:** cms-regulatory-compliance-report.md, Section III.C (Special Focus Facility Program), pages 49-75

**Deal Impact Assessment:**

1. **Revenue Loss:** $24.6M annually (88% of $28M facility revenue = Medicare 28% + Medicaid 60%)
2. **CHOW Delay:** California CDPH will not approve license transfer for facility under termination threat → 3-6 month delay for entire $425M acquisition
3. **Transaction Structure Options:**
   - **Option A:** Delay entire closing 3-6 months until Orange County stabilizes
   - **Option B:** Exclude Orange County from transaction, reduce purchase price $38M-$45M ($28M revenue × 8-10× SNF EBITDA multiple, accounting for operational turnaround discount)
   - **Option C:** Delayed closing structure (close 11 facilities first, Orange County when CHOW approved) - complex, requires separate purchase agreements

**Probability of Deal Failure:** 30-40% (based on Orange County survey failure probability)

**Basis:**
- 2 prior IJ citations within 24 months indicates systemic quality issues (not isolated incidents)
- Staffing shortfalls 11% below California AB 1502 requirement (3.1 PPD actual vs 3.5 PPD required)
- Quality measures below national averages (pressure ulcers 12% vs 6%, falls 8% vs 4%, antipsychotics 25% vs 15%)
- 1-star overall rating reflects persistent performance problems

**Mitigation Strategy (60-Day Timeline):**
1. **Pre-survey mock survey:** Independent nursing home turnaround consultant using CMS State Operations Manual protocols ($150K-$250K cost)
2. **Interim management team:** Deploy experienced administrator + DON from Silver Sage (portfolio's 4-star facility) for 60-day intensive oversight
3. **Staffing surge:** Increase to 3.6 PPD immediately (exceeds California AB 1502 requirement, demonstrates commitment) - cost $25K/month incremental
4. **Zero-tolerance quality assurance:** Daily clinical rounds, medication administration double-check protocols, infection control monitoring, pressure ulcer prevention audits

**Escalation:** This timeline conflict constitutes a DEAL-BLOCKING issue requiring sponsor notification and purchase agreement provisions.

---

#### Orchestrator Decision Required

Before proceeding to section generation, orchestrator must address:

**RECOMMENDED OPTION (Based on Analysis):**

✅ **OPTION A: Continue Full Research & Memo Generation + Orange County Intervention**

**Rationale:**
1. March 2025 survey is 60 days away (sufficient time for intensive intervention)
2. Mitigation strategy cost ($150K-$250K consultant + $50K interim management + $75K staffing surge = $275K-$375K total) is MATERIAL but far less than $38M-$45M price reduction if facility excluded
3. 60-70% probability Orange County passes survey with intervention (vs. 30-40% baseline without intervention)
4. Complete research provides comprehensive risk picture for negotiation (FCA settlement, insurance gaps, employment costs)
5. Memo prominently flags deal-blocking risk but preserves transaction optionality

**Purchase Agreement Provisions Required:**
- **Closing Condition Precedent:** Orange County passes March 2025 survey without immediate jeopardy OR facility excluded from transaction with pro rata price reduction
- **Seller Obligation:** Golden Gate Capital funds $375K intervention cost (or credited against purchase price)
- **Option to Exclude:** Silver Oak retains right to exclude Orange County facility post-survey if IJ cited, automatic $40M purchase price reduction
- **CHOW Contingency:** If CHOW approval delayed >90 days due to Orange County survey issues, buyer may terminate OR extend closing date up to 180 days

### CRITICAL REGULATORY UPDATE (Post-Research Plan Creation)

**CMS Staffing Minimums REPEALED** (December 2025, Public Law 119-21)

**Impact:**
- **Cost Avoidance:** $4.3M annually + $500K-$800K recruitment costs (research plan estimate) = **NO LONGER REQUIRED**
- **Arizona/Nevada facilities:** Can maintain current 3.45 PPD staffing levels without federal penalty
- **California facilities:** AB 1502 (3.5 PPD) remains in effect → $86K annual cost (3 facilities only vs portfolio-wide $4.3M)

**Critical Issue #3 Status Update:**
- Original: "CMS staffing minimums — $4.3M annually ongoing"
- **REVISED:** "CMS staffing minimums REPEALED — cost avoidance $4.3M annually. California AB 1502 compliance required ($86K annually, 3 facilities)."

**Net Financial Impact:** **-$4.3M annual cost eliminated** (material positive development for transaction economics)
