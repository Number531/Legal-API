## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This employment and labor law analysis addresses Critical Issues #3 (CMS staffing minimums $4.3M annually) and #8 (staff turnover 85% CNAs $3.5M recruitment costs) from the research plan, while evaluating WARN Act exposure if Orange County facility closes, wage/hour compliance across California/Arizona/Nevada, union organizing vulnerability (SEIU-UHW), and ERISA benefit plan compliance. Total quantified employment law exposure ranges **$9.0M-$11.4M annually** (excluding contingent union organizing risk $20M annually if organizing campaign succeeds).

### 1. CMS Staffing Minimums — CRITICAL REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT (REPEALED)

**Background:** CMS finalized minimum staffing requirements May 10, 2024 (89 FR 40876) requiring skilled nursing facilities to provide 3.48 hours per resident day (HPRD) total nursing (RN 0.55 HPRD, CNA 2.45 HPRD) with 24/7 RN on-site presence. Sunset currently provides 3.45 HPRD (RN 0.45, LPN 0.80, CNA 2.20), creating compliance gap requiring 26 additional RN FTEs + 65 CNA FTEs at estimated cost $4.3 million annually ongoing + $344K-$800K one-time recruitment.

**DECEMBER 2025 REPEAL:** CMS published interim final rule December 3, 2025 (89 FR [TBD]) **REPEALING** the minimum staffing standards effective February 2, 2026. Repealed requirements include 3.48 HPRD total, 0.55 RN HPRD, 2.45 CNA HPRD, and 24/7 RN presence. Statutory basis: Public Law 119-21 (signed July 4, 2025) prohibited CMS from implementing/enforcing minimum staffing standards. Facility assessment requirements remain in effect (42 C.F.R. § 483.71), requiring facilities to staff based on resident acuity but without specific quantitative HPRD minimums.

**Legal Challenges Pre-Repeal:** Federal district courts in Texas (AHCA v. HHS) and Iowa (20 state AGs v. HHS) vacated the 2024 final rule May and October 2024 respectively, finding CMS exceeded statutory authority and violated Administrative Procedures Act. Trump administration DOJ initially defended rule April 2025 but subsequently repealed December 2025.

**Impact on Sunset:** Federal repeal means Sunset **NO LONGER required** to hire 91 FTEs or incur $4.3M annual staffing cost for federal compliance. **COST AVOIDANCE:** $4,326,400 annually + $344,500-$800,000 recruitment costs. Sunset can maintain current 3.45 HPRD staffing levels for Arizona (6 facilities) and Nevada (3 facilities) without federal penalty.

**California AB 1502 State Mandate (REMAINS IN EFFECT):** California Health & Safety Code § 1276.5 requires **3.5 HPRD total nursing** minimum for California skilled nursing facilities (effective July 2023), independent of federal CMS rule. Applies to Sunset's 3 California facilities (Sunrise Manor 150 beds, Orange County 145 beds, San Diego 130 beds). **Orange County Non-Compliance:** Currently 3.4 HPRD (below 3.5 minimum), must add **2.3 FTE** (CNAs or LPNs) at cost $86,112 annually. California CDPH can impose civil monetary penalties $100-$150 per resident per day for non-compliance ($435,000/month exposure if deficiency cited).

**Strategic Implications:** (1) **Positive:** Federal repeal avoids $4.3M annual cost, provides operational flexibility to staff based on facility-specific acuity. (2) **Remaining Obligations:** Orange County facility California AB 1502 compliance $86K annually, qualitative federal standard 42 C.F.R. § 483.35 "sufficient nursing staff" (F880 deficiency risk if inadequate staffing causes resident harm). (3) **Five Star Ratings:** Repeal does not eliminate Payroll-Based Journal reporting or staffing component (20% of overall rating). Sunset current 3.45 HPRD = 2.6 stars staffing component. Recommendation: **Maintain 3.45 HPRD minimum** to preserve current star ratings, avoid further degradation.

### 2. WARN Act Liability — Orange County Facility Closure ($0-$4.5M Exposure)

**Triggering Scenario:** If Orange County facility designated full Special Focus Facility September 2025 (following March 2025 survey immediate jeopardy) → fails to achieve substantial compliance within 18-24 months → CMS terminates Medicare provider agreement March 2028 → facility loses 88% revenue ($24.6M annually Medicare/Medicaid) → closure inevitable due to financial non-viability → **290 employees laid off** (128 residents × 2.27 FTE/resident industry average = nursing staff ~180, dietary/housekeeping ~60, therapists ~25, admin ~25).

**Federal WARN Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109):** Sunset meets 100+ employee threshold (1,850 total employees). Orange County 290-employee layoff qualifies as **plant closing** (≥50 employees single site during 30-day period). **60-day advance written notice required** to: (1) affected employees, (2) California Employment Development Department, (3) City of Santa Ana chief elected official. Notice must specify closure date, job titles affected, bumping rights, company contact.

**Exceptions Unlikely to Apply:** (1) **Unforeseeable Business Circumstances:** CMS termination arguably FORESEEABLE (Orange County already SFF candidate September 2024, full SFF designation September 2025 provides 24 months advance warning of termination risk March 2028). Courts require "sudden, dramatic, unexpected" circumstances outside employer control (20 C.F.R. § 639.9(b)(1)), regulatory termination after 24-month improvement plan does NOT satisfy. (2) **Faltering Company:** Limited to plant closings where employer seeking capital/business and notice would preclude financing (not applicable to CMS regulatory termination). (3) **Natural Disaster:** Not applicable.

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:** (1) **Back Pay + Benefits:** $500/day per employee for each day of violation up to 60 days maximum. 290 employees × $189/day average wage × 60 days = $3,288,600 back pay + $464,000 benefits (health insurance 60 days) = **$3,752,600 employee liability**. (2) **Civil Penalty:** $500/day to City of Santa Ana for each day of violation, 60 days maximum = $30,000 (avoidable if employer pays all back pay/benefits to employees within 3 weeks of closure). (3) **Attorney Fees:** Prevailing employees entitled to reasonable fees, class action likely (290 employees), estimated $500K-$1M attorney fees. **TOTAL FEDERAL WARN EXPOSURE:** $3,752,600 + $30,000 + $750,000 = **$4,532,600** if ZERO days notice provided.

**California WARN Act (Cal. Labor Code §§ 1400-1408):** Stricter state requirements apply **in addition to** federal (no double recovery, employees elect higher recovery). California threshold 75+ employees (Sunset 1,850 meets threshold), triggering events include termination of operations (Orange County closure), 60-day notice to employees/California EDD/Local Workforce Investment Board/chief elected officials city and county. Penalties same as federal: back pay/benefits up to 60 days (or one-half days employed whichever smaller), civil penalty $500/day, attorney fees (asymmetric fee-shifting, prevailing employees recover fees but prevailing employer cannot).

**Mitigation Strategy — ZERO LIABILITY:** **Provide full 60-day advance written notice January 2028** (60 days before March 2028 anticipated CMS termination effective date). Notice allows employees to seek new employment, file unemployment claims, coordinate with California EDD Rapid Response Services (job fairs, resume assistance, retraining programs). **Cost:** $0 WARN penalties (full compliance). **Additional Closure Costs (Not WARN-Related):** (1) Severance $825,300 (2 weeks pay per year of service typical, 290 employees × 3 years average tenure, voluntary not required by WARN but common practice reduces litigation). (2) Accrued PTO Payout $548,100 (California law requires vacation payout upon termination Lab. Code § 227.3). **Total Closure Costs:** $1,373,400 unavoidable regardless of WARN compliance.

**Transfer Option (Reduce WARN Headcount):** If other Sunset facilities have vacancies within reasonable commuting distance (50 miles), employees who accept transfers NOT counted as "employment loss" for WARN purposes (20 C.F.R. § 639.3(f)). San Diego facility 90 miles from Orange County (marginal commuting distance), assume 20-30 employees accept transfers. Revised WARN headcount: 290 - 25 transferred = **265 employees** subject to notice (modest reduction, still significant).

**Cross-Domain Impact:** WARN Act penalties typically **NOT covered** by Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) policies (statutory penalties excluded). Review Sunset EPLI policy, if WARN excluded, budget $3.75M-$4.5M uninsured exposure. Purchase agreement should allocate WARN liability between seller (Sunset management 2019-2025 caused SFF designation) and buyer (Silver Oak as successor employer responsible for post-closing compliance).

### 3. Staff Turnover & Retention Strategy ($11M Investment, $8.5M Net Cost)

**Current Turnover Crisis:** Sunset nursing staff turnover 67% weighted average (CNAs 85%, LPNs 55%, RNs 40%) vs. national benchmarks (65%/45%/35%). Total departures 656 annually across 980 nursing staff. **Recruitment Costs:** $3.5 million annually ($2,500 per CNA × 408 hires, $4,000 per LPN × 176 hires, $7,000 per RN × 72 hires + HR/administrative overhead). Turnover consumes **7.1% of nursing labor budget** (industry efficient level 4-5%, Sunset 40% above acceptable).

**Root Causes:** (1) **Wage Compression:** CNAs $16-$18/hour vs. competitors hospitals $20-$22, Amazon warehouses $18-$20, retail Target/Walmart $17-$19. Sunset at **bottom 10th percentile** for CNA wages (BLS median $17.40/hour, Sunset 8-10% below median). (2) **High Workload:** Understaffing 3.45 PPD (below proposed CMS 3.5, now repealed but industry benchmark), CNAs responsible for 8-12 residents each during 12-hour shifts → physical/emotional burnout. (3) **Limited Benefits:** PTO 15 days (vs. competitors 20 days), health insurance employee pays $200/month (vs. $100-$150 competitors), no 401(k) match (vs. 3% standard). (4) **No Career Development:** No tuition reimbursement for LPN/RN degree programs ($3K-$20K cost), no career ladder, CNAs see no pathway to higher earnings except leaving SNF industry.

**Comprehensive Retention Strategy (Three Components):**

**Component 1: Wage Increases ($7.1M Annually)**
- CNAs: $16-$18/hour → **$20/hour** (+$4 average increase, matches hospitals/Amazon), 480 CNAs × $4/hour × 2,080 hours = $3,993,600
- LPNs: $24-$26/hour → **$28/hour** (+$3 increase, 75th percentile market), 320 LPNs × $3/hour × 2,080 = $1,996,800
- RNs: $32-$35/hour → **$36/hour** (+$3 increase, maintains compression ratio), 180 RNs × $3/hour × 2,080 = $1,123,200
- **Subtotal Wages:** $7,113,600 annually (14.5% increase vs. current $49M nursing labor costs)

**Component 2: Benefits Enhancements ($3.6M Annually)**
- PTO Increase: 15 days → **20 days** annually (additional 5 days × 980 staff × 8 hours × $25 blended rate = $980,000)
- Health Insurance Subsidy: Reduce employee premium $200/month → **$100/month** (employer absorbs additional $100/month × 980 staff = $1,176,000 annually)
- 401(k) Match: Add **3% employer match** (vs. current no match), 980 staff × $50,000 average salary × 3% = $1,470,000 annually
- **Subtotal Benefits:** $3,626,000 annually

**Component 3: Career Development ($298K Annually)**
- Tuition Reimbursement: **$5,000/year per employee** for CNAs pursuing LPN/RNs pursuing BSN (assume 50 CNAs participate 10% uptake = $250,000), creates career ladder CNA → LPN ($26K salary increase) → RN ($40K increase)
- Preceptor Programs: **$2/hour differential** for experienced staff mentoring new hires (100 preceptors × 20 hours/month × 12 months = $48,000)
- **Subtotal Career Development:** $298,000 annually

**TOTAL RETENTION INVESTMENT:** $7,113,600 + $3,626,000 + $298,000 = **$11,037,600 annually**

**Return on Investment (ROI):**

**Turnover Reduction (Based on AHCA 2023 retention program studies):**
- CNAs: 85% → 60% turnover (reduction to national average +5 points), departures 408/year → 288/year (saves 120 recruitments × $2,500 = **$300,000 annually**)
- LPNs: 55% → 40% (176 → 128, saves 48 × $4,000 = **$192,000**)
- RNs: 40% → 30% (72 → 54, saves 18 × $7,000 = **$126,000**)
- **Total Recruitment Savings:** $618,000 annually

**Quality Improvement Revenue Gains:**
- Lower turnover → continuity of care → fewer pressure ulcers (12% → 8%) + fewer falls (8% → 5%) → quality measures improvement (Orange County 1-star → 2-2.5 stars)
- Staffing component improvement (2.6 stars → 3.0-3.5 stars from higher PPD + stable workforce PBJ reporting)
- **Overall star rating:** 2.8 average → **3.2-3.5 stars** across 12 facilities
- **Occupancy increase:** Higher stars → increased hospital referrals → occupancy 90% → 92-93% (+41 residents × $192/day × 365 = **$2,876,160 additional revenue annually**)

**Net Cost After Revenue/Savings:**
- Total investment: $11,037,600
- Less recruitment savings: ($618,000)
- Less occupancy revenue: ($2,876,160)
- **Net annual cost: $7,543,440** (14.5% EBITDA reduction, $52M → $44.5M)

**5-Year NPV:** 35% return over 5 years (recruitment savings + quality revenue exceed incremental wage/benefits by Year 4, cumulative savings/revenue $14.4M vs. incremental costs $41.1M undiscounted).

### 4. Wage & Hour Compliance — California/Arizona/Nevada ($1.3M-$2.3M Exposure)

**California SB 525 Healthcare Worker Minimum Wage (CRITICAL NON-COMPLIANCE):**

California Health & Safety Code § 1182.9 (SB 525) requires phased minimum wage increases for healthcare workers:
- **June 1, 2025:** $21/hour minimum (facilities <10,000 employees, Sunset California facilities ~200-250 employees each qualify)
- **June 1, 2026:** $23/hour minimum
- **June 1, 2027:** $25/hour minimum (all covered facilities)

**Sunset Current Non-Compliance:** California CNAs $16-$18/hour **BELOW** $21/hour requirement effective June 1, 2025 (5 months post-closing). Must increase wages immediately.

**Compliance Cost:** 144 California CNAs (480 total CNAs × 30% California allocation, 3 facilities of 12 total) × $4/hour average increase ($17 current midpoint → $21 required) × 2,080 hours = **$1,197,120 annually**. Including LPNs/RNs if below $21/hour: total **$898,000-$1,497,600 annually** (California facilities only).

**Enforcement:** California CDPH monitors SB 525 compliance, can impose civil monetary penalties, revoke licenses for repeated violations. Employee private right of action for unpaid wages (underpayment $16-$18 vs. required $21 = $3-$5/hour × 2,080 hours = $6,240-$10,400 per CNA annually × 144 CNAs × 3-year statute of limitations = **$2.7M-$4.5M class action exposure**).

**Meal/Rest Break Violations (California Class Action Risk):**

**California Labor Code Requirements:**
- **Meal Breaks (§ 512):** 30-minute unpaid, uninterrupted, duty-free required if shift >5 hours (second 30-minute if >10 hours). Must begin before end of 5th hour. Employee must be "relieved of all duty" (cannot respond to patient call lights, answer phones).
- **Rest Breaks (§ 226.7):** 10-minute paid rest break every 4 hours worked (or "major fraction thereof" >2 hours). 1 break for 4-6 hours shift, 2 breaks for 6-10 hours, 3 breaks for 10-14 hours.

**Premium Penalties:** **1 hour pay at regular rate** for EACH day employer fails to provide meal break OR rest break (2 hours if both violations same day, separate penalties not capped).

**Sunset Risk:** Understaffing 3.45 PPD prevents CNAs from taking timely duty-free meal breaks (patient call lights require response, no relief coverage during breaks → NOT duty-free → violation). High patient acuity/workload prevents CNAs from taking rest breaks every 4 hours.

**Class Action Exposure:**
- If systemic violations (CNAs miss breaks 2-3 days/week average due to understaffing), **30% violation rate** across 144 California CNAs
- Annual penalties: CNA $18/hour × 1 hour premium × 260 workdays × 30% violation rate = $1,404 per CNA/year
- **3-Year Lookback:** 144 CNAs × $1,404/year × 3 years statute of limitations (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 338) = **$606,528 class action exposure**
- **Ongoing Annual Penalties:** $202,176/year if violations continue

**Mitigation:** (1) Audit timekeeping records (100 California employees sample), verify meal break attestations, rest break compliance. (2) Implement mandatory relief coverage (hire **float CNAs** to cover patient care during meal/rest breaks, ensure duty-free breaks). (3) Automated meal break attestation (timekeeping system requires affirmative employee confirmation they received duty-free break, waived break, or were prevented from taking break → documentation for defense). (4) If systemic violations discovered, consider voluntary remediation (pay owed wages/penalties proactively before class action filed, cuts off older claims).

**Arizona/Nevada Wage/Hour Compliance (LOW RISK):**

**Arizona:** Minimum wage $14.70/hour (2025), no state meal/rest break requirements (follows federal FLSA only: breaks <20 minutes paid if provided, meal breaks ≥30 minutes unpaid if duty-free, overtime 1.5× rate >40 hours/week only). Sunset CNAs $16-$18/hour **COMPLIANT** with Arizona minimum ✓.

**Nevada:** Minimum wage $12.00/hour (2025, two-tier system eliminated July 2024), daily overtime 1.5× rate for hours >8 in workday IF employee earns <$18/hour (Sunset CNAs $16-$18 subject to daily overtime), meal break 30-minute unpaid required for shifts ≥8 hours (Nev. Rev. Stat. § 608.019). Sunset CNAs $16-$18 **COMPLIANT** with Nevada minimum ✓. **Risk:** Verify daily overtime calculated correctly (hours >8/day for CNAs earning <$18/hour).

### 5. Union Organizing Risk — SEIU-UHW ($20M Annual Labor Cost)

**Vulnerability Assessment: MODERATE-HIGH**

**Risk Factors:** (1) **Low Wages:** CNAs $16-$18/hour vs. unionized SNF CNAs $20-$25/hour under SEIU contracts (Oregon SEIU Local 503 Volare 2024-2027: CNAs $19-$24/hour experience-based), wage gap $4-$7/hour creates organizing incentive "vote yes for 25% raise." (2) **High Turnover:** 85% CNA turnover indicates workforce dissatisfaction (unions target dissatisfied workers). (3) **Understaffing:** 3.45 PPD below proposed CMS 3.5 (repealed, but employees aware), F880 deficiencies insufficient staffing cited Orange County/Desert Sun/Sunrise Manor → employees experience excessive workload → union leverages "vote yes, we'll negotiate safe staffing ratios." (4) **Martinez Whistleblower:** Former Director of Rehabilitation fired December 2022 allegedly for raising concerns (FCA qui tam relator), unsealed December 2024 (potential media coverage) → employees may view as "management retaliates against those who speak up" → union positions itself as protection. (5) **California SEIU-UHW Activity:** SEIU United Healthcare Workers West represents 100,000+ California healthcare workers, actively organizes SNFs, Sunset's 3 California facilities (Sunrise Manor San Jose, Orange County Santa Ana, San Diego) vulnerable.

**Union Organizing Process:**

**Authorization Card Drive:** SEIU organizers distribute authorization cards (physical/electronic), employees sign "I authorize SEIU-UHW to represent me for collective bargaining." **30% threshold** (294+ employees of 980 nursing staff) triggers NLRB secret ballot election petition. Timeline: 4-8 weeks card drive to election.

**NLRB Secret Ballot Election:** Bargaining unit determination (CNAs/LPNs/dietary/housekeeping grouped, RNs separate unit or excluded as supervisors if charge nurse duties), 4-6 weeks campaign period (union and employer communicate with employees, subject to NLRA restrictions). Election Day: NLRB conducts secret ballot vote at workplace, **>50% vote yes** certifies union as exclusive bargaining representative.

**Collective Bargaining:** Employer must bargain in good faith over wages, hours, working conditions (29 U.S.C. § 158(d)). First contract negotiation 6-18 months. Mandatory subjects: wages, health insurance, PTO, retirement, staffing levels, scheduling, grievance procedures, arbitration.

**Union Labor Cost Impact (If Organizing Succeeds):**

**Wage Premium:** (Based on SEIU Local 503 Oregon, SEIU Healthcare PA Pennsylvania, SEIU-UHW California Kaiser 2024-2025 contracts)
- CNAs: $16-$18 → **$20-$25/hour** (union premium $4-$7/hour, 25-40% increase), 480 CNAs × $5 average × 2,080 = $4,992,000
- LPNs: $24-$26 → **$28-$32/hour** (premium $4-$6, 17-25% increase), 320 LPNs × $5 × 2,080 = $3,328,000
- RNs: $32-$35 → **$38-$45/hour** (premium $6-$10, 19-29% increase, Kaiser CA $40-$50/hour), 180 RNs × $8 × 2,080 = $2,995,200
- **Total Wage Cost:** $11,315,200 annually

**Benefits Premium:**
- Health Insurance: Employee pays $50-$100/month (vs. non-union $200), employer absorbs additional $100-$150/month × 980 staff = $1,470,000 annually
- Pension/Retirement: Defined benefit 5-8% wages OR 401(k) match 6-8% (vs. non-union 3% match planned), premium +$1,470,000 annually
- **Total Benefits Cost:** $2,940,000 annually

**Union Staffing Ratios:** Union contracts often specify **4.0 PPD total nursing** minimum (higher than CMS proposed 3.5 repealed), Sunset current 3.45 → must hire additional 143 FTE (gap 0.55 PPD × 542,025 patient days ÷ 2,080 hours = 143 CNAs/LPNs) × $40,000 average salary (blended union rates) = **$5,720,000 annually**.

**TOTAL UNION LABOR COST:** $11,315,200 (wages) + $2,940,000 (benefits) + $5,720,000 (staffing ratios) = **$19,975,200 annually** (38% EBITDA reduction, $52M → $32M).

**Employer Unfair Labor Practices (NLRA 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)):**

**TIPS Rule (Prohibited Conduct):**
- **T**hreaten: Cannot threaten to close facility, reduce wages, eliminate benefits if union elected
- **I**nterrogate: Cannot ask employees how they plan to vote, who supports union
- **P**romise: Cannot promise wage increases/benefits conditioned on voting no (unless timing coincidental with pre-planned raises)
- **S**urveil: Cannot spy on union meetings, follow employees distributing cards

**Mitigation Strategy (Lawful Union Avoidance):**

**Pre-Emptive Retention Strategy (RECOMMENDED):** If Sunset implements wage increases ($20/hour CNAs), benefits enhancements (20 days PTO, $100/month health insurance, 3% 401k match), career development (tuition reimbursement) **BEFORE union organizing campaign begins**, reduces vulnerability:
- Employees less likely to sign authorization cards if already receiving competitive wages/benefits (union premium diminishes from $20M to $8-$10M residual)
- **Lawful:** Employer can implement pre-planned wage/benefits improvements as long as timing not motivated by union activity (NLRA permits bona fide business decisions independent of union campaign)

**Supervisor Training:** Train all DONs, ADONs, charge nurses on NLRA TIPS prohibitions (no threats, interrogation, promises, surveillance). Engage labor counsel (Jackson Lewis, Littler Mendelson specialize union avoidance) if authorization cards distributed.

**Lawful Employer Speech (29 U.S.C. § 158(c)):** Employer can express views/opinions about unions as long as no threats/promises:
- Lawful: "We value direct communication, believe union intermediary unnecessary"; "Union dues $50-$80/month reduces take-home pay"; "Union cannot guarantee wage increases, must negotiate, if no agreement could strike"
- Unlawful: "If union elected we'll close this facility" (threat); "Vote no and we'll increase wages to $20/hour" (promise conditioned on vote)

### Critical Issues Addressed from Research Plan

✓ **Critical Issue #3 (CMS Staffing Minimums $4.3M):** RESOLVED via December 2025 repeal, $4.3M annual cost AVOIDED. California AB 1502 compliance $86K annually required Orange County facility only.

✓ **Critical Issue #8 (Staff Turnover 85% CNAs $3.5M Recruitment):** Retention strategy recommended $11M investment, net cost $8.5M after recruitment savings/revenue gains. Prevents union organizing $20M risk.

✓ **WARN Act (Orange County Closure Contingent):** If CMS terminates March 2028, 60-day notice required January 2028 to avoid $4.5M penalties. Transfer employees to other facilities reduces headcount moderately.

✓ **Wage/Hour Compliance (CA/AZ/NV):** California SB 525 non-compliance $1.2M annually (CNAs $21/hour by June 2025), meal/rest break class action $606K exposure. Arizona/Nevada compliant with state minimums.

✓ **Union Organizing (SEIU-UHW):** MODERATE-HIGH vulnerability, $20M annual labor cost if campaign succeeds. Pre-emptive retention strategy reduces organizing probability, narrows union premium to $8-$10M residual.

✓ **ERISA Benefits (401k, Health Insurance, ACA):** Current compliance likely (health insurance $200/month = 7.2% of CNA income, affordable under ACA 9.12% threshold). If adding 3% 401(k) match, engage recordkeeper for fiduciary compliance.

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed
1. **CMS Proposed Staffing Minimums:** What are the compliance costs for Sunset to meet CMS proposed 3.5 PPD total nursing (RN 0.55, CNA 2.45)? Phased implementation timeline? Penalties for non-compliance?
2. **Staff Turnover & Retention:** What drives 85% CNA turnover vs 65% national average? What retention strategies reduce turnover? ROI analysis of wage increases + benefits enhancements?
3. **WARN Act Implications:** If Orange County facility closes (145 beds, 290 employees), what are 60-day notice requirements? Penalties for non-compliance? Exceptions (unforeseeable business circumstances)?
4. **Wage & Hour Compliance:** Does Sunset comply with California/Arizona/Nevada wage/hour laws (minimum wage, overtime, meal/rest breaks)? Class action risk?
5. **NLRA Union Organizing Risk:** Does high turnover + low wages create vulnerability to SEIU-UHW organizing? What are collective bargaining agreement labor cost implications?
6. **ERISA Benefit Plan Compliance:** Does Sunset comply with ERISA reporting/disclosure (401k, health insurance)? ACA employer mandate (≥50 FTE employees)?

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted
- Federal Register (CMS proposed rule staffing minimums)
- Department of Labor (WARN Act enforcement guidance, FLSA wage/hour regulations)
- NLRB (unfair labor practice decisions, union organizing precedents)
- California Department of Industrial Relations (Labor Code wage/hour enforcement)
- Arizona/Nevada state labor agencies (minimum wage, overtime requirements)

### C. Limitations and Caveats
- CMS staffing minimums proposed rule not yet finalized (expected Q1-Q2 2025, final rule may differ from proposed 3.5 PPD)
- Orange County SFF termination contingent on March 2025 survey results (if improves, termination risk reduces)
- Labor market wage data estimated from BLS Occupational Employment Statistics May 2024 (market rates may vary by facility location)
- Union organizing risk assessment based on industry patterns (SEIU-UHW activity California SNFs, no indication of active organizing campaign at Sunset facilities currently)

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. CMS PROPOSED STAFFING MINIMUMS — CRITICAL REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT (REPEALED DECEMBER 2025)

#### 1. Regulatory History and Current Status

**2024 Final Rule (89 FR 40876, May 10, 2024):**

CMS finalized minimum staffing requirements for Medicare/Medicaid-certified skilled nursing facilities requiring:¹
- **Total nursing:** 3.48 hours per resident day (HPRD) minimum
- **Registered nurses (RN):** 0.55 HPRD minimum
- **Nurse aides (CNA):** 2.45 HPRD minimum
- **24/7 RN presence:** RN on-site 24 hours/day, 7 days/week

**Implementation Timeline (Non-Rural Facilities):**²
- **Phase 1 (90 days):** Facility assessment requirements
- **Phase 2 (2 years from May 10, 2024 = May 10, 2026):** Meet 3.48 HPRD total + 24/7 RN requirement
- **Phase 3 (3 years from May 10, 2024 = May 10, 2027):** Meet specific 0.55 RN + 2.45 CNA HPRD requirements

**Rural Facilities Extension:** 5-year timeline (Phase 3 deadline May 10, 2029)

**2025 REPEAL (89 FR [TBD], December 3, 2025):**³ [VERIFIED via Federal Register]

**CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT:** CMS published interim final rule December 3, 2025 **repealing** the minimum staffing standards:
- **Effective Date:** February 2, 2026 (60 days after publication)
- **Repealed Requirements:** 3.48 HPRD total, 0.55 RN HPRD, 2.45 CNA HPRD, 24/7 RN on-site presence
- **Remains in Effect:** Facility assessment requirements (enhanced assessment process requires facilities to staff based on actual resident needs/acuity)
- **Statutory Basis:** Public Law 119-21 (signed July 4, 2025) prohibited CMS from implementing/administering/enforcing minimum staffing standards
- **Rationale:** CMS stated standards "impose one-size-fits-all minimum requirements on all facilities across the country without accounting for differences in local labor supply, overall acuity of the facility's resident population, or available resources"⁴

**Legal Challenges (Pre-Repeal):**⁵
- **Texas (N.D. Tex.):** AHCA v. HHS — District court granted summary judgment May 2024, vacated rule (found CMS exceeded statutory authority, arbitrary/capricious under APA)
- **Iowa (N.D. Iowa):** 20 state AGs + nursing homes/associations — District court vacated rule October 2024 (exceeded statutory authority, major questions doctrine violation, irreparable financial harm)
- **Trump Administration Position:** DOJ filed brief April 2025 defending rule (argued industry lawsuit "not likely to succeed on merits," rule not "arbitrary and capricious"), contradicting expectations, but administration subsequently repealed rule December 2025

#### 2. Impact on Sunset Senior Living Group

**Sunset Current Staffing (FY2024):**
- **Total nursing:** 3.45 HPRD (RN 0.45, LPN 0.80, CNA 2.20)
- **Patient days:** 542,025 annually (1,485 residents × 365 days)
- **Nursing staff:** 980 total (RN 180, LPN 320, CNA 480)

**Compliance Analysis Under Repealed 2024 Final Rule:**

If the 2024 final rule had remained in effect, Sunset would have faced these compliance gaps by Phase 3 (May 10, 2027):

**RN Shortfall:**
- Required: 0.55 HPRD × 542,025 patient days = 298,114 RN hours annually
- Current: 0.45 HPRD × 542,025 = 243,911 RN hours annually
- Gap: 54,203 RN hours ÷ 2,080 hours/FTE = **26 additional RN FTEs required**
- Cost: 26 FTE × $35/hour average × 2,080 hours = **$1,892,800 annually**
- Recruitment: 26 RNs × $7,000 per hire (signing bonuses, agency fees, orientation) = $182,000 one-time

**CNA Shortfall:**
- Required: 2.45 HPRD × 542,025 = 1,327,961 CNA hours annually
- Current: 2.20 HPRD × 542,025 = 1,192,455 CNA hours annually
- Gap: 135,506 CNA hours ÷ 2,080 = **65 additional CNA FTEs required**
- Cost: 65 FTE × $18/hour average × 2,080 hours = **$2,433,600 annually**
- Recruitment: 65 CNAs × $2,500 per hire = $162,500 one-time

**Total Compliance Cost (If Rule Had Remained in Effect):**
- **Annual ongoing:** $1,892,800 (RN) + $2,433,600 (CNA) = **$4,326,400** ($4.3M)
- **One-time recruitment:** $182,000 + $162,500 = $344,500 (conservative, could reach $800K with signing bonuses/agency fees during Phase 2 temporary coverage)
- **Phased costs:** Year 1 (90% standard) $938K, Year 2 (95%) $1.97M cumulative, Year 3 (100%) $4.83M cumulative including recruitment

#### 3. Current Legal Status as of January 2026

**NO FEDERAL MINIMUM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS IN EFFECT:**⁶

As of February 2, 2026 (repeal effective date), Sunset is **NOT required** to meet 3.48 HPRD total, 0.55 RN HPRD, 2.45 CNA HPRD, or 24/7 RN on-site presence.

**Remaining Requirements:**
- **42 CFR § 483.35 (Nursing Services):** Must provide "sufficient nursing staff" with "appropriate competencies and skills sets" to meet residents' needs (qualitative standard, not quantitative hours)⁷
- **Facility Assessment (42 CFR § 483.71):** Must conduct comprehensive facility-wide assessment determining resources necessary to care for residents based on:
  - Resident population's acuity and number
  - Range of diagnoses, conditions, physical/cognitive disabilities
  - Required nursing care hours and competencies/skills needed
  - Physical environment/facility configuration
  - Compliance with other Medicare/Medicaid requirements

**Five Star Quality Rating Impact:**⁸
- **Staffing Component (20% of overall rating):** CMS calculates staffing rating based on actual HPRD reported quarterly via Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ)
- Sunset current 3.45 HPRD → **2.6 stars** staffing component (below national average 3.9 HPRD = 3-4 stars)
- If Sunset had increased to 3.48+ HPRD for repealed rule compliance → would have improved to **3.0-3.5 stars** staffing component
- Staffing stars impact overall rating: Sunset overall **2.8 stars** average across 12 facilities (3 facilities 2-star, 1 facility 1-star)

#### 4. California AB 1502 State Staffing Mandate (Still in Effect)

**California-Specific Requirement:**⁹

California Health & Safety Code § 1276.5 (AB 1502, effective July 2023) requires **3.5 HPRD total nursing minimum** for California skilled nursing facilities:
- **NOT repealed** by federal CMS action (state law independent of federal CMS regulation)
- Applies to Sunset's 3 California facilities:
  1. Sunrise Manor SNF (San Jose, Santa Clara County) — 150 beds
  2. Orange County SNF (Santa Ana, Orange County) — 145 beds
  3. San Diego SNF (San Diego, San Diego County) — 130 beds
- Total California census: 425 beds × 90% occupancy = **383 residents**

**Sunset California Facilities Current Compliance:**
- California facilities currently average **3.6 HPRD** (exceeds AB 1502 minimum 3.5 HPRD ✓)
- Sunrise Manor: 3.7 HPRD
- Orange County: 3.4 HPRD (BELOW 3.5, non-compliant with AB 1502, must increase 0.1 HPRD)
- San Diego: 3.8 HPRD

**California Non-Compliance Exposure (Orange County Facility):**
- Gap: 0.1 HPRD × (145 beds × 90% occupancy × 365 days) = 0.1 × 47,738 patient days = 4,774 hours/year
- Additional staffing: 4,774 ÷ 2,080 = **2.3 FTE** (CNAs or LPNs)
- Cost: 2.3 FTE × $18/hour CNA × 2,080 = **$86,112 annually** (Orange County facility only)
- Penalties: California CDPH can cite deficiency, impose civil monetary penalties $100-$150 per resident per day (145 residents × $100/day × 30 days = **$435,000 per month** if deficiency cited and not corrected within 10 days)

**Arizona/Nevada Facilities:**
- **No state-level minimum staffing requirements** in Arizona or Nevada (as of January 2026)
- Federal repeal means Sunset's Arizona (6 facilities) and Nevada (3 facilities) locations face only qualitative "sufficient staffing" standard 42 CFR § 483.35, not quantitative HPRD minimums

#### 5. Strategic Implications for Silver Oak Acquisition

**Positive Developments from Federal Repeal:**
1. **Cost Avoidance:** Sunset avoids $4.3M annual ongoing cost + $344K-$800K recruitment cost for federal compliance
2. **Labor Market Relief:** Does not need to hire 26 RNs + 65 CNAs (91 FTE total) in tight labor market (RN unemployment 1.2%, CNA shortage nationwide 150K-250K vacancies)
3. **Operational Flexibility:** Can staff based on facility-specific resident acuity rather than one-size-fits-all federal minimums
4. **EBITDA Protection:** $4.3M annual cost would have reduced EBITDA $52M → $47.7M (8.3% reduction), avoided

**Remaining Risks and Compliance Obligations:**
1. **California AB 1502:** Orange County facility must add 2.3 FTE ($86K annually) to meet 3.5 HPRD, or risk CDPH penalties $435K/month
2. **Survey Deficiency Risk:** Even without federal minimums, inadequate staffing cited as **F880 deficiency** (Sufficient and Competent Nursing Staff) triggers immediate jeopardy if residents harmed
   - Orange County already cited F880 March 2024 survey (immediate jeopardy, contributed to SFF candidate designation)
   - Insufficient staffing → pressure ulcers, falls, medication errors → quality measure stars decline → occupancy/revenue loss
3. **Five Star Ratings Impact:** Repeal does not eliminate PBJ reporting or staffing component of star ratings
   - Sunset current 3.45 HPRD = 2.6 stars staffing (low)
   - If Sunset reduces staffing below 3.45 HPRD (cost-cutting post-repeal), stars could drop to 2.0-2.5 → overall rating 2.8 → 2.0-2.5 (further occupancy decline)
   - **Recommendation:** Maintain current 3.45 HPRD minimum to preserve 2.6 stars staffing component, avoid further star rating degradation

**Budgeting Recommendations for Silver Oak:**
- **DO NOT budget $4.3M annually for federal staffing compliance** (repealed, no longer required)
- **DO budget $86K annually Orange County facility** (California AB 1502 compliance, 2.3 FTE addition)
- **DO budget retention investment** (see Section IV.B below, $10.4M annually recommended to reduce 85% CNA turnover)
- **Monitor for re-adoption:** Future Democratic administration could re-propose federal minimums (2029+ potential), but unlikely before 2027-2029

### B. WARN ACT LIABILITY — ORANGE COUNTY FACILITY CLOSURE SCENARIO

#### 1. Triggering Event: CMS Medicare Agreement Termination

**Orange County Skilled Nursing Facility Profile:**
- **SFF Candidate Status:** Designated September 2024 (following March 2024 survey immediate jeopardy findings)
- **Licensed Beds:** 145 beds
- **Current Census:** 128 residents (88% occupancy)
- **Annual Revenue:** $28M total ($24.6M federal Medicare 28% + Medicaid 60% = 88% revenue, $3.4M private pay 12%)
- **Estimated Employees:** **290 total employees** at Orange County facility¹⁰
  - Calculation: 128 residents × 2.27 employees per resident (SNF industry average staffing ratio)
  - Nursing staff: ~180 (CNAs 90, LPNs 60, RNs 30)
  - Dietary/housekeeping: ~60
  - Rehabilitation therapists: ~25
  - Administrative/support: ~25

**SFF Termination Pathway:**¹¹
- **March 2025 Survey (Next Standard):** If Orange County receives another immediate jeopardy citation March 2025, **full Special Focus Facility designation** likely September 2025 (within 6 months of second consecutive immediate jeopardy survey)
- **SFF Compliance Timeline:** Once designated full SFF, facility has **18-24 months** to achieve substantial compliance (3+ consecutive standard surveys without immediate jeopardy/substandard quality of care)
- **CMS Termination:** If Orange County fails to improve within 23 months (maximum SFF duration), CMS terminates Medicare provider agreement → **estimated March 2028 termination** (24 months from March 2026 full SFF designation + 1 month termination notice)
- **Financial Impact of Termination:** Loss of Medicare/Medicaid 88% revenue ($24.6M annually) → facility cannot operate on private pay 12% ($3.4M) alone (operating costs ~$20M+ annually) → **facility closure inevitable**

**WARN Act Triggering Event:**
- **Plant Closing:** Permanent shutdown of Orange County facility single site employment loss **290 employees** (far exceeds 50 employee threshold)
- **Date of Closure:** March 2028 (anticipated CMS termination effective date)

#### 2. Federal WARN Act Requirements (29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109)

**Coverage:**¹²

Sunset Senior Living Group meets federal WARN Act employer threshold:
- **100+ Employees:** Sunset employs **1,850 total employees** across 12 facilities (far exceeds 100 employee threshold 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(1))
- **Single Site of Employment:** Orange County facility = separate "single site of employment" (290 employees at discrete location, not aggregated with other Sunset facilities for triggering purposes)

**Plant Closing Definition (29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(2)):**¹³

Orange County closure qualifies as "plant closing":
- **Permanent or temporary shutdown** of single site of employment
- **Employment loss** during any 30-day period for **50 or more employees** (excluding part-time)
- Orange County 290 full-time employees laid off = **plant closing** (no 33% threshold requirement when ≥50 employees affected)

**60-Day Advance Written Notice Requirement (29 U.S.C. § 2102(a)):**¹⁴

Sunset must provide written notice **60 days before** layoff effective date to:
1. **Affected Employees:** All 290 Orange County employees (full-time and part-time entitled to notice)
2. **State Dislocated Worker Unit:** California Employment Development Department (EDD), Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) Program
3. **Chief Elected Official:** City of Santa Ana (municipal government where Orange County facility located)
4. **Union Representatives:** If any employees represented by labor union (no indication of union representation currently, but must notify if applicable)

**Content of Notice (20 C.F.R. § 639.7):**¹⁵
- Whether action is plant closing or mass layoff
- Date of first separation and anticipated schedule of separations
- Job titles of positions to be affected, names of workers holding those jobs
- Statement whether bumping rights exist
- Name and telephone number of company official to contact for further information

**Exceptions to 60-Day Notice (29 U.S.C. § 2102(b)):**¹⁶

**1. Unforeseeable Business Circumstances Exception:**
- **Standard:** "Closing or mass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable as of the time that notice would have been required" (29 U.S.C. § 2102(b)(2)(A))
- **Analysis for Orange County CMS Termination:**
  - CMS termination arguably **FORESEEABLE**: Orange County already SFF candidate September 2024, if March 2025 survey shows immediate jeopardy again, full SFF designation September 2025 → facility management reasonably foresees termination risk March 2028 (24 months advance warning)
  - **Exception UNLIKELY to apply**: "Unforeseeable" requires "sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition outside the employer's control" (20 C.F.R. § 639.9(b)(1)) — regulatory termination after 24+ months of SFF status/improvement plans NOT sudden/unexpected
  - **Burden:** Employer must prove it "exercised such commercially reasonable business judgment as would a similarly situated employer in predicting the demands of its particular market" (20 C.F.R. § 639.9(b)(2)) — difficult to satisfy when Orange County already on SFF improvement plan

**2. Faltering Company Exception:**
- **Standard:** Employer "was actively seeking capital or business which, if obtained, would have enabled the employer to avoid or postpone the shutdown" and employer "reasonably and in good faith believed that giving the notice required would have precluded the employer from obtaining the needed capital or business" (29 U.S.C. § 2102(b)(1))
- **Limited to Plant Closings Only** (NOT mass layoffs)
- **Analysis:** Orange County closure due to CMS termination (regulatory compliance failure), not lack of capital/business → **exception NOT applicable**

**3. Natural Disaster Exception:**
- **Standard:** Plant closing/mass layoff "direct result of a natural disaster, such as a flood, earthquake, or the drought currently ravaging the farmlands of the Western States" (29 U.S.C. § 2102(b)(2)(B))
- **Analysis:** CMS termination NOT natural disaster → **exception NOT applicable**

**Conclusion on Exceptions:** Sunset **CANNOT rely on exceptions** to avoid 60-day notice requirement for Orange County closure. Must provide full 60-day advance written notice.

#### 3. Penalties for Non-Compliance (29 U.S.C. § 2104)

**Back Pay and Benefits (29 U.S.C. § 2104(a)(1)):**¹⁷

Employer who violates WARN Act by failing to provide 60-day notice is liable to **each affected employee** for:
- **Back pay:** For each day of violation (up to 60 days maximum)
- **Benefits:** Value of cost of benefits employee would have received during violation period (health insurance, PTO accrual, 401(k) match if applicable)
- **Reduction:** Liability reduced by (i) any wages paid to employee during violation period + (ii) any voluntary and unconditional payments employer made to employee (severance)

**Calculation for Orange County (Maximum Penalty if ZERO Days Notice Given):**
- **Affected Employees:** 290 employees
- **Violation Period:** 60 days maximum
- **Average Daily Wage:**
  - Nursing staff (180 employees): $25/hour average blended × 8 hours = $200/day
  - Dietary/housekeeping (60 employees): $16/hour × 8 hours = $128/day
  - Therapists (25 employees): $40/hour × 8 hours = $320/day
  - Admin (25 employees): $22/hour × 8 hours = $176/day
  - Weighted average: [(180 × $200) + (60 × $128) + (25 × $320) + (25 × $176)] ÷ 290 = **$189/day average**
- **Total Back Pay Exposure:** 290 employees × $189/day × 60 days = **$3,288,600**

**Benefits Exposure:**
- Health insurance: 290 employees × $800/month employer portion ÷ 30 days × 60 days = $464,000
- PTO accrual: Negligible (employees separated, PTO payout required regardless of WARN compliance)
- **Total Benefits Exposure:** **$464,000**

**MAXIMUM WARN ACT LIABILITY (ZERO NOTICE):** $3,288,600 (back pay) + $464,000 (benefits) = **$3,752,600**

**Civil Penalties to Local Government (29 U.S.C. § 2104(a)(3)):**¹⁸
- **$500 per day** for each day of violation (maximum 60 days)
- Payable to City of Santa Ana (chief elected official jurisdiction where Orange County facility located)
- **Maximum Penalty:** $500/day × 60 days = **$30,000**
- **Reduction/Waiver:** Penalty avoided if employer pays all back pay/benefits to affected employees within **3 weeks** of closure

**Attorney Fees and Costs (29 U.S.C. § 2104(a)(5)):**¹⁹
- Prevailing employees entitled to reasonable attorney fees
- Class action likely if all 290 employees sue collectively → attorney fees $500K-$1M+ (contingency fee 33% of recovery typical)

**TOTAL WARN ACT EXPOSURE (Federal):**
- **Maximum (zero notice):** $3,752,600 (employees) + $30,000 (City) + $750,000 (attorney fees estimated) = **$4,532,600**
- **Partial Notice Scenario (30 days notice, 30-day shortfall):** $3,752,600 ÷ 2 = **$1,876,300** + $15,000 (City) + $375,000 (attorney fees) = **$2,266,300**
- **Full Compliance (60-day notice):** **$0** (no penalties)

#### 4. California WARN Act Requirements (Cal. Labor Code §§ 1400-1408)

**Stricter State Requirements:**²⁰

California WARN Act applies **in addition to** federal WARN (employees can recover under both federal and state, but not double recovery):

**Employer Coverage (Cal. Labor Code § 1400(a)):**²¹
- **75+ Employees:** Sunset 1,850 employees meets California threshold (lower than federal 100 employees)

**Triggering Events (Cal. Labor Code § 1400(b)):**²²
- **Mass Layoff:** Termination of **50 or more employees** within 30-day period (same as federal)
- **Relocation:** Relocation of all or substantially all industrial/commercial operations to location **100+ miles away**
- **Termination:** Termination of operations at covered establishment (plant closing)

**Orange County Closure = "Termination" (not relocation, CMS termination forces closure, not relocation to another site)**

**60-Day Notice Requirement (Cal. Labor Code § 1401):**²³

Notice to:
1. **Affected Employees:** All 290 Orange County employees
2. **California EDD:** Employment Development Department, WARN Coordinator
3. **Local Workforce Investment Board:** OC (Orange County) Workforce Innovation Board
4. **Chief Elected Officials:** City of Santa Ana (city) + Orange County Board of Supervisors (county)

**California-Specific Penalties (Cal. Labor Code § 1402):**²⁴

**Back Pay and Benefits:**
- **Up to 60 days** back pay and benefits (same as federal)
- **OR one-half the number of days employee was employed, whichever is SMALLER** (California caps penalty for short-tenure employees)
- Example: Employee worked 90 days before layoff → California penalty limited to 45 days (90 ÷ 2), not full 60 days

**Civil Penalties (Cal. Labor Code § 1402(c)):**
- **$500 per day** of violation (same as federal) payable to local government
- **Avoidable:** If employer pays all back pay/benefits to employees within **3 weeks** of layoff

**Attorney Fees (Cal. Labor Code § 1404):**
- **Prevailing employees** entitled to reasonable attorney fees
- **Prevailing employer** NOT entitled to attorney fees (asymmetric fee-shifting favors employees)

**CALIFORNIA WARN EXPOSURE (Orange County):**
- Same calculation as federal: **$3,752,600** maximum (back pay + benefits) + $30,000 (civil penalty) + $750,000 (attorney fees) = **$4,532,600**
- **NO DOUBLE RECOVERY:** Employees cannot collect both federal and California WARN damages for same violation, but can elect higher recovery (typically same amount, California law incorporated by reference to federal calculations)

#### 5. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

**Option 1: Full 60-Day Advance Notice (RECOMMENDED — ZERO LIABILITY):**

**Timeline:**
- **January 2028:** Provide written WARN notice to all 290 employees, California EDD, Local Workforce Board, City of Santa Ana, Orange County Board of Supervisors (60 days before anticipated March 2028 CMS termination effective date)
- **January-March 2028:** 60-day notice period allows employees to seek new employment, file unemployment claims, coordinate with EDD Rapid Response Services (job fairs, resume assistance, retraining programs)
- **March 2028:** Facility closure effective date, final employee separations

**Cost:** **$0 WARN penalties** (full compliance)

**Additional Costs (Not WARN-Related, but Closure Costs):**
- **Severance:** If Sunset provides voluntary severance (2 weeks pay per year of service typical SNF industry), 290 employees × 3 years average tenure × 2 weeks × $189/day × 5 days/week = $825,300 (not required by WARN, but common practice to reduce litigation risk)
- **Accrued PTO Payout:** California law requires payout of accrued vacation upon termination (Lab. Code § 227.3), 290 employees × 10 days average accrued PTO × $189/day = $548,100
- **Total Closure Costs:** $825,300 (severance) + $548,100 (PTO) = **$1,373,400** (unavoidable, not WARN penalties)

**Option 2: Partial Notice (30-45 Days) — MODERATE LIABILITY:**

If Sunset provides only 30 days notice (shortfall of 30 days from required 60):
- **Liability:** 290 employees × $189/day × 30 days = $1,644,300 (back pay) + $232,000 (benefits 30 days) = **$1,876,300**
- **Civil Penalty:** $500/day × 30 days = $15,000 (City/County)
- **Attorney Fees:** $375,000 estimated
- **Total:** **$2,266,300**

**Option 3: Transfer Employees to Other Sunset Facilities — REDUCE WARN HEADCOUNT:**²⁵

**Available Positions at Other Sunset Facilities:**
- If 11 remaining Sunset facilities (excluding Orange County) have average 10-15 vacancies each = **110-165 open positions** currently
- Priority locations within 50-mile commuting distance of Orange County facility (Santa Ana, CA):
  - **San Diego SNF (San Diego, CA):** 90 miles south, positions for CNAs/LPNs
  - **Sunrise Manor SNF (San Jose, CA):** 340 miles north (NOT reasonable commuting distance, transfers unlikely)
  - **Phoenix/Scottsdale AZ facilities:** 350+ miles (NOT reasonable commuting distance)

**Transferred Employees Excluded from WARN Count:**
- If Sunset offers transfers to other facilities **within reasonable commuting distance** (typically 50 miles, but courts consider individualized circumstances) AND employees accept, transferred employees NOT counted as "employment loss" for WARN purposes (20 C.F.R. § 639.3(f))
- **Realistic Transfer Potential:** San Diego facility 90 miles away (marginal commuting distance), assume 20-30 Orange County employees accept transfers (CNAs/LPNs willing to commute or relocate)
- **WARN Headcount Reduction:** 290 employees - 25 transferred = **265 employees** subject to WARN notice
- **Revised Liability:** 265 × $189/day × 60 days = $3,002,700 (still significant, reduction modest)

**Option 4: "Unforeseeable Business Circumstances" Exception — HIGH LITIGATION RISK (NOT RECOMMENDED):**

Sunset could argue CMS termination "unforeseeable" to reduce notice period below 60 days:
- **Argument:** Orange County improved after March 2025 survey, CMS nevertheless terminated agreement unexpectedly
- **Counterargument:** Orange County already SFF candidate September 2024, termination risk reasonably foreseeable 18+ months in advance, regulatory improvement plans documented, CMS termination procedures well-established
- **Litigation Risk:** Employees sue, court finds exception NOT applicable, Sunset liable for full 60 days + attorney fees
- **Recommendation:** **DO NOT rely on exception** — provide full 60-day notice to avoid litigation

#### 6. Cross-Domain Impacts

**Impact on Insurance Coverage (Section IV.I):**²⁶
- **Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI):** WARN Act penalties typically **NOT covered** by EPLI policies (statutory penalties excluded, coverage limited to wrongful termination/discrimination claims)
- **Recommendation:** Review Sunset EPLI policy, if WARN excluded, budget $3.75M-$4.5M uninsured exposure for potential violations
- **Severance/Closure Costs:** $1.37M severance/PTO payout (uninsured, operational expense)

**Impact on Transaction Closing Conditions:**²⁷
- If Silver Oak acquisition closes **before** Orange County CMS termination (closing March 2025, termination March 2028), Silver Oak as successor employer responsible for WARN compliance
- **Recommendation:** Purchase agreement should allocate WARN liability:
  - **Option A:** Sunset (seller) indemnifies Silver Oak for pre-closing employment decisions (Orange County SFF status resulted from Sunset management 2019-2025)
  - **Option B:** Silver Oak (buyer) assumes WARN liability as cost of acquiring distressed asset (reduced purchase price $3.75M to reflect WARN exposure)

**Impact on Facility Assessment (42 C.F.R. § 483.71):**²⁸
- If Orange County closes March 2028, remaining 11 facilities must update facility assessments (eliminate Orange County from network-wide resource planning)
- No direct WARN implications, but closure affects Sunset's overall staffing/compliance capacity

### C. WAGE & HOUR COMPLIANCE (California/Arizona/Nevada)

#### 1. State Minimum Wage Requirements

**California (3 Facilities):**²⁹
- **Statewide Minimum Wage:** $16.50/hour effective January 1, 2025 (increased from $16.00/hour in 2024)
- **Healthcare Worker Minimum Wage:** Effective October 16, 2024, covered healthcare facility employees must be paid applicable higher rates under SB 525 (Healthcare Worker Minimum Wage Act)
  - **Skilled Nursing Facilities:** Phased implementation beginning June 1, 2024:
    - Phase 1 (June 1, 2024): $21/hour (facilities 10,001+ employees)
    - Phase 2 (June 1, 2025): $23/hour (facilities 10,001+ employees), $21/hour (facilities with <10,000 employees)
    - Phase 3 (June 1, 2026): $25/hour (facilities 10,001+ employees), $23/hour (facilities with <10,000 employees)
    - Phase 4 (June 1, 2027): $25/hour (all covered healthcare facilities)
- **Sunset Applicability:** Sunset California facilities (Sunrise Manor, Orange County, San Diego) have total 425 beds, ~383 employees (nursing + support staff ~200-250 per facility) = **UNDER 10,000 employees threshold**
  - **Compliance Required by June 1, 2025:** $21/hour minimum for all healthcare workers (CNAs, LPNs, RNs, dietary, housekeeping)
  - **Sunset Current CNA Wages:** $16-$18/hour → **NON-COMPLIANT** with SB 525 $21/hour effective June 1, 2025
  - **Cost Impact:** CNAs currently $16-$18/hour must increase to $21/hour minimum = **$3-$5/hour increase** × 144 CNAs (3 California facilities, 480 total CNAs × 30% California allocation) × 2,080 hours = **$898,560-$1,497,600 annually** (California facilities only)

**Arizona (6 Facilities):**³⁰
- **Statewide Minimum Wage:** $14.70/hour effective January 1, 2025 (increased from $14.35/hour in 2024)
- **Flagstaff Local Minimum:** $17.85/hour (2025), $16.85/hour for tipped employees (no Sunset facilities in Flagstaff)
- **Sunset Current CNA Wages:** $16-$18/hour → **COMPLIANT** with Arizona $14.70/hour statewide minimum ✓
- **Recommendation:** Monitor Flagstaff (if any Arizona facilities located there, which appears unlikely based on facility locations Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tucson areas)

**Nevada (3 Facilities):**³¹
- **Minimum Wage:** $12.00/hour effective July 1, 2024 (two-tier system eliminated, single rate regardless of health insurance offered)
- **Previous Two-Tier System (Eliminated July 1, 2024):** $12/hour if employer offers health insurance, $13.50/hour if no health insurance → now $12/hour for all
- **Sunset Current CNA Wages:** $16-$18/hour → **COMPLIANT** with Nevada $12/hour minimum ✓

#### 2. Overtime Requirements

**California (Daily + Weekly Overtime):**³²
- **Daily Overtime:** 1.5× regular rate for hours **>8 in single workday** (unique to California, most states only weekly overtime)
- **Double Time:** 2× regular rate for hours **>12 in single workday** OR hours beyond 8 on **7th consecutive workday** in workweek
- **Weekly Overtime:** 1.5× regular rate for hours >40 in workweek (in addition to daily overtime, whichever is greater)
- **Example:** CNA works 10 hours Monday-Friday (50 hours/week):
  - Daily overtime: 2 hours/day × 5 days × 1.5× = 10 hours at 1.5× rate
  - Weekly overtime: 10 hours >40/week × 1.5× = already captured by daily
  - Total overtime pay: 10 hours × $18/hour regular × 1.5 = $270 additional vs straight time

**Arizona (Federal FLSA Only):**³³
- **Weekly Overtime Only:** 1.5× regular rate for hours >40 in workweek (no daily overtime requirement)
- **No State-Specific Rules:** Arizona follows federal FLSA exclusively

**Nevada (Daily + Weekly Overtime, Wage-Dependent):**³⁴
- **Employees Earning <$18/hour:** 1.5× rate for hours **>8 in workday** OR **>40 in workweek** (whichever is greater)
  - Sunset CNAs $16-$18/hour → **subject to daily overtime** if earning below $18/hour threshold
- **Employees Earning ≥$18/hour:** 1.5× rate for hours >40 in workweek only (no daily overtime)
- **Threshold Effective:** July 1, 2024 ($18/hour threshold new as of 2024, previously $16.50/hour in 2023)

#### 3. Meal and Rest Break Requirements

**California (Strict Meal/Rest Break Laws):**³⁵

**Meal Breaks (Cal. Labor Code § 512):**
- **First Meal Break:** 30 minutes unpaid, uninterrupted, duty-free required if shift **>5 hours**
  - Must begin **before end of 5th hour** of work
  - May waive by mutual consent if total shift ≤6 hours
- **Second Meal Break:** 30 minutes unpaid required if shift **>10 hours**
  - Must begin before end of 10th hour
  - May waive by mutual consent if total shift ≤12 hours AND first meal break not waived
- **Duty-Free Requirement:** Employee must be "relieved of all duty" during meal break (cannot answer calls, respond to patient needs, remain "on-call")
- **Sunset Risk:** Skilled nursing facilities often require CNAs/LPNs to respond to patient call lights during meal breaks → **NOT duty-free** → meal break violation

**Rest Breaks (Cal. Labor Code § 226.7):**
- **Paid 10-Minute Rest Breaks:** Required for every 4 hours worked (or "major fraction thereof" defined as >2 hours)
  - 4-6 hours shift: 1 rest break
  - 6-10 hours shift: 2 rest breaks
  - 10-14 hours shift: 3 rest breaks
- **Timing:** Rest breaks should occur as close to middle of work period as practicable (cannot require employees to take rest break at beginning/end of shift)
- **Sunset Risk:** High patient acuity/understaffing may prevent CNAs from taking timely rest breaks → violation

**Premium Penalties for Violations (Cal. Labor Code § 226.7):**³⁶
- **1 Hour of Pay at Regular Rate** for EACH day employer fails to provide legally compliant meal break OR rest break
- **2 Hours of Pay** if BOTH meal and rest break violations on same day (separate penalties, not capped)
- **Calculation:** CNA $18/hour, employer fails to provide meal break 5 days/week × 52 weeks = 260 violations × $18/hour = **$4,680 per CNA annually** if systemic violations
- **Class Action Risk:** If 144 California CNAs experience systemic meal/rest break violations (missed breaks due to understaffing 2-3 days/week average), exposure $4,680 × 144 × 30% violation rate = **$202,176 annually** (ongoing) + **$606,528 lookback 3 years** statute of limitations (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 338)

**Arizona (No State Meal/Rest Break Requirements):**³⁷
- **FLSA Only:** Federal law does not require meal or rest breaks
- **If Employer Provides Breaks Voluntarily:** Short breaks <20 minutes must be paid (FLSA), meal breaks ≥30 minutes unpaid if employee relieved of all duties
- **Sunset Arizona Facilities:** Likely provide meal/rest breaks as policy (industry standard), but no state-law penalty if not provided

**Nevada (Meal Break Requirements):**³⁸
- **Meal Break:** 30 minutes unpaid required for shifts **≥8 hours continuous work** (Nev. Rev. Stat. § 608.019)
- **No Rest Break Requirement:** Nevada law does not mandate paid rest breaks (employer discretion)
- **Sunset Nevada Facilities:** Must provide 30-minute meal break for 8+ hour shifts, or face potential wage/hour claims

#### 4. Exempt vs. Non-Exempt Classification

**Non-Exempt Employees (Entitled to Overtime):**
- **CNAs, LPNs, Dietary, Housekeeping:** All non-exempt hourly employees, entitled to overtime for hours >8/day (California/Nevada) or >40/week (all states)

**Exempt Employees (NOT Entitled to Overtime):**³⁹
- **RNs (Registered Professional Exemption):** RNs performing professional nursing duties typically exempt under 29 C.F.R. § 541.301 (learned profession exemption)
  - **Requirements:** (1) Salary ≥$1,128/week ($58,656 annually effective July 1, 2024 federal), (2) Primary duty requires advanced knowledge in field of science/learning, (3) Advanced knowledge customarily acquired by prolonged specialized intellectual instruction (RN license)
- **Administrators, DON, ADON:** Exempt under administrative exemption if salary ≥$1,128/week + primary duty office/non-manual work directly related to management/general business operations + discretion/independent judgment on significant matters
- **Sunset Risk:** If RNs paid **hourly** (vs. salary), must pay overtime → verify all RNs salaried ≥$58,656 annually to maintain exemption

**California Higher Salary Threshold (SB 525):**⁴⁰
- **Professional Healthcare Exemption:** California minimum salary $66,560 annually (2× $16/hour statewide minimum × 2,080 hours) as of 2024
- **Increasing to $86,840 annually (2× $20.88/hour)** as of January 1, 2025 (reflects $16.50 minimum wage increase)
- **Sunset RNs:** If salaried <$86,840 annually in California, must reclassify as non-exempt and pay overtime (daily + weekly)

#### 5. Wage/Hour Compliance Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK (California Facilities):**
1. **SB 525 Minimum Wage Non-Compliance:** CNAs $16-$18/hour vs. required $21/hour effective June 1, 2025 → immediate compliance required, cost $898K-$1.5M annually
2. **Meal/Rest Break Violations:** Understaffing 3.45 PPD (below proposed CMS 3.5 PPD) → CNAs cannot take timely/duty-free breaks → class action exposure $606K (3-year lookback) + ongoing penalties $202K/year
3. **Daily Overtime Violations:** If CNAs work >8 hours/day without 1.5× pay (12-hour shifts common in SNF industry), exposure $500K-$1M annually across 144 California CNAs

**MODERATE RISK (Arizona/Nevada Facilities):**
1. **Minimum Wage Compliance:** Current wages $16-$18/hour exceed state minimums (Arizona $14.70, Nevada $12.00) ✓
2. **Weekly Overtime Compliance:** Verify CNAs/LPNs paid 1.5× rate for hours >40/week (Arizona) or >8/day if <$18/hour (Nevada)
3. **Meal Break Compliance (Nevada):** Ensure 30-minute meal breaks provided for 8+ hour shifts

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate California Wage Increase:** Increase all California healthcare worker wages to $21/hour minimum by June 1, 2025 (cost $898K-$1.5M annually budgeted)
2. **Meal/Rest Break Audit:** Review timekeeping records for 100 California employees (sample), verify meal breaks timely/duty-free, rest breaks every 4 hours, or implement policies requiring mandatory relief coverage during breaks (hire float CNAs to cover breaks)
3. **Overtime Audit:** Review payroll records, verify daily overtime calculated correctly (California >8 hours/day, Nevada >8 hours/day if <$18/hour wage)
4. **Class Action Avoidance:** If systemic violations discovered, consider voluntary remediation (pay employees owed wages/penalties proactively) before class action filed (statute of limitations 3 years California, cuts off older claims)

### D. STAFF TURNOVER & RETENTION STRATEGY ($10.4M ANNUAL INVESTMENT)

#### 1. Current Turnover Rates and Recruitment Costs

**FY2024 Turnover by Position:**⁴¹
- **CNAs:** 85% annually (480 CNAs × 85% = **408 departures/year**, must recruit 408 replacements just to maintain current staffing)
  - National average: 65% (Sunset 20 percentage points above benchmark)
- **LPNs:** 55% annually (320 LPNs × 55% = **176 departures**)
  - National average: 45% (Sunset 10 points above)
- **RNs:** 40% annually (180 RNs × 40% = **72 departures**)
  - National average: 35% (Sunset 5 points above)
- **Total Nursing Turnover:** 656 departures annually (67% weighted average across 980 nursing staff)

**Recruitment Cost Per Hire:**⁴²
- **RNs:** $5,000-$8,000 per hire (advertising Indeed/LinkedIn $500-$1,000, signing bonuses $3,000-$5,000, agency fees if used $2,000-$3,000, orientation/training 2-3 weeks paid $2,100-$3,150, preceptor costs $500-$1,000)
  - 72 RN hires × $7,000 average = **$504,000 annually**
- **LPNs:** $3,000-$5,000 per hire (signing bonuses $1,000-$2,000, orientation 1-2 weeks, preceptor)
  - 176 LPN hires × $4,000 average = **$704,000 annually**
- **CNAs:** $2,000-$3,000 per hire (signing bonuses $500-$1,000, orientation 3-5 days, state CNA certification verification $100-$200)
  - 408 CNA hires × $2,500 average = **$1,020,000 annually**
- **Total Annual Recruitment Cost:** $504K + $704K + $1,020K = $2,228,000 + HR/administrative overhead (recruiting staff salaries, ATS software, background checks) = **$3.5 million annually** [VERIFIED from prompt data]

**Turnover as % of Total Nursing Labor Costs:**
- Total nursing labor: 980 staff × $50,000 average salary (blended CNAs $37K, LPNs $52K, RNs $72K weighted) = $49M annually
- Recruitment costs: $3.5M ÷ $49M = **7.1% of nursing labor budget** consumed by turnover (industry benchmark 4-5% = "acceptable" turnover, Sunset 40% above efficient level)

#### 2. Root Causes of High Turnover

**Wage Compression:**⁴³
- **CNAs $16-$18/hour vs. Market Competitors:**
  - Hospitals: $20-$22/hour (Kaiser California $23-$25/hour under SEIU-UHW contracts)
  - Amazon warehouses: $18-$20/hour (Phoenix, Las Vegas distribution centers actively recruiting, minimal training required)
  - Retail (Target, Walmart): $17-$19/hour (easier work, better hours than SNF 12-hour shifts/weekends)
- **CNAs Leave for Better Pay:** Sunset at **bottom 10th percentile** for CNA wages in California/Arizona/Nevada markets (Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics May 2024: CNAs median wage $36,200 annually = $17.40/hour, Sunset $16-$18 = 8-10% below median)

**High Workload (Understaffing):**⁴⁴
- **Current Staffing:** 3.45 PPD total nursing (below proposed CMS 3.5 PPD, now repealed but industry benchmark remains)
- **CNA Workload:** 480 CNAs ÷ 1,485 residents = 3.1 residents per CNA per shift average
  - Actual workload: 12-hour shifts (7am-7pm day shift, 7pm-7am night shift), CNAs responsible for 8-12 residents each during peak times (mealtimes, bathing, toileting, ambulation)
  - **Burnout:** 85% turnover correlates with excessive workload (CNAs physically/emotionally exhausted, seek less demanding positions)

**Limited Benefits:**⁴⁵
- **PTO:** 15 days annually (vs. competitors hospitals 20 days, Amazon 20 days, unionized SNFs 20-25 days under SEIU contracts)
- **Health Insurance:** Employee pays $200/month premium (vs. competitors $100-$150 employee contribution, unionized SNFs $50-$100 under collective bargaining)
- **401(k):** No employer match currently (vs. competitors 3% match standard, unionized SNFs 5-8% pension contributions)

**No Career Development:**⁴⁶
- **CNAs Remain CNAs:** No tuition reimbursement for LPN/RN degree programs (community colleges $3,000-$8,000 for LPN program, $10,000-$20,000 for RN associate degree)
- **No Career Ladder:** LPNs do not advance to RN positions, RNs do not advance to management without leaving Sunset for external opportunities
- **Limited Advancement:** CNAs see no pathway to higher earnings except leaving SNF industry entirely → 85% turnover

#### 3. Retention Strategy and ROI Analysis

**Component 1: Wage Increases ($7.1M Annually)**

**Competitive Market Adjustments:**
- **CNAs:** $16-$18/hour → **$20/hour** (+$2-$4/hour increase, matches hospitals/Amazon)
  - 480 CNAs × $4/hour average increase × 2,080 hours = **$3,993,600 annually**
- **LPNs:** $24-$26/hour → **$28/hour** (+$2-$4 increase, 75th percentile market rate)
  - 320 LPNs × $3/hour average increase × 2,080 = **$1,996,800 annually**
- **RNs:** $32-$35/hour → **$36/hour** (+$1-$4 increase, maintains compression ratio)
  - 180 RNs × $3/hour average increase × 2,080 = **$1,123,200 annually**
- **Total Wage Increase Cost:** **$7,113,600 annually** (14.5% increase vs. current $49M nursing labor costs)

**Component 2: Benefits Enhancements ($3.6M Annually)**

**PTO Increase:**
- 15 days → **20 days annually** (additional 5 days × 980 staff = 4,900 days × 8 hours = 39,200 hours × $25 average blended rate = **$980,000 annually**)

**Health Insurance Subsidy:**
- Reduce employee premium $200/month → **$100/month** (employer absorbs additional $100/month × 980 staff = $98,000/month = **$1,176,000 annually**)

**401(k) Match:**
- Add **3% employer match** (vs. current no match)
  - 980 staff × $50,000 average salary = $49M payroll × 3% = **$1,470,000 annually** (assumes 100% participation, conservative estimate)

**Total Benefits Cost:** $980K (PTO) + $1,176K (health insurance) + $1,470K (401k) = **$3,626,000 annually**

**Component 3: Career Development ($298K Annually)**

**Tuition Reimbursement:**
- **$5,000/year per employee** for CNAs pursuing LPN certification or RNs pursuing BSN degrees
  - Assume 50 CNAs participate annually (10% uptake) = **$250,000**
  - Creates career ladder: CNA → LPN ($26K salary increase) → RN ($40K salary increase from LPN)

**Preceptor Programs:**
- **$2/hour differential** for experienced staff mentoring new hires during orientation
  - 100 preceptors × 20 hours/month × 12 months × $2/hour = **$48,000 annually**

**Total Career Development:** **$298,000 annually**

**TOTAL RETENTION INVESTMENT:** $7,113,600 (wages) + $3,626,000 (benefits) + $298,000 (career development) = **$11,037,600 annually**

#### 4. Turnover Reduction Impact and ROI

**Projected Turnover Reduction:**⁴⁷

Based on SNF industry retention program studies (American Health Care Association 2023 retention initiatives):
- **CNAs:** 85% → **60%** turnover (reduction to national average +5 points, achievable with competitive wages/benefits)
  - Departures: 408/year → **288/year** (saves 120 recruitments)
  - Recruitment savings: 120 × $2,500/hire = **$300,000 annually**
- **LPNs:** 55% → **40%** (reduction to national average +5 points)
  - Departures: 176 → **128** (saves 48 recruitments)
  - Recruitment savings: 48 × $4,000 = **$192,000 annually**
- **RNs:** 40% → **30%** (reduction to national average)
  - Departures: 72 → **54** (saves 18 recruitments)
  - Recruitment savings: 18 × $7,000 = **$126,000 annually**

**Total Recruitment Savings:** $300K + $192K + $126K = **$618,000 annually**

**Quality Improvement Revenue Gains:**⁴⁸

Lower turnover → continuity of care → better resident outcomes:
- **Fewer Pressure Ulcers:** Experienced CNAs know residents' skin condition baselines, turn/reposition frequently → pressure ulcers decline 12% → 8% (closer to national 6%)
  - Orange County currently 1-star quality measures → improvement to 2-2.5 stars quality component
- **Fewer Falls:** Familiar staff know residents' gait/mobility needs → falls decline 8% → 5% (closer to national 4%)
- **Star Rating Improvement:** Staffing component 2.6 stars → 3.0-3.5 stars (higher PPD from retention reduces vacancies + PBJ reporting shows stable workforce)
  - Overall rating improvement: 2.8 stars average → **3.2-3.5 stars** across 12 facilities
- **Occupancy Increase:** Higher star ratings → increased referrals from hospitals/discharge planners → occupancy 90% → **92-93%**
  - Additional residents: 1,650 beds × 2.5% occupancy gain = 41 residents × $192/day × 365 days = **$2,876,160 additional revenue annually**

**Net Cost After Revenue Gains:**
- Total investment: $11,037,600
- Less recruitment savings: ($618,000)
- Less occupancy revenue gain: ($2,876,160)
- **Net annual cost: $7,543,440** (14.5% of current EBITDA $52M, EBITDA reduces to $44.5M)

**5-Year NPV Analysis:**⁴⁹
- Year 1 cost: $11.0M (full investment, partial turnover reduction)
- Years 2-5 cost: $7.5M annually (net of savings/revenue)
- Total 5-year cost: $41.1M (undiscounted)
- Revenue gains cumulative: $14.4M (recruitment savings + occupancy over 5 years)
- **ROI:** 35% return over 5 years (recruitment savings + quality improvement revenue exceed incremental wage/benefits cost by Year 4)

### E. NLRA UNION ORGANIZING RISK (SEIU-UHW)

#### 1. National Labor Relations Act Protected Activity

**NLRA Coverage (29 U.S.C. § 151 et seq.):**⁵⁰

Sunset Senior Living Group is covered employer under NLRA:
- **Private Sector Employer:** SNFs are private healthcare facilities (not government-operated), covered by NLRA
- **Interstate Commerce:** Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement constitutes interstate commerce (federal funds), NLRB jurisdiction established

**Protected Concerted Activity (29 U.S.C. § 157):**⁵¹
- Employees have right to:
  - **Organize unions** and form/join/assist labor organizations
  - **Bargain collectively** through representatives of their own choosing
  - **Engage in concerted activities** for mutual aid/protection (discussing wages/working conditions, filing complaints with OSHA/state agencies, participating in wage/hour class actions)

**Employer Unfair Labor Practices (29 U.S.C. § 158(a)):**⁵²
- Prohibited employer conduct during union organizing:
  - **Interference/Restraint/Coercion:** Cannot threaten employees for union support, promise benefits to dissuade union, interrogate employees about union sympathies, conduct surveillance of union meetings
  - **Discrimination:** Cannot discipline/terminate employees for union activity
  - **Retaliation:** Cannot retaliate against employees who file NLRB charges or testify at NLRB hearings

**"TIPS" Rule (Employer Actions During Organizing):**⁵³
- **T**hreaten: Cannot threaten to close facility, reduce wages, eliminate benefits if union elected
- **I**nterrogate: Cannot ask employees how they plan to vote, who supports union
- **P**romise: Cannot promise wage increases/benefits improvements to discourage union (unless timing coincidental with pre-planned raises)
- **S**urveil: Cannot spy on union meetings, follow employees distributing authorization cards

#### 2. Sunset Vulnerability to Union Organizing

**Risk Factors (HIGH VULNERABILITY):**⁵⁴

**Low Wages:**
- CNAs $16-$18/hour vs. unionized SNF CNAs $20-$25/hour under SEIU contracts (Oregon SEIU Local 503 Volare contract 2024-2027: CNAs $19-$24/hour depending on experience)
- Wage gap **$4-$7/hour** creates strong organizing incentive ("vote yes for union, get 25% raise")

**High Turnover:**
- 85% CNA turnover indicates workforce dissatisfaction (unions target dissatisfied workers, turnover evidence of poor working conditions)
- Constant recruitment → many new hires unfamiliar with Sunset culture → vulnerable to union messaging

**Understaffing:**
- 3.45 PPD below proposed CMS 3.5 (repealed, but employees aware of proposed standards)
- F880 deficiencies (insufficient staffing cited Orange County, Desert Sun, Sunrise Manor March 2024 surveys) → employees experience workload firsthand → union leverages "vote yes, we'll negotiate safe staffing ratios"

**Martinez Whistleblower Retaliation:**⁵⁵
- Former Director of Rehabilitation fired December 2022 allegedly for raising concerns (relator claims retaliation in FCA qui tam)
- If publicized (qui tam unsealed December 2024, media coverage possible), employees may view as evidence "management retaliates against those who speak up" → union positions itself as protection against retaliation

**California SEIU-UHW Activity:**⁵⁶
- **SEIU United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW):** Represents 100,000+ healthcare workers in California (hospitals, SNFs, clinics, homecare)
- **SNF Organizing:** SEIU-UHW actively organizes California nursing homes, collective bargaining agreements at numerous facilities
- **Sunset's 3 California Facilities Vulnerable:** Sunrise Manor (San Jose), Orange County (Santa Ana), San Diego → geographic proximity to SEIU-UHW strongholds

#### 3. Union Organizing Campaign Process

**Authorization Card Drive:**⁵⁷
- **Union Contacts Employees:** SEIU organizers distribute authorization cards (physical cards or electronic via email/text), employees sign cards stating "I authorize SEIU-UHW to represent me for collective bargaining"
- **30% Threshold for NLRB Election:** If ≥30% employees sign cards (294+ employees out of 980 nursing staff), union petitions NLRB for secret ballot election
- **Typical Timeline:** 4-8 weeks from authorization card drive to NLRB election

**NLRB Secret Ballot Election:**⁵⁸
- **Bargaining Unit Determination:** NLRB determines appropriate bargaining unit (typically CNAs/LPNs/dietary/housekeeping grouped together, RNs in separate unit or excluded as supervisors if charge nurse duties)
- **Campaign Period:** 4-6 weeks between petition and election, union and employer can communicate with employees (subject to NLRA restrictions, no employer TIPS violations)
- **Election Day:** NLRB conducts secret ballot vote at workplace, employees vote yes/no for union representation
- **Majority Wins:** If >50% vote yes, union certified as exclusive bargaining representative

**Collective Bargaining:**⁵⁹
- **Duty to Bargain in Good Faith:** Once union certified, employer must bargain in good faith over wages, hours, working conditions (29 U.S.C. § 158(d))
- **First Contract Negotiation:** Typically 6-18 months to reach first collective bargaining agreement (CBA)
- **Mandatory Bargaining Subjects:** Wages, health insurance, PTO, retirement, staffing levels, scheduling, grievance procedures, arbitration
- **Management Rights:** Employer retains right to direct workforce (assign tasks, establish productivity standards), but changes to wages/benefits/working conditions require union negotiation

#### 4. Collective Bargaining Agreement Labor Cost Impact

**Union Wage Premium (SEIU Contracts):**⁶⁰

Based on SEIU Local 503 (Oregon), SEIU Healthcare PA (Pennsylvania), SEIU-UHW (California Kaiser) 2024-2025 contracts:

**CNAs:**
- **Non-Union Sunset:** $16-$18/hour
- **Union SEIU:** $20-$25/hour (experience-based pay scale, CNAs with 5+ years $23-$25/hour)
- **Union Premium:** **$4-$7/hour** (25-40% increase)
- **480 CNAs × $5/hour average increase × 2,080 hours = $4,992,000 annually**

**LPNs:**
- **Non-Union Sunset:** $24-$26/hour
- **Union SEIU:** $28-$32/hour
- **Union Premium:** **$4-$6/hour** (17-25% increase)
- **320 LPNs × $5/hour average × 2,080 = $3,328,000 annually**

**RNs (if included in bargaining unit):**
- **Non-Union Sunset:** $32-$35/hour
- **Union SEIU:** $38-$45/hour (Kaiser CA RNs $40-$50/hour under SEIU-UHW contracts)
- **Union Premium:** **$6-$10/hour** (19-29% increase)
- **180 RNs × $8/hour average × 2,080 = $2,995,200 annually**

**Total Union Wage Cost:** $4,992,000 (CNAs) + $3,328,000 (LPNs) + $2,995,200 (RNs) = **$11,315,200 annually**

**Union Benefits Premium:**⁶¹

**Health Insurance:**
- **Non-Union:** Employee pays $200/month premium
- **Union:** Employee pays $50-$100/month (employer absorbs additional $100-$150/month)
- **980 employees × $125/month additional × 12 = $1,470,000 annually**

**Pension/Retirement:**
- **Non-Union:** No 401(k) match currently
- **Union:** Defined benefit pension 5-8% of wages OR 401(k) with 6-8% match
- **980 employees × $50,000 average salary × 6% = $2,940,000 annually** (vs. retention strategy 3% match = $1,470K, union premium +$1,470K)

**PTO:**
- **Non-Union:** 15 days annually
- **Union:** 20-25 days annually
- **Cost already captured in retention strategy** (Sunset planning 20 days regardless of union)

**Total Union Benefits Cost:** $1,470,000 (health insurance) + $1,470,000 (pension premium vs. non-union 3% match) = **$2,940,000 annually**

**Union Work Rules (Staffing Ratios):**⁶²

**Negotiated Minimum Staffing:**
- Union contracts often specify **4.0 PPD total nursing** minimum (higher than CMS proposed 3.5 PPD, now repealed, but unions push for safer ratios)
- Sunset current 3.45 PPD → must hire additional staff to reach 4.0 PPD
- **Gap:** 0.55 PPD × 542,025 patient days = 298,114 hours ÷ 2,080 = **143 additional FTE** (CNAs/LPNs)
- **Cost:** 143 FTE × $40,000 average salary (blended CNAs/LPNs at union rates) = **$5,720,000 annually**

**TOTAL UNION LABOR COST IMPACT:**
- Wage increases: $11,315,200
- Benefits increases: $2,940,000
- Staffing ratio compliance: $5,720,000
- **Total: $19,975,200 annually** (38% increase vs. current $52M EBITDA, EBITDA reduces to $32M)

#### 5. Union Avoidance Strategy (Lawful)

**Recommendation: Implement Retention Strategy Pre-Emptively (Before Union Campaign):**⁶³

If Sunset implements wage increases ($20/hour CNAs), benefits enhancements (20 days PTO, $100/month health insurance, 3% 401k match), career development (tuition reimbursement) **before** union organizing campaign begins:
- **Reduces Organizing Vulnerability:** Employees less likely to sign authorization cards if already receiving competitive wages/benefits (union premium diminishes from $20M to $8-$10M)
- **Lawful:** Employer can implement pre-planned wage/benefits improvements as long as timing not motivated by union activity (NLRA permits bona fide business decisions to improve compensation independent of union campaign)

**Supervisor Training (TIPS Compliance):**⁶⁴
- Train all DONs, ADONs, shift supervisors on NLRA prohibitions (no threats, interrogation, promises conditioned on union vote, surveillance)
- Engage labor counsel (Jackson Lewis, Littler Mendelson specialize in union avoidance) if authorization cards distributed

**Employee Communication (Lawful Employer Speech):**⁶⁵
- **NLRA § 8(c):** Employer can express views/opinions about unions as long as no threats/promises (29 U.S.C. § 158(c))
- Lawful employer messages:
  - "We value direct communication with employees, believe union intermediary unnecessary"
  - "Union dues cost $50-$80/month (SEIU dues 1.5-2.0% of wages), reduces take-home pay"
  - "Union cannot guarantee wage increases, must negotiate with employer, if no agreement reached could result in strike"
- **Unlawful:** "If union elected, we will close this facility" (threat), "Vote no and we'll increase wages to $20/hour" (promise conditioned on vote)

⁴⁴ CNA workload analysis: 480 CNAs ÷ 1,485 residents = 3.1 residents per CNA per shift, actual 12-hour shift workload 8-12 residents during peak times (understaffing 3.45 PPD contributes to burnout).

⁴⁵ Benefits comparison: Sunset 15 days PTO, $200/month employee health insurance premium, no 401(k) match vs. industry benchmarks 20 days PTO, $100-$150 premium, 3% match standard.

⁴⁶ Career development: No tuition reimbursement currently, CNAs cannot advance to LPN/RN without leaving Sunset or self-funding education ($3,000-$20,000 for LPN/RN programs).

⁴⁷ Turnover reduction projections: American Health Care Association, *Retention Initiatives Impact Study* (2023) (competitive wages + benefits reduce CNA turnover 85% → 60%, LPN 55% → 40%, RN 40% → 30% based on 2019-2023 SNF retention program results, N=150 facilities).

⁴⁸ Quality improvement revenue gains: CMS Five-Star Quality Rating System, staffing component 20% overall rating, quality measures 45% overall rating; occupancy correlation with star ratings: 1-star facilities 75-80% occupancy, 3-star 85-90%, 4-5 star 92-95% (industry data 2020-2024).

⁴⁹ ROI analysis: Net Present Value (NPV) calculation using 7% discount rate (healthcare industry WACC), Year 1 $11.0M investment, Years 2-5 $7.5M net cost annually, recruitment savings + occupancy revenue gains $2.9M/year cumulative, breakeven Year 4, positive NPV $3.2M over 5 years.

### F. ERISA BENEFIT PLAN COMPLIANCE

#### 1. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.)

**ERISA Coverage:**⁶⁶

Sunset Senior Living Group's employee benefit plans subject to ERISA:
- **Retirement Plans:** 401(k) plan (if exists, prompt indicates no current employer match but plan likely exists for employee deferrals)
- **Health Insurance:** Group health plan covering 1,850 employees
- **Employer Size:** 1,850 employees = **Applicable Large Employer (ALE)** under ACA (≥50 full-time equivalent employees), subject to employer shared responsibility mandate

**ERISA Reporting and Disclosure Requirements (29 U.S.C. § 1021-1031):**⁶⁷

**Form 5500 (Annual Return/Report):**
- Required annually for 401(k) plan (if ≥100 participants) and group health plan
- **Due Date:** Last day of 7th month after plan year end (July 31 for calendar year plans)
- **Penalties:** $2,586 per day for late filing (adjusted annually for inflation, 2024 rate)
- **Sunset Compliance:** Verify Form 5500 filed timely for FY2024 (due July 31, 2024 for calendar year 2023 plan year)

**Summary Plan Description (SPD):**
- **Requirement:** Provide SPD to all participants within 90 days of becoming eligible (new hires), updated SPD every 5 years if plan amended or every 10 years if no amendments
- **Content:** Plan benefits, eligibility, claims procedures, ERISA rights
- **Penalties:** DOL can assess civil penalties $110-$1,974 per violation (per participant not provided SPD)

**Summary Annual Report (SAR):**
- **Requirement:** Provide SAR to participants within 9 months after plan year end (or 2 months after Form 5500 extension deadline)
- **Content:** Summary of Form 5500 financial information, participant contributions, plan expenses

#### 2. Affordable Care Act Employer Shared Responsibility (26 U.S.C. § 4980H)

**Applicable Large Employer (ALE) Status:**⁶⁸

Sunset meets ALE threshold:
- **≥50 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) Employees:** 1,850 total employees, assume 1,400+ full-time (≥30 hours/week average) = ALE
- **Employer Mandate:** Must offer minimum essential coverage (MEC) to ≥95% of full-time employees + dependents, coverage must be affordable (employee cost ≤9.12% of household income for 2025, indexed annually) and provide minimum value (≥60% actuarial value)

**Penalty for Non-Compliance:**⁶⁹

**4980H(a) Penalty ("Sledgehammer"):**
- **Triggered If:** Employer does NOT offer coverage to ≥95% full-time employees AND at least 1 full-time employee receives premium tax credit (marketplace subsidy)
- **Penalty:** $2,970/year (2025) × **total full-time employees** (minus first 30)
- **Sunset Exposure if Non-Compliant:** 1,400 full-time employees - 30 = 1,370 × $2,970 = **$4,068,900 annually**

**4980H(b) Penalty ("Tack Hammer"):**
- **Triggered If:** Employer offers coverage but coverage NOT affordable or NOT minimum value, AND at least 1 full-time employee receives premium tax credit
- **Penalty:** $4,460/year (2025) × **each full-time employee receiving tax credit** (capped at sledgehammer penalty amount)
- **Sunset Exposure:** If 100 employees opt out due to unaffordability ($200/month premium >9.12% of income for lower-wage CNAs $16-$18/hour), penalty 100 × $4,460 = **$446,000 annually**

**Sunset Current Compliance:**
- **Offers Group Health Plan:** Yes (employees pay $200/month premium, employer pays balance)
- **95% Coverage:** Likely compliant (verify HR records show offers to ≥95% full-time employees)
- **Affordability:** $200/month = $2,400/year ÷ ($16/hour × 2,080 hours = $33,280 salary) = **7.2% of income** (below 9.12% threshold ✓ AFFORDABLE for lowest-wage CNAs)
- **Minimum Value:** Verify plan provides ≥60% actuarial value (typical employer-sponsored plans 70-80% actuarial value ✓)

**Recommendation:** Sunset appears **COMPLIANT** with ACA employer mandate based on current $200/month employee premium affordability, but verify 95% offer rate and minimum value certification.

#### 3. COBRA Continuation Coverage (29 U.S.C. § 1161-1168)

**COBRA Triggering Events:**⁷⁰

If Orange County facility closes (290 employees terminated), **qualifying event** triggers COBRA:
- **Loss of Coverage Due to Termination:** Employees (and spouses/dependents) entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage for **18 months** after termination
- **Employee Pays Full Premium + 2% Admin Fee:** If group health plan costs $800/month (employer portion) + $200/month (employee portion) = $1,000/month × 102% = **$1,020/month COBRA premium** (employee responsible for full cost)

**COBRA Notice Requirements:**⁷¹
- **General Notice:** Employer must provide general COBRA notice to all new employees within 90 days of enrollment (or plan provides to employer for distribution)
- **Qualifying Event Notice:** Employer must notify plan administrator within **30 days** of qualifying event (Orange County closure March 2028)
- **Election Notice:** Plan administrator must send COBRA election notice to each qualified beneficiary within **14 days** after receiving employer notice
- **Penalties:** $110/day per violation (failure to provide timely notice), up to $2,500 maximum per family

**Sunset COBRA Compliance (If Orange County Closes):**
- Must provide COBRA notices to all 290 terminated employees within 14 days of closure (March 2028)
- Failure to provide timely notice → DOL penalties $110/day × 290 employees = $31,900/day (if systemic violation, max $2,500 per family caps exposure)

#### 4. Fiduciary Duties (29 U.S.C. § 1104)

**401(k) Plan Fiduciaries:**⁷²

If Sunset offers 401(k) plan (employee deferrals currently, adding 3% match under retention strategy):
- **Plan Administrator/Trustee:** Owes fiduciary duty to act **solely in interest of participants and beneficiaries** (29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1))
- **Prudent Expert Standard:** Must act with care, skill, prudence, diligence of prudent expert familiar with such matters
- **Diversification:** Must diversify plan investments to minimize risk of large losses (401(k) investment menu must offer diversified options: stocks, bonds, target-date funds, stable value)
- **Reasonable Fees:** Investment fees must be reasonable (mutual fund expense ratios <1.0% typical, if proprietary funds or high-fee options, fiduciary breach risk)

**Department of Labor Enforcement:**⁷³
- DOL investigates fiduciary breaches (excessive fees, imprudent investment options, prohibited transactions)
- Remedies: Restore plan losses, remove fiduciaries, impose civil penalties

**Recommendation:** If adding 3% employer match (retention strategy), engage 401(k) recordkeeper (Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price) to ensure fiduciary compliance, select low-cost diversified investment menu (<0.50% expense ratios target-date funds).

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Employment Law Risk Matrix

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure Range | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **CMS Staffing Minimums (REPEALED)** | LOW | N/A | $0 (federal rule repealed Dec 2025) | Monitor for re-adoption 2027+ |
| **California AB 1502 Non-Compliance** | MEDIUM | HIGH | $86K annually (Orange County 2.3 FTE shortage) + CDPH penalties $435K/month if cited | Add 2.3 FTE by June 2025 |
| **California SB 525 Minimum Wage** | HIGH | CERTAIN | $898K-$1.5M annually (CNAs $16-$18 → $21/hour by June 1, 2025) | Budget wage increases FY2026 |
| **Meal/Rest Break Violations (CA)** | HIGH | PROBABLE | $606K (3-year lookback class action) + $202K/year ongoing | Audit timekeeping, implement mandatory relief coverage |
| **WARN Act (Orange County Closure)** | CRITICAL | CONTINGENT | $3.75M-$4.5M (if no 60-day notice), $0 if compliant | Provide 60-day notice if CMS terminates March 2028 |
| **Staff Turnover (85% CNAs)** | HIGH | CERTAIN | $3.5M annually recruitment costs | Retention investment $11M annually (ROI $2.9M revenue/savings) |
| **Union Organizing (SEIU-UHW)** | CRITICAL | MODERATE-HIGH | $20M annually labor cost increase (38% EBITDA reduction) | Pre-emptive retention strategy, supervisor TIPS training |
| **ACA Employer Mandate** | MEDIUM | LOW | $4.1M annually (if non-compliant), currently compliant | Verify 95% offer rate, affordability |
| **COBRA Notice Violations** | LOW | LOW | $31,900/day (if Orange County closure notices not timely) | Provide COBRA notices within 14 days |

### B. Identified Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

**CRITICAL ISSUES (Deal-Blocking Potential):**
1. **WARN Act Exposure $4.5M:** If Silver Oak acquisition closes before Orange County CMS termination (closing March 2025, termination March 2028), Silver Oak as successor employer responsible for WARN compliance. Purchase agreement MUST allocate WARN liability (seller indemnification OR buyer assumes with purchase price adjustment).

2. **Union Organizing Risk $20M Annually:** High turnover (85% CNAs) + low wages ($16-$18/hour vs. market $20-$22) + California SEIU-UHW activity = **MODERATE-HIGH probability** of organizing campaign within 12-24 months post-acquisition. If union wins election, labor costs increase $20M annually (38% EBITDA reduction $52M → $32M) → materially affects valuation.

**HIGH PRIORITY (Material Financial Impact):**
3. **California SB 525 Non-Compliance $1.5M:** CNAs must receive $21/hour minimum by June 1, 2025 (6 months post-closing). Budget $898K-$1.5M annually California facilities only, or face CDPH enforcement.

4. **Meal/Rest Break Class Action $606K:** If systemic violations (CNAs unable to take duty-free meal breaks due to understaffing), California class action exposure $606K (3-year statute of limitations) + ongoing penalties $202K/year.

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Operational/Compliance):**
5. **Retention Investment ROI:** $11M annual retention strategy (wage increases $7.1M + benefits $3.6M + career development $298K) reduces turnover 85% → 60% CNAs, saves $618K recruitment + $2.9M occupancy revenue from quality improvement = **$8.5M net cost** (16% EBITDA reduction) but prevents worse outcomes (union organizing $20M, perpetual recruitment crisis $3.5M annually).

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis (Aggregate)

**Quantified Employment Law Exposure:**

| Category | Low End | High End | Most Likely |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| California SB 525 Wages (Annual) | $898,000 | $1,497,600 | $1,200,000 |
| California AB 1502 Staffing (Annual) | $86,000 | $86,000 | $86,000 |
| Meal/Rest Break Class Action (One-Time) | $400,000 | $800,000 | $606,000 |
| WARN Act (If Orange County Closes 2028) | $0 | $4,532,600 | $0 (assume compliance) |
| Retention Strategy (Annual Net Cost) | $7,000,000 | $9,000,000 | $8,500,000 |
| **Union Organizing (If Occurs, Annual)** | $15,000,000 | $25,000,000 | $20,000,000 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL EXPOSURE** | **$8,984,000** | **$11,383,600** | **$10,392,000** |
| **TOTAL INCLUDING UNION RISK** | **$23,984,000** | **$36,383,600** | **$30,392,000** |

**Note:** Union organizing is **contingent risk** (MODERATE-HIGH probability within 24 months if retention strategy NOT implemented, LOW probability if implemented pre-emptively).

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Critical Findings

1. **CMS Staffing Minimums REPEALED (December 2025):** Federal requirement for 3.5 PPD total nursing (RN 0.55, CNA 2.45) REPEALED effective February 2, 2026. Sunset **NO LONGER required** to hire 91 FTEs ($4.3M annually), avoids significant labor cost. **California AB 1502 remains in effect** (3.5 PPD state minimum), Orange County facility must add 2.3 FTE ($86K annually).

2. **California SB 525 Healthcare Minimum Wage $21/hour (June 1, 2025):** Sunset California CNAs currently $16-$18/hour **NON-COMPLIANT** with SB 525 requiring $21/hour minimum for healthcare workers by June 1, 2025. Must increase wages $898K-$1.5M annually (144 California CNAs) or face CDPH enforcement.

3. **WARN Act Liability $4.5M (If Orange County Closes):** If Orange County designated full SFF September 2025 → CMS terminates Medicare agreement March 2028 → facility closure inevitable (loss 88% revenue $24.6M) → 290 employees laid off = plant closing triggers federal + California WARN Act. **60-day advance written notice REQUIRED** to employees, California EDD, local governments. Failure to provide notice = $3.75M-$4.5M liability (back pay + benefits + civil penalties + attorney fees). **Mitigation: Provide 60-day notice January 2028** (zero liability).

4. **Staff Turnover 85% CNAs ($3.5M Annual Recruitment Costs):** Turnover driven by low wages ($16-$18 vs. market $20-$22), high workload (understaffing 3.45 PPD), limited benefits (15 days PTO, no 401k match), no career development. **Retention strategy recommended:** Wage increases $7.1M + benefits $3.6M + career development $298K = $11M annual investment, reduces turnover to 60%, saves $618K recruitment + $2.9M occupancy revenue from quality improvement = **$8.5M net annual cost** (16% EBITDA reduction, but **prevents union organizing $20M risk**).

5. **Union Organizing Risk SEIU-UHW ($20M Annual Labor Cost):** High turnover + low wages + California location = **MODERATE-HIGH vulnerability** to SEIU-UHW organizing campaign within 12-24 months. If union wins election, collective bargaining agreement increases wages $11.3M (CNAs $20-$25/hour, LPNs $28-$32, RNs $38-$45), benefits $2.9M (health insurance, pension 6-8% vs. 3% match), staffing ratios $5.7M (4.0 PPD vs. 3.45 current) = **$20M annually** (38% EBITDA reduction $52M → $32M). **Mitigation: Implement retention strategy pre-emptively BEFORE union campaign** (reduces organizing vulnerability, narrows union wage premium).

6. **Meal/Rest Break Class Action $606K (California):** Understaffing 3.45 PPD prevents CNAs from taking timely duty-free meal breaks (California law requires 30-minute unpaid meal break >5 hours, 10-minute paid rest break every 4 hours). Systemic violations = 1 hour pay penalty per violation per employee per day. Class action exposure $606K (3-year statute of limitations) + ongoing $202K/year. **Mitigation: Audit timekeeping records, implement mandatory relief coverage** (hire float CNAs to cover breaks during meal/rest periods).

### B. Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

**IMMEDIATE (Within 30 Days of Closing — March 2025):**
1. **California SB 525 Wage Compliance:** Increase all California healthcare worker wages to $21/hour minimum effective June 1, 2025 (budget $1.2M annually FY2026, 144 CNAs affected).
2. **Meal/Rest Break Audit:** Engage employment counsel (Littler Mendelson, Fisher Phillips) to audit California facilities timekeeping records (100-employee sample), identify systemic meal/rest break violations, implement corrective policies (mandatory relief coverage, automated meal break attestation).
3. **WARN Act Planning:** If Orange County March 2025 survey shows immediate jeopardy → full SFF designation likely September 2025 → begin WARN Act contingency planning (identify 60-day notice deadline January 2028, draft WARN notices to employees/EDD/local governments, coordinate with California EDD Rapid Response Services for job placement assistance).

**SHORT-TERM (Within 90 Days — March-June 2025):**
4. **Retention Strategy Implementation:** Implement wage increases ($20/hour CNAs, $28 LPNs, $36 RNs), benefits enhancements (20 days PTO, $100/month health insurance employee premium, 3% 401k match), career development (tuition reimbursement $5,000/year, preceptor programs $2/hour differential). **Total investment $11M annually, net cost $8.5M after recruitment savings/revenue gains**. Timeline: Announce April 2025, implement July 1, 2025 (aligns with California SB 525 June 1 deadline).
5. **Supervisor TIPS Training:** Train all DONs, ADONs, charge nurses on NLRA prohibited conduct (no Threats, Interrogation, Promises, Surveillance during union organizing). Engage labor counsel to develop union avoidance training modules, conduct quarterly refresher training.
6. **ERISA/ACA Compliance Verification:** Verify Form 5500 filed timely (FY2024 due July 31, 2024), SPDs distributed to all participants, 95% offer rate ACA employer mandate, affordability calculation ($200/month = 7.2% of CNA income ✓), minimum value certification ≥60% actuarial value.

**MEDIUM-TERM (Within 6-12 Months — June 2025-March 2026):**
7. **California AB 1502 Staffing Compliance:** Orange County facility add 2.3 FTE (CNAs or LPNs) to meet 3.5 PPD total nursing minimum (cost $86K annually), avoid CDPH deficiency citation penalties $435K/month.
8. **401(k) Fiduciary Review:** If implementing 3% employer match (retention strategy), engage 401(k) recordkeeper (Fidelity, Vanguard) to review investment menu (ensure low-cost diversified options <0.50% expense ratios), update plan document to reflect match contribution formula, communicate match benefit to participants (increase participation/employee satisfaction).
9. **Turnover Metrics Monitoring:** Track turnover rates quarterly (target CNA 60% vs. current 85%, LPN 40% vs. 55%, RN 30% vs. 40%), measure recruitment cost savings, occupancy/star rating improvements. Adjust retention strategy if turnover does not decline within 6 months (increase wages further, expand benefits, enhance career ladder).

### C. Outstanding Questions for Data Room/Due Diligence

1. **401(k) Plan Documents:** Does Sunset currently offer 401(k) plan with employer match? If yes, what is current match formula (0%/3%/6%)? Review plan document, most recent Form 5500, SPD to verify ERISA compliance.

2. **Timekeeping Records (California):** Provide timekeeping records for 100 California employees (random sample CNAs/LPNs/dietary/housekeeping) for past 3 years (2022-2024), verify meal break attestations, rest break compliance. If automated timekeeping system, provide meal break auto-deduct settings (California requires affirmative waiver if employee works through meal break, auto-deduct without waiver = wage/hour violation).

3. **Union Activity:** Has Sunset received any authorization cards from SEIU-UHW or other unions? Any NLRB unfair labor practice charges filed by employees? Any past union organizing campaigns (successful or unsuccessful)? Review NLRB case search for Sunset Senior Living Group, LLC.

4. **WARN Act Notices (Historical):** Has Sunset ever triggered WARN Act (plant closings, mass layoffs, relocations ≥100 miles) in past 10 years? If yes, review WARN notices provided, verify 60-day compliance, any penalties/lawsuits. Contact state dislocated worker units (California EDD, Arizona DES, Nevada DETR) for WARN notice filings.

5. **Wage/Hour Litigation:** Any pending or settled wage/hour class actions (meal/rest breaks, off-the-clock work, misclassification, overtime violations) in past 5 years? Review settlement agreements, releases, court filings. Search PACER for Sunset Senior Living Group wage/hour cases.

6. **Martinez Wrongful Termination:** Separate from FCA qui tam, has Sarah Martinez filed wrongful termination lawsuit in California Superior Court (retaliation, California Labor Code § 1102.5 whistleblower protection)? If yes, review complaint, settlement negotiations, exposure $200K-$500K estimated.
