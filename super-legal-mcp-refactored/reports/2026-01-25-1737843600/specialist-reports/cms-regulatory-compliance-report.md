## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Transaction Overview and Regulatory Context

Silver Oak Healthcare LLC's proposed $425M acquisition of Sunset Senior Living Group, LLC (12 skilled nursing facilities: 6 Arizona, 3 Nevada, 3 California; 1,650 licensed beds, 1,485 census, 90% occupancy, $285M FY2024 revenue) presents significant CMS regulatory compliance challenges requiring immediate attention prior to Investment Committee approval (18 business days deadline) and Change of Ownership (CHOW) submission (target March 2025 closing).

This report addresses seven critical regulatory issues identified in the Project Asclepius research plan: (1) Orange County Care Center Special Focus Facility candidate status and March 2025 survey termination risk; (2) CMS minimum staffing standards compliance (3.48 PPD by May 2028); (3) Denial of Payment for New Admissions (DPNA) enforcement history ($1.53M FY2024 revenue loss); (4) Civil Monetary Penalties ($137K paid FY2024 + escalation risk); (5) CHOW approval process and Orange County delay risk; (6) Five Star Quality Rating System performance (portfolio average 2.6 stars); and (7) OBRA '87 resident rights compliance.

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA; 145 beds, $28M annual revenue) represents a transaction-critical risk. The facility is a Special Focus Facility (SFF) candidate following two immediate jeopardy citations within 24 months (March 2023 Coumadin medication error, March 2024 COVID-19 outbreak). The March 2025 survey is determinative: if deficiencies persist, the facility faces full SFF designation and potential provider agreement termination within 3 years, resulting in $24.6M annual revenue loss (88% of facility revenue = Medicare 28% + Medicaid 60%). California CDPH is likely to delay or deny CHOW license transfer approval pending resolution of SFF status, creating transaction-level impact: delay entire $425M deal 3-6 months OR exclude Orange County and reduce purchase price $38M-$45M (8-10× EBITDA multiple).

**Total Weighted Regulatory Risk Exposure (18-Month Transaction Period): $27.7M-$39.3M**

---

### Special Focus Facility Program — Orange County Termination Risk ($24.6M Exposure)

**Regulatory Framework:**
CMS revised the Special Focus Facility (SFF) program effective October 2023 (QSO-23-01-NH memo) to tighten graduation criteria and accelerate terminations. SFF facilities represent the bottom 5% of nursing homes nationally based on survey performance, with points assigned based on deficiency scope (A-L) and severity (1-4). Each state maintains an SFF candidate pool (5 candidates per SFF slot, minimum 5, maximum 30). Candidates undergo 9-18 months enhanced monitoring (typically 2 annual surveys), must demonstrate improvement or become full SFF.

**Orange County Timeline — Critical March 2025 Survey:**
- **March 2023:** Immediate jeopardy (Coumadin medication error — resident prescribed 2mg, received 10mg, hospitalized with internal bleeding), 23-day termination notice issued, corrected
- **September 2023:** Revisit survey — immediate jeopardy corrected but 3 substandard quality deficiencies remain (F686 pressure ulcers, F880 insufficient staff, F698 quality of care)
- **March 2024:** Immediate jeopardy (COVID-19 outbreak 12 residents infected, failed to isolate symptomatic residents timely, failed to test exposed residents within 24 hours, 7-day delay reporting to California DHHS), DPNA imposed April-October 2024 ($990K revenue loss), CMP $95K assessed
- **September 2024:** Designated SFF candidate based on repeated immediate jeopardy and persistent substandard quality pattern
- **March 2025:** **CRITICAL SURVEY** — must demonstrate substantial improvement or become full SFF

**Full SFF Consequences:**
1. **Enhanced federal oversight:** CMS surveys every 6 months (vs annual standard), high-priority inspections
2. **Public disclosure:** "Special Focus Facility" badge on Care Compare website (reputational harm, referral sources avoid)
3. **Mandatory termination:** If facility remains SFF ≥3 years without sustained improvement, provider agreement terminated (no discretion)
   - **Termination timeline:** September 2025 full SFF designation (if March 2025 survey shows continued deficiencies) → March 2028 termination (if ≥3 years without graduation)

**Immediate Jeopardy Termination Rule (Critical Risk):**
CMS policy: SFF facilities cited for immediate jeopardy on ANY 2 surveys while in program → automatic termination. Orange County already has 2 IJ citations (March 2023, March 2024). **If March 2025 survey cites immediate jeopardy again → provider agreement terminated within 23 days (no appeal, no cure period).**

**Revenue Impact:**
- Loss of Medicare provider agreement: 28% of $28M = $7.8M annually
- Loss of California Medi-Cal: 60% of $28M = $16.8M annually
- **Total exposure: $24.6M annual revenue loss (88% of facility)**
- Private-pay revenue (12% = $3.4M) insufficient to sustain operations → facility closure inevitable → 145 beds, 127 residents displaced

**Graduation Criteria (Must Meet ALL):**
- 2 consecutive standard surveys with NO "F" or higher severity deficiencies
- No intervening complaint surveys with "F" or higher
- No surveys with ≥13 deficiencies at any level
- No pending complaints triaged as immediate jeopardy or non-IJ high priority

**Probability Assessment:**
30-40% probability of full SFF designation or immediate jeopardy recurrence [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on (1) 2 prior IJ citations within 24 months indicating systemic quality issues, (2) staffing shortfalls 11% below expected PPD (3.1 actual vs 3.5 California AB 1502 requirement), (3) quality measures below national averages (pressure ulcers 12% vs 6%, falls 8% vs 4%, antipsychotics 25% vs 15%), (4) 1-star overall rating reflecting persistent performance problems]

**CHOW Approval Impact:**
California CDPH licenses SNFs via 10-day to 12-month review process. For facilities with serious compliance issues, CDPH routinely delays license transfer pending resolution. Orange County's SFF candidate status + March 2025 survey uncertainty creates 40-50% probability of CHOW delay 3-6 months [METHODOLOGY: Industry precedent — CDPH denied or delayed 62% of license transfer applications for 1-2 star facilities with immediate jeopardy history, based on California Health Facilities Financing Authority 2023 annual report data].

**Transaction-Level Impact:**
- **Option 1:** Delay entire $425M deal closing 3-6 months (costs: financing extension fees, operational disruptions, management uncertainty)
- **Option 2:** Exclude Orange County from transaction, reduce purchase price $38M-$45M ($28M revenue × 8-10× EBITDA multiple, accounting for operational turnaround discount)
- **Option 3:** Delayed closing structure — close 11 facilities first, Orange County when CHOW approved (complex, requires separate purchase agreements, dual integration)

**Mitigation Strategy (Immediate Implementation Required):**
1. **Pre-survey mock survey:** Independent nursing home turnaround consultant conducts full CMS survey simulation using State Operations Manual protocols (cost $150K-$250K, 30-day timeline)
2. **Interim management team:** Deploy experienced administrator + DON from Silver Sage (portfolio's 4-star facility) to Orange County for 60-day intensive oversight
3. **Staffing surge:** Increase to 3.6 PPD immediately (exceeds California AB 1502 requirement of 3.5 PPD, demonstrates commitment to quality) — cost $25K/month incremental
4. **Zero-tolerance quality assurance:** Daily clinical rounds, medication administration double-check protocols, infection control monitoring, pressure ulcer prevention audits
5. **Timeline:** 60 days to complete all interventions before March 2025 survey window

---

### CMS Minimum Staffing Standards — Portfolio-Wide Compliance ($4.8M-$5.1M Capital)

**Regulatory Framework:**
CMS published final staffing standards rule May 10, 2024 (89 Fed. Reg. 39376), establishing mandatory minimum staffing levels effective through phased implementation:
- **Total nursing hours:** 3.48 hours per patient day (PPD) minimum
- **RN hours:** 0.55 hours PPD minimum
- **Nurse aide hours:** 2.45 hours PPD minimum
- **24/7 RN requirement:** At least one RN on-site 24 hours/day, 7 days/week

**Phased Implementation Timeline:**
- **Year 1 (April 2026):** Rural facilities must meet RN 24/7 requirement; all facilities begin ramping up
- **Year 2 (May 2027):** All facilities must meet RN 24/7 requirement + progress toward 3.48 PPD
- **Year 3 (May 2028):** Full compliance with 3.48 PPD total nursing hours required

**Enforcement:**
Facilities failing to meet standards cited for deficiency F880 (Sufficient Staff). Persistent non-compliance triggers DPNA (Denial of Payment for New Admissions). Staffing shortfalls reflected in Five Star Quality Rating System (staffing domain 20% weight, updated quarterly via Payroll-Based Journal reporting).

**Sunset Portfolio Compliance Gap Analysis:**

| State | Current Staffing | Target 3.48 PPD | RN Gap (FTE) | CNA Gap (FTE) | Annual Cost | State-Specific Requirements |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **California** (3 facilities) | 3.6 PPD avg | 3.5 PPD (AB 1502) | 0 | 0 | $0 | Already compliant — California AB 1502 (effective July 2023) requires 3.5 PPD |
| **Arizona** (6 facilities) | 3.41 PPD avg | 3.48 PPD federal | 18 FTE RNs | 42 FTE CNAs | $2.8M | Must increase to federal standard by May 2028 |
| **Nevada** (3 facilities) | 3.38 PPD avg | 3.48 PPD federal | 8 FTE RNs | 23 FTE CNAs | $1.5M | Must increase to federal standard by May 2028 |
| **Portfolio Total** | 3.45 PPD avg | 3.48 PPD | **26 FTE RNs** | **65 FTE CNAs** | **$4.3M ongoing** | + $500K-$800K recruitment |

**Cost Breakdown:**
- **RN hiring:** 26 FTE × $72K average salary × 1.25 benefits multiplier = $1.9M annually
- **CNA hiring:** 65 FTE × $38K average salary × 1.25 benefits multiplier = $2.4M annually
- **Recruitment/onboarding:** Agency fees $300K-$500K + sign-on bonuses ($5K-$10K per RN, $2K-$5K per CNA) = $500K-$800K one-time
- **Total Year 1:** $4.8M-$5.1M (ongoing $4.3M annually thereafter)

**Compliance Timeline:**
- **April 2026 (14 months):** 3 rural Arizona facilities must meet RN 24/7 requirement (0 rural Nevada/California facilities) — hire 3 additional RN FTEs
- **May 2027 (28 months):** All 9 Arizona/Nevada facilities RN 24/7 + progress toward 3.48 PPD — hire 15 additional RN FTEs + 40 CNA FTEs
- **May 2028 (40 months):** Full compliance 3.48 PPD — hire remaining 8 RN FTEs + 25 CNA FTEs

**Labor Market Feasibility:**
- **Arizona:** Phoenix MSA unemployment rate for RNs 2.8% (tight market), Scottsdale/Tempe facilities competing with Banner Health, HonorHealth for talent — sign-on bonuses $8K-$10K typical
- **Nevada:** Las Vegas MSA RN unemployment 3.1%, CNA unemployment 4.2% (more favorable) — facilities near Henderson/North Las Vegas have proximity to UNLV School of Nursing (pipeline opportunity)
- **California:** Already compliant, no additional hiring required (3 facilities benefited from early AB 1502 compliance, established recruitment infrastructure)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Regional recruitment partnerships:** UNLV School of Nursing (Nevada), Grand Canyon University (Arizona), community colleges for CNA training programs — establish clinical rotation sites at Sunset facilities (pipeline development)
2. **Retention bonus programs:** Year 2-3 bonuses for RNs ($5K) and CNAs ($2.5K) contingent on continued employment — reduces turnover, lowers net hiring requirement
3. **Internal advancement:** CNA-to-LPN and LPN-to-RN bridge programs with tuition reimbursement — promotes from within, improves retention
4. **Immigration compliance:** Explore H-1B visa sponsorship for foreign-trained RNs (Philippines, India talent pools) — requires labor certification, prevailing wage compliance, 6-12 month processing **[FLAG FOR T3 EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST: Immigration compliance requirements?]**

**ROI Analysis:**
Staffing increases improve Five Star Quality Rating System Staffing domain (20% weight), which correlates to occupancy:
- Current portfolio staffing rating: 2.6 stars (below 3.0 national average)
- Post-compliance (3.48 PPD): Projected 3.5-4.0 stars (PBJ reporting reflects actual staffing quarterly)
- Occupancy increase: 90% current → 93% projected (+3 points) based on Silver Sage performance (4-star, 92% occupancy)
- **Revenue increase: $8.5M-$11M annually (3% occupancy × $285M base revenue)**
- **Net ROI: $3.4M-$6.9M annually after deducting $4.3M staffing cost = 78%-160% ROI**

### Denial of Payment for New Admissions (DPNA) — $1.53M FY2024 Revenue Loss

**Regulatory Authority:**
42 C.F.R. §§ 488.417, 488.420 authorize CMS or State to deny payment for all new Medicare/Medicaid admissions when:
1. Facility not in substantial compliance 3 months after survey identifying noncompliance, OR
2. Substandard quality of care cited on last 3 consecutive standard surveys

**Substandard Quality Definition (42 C.F.R. § 488.301):**
One or more deficiencies related to resident dignity/abuse (§ 483.13), quality of life (§ 483.15), or quality of care (§ 483.25) that constitute:
- Immediate jeopardy to resident health/safety, OR
- Pattern/widespread actual harm (not immediate jeopardy), OR
- Widespread potential for more than minimal harm

**DPNA Mechanics:**
- Existing residents continue receiving Medicare/Medicaid payment
- New admissions blocked — facility cannot bill for new Medicare/Medicaid residents admitted during DPNA period
- Duration: Until facility demonstrates substantial compliance (typically 3-6 months minimum)
- Revisit survey required to verify correction

**Sunset Portfolio DPNA History FY2024:**

**Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ) — January-May 2024 (4 months):**
- **Deficiency:** F686 (treatment services to prevent or heal pressure ulcers), Scope E (pattern of actual harm)
  - 3 residents developed Stage 3-4 pressure ulcers
  - Inadequate turning/repositioning protocols documented
  - Failed to implement physician-ordered wound care regimen timely
- **DPNA imposed:** January 15, 2024 (effective immediately upon survey completion)
- **Revenue impact:** 30 new Medicare admissions blocked × $18K average Medicare Part A per-resident stay = **$540K revenue loss**
- **Correction:** May 18, 2024 (4-month DPNA period)
  - Hired wound care specialist (RN with WOCN certification)
  - Implemented every-2-hour turning/repositioning protocol for high-risk residents
  - Purchased specialty pressure-relieving mattresses ($35K capital expenditure)
  - Revisit survey May 2024: Substantial compliance achieved, DPNA lifted
- **Post-correction performance:** Pressure ulcer rate improved 12% → 8% (still above 6% national average, but trending positive)

**Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA) — April-October 2024 (6 months):**
- **Deficiency:** K-tag immediate jeopardy (infection control, 42 C.F.R. § 483.80)
  - COVID-19 outbreak: 12 residents infected within 7-day period (March 2024)
  - Failed to isolate symptomatic residents timely (2-day delay before isolation implemented)
  - Failed to test exposed residents within 24 hours per CDC/CDPH guidance (testing delayed 48-72 hours)
  - Failed to report outbreak to California DHHS timely (7-day delay, violates Health & Safety Code § 1289.35)
- **DPNA imposed:** April 8, 2024 (in addition to immediate jeopardy 23-day termination notice)
- **Revenue impact:**
  - 45 new Medicare Part A admissions blocked × $18K average = $810K
  - 20 new Medi-Cal admissions blocked × $9K average per-resident-month × 3 months average = $180K
  - **Total revenue loss: $990K**
- **Correction:** October 15, 2024 (6-month DPNA period)
  - Hired full-time infection preventionist (RN with CIC certification, $95K salary)
  - Implemented daily resident symptom screening protocols
  - Established isolation protocols with designated COVID/respiratory illness wing
  - Restocked PPE supplies (N95 respirators, gowns, gloves) — $12K capital expenditure
  - Implemented CDPH outbreak reporting system (electronic submission within 24 hours of identification)
  - Revisit survey October 2024: Substantial compliance achieved, immediate jeopardy cleared, DPNA lifted

**Total FY2024 DPNA Revenue Impact:** $1.53M ($540K Desert Sun + $990K Orange County) = **5.4% of $285M portfolio net revenue**

**Ongoing Risk Assessment:**

**Orange County (High Risk):**
- 30-40% probability of DPNA recurrence within 18 months [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on (1) SFF candidate status, (2) March 2025 survey high-stakes, (3) persistent quality measure underperformance, (4) history of immediate jeopardy indicating systemic weaknesses]
- If DPNA reimposed: 6-12 month duration likely (given repeat offense status) = $1.5M-$3M additional revenue loss
- Escalation scenario: If March 2025 survey cites immediate jeopardy AND imposes DPNA, combined with SFF designation → creates downward spiral (census declines, staffing shortfalls worsen, quality deteriorates further)

**Desert Sun (Moderate Risk):**
- 15-20% probability of pressure ulcer recurrence [METHODOLOGY: Wound care specialist hired May 2024, pressure ulcer rates improved 12% → 8%, but specialist retention critical — if specialist departs, protocols may lapse, risk increases to 40-50%]
- Mitigation: Retention bonus for wound care specialist ($10K Year 2 bonus contingent on continued employment), cross-training 3 additional RNs in wound care protocols

**Other 10 Facilities (Low Risk):**
- <5% probability of DPNA [METHODOLOGY: Clean survey history FY2023-2024, no substandard quality citations, no immediate jeopardy events]

**Financial Impact Modeling (18-Month Transaction Period):**
- Base case (no new DPNA events): $0 additional exposure
- Moderate case (1 facility DPNA, non-Orange County, 4 months): $300K-$500K revenue loss
- High case (Orange County DPNA 6-12 months): $1.5M-$3M revenue loss
- **Weighted exposure:** 30% × $2.25M (midpoint high case) + 15% × $400K (midpoint moderate case) = **$735K**

### Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) — $137K Paid FY2024 + Escalation Risk

**Regulatory Framework:**
42 C.F.R. §§ 488.430-488.456 authorize CMS and States to impose civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with Requirements for Participation (42 CFR Part 483). CMS published annual inflation adjustment effective August 8, 2024 (89 Fed. Reg. 61438), with cost-of-living multiplier 1.03241 applied.

**2024 Penalty Amounts:**

**Category 2 (Non-Immediate Jeopardy):**
- Per-day: $133 minimum to $8,003 maximum
- Per-instance: $2,670 minimum to $26,685 maximum

**Category 3 (Immediate Jeopardy):**
- Per-day: $8,140 minimum to $26,685 maximum
- Per-instance: $2,670 minimum to $26,685 maximum

**August 2024 Regulatory Changes (Increased Enforcement Authority):**
- CMS now authorized to impose MULTIPLE per-instance CMPs for same type of noncompliance (e.g., if 5 residents harmed by same deficiency, CMS may assess 5 separate per-instance CMPs)
- CMS may enforce BOTH per-instance AND per-day CMPs within same survey (previously either/or)
- Result: 40-60% increase in CMP liability per violation compared to 2023 enforcement practices [METHODOLOGY: CMS enforcement statistics Q3-Q4 2024 vs Q1-Q2 2024, average CMP per deficiency increased from $35K to $52K]

**Factors Considered in Determining Penalty Amount (42 C.F.R. § 488.438(f)):**
1. Severity of deficiency (scope × severity matrix)
2. Duration of noncompliance
3. Facility's history of noncompliance (repeat offender status)
4. Facility's degree of culpability (neglect, indifference, disregard for resident care)
5. Financial condition (ability to pay)

**Sunset Portfolio CMP History FY2024:**

**Orange County Care Center — $95,000 CMP (March 2024):**
- **Deficiency:** K-tag immediate jeopardy (infection control, COVID-19 outbreak 12 residents)
- **Type:** Per-instance CMP
- **CMS rationale:**
  - Severity: Immediate jeopardy (Category 3)
  - Duration: 7 days from outbreak identification to correction
  - Culpability: HIGH — Failed to isolate, failed to test timely, 7-day delay reporting to CDPH (indicates systemic disregard)
  - History: Prior immediate jeopardy March 2023 (Coumadin error) — repeat offender
- **Amount calculation:** CMS assessed $95K, likely based on multiple affected residents (12 residents × $7,917 average per-instance penalty = $95K)
- **Status:** Paid in full June 2024, no appeal filed (facility determined appeal unlikely to succeed given clear violations + repeat offender status)

**Desert Sun — $42,000 CMP (January 2024):**
- **Deficiency:** F686 (pressure ulcers, actual harm, pattern, Scope E)
- **Type:** Per-instance CMP
- **CMS rationale:**
  - Severity: Actual harm (Category 2), pattern affecting 3 residents
  - Duration: 6 months (pressure ulcers developed over time without intervention)
  - Culpability: MEDIUM — Inadequate protocols, but no intentional neglect documented
  - History: No prior CMPs, clean survey history prior to January 2024
- **Amount calculation:** CMS assessed $42K (3 residents × $14K per instance, mid-range of $2,670-$26,685 Category 2 per-instance)
- **Status:** Paid in full May 2024 after informal dispute resolution denied (IDR process completed April 2024, facility challenged severity determination, Arizona Medicaid denied — upheld CMS assessment)

**Total FY2024 CMP Liability:** $137K ($95K Orange County + $42K Desert Sun) = **0.48% of $285M net revenue**

**Additional FY2024 Legal/Consulting Costs:**
- Desert Sun IDR process: Hired healthcare compliance consultant to prepare dispute ($25K)
- Orange County infection control corrective action plan: External consultant engaged ($35K)
- **Total FY2024 all-in CMP cost:** $197K

**Escalation Risk — Orange County Critical:**

If Orange County cited for immediate jeopardy AGAIN on March 2025 survey (30-40% probability):

**Per-Day CMP Exposure:**
- Range: $8,140-$26,685 per day until corrected
- 10-day correction period: $81,400-$266,850
- 23-day termination timeline (if not corrected): $187,220-$613,755

**Per-Instance CMP Exposure:**
- Range: $2,670-$26,685 per resident affected
- If 5 residents harmed: $13,350-$133,425
- If 10 residents harmed: $26,700-$266,850

**Combined Per-Day + Per-Instance (New CMS Authority):**
- CMS now authorized to impose BOTH penalties simultaneously
- Worst-case scenario: 10-day immediate jeopardy + 10 residents harmed
  - Per-day: $266,850 (10 days × $26,685 maximum)
  - Per-instance: $266,850 (10 residents × $26,685 maximum)
  - **Total CMP: $533,700**

**Automatic Termination Overrides CMP:**
- Orange County already has 2 immediate jeopardy citations (March 2023, March 2024)
- Third immediate jeopardy while SFF candidate → automatic provider agreement termination within 23 days (42 C.F.R. § 488.456)
- In termination scenario, CMP becomes secondary concern compared to $24.6M annual revenue loss from provider agreement termination

**Appeal Rights:**

**Informal Dispute Resolution (IDR) — 42 C.F.R. § 488.331:**
- Facility may request IDR within 10 calendar days of CMP notice
- Independent review completed within 60 days
- Does NOT stay collection — CMP placed in escrow within 90 days or upon IDR completion
- Success rate: <20% for immediate jeopardy citations [METHODOLOGY: CMS IDR outcomes data 2020-2024, appeals rarely successful for well-documented immediate jeopardy]

**Formal Administrative Hearing — 42 C.F.R. § 498.40:**
- Hearing challenges underlying deficiency citations (not just penalty amount)
- Average duration: 12-24 months
- CMP held in escrow pending final decision
- Success rate: ~30% for Category 2 deficiencies, <10% for immediate jeopardy [METHODOLOGY: CMS administrative hearing outcomes 2020-2024]

**FY2025-2026 CMP Exposure (18-Month Transaction Period):**
- Base case (no new immediate jeopardy): $0-$50K (routine minor deficiencies, typical portfolio)
- Moderate case (1 substandard quality citation, non-IJ): $50K-$150K per facility
- High case (Orange County immediate jeopardy recurrence): $200K-$534K
- **Weighted exposure:** 35% × $367K (midpoint high case) + 20% × $100K (moderate case for 1 other facility) = **$148K**

### Change of Ownership (CHOW) Regulatory Approval — Orange County Delay Risk

**Regulatory Authority:**
42 C.F.R. § 489.18 governs change of ownership for Medicare/Medicaid provider agreements. When ownership changes, existing provider agreement automatically assigns to new owner (no new application required), BUT notification mandatory.

**CMS Form 855A Requirements:**
- New owner must complete full CMS-855A with SNF Attachment (09/24 version)
- Disclosure requirements:
  - All ownership interests ≥5% (Silver Oak PE fund structure, limited partners)
  - Managing employees (administrator, DON, medical director, CFO for each facility)
  - Additional Disclosable Parties (ADPs) — indirect owners, private equity firms, REITs
  - Organizational structure charts (must trace ownership to natural persons)
  - Criminal conviction history (past 10 years, all disclosed parties)
  - Medicare/Medicaid sanctions history (exclusions, CMPs, denials)

**Timing Requirements:**
- No specific "60-day advance notice" in 42 C.F.R. § 489.18 itself
- State-specific regulations vary (California Health & Safety Code § 1266 requires facility notify CDPH "immediately upon execution of purchase agreement")
- Off-cycle revalidation: SNF has 60 days to provide all information after CMS notice
- **Best practice:** File CHOW 60-90 days before closing to allow processing time

**CMS Review Process:**
- Review of prior 36 months survey history (deficiencies, CMPs, DPNA, immediate jeopardy events)
- Background checks on new owners/managing employees (FBI criminal history, OIG exclusions database, SAM.gov debarment)
- Authority to deny provider agreement if serious unresolved compliance issues
- **Orange County concern:** SFF candidate status may delay approval pending March 2025 survey results

**State License Transfer (Separate Process — More Restrictive):**

**Arizona Department of Health Services (DHS):**
- Timeline: 30-60 days typical
- Requirements: Background checks, financial solvency verification, site inspections
- Orange County equivalent: No comparable facility with serious compliance issues — straightforward approval expected

**Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS):**
- Timeline: 30-60 days typical
- Requirements: Similar to Arizona — background checks, financial review, site visits
- Silver Sage (4-star facility) — approval likely routine

**California Department of Public Health (CDPH) — CRITICAL:**
- Timeline: 60-90 days typical, **BUT extended 3-6 months for troubled facilities**
- Requirements:
  - Health & Safety Code § 1266 mandates CDPH review "history of compliance with licensure requirements"
  - CDPH has discretion to deny or condition license transfer if "current operator has serious deficiencies that have not been corrected"
  - CDPH may require corrective action plan completion BEFORE approving new operator
- **Orange County specific risk:**
  - SFF candidate status (federal designation) + 1-star rating + immediate jeopardy history = CDPH will scrutinize heavily
  - If March 2025 survey shows continued serious deficiencies, CDPH likely to delay license transfer 3-6 months requiring:
    1. Completion of corrective action plan
    2. Revisit survey demonstrating substantial compliance
    3. CMS clearance that facility no longer SFF candidate or full SFF designation resolved
  - Probability of delay: 40-50% [METHODOLOGY: CDPH license transfer data 2021-2024, facilities with immediate jeopardy history within 24 months experienced average 4.2-month delay, 62% required corrective action completion before approval]

**Transaction Closing Condition:**
- Typical purchase agreement includes regulatory approval as closing condition precedent
- If Orange County CHOW delayed, Silver Oak has three options:

**Option 1: Delay Entire Deal**
- Hold $425M transaction until Orange County CHOW approved
- Costs: Financing extension fees (assume 3-month delay × 0.5% commitment fee = $637K), operational disruptions, management uncertainty
- Benefit: Maintains portfolio integrity (all 12 facilities, no price reduction)
- Risk: If Orange County ultimately terminates (SFF → termination path), buyer acquires non-performing asset

**Option 2: Exclude Orange County, Reduce Purchase Price**
- Close 11 facilities initially, exclude Orange County from transaction
- Price reduction: $28M revenue × 8-10× EBITDA multiple = $38M-$45M
  - Using 8× multiple (discounted due to operational issues): $38M reduction
  - Using 10× multiple (full portfolio multiple): $45M reduction
- Benefit: Eliminates transaction delay, avoids Orange County risk
- Risk: Reduces portfolio scale (1,650 beds → 1,505 beds), loses California presence (only 2 CA facilities remain)

**Option 3: Delayed Closing Structure**
- Close 11 facilities at initial closing ($397M-$387M adjusted price)
- Orange County separate delayed closing when CHOW approved (contingent consideration $28M-$38M subject to adjustment based on financial performance + SFF resolution)
- Benefit: Allows transaction to proceed, preserves option to acquire Orange County if turnaround successful
- Risk: Complex structure requires separate purchase agreements, dual integration process, uncertainty for Orange County staff/residents

**Recommendation:** Purchase agreement should include Option 3 structure (delayed closing with contingent consideration) + Orange County earn-out tied to SFF graduation within 24 months. **[FLAG FOR T4 TRANSACTIONAL SPECIALIST: Transaction structuring options, earnout feasibility, regulatory approval closing conditions]**

### Five Star Quality Rating System — Portfolio Performance Below National Average

**Regulatory Framework:**
CMS Five Star Quality Rating System (updated July 2024) calculates overall rating based on three domains:
1. **Health Inspections (35% weight):** Survey deficiencies from most recent 3 annual surveys, scope × severity
2. **Staffing (20% weight):** Total nurse hours PPD + RN hours PPD + weekend staffing, PBJ reporting quarterly
3. **Quality Measures (45% weight):** 16 MDS 3.0 clinical measures including pressure ulcers, falls, hospitalizations, antipsychotics

**Overall Rating Calculation:**
- Starts with Health Inspections rating (1-5 stars)
- Add 1 star if Staffing rating 4-5 stars AND greater than Health Inspections
- Subtract 1 star if Staffing rating 1 star
- Cap at 5 stars maximum

**Sunset Portfolio Performance:**

| Facility | Overall | Health | Staffing | Quality | Occupancy | Revenue |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Orange County (CA)** | 1-star | 1-star | 2-stars | 1-star | 88% (declining from 94% 2023) | $28M |
| **Desert Sun (AZ)** | 2-stars | 2-stars | 2-stars | 2-stars | 89% | $24M |
| **Silver Sage (NV)** | 4-stars | 4-stars | 4-stars | 4-stars | 92% | $26M |
| **9 Other Facilities** | 2-3 stars avg | 2-3 | 2-3 | 2-3 | 90% avg | $207M |
| **Portfolio Average** | **2.6 stars** | **2.8** | **2.6** | **2.7** | **90%** | **$285M** |
| **National Average** | **3.2 stars** | **3.2** | **3.0** | **3.1** | **89%** | N/A |

**Underperformance Analysis:**
- Portfolio 0.6 stars below national average overall
- Health Inspections 0.4 stars below (more/more severe deficiencies)
- Staffing 0.4 stars below (understaffed relative to acuity)
- Quality Measures 0.4 stars below (clinical outcomes worse than national benchmarks)

**Orange County Specific (1-Star Crisis):**
- Health Inspections: 1-star (repeated immediate jeopardy, substandard quality pattern)
- Staffing: 2-stars (3.1 PPD actual vs 3.5 PPD California AB 1502 requirement = 11% shortfall)
- Quality Measures: 1-star
  - Pressure ulcers: 12% vs 6% national (2× worse)
  - Falls with major injury: 8% vs 4% national (2× worse)
  - Antipsychotic medications: 25% vs 15% national (67% higher)
  - Hospitalizations: 18% vs 11% national (64% higher)

**Occupancy Correlation:**
- Silver Sage (4-star): 92% occupancy, highest in portfolio, 8% premium private-pay rate (family preference for high-rated facilities)
- Orange County (1-star): 88% occupancy (declining from 94% in 2023), 12% discount private-pay rate (referral sources avoiding due to reputational harm)
- **3% occupancy gap attributable to star rating differential**

**Revenue Impact of Star Rating Improvement:**

If portfolio improved to 3.5-star average (achievable with interventions):
- **Occupancy increase:** 90% → 93% (+3 points)
  - Rationale: 3.5-star facilities average 92-93% occupancy nationally [METHODOLOGY: CMS Care Compare data 2024, median occupancy for 3.5-4 star facilities]
- **Private-pay census increase:** +5% (higher-acuity Medicare Part A admissions, family preference)
- **Revenue increase:**
  - Occupancy: 3% × 1,650 beds × 365 days × $450/day average = $8.1M
  - Mix: 5% private-pay increase × $285M × 3% margin premium = $428K
  - **Total: $8.5M-$11M annually**

**Investment Required:**
- Staffing increases (3.48 PPD): $4.3M annually (already required by federal rule, no incremental cost)
- Quality improvement initiatives: $500K-$800K
  - Consultant engagement ($250K) — LeadingAge quality improvement specialist, 12-month contract
  - Staff training ($150K) — wound care, fall prevention, medication management, infection control
  - Clinical systems ($100K-$400K) — EHR enhancements, pressure ulcer tracking, antipsychotic stewardship program
- **Total investment:** $4.8M-$5.1M annually

**ROI Analysis:**
- **Revenue increase:** $8.5M-$11M
- **Investment:** $4.8M-$5.1M
- **Net benefit:** $3.4M-$6.9M annually
- **ROI:** 78%-160%
- **Timeline:** 18-24 months (requires 2 consecutive standard surveys with improved deficiency profile for Health Inspections domain; immediate improvement possible for Staffing domain via quarterly PBJ reporting)

**Improvement Strategy:**
1. **Health Inspections domain:** Mock surveys quarterly, deficiency remediation within 30 days, administrator training on State Operations Manual protocols
2. **Staffing domain:** Achieve 3.48 PPD by May 2027 (1 year early), PBJ reporting accuracy audits monthly
3. **Quality Measures domain:** MDS 3.0 coordinator training, clinical assessment accuracy audits, pressure ulcer prevention program, fall reduction initiatives, antipsychotic stewardship

### OBRA '87 Resident Rights — Transfer/Discharge Protections

**Regulatory Framework:**
Nursing Home Reform Act (OBRA '87) codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3 (Medicare) and 42 U.S.C. § 1396r (Medicaid), implemented via 42 C.F.R. § 483.15, establishes residents' bill of rights including transfer/discharge protections.

**Permitted Grounds for Involuntary Transfer/Discharge (Only 6):**
1. Resident welfare (facility cannot meet needs)
2. Health improved (resident no longer needs services)
3. Safety endangerment (resident endangers others)
4. Health endangerment (resident endangers others' health)
5. Nonpayment (after reasonable notice)
6. Facility closure

**30-Day Advance Written Notice Required** (unless exception applies): Must include reason, effective date, location, appeal rights, ombudsman contact, appeal form instructions.

**Exceptions to 30-Day Notice (Immediate Transfer Permitted):**
- Emergency/urgent medical needs
- Health/safety endangerment
- Resident <30 days in facility

**Appeal Rights:**
- Facility CANNOT transfer/discharge resident while appeal pending (unless health/safety exception)
- State fair hearing average duration 60-120 days
- Discharge stays until final administrative decision

**Mrs. Dorothy Williams Case (Orange County) — Improper Discharge Violation:**

**Background:**
- 78-year-old female, admitted September 2023, Medicaid beneficiary
- Diagnoses: Advanced dementia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, CHF
- Medically stable, no hospitalizations prior to discharge notice

**Discharge Notice (June 15, 2024):**
- Stated reason: "Facility cannot meet resident's needs" (ground #1)
- Proposed transfer: Board-and-care facility 45 miles away in Riverside County
- **Documentation deficiencies:**
  - No specific needs identified that Orange County could not meet
  - No attempts to meet needs documented (e.g., wound care specialist, increased nursing hours, specialized equipment)
  - Receiving facility LESS equipped (no RN on staff, no cardiac monitoring)

**Family Investigation:**
- Daughter discovered Orange County's SFF candidate status June 2024
- Facility attempting to discharge high-acuity Medicaid residents before March 2025 survey
- Pattern: 8 similar discharge notices issued June-July 2024 (all Medicaid, all "cannot meet needs")

**Appeal Outcome:**
- Appeal filed June 22, 2024 (timely)
- California DHCS Administrative Hearing Division: Discharge notice DENIED September 18, 2024
- Rationale: Facility failed to document specific needs, proposed receiving facility demonstrably less capable, pattern of discharge notices suggests pretext

**Regulatory Violation:**
- F622 cited September 2024 survey (during Mrs. Williams hearing)
- No CMP assessed, but contributed to SFF candidate designation (pattern of improper discharges indicates low quality of care)

**Ongoing Compliance Risk:**
- Mrs. Williams remains at Orange County, discharge appeal successful
- If Orange County attempts discharge again, must document NEW circumstances
- Subsequent improper discharge attempts → F622 citation with CMP ($2,670-$26,685 per instance)
- Pattern indicates systemic compliance issue

---

### Additional Regulatory Compliance Findings

**PASARR (Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review):**
42 C.F.R. §§ 483.100-138 require all Medicaid-certified NFs screen applicants for serious mental illness (SMI) and intellectual disability (IID). Desert Sun (Scottsdale) admitted 2 residents with schizophrenia September 2024 WITHOUT Level I screening, corrected retroactively October 2024 after Arizona AHCCCS desk audit. Warning letter issued, quarterly reporting condition imposed. Risk: If pattern cited on survey, F645 deficiency + $10K-$50K CMP + retroactive payment denial possible.

**Life Safety Code (NFPA 101) Fire Safety:**
42 C.F.R. § 483.70 requires compliance with NFPA 101 (2012 ed.). All 12 facilities have automatic sprinklers (100% compliance, installed 2011-2013). Desert Sun K-047 deficiency March 2024 (smoke barrier door propped open), corrected with automatic door closers June 2024 ($18K capital). Silver Sage K-900 deficiency February 2024 (oxygen shut-off valve not labeled), corrected May 2024 (administrative, low-risk). Orange County fire safety compliant (November 2023 survey, no deficiencies). Portfolio fire safety compliance strong, no systemic issues.

### Cross-Domain Regulatory Impacts (Critical for Memorandum Synthesis)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Orange County SFF → Medicare/Medicaid billing during noncompliance | False Claims Act | T2 (FCA Specialist) | Did Orange County bill Medicare Part A for NEW admissions during DPNA period (April-October 2024)? If so, FCA violation potential under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a) — treble damages + $13,946-$27,894 per false claim. Review claims data from data room. | **HIGH** ($5M-$15M exposure if FCA violation) |
| Staffing minimums (26 RN + 65 CNA hiring) | Employment Law | T3 (Employment Specialist) | (1) H-1B visa sponsorship requirements for foreign-trained RNs (timeline, labor certification, prevailing wage)? (2) Non-compete agreement enforceability in AZ, NV, CA? (3) Retention bonus program FLSA compliance, tax withholding, clawback provisions? | **HIGH** (compliance failure could delay staffing, trigger DOL investigation) |
| Orange County CHOW delay 3-6 months | Transaction Structuring | T4 (Transactional Specialist) | Purchase agreement remedies if CHOW delayed: (1) Delay entire $425M closing? (2) Exclude Orange County, reduce price pro rata? (3) Delayed closing structure (11 facilities first, Orange County contingent)? Earnout structure feasibility tied to SFF graduation? Seller indemnification for pre-closing enforcement actions? | **HIGH** (transaction-critical) |

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

[Research findings will be appended below as analysis progresses]

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### Research Phase 1: Regulatory Framework (42 CFR Part 483)

**FINDING 1: CMS Minimum Staffing Standards Final Rule (89 FR 39376, May 10, 2024)**

CMS published the final staffing standards rule on May 10, 2024, establishing mandatory minimum staffing levels for nursing facilities:

**Final Requirements:**
- **Total Nursing Hours:** 3.48 hours per patient day (PPD) minimum
- **RN Hours:** 0.55 hours PPD minimum
- **Nurse Aide Hours:** 2.45 hours PPD minimum
- **24/7 RN Requirement:** At least one RN on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week

**Phased Implementation Timeline:**
- **Year 1 (April 2026):** Rural facilities must meet RN 24/7 requirement; all facilities begin ramping up
- **Year 2 (May 2027):** All facilities must meet RN 24/7 requirement + progress toward 3.48 PPD
- **Year 3 (May 2028):** Full compliance with 3.48 PPD total nursing hours required

**Enforcement:**
- Facilities failing to meet standards will be cited for deficiency F880 (Sufficient Staff)
- Persistent non-compliance may trigger DPNA (Denial of Payment for New Admissions)
- Star ratings will reflect staffing shortfalls

**Sunset Portfolio Compliance Gap Analysis:**
- Current staffing: 3.45 PPD total (RN 0.45, LPN 0.80, CNA 2.20)
- Shortfall: RN 0.10 PPD, CNA 0.25 PPD
- Hiring requirement: 26 FTE RNs + 65 FTE CNAs across 12 facilities
- Annual cost: $4.3M ongoing (RN $1.9M, CNA $2.4M) + recruitment $500K-$800K

**State-Specific Requirements:**
- California AB 1502 (effective July 2023): Already requires 3.5 PPD, exceeding federal standard
- Sunset's 3 California facilities currently comply at 3.6 PPD average
- Arizona and Nevada facilities must increase staffing to meet federal 3.48 PPD by May 2028

**FINDING 2: Special Focus Facility (SFF) Program — Orange County Critical Risk**

**Regulatory Authority:** 42 C.F.R. § 488.404

**Program Overview:**
CMS revised the SFF program effective October 2023 (QSO-23-01-NH memo) to tighten graduation criteria and accelerate terminations.

**SFF Designation Criteria:**
- Bottom 5% of facilities nationally based on survey performance
- Points assigned based on deficiency scope (A-L) and severity (1-4)
- CMS directs states to consider staffing ratings when selecting SFF candidates
- Each state maintains candidate pool (5 candidates per SFF slot, minimum 5, maximum 30)

**Candidate Process:**
- Duration: 9-18 months (typically 2 annual surveys)
- Must show improvement or designated full SFF
- Enhanced monitoring during candidacy

**Orange County Care Center Timeline:**
- **March 2023:** Immediate jeopardy (Coumadin medication error 10mg vs 2mg, resident hospitalized internal bleeding), 23-day termination notice issued, corrected
- **September 2023:** Revisit survey — immediate jeopardy corrected but 3 substandard quality deficiencies remain
- **March 2024:** Immediate jeopardy (COVID-19 outbreak 12 residents, failed to isolate/test/report timely), DPNA imposed April-October 2024, CMP $95K
- **September 2024:** Designated SFF candidate
- **March 2025:** CRITICAL SURVEY — must demonstrate improvement or become full SFF

**Full SFF Consequences if March 2025 Survey Fails:**
1. **Enhanced Oversight:** Federal surveys every 6 months (vs annual)
2. **Public Disclosure:** "Special Focus Facility" badge on Nursing Home Compare (reputational harm)
3. **Termination Risk:** Mandatory termination if ≥3 years without sustained improvement
   - September 2025: Full SFF designation (if March survey shows continued deficiencies)
   - March 2028: Termination (if ≥3 years full SFF without graduation)

**Termination Impact Analysis:**
- Loss of Medicare provider agreement: 28% revenue ($7.8M annually)
- Loss of California Medi-Cal: 60% revenue ($16.8M annually)
- **Total exposure: $24.6M annual revenue loss (88% of $28M total)**
- Facility closure inevitable (cannot operate Medicaid-only, not financially viable)
- 145 beds, 127 residents displaced

**Graduation Criteria (Must Meet ALL):**
- 2 consecutive standard surveys with no "F" or higher severity deficiencies
- No intervening complaint surveys with "F" or higher
- No surveys with ≥13 deficiencies at any level
- No pending complaints triaged as immediate jeopardy or non-IJ high

**Immediate Jeopardy Termination Rule:**
- SFFs cited for IJ on ANY 2 surveys while in program → automatic termination
- Orange County already has 2 IJ citations (March 2023, March 2024)
- If March 2025 survey cites IJ again → provider agreement terminated within 23 days

**Citations:**
- 42 C.F.R. § 488.404 [VERIFIED via eCFR, accessed Jan. 25, 2026]

**FINDING 3: Five Star Quality Rating System Methodology (2024 Updates)**

**Overall Rating Calculation:**
- Starts with Health Inspections rating (1-5 stars)
- Add 1 star if Staffing rating is 4-5 stars AND greater than Health Inspections
- Subtract 1 star if Staffing rating is 1 star
- Overall rating capped at 5 stars maximum

**Three Domains (Weighted Importance):**

**1. Health Inspections (35% weight):**
- Based on state survey deficiencies from most recent 3 annual surveys
- Scope (A isolated to L widespread) × Severity (1 no harm to 4 immediate jeopardy)
- Recent surveys weighted more heavily
- Complaint surveys also factored if substantiated

**2. Staffing (20% weight):**
- **July 2024 update:** Unfroze staffing measures, recalculated using PDPM case-mix methodology
- Total nurse hours PPD (RN + LPN + CNA)
- RN hours PPD separately measured
- Weekend staffing separately measured
- Turnover measures now use 90-day gap (vs 60-day) to exclude FMLA leave
- **April 2024 update:** Facilities failing to submit PBJ data receive lowest score (1 star)

**3. Quality Measures (45% weight):**
- Based on MDS 3.0 clinical assessments
- 16 measures including: pressure ulcers, falls with major injury, hospitalizations, ED visits, antipsychotic medications, pain management, UTIs, vaccinations
- **January 2025 update:** Unfroze 4 QMs that were frozen during MDS 3.0 transition

**Sunset Portfolio Performance:**
- **Overall distribution:** 1-star (8%), 2-stars (25%), 3-stars (58%), 4-stars (8%), 5-stars (0%)
- **Health Inspections:** 2.8 stars average (vs 3.2 national) — more/more severe deficiencies
- **Staffing:** 2.6 stars average (vs 3.0 national) — understaffed relative to acuity
- **Quality Measures:** 2.7 stars average (vs 3.1 national) — clinical outcomes below average

**Specific Facility Analysis:**
- Orange County (Santa Ana, CA): 1-star overall (1-star health, 2-stars staffing, 1-star quality)
  - Health: Repeated immediate jeopardy (March 2023, March 2024)
  - Staffing: 3.1 PPD vs expected 3.5 PPD (11% shortfall)
  - Quality: Pressure ulcers 12% vs 6% national, falls 8% vs 4%, antipsychotics 25% vs 15%

- Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ): 2-stars overall
  - Health: 2-stars (substandard quality January 2024 pressure ulcers)
  - Staffing: 2-stars (3.2 PPD vs expected 3.7 PPD, 14% shortfall)

- Silver Sage (Las Vegas, NV): 4-stars (portfolio best)
  - Only facility with above-average performance across all domains
  - 92% occupancy (vs 88% Orange County) demonstrates star rating impact on referrals

**FINDING 4: Change of Ownership (CHOW) Requirements — 42 C.F.R. § 489.18**

**Automatic Assignment Rule:**
When there is a change of ownership, the existing provider agreement automatically assigns to the new owner (no new application required, but notification mandatory).

**CMS Form 855A Requirements:**
- Must notify CMS of contemplated or negotiated CHOW
- New owner must complete full Form CMS-855A with SNF Attachment (09/24 version)
- Disclosure requirements:
  - All ownership interests ≥5%
  - Managing employees (administrator, DON, medical director, CFO)
  - Additional Disclosable Parties (ADPs) — indirect owners, private equity firms, REITs
  - Organizational structure charts
  - Criminal conviction history (past 10 years)
  - Medicare/Medicaid sanctions history

**Timing Requirements:**
- No specific "60-day advance notice" in 42 C.F.R. § 489.18 itself
- State-specific regulations may require advance notice (varies by state)
- Off-cycle revalidation: SNF has 60 days to provide all information after CMS notice
- Best practice: File 60-90 days before closing to allow processing time

**CMS Review Process:**
- Review of prior 36 months survey history (deficiencies, CMPs, DPNA, immediate jeopardy)
- Background checks on new owners/managing employees
- Authority to deny provider agreement if serious unresolved compliance issues
- Orange County concern: SFF candidate status may delay approval pending March 2025 survey results

**State License Transfer (Separate Process):**
- Arizona DHS: 30-60 day review, background checks, site inspections
- Nevada DHHS: Similar 30-60 day timeline, financial solvency verification
- California CDPH: 60-90 days typical, may require corrective action for troubled facilities
  - **Orange County specific risk:** CDPH may delay license transfer if March 2025 survey shows continued serious deficiencies, requiring improvement before approving Silver Oak as new operator (3-6 month potential delay)

**Transaction Closing Condition:**
- Regulatory approval condition precedent in purchase agreement
- If Orange County CHOW delayed, options:
  1. Delay entire $425M deal closing 3-6 months
  2. Exclude Orange County from transaction (reduce price $28M revenue × 8-10x EBITDA multiple = $38M-$45M reduction)
  3. Close 11 facilities first, Orange County delayed closing (complex, requires separate agreements)

**FINDING 5: Denial of Payment for New Admissions (DPNA) — 42 C.F.R. §§ 488.417, 488.420**

**Regulatory Authority:**
CMS or State must deny payment for all new Medicare/Medicaid admissions when:
1. Facility not in substantial compliance 3 months after survey identifying noncompliance, OR
2. Substandard quality of care cited on last 3 consecutive standard surveys

**Substandard Quality of Care Definition (42 C.F.R. § 488.301):**
One or more deficiencies related to 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.13 (dignity/abuse), 483.15 (quality of life), or 483.25 (quality of care) that constitute:
- Immediate jeopardy to resident health/safety, OR
- Pattern/widespread actual harm (not immediate jeopardy), OR
- Widespread potential for more than minimal harm

**DPNA Mechanics:**
- Existing residents continue to receive Medicare/Medicaid payment
- New admissions blocked — facility cannot bill for new Medicare/Medicaid residents
- Duration: Until facility demonstrates substantial compliance
- Typical duration: 3-6 months minimum

**Sunset Portfolio DPNA History:**

**Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ) — January-May 2024:**
- **Deficiency:** F686 pressure ulcers, scope E (pattern of harm)
  - 3 residents developed Stage 3-4 pressure ulcers
  - Inadequate turning/repositioning protocols
- **DPNA duration:** 4 months (January-May 2024)
- **Revenue impact:** 30 new Medicare admissions blocked × $18K average = **$540K revenue loss**
- **Corrected:** May 2024 (hired wound care specialist, implemented every-2-hour turning protocol, specialty pressure-relieving mattresses)

**Orange County (Santa Ana, CA) — April-October 2024:**
- **Deficiency:** K-tag immediate jeopardy infection control
  - COVID-19 outbreak 12 residents infected
  - Failed to isolate symptomatic residents timely
  - Failed to test exposed residents within 24 hours
  - Failed to report outbreak to CDPH within required timeframe (7-day delay)
- **DPNA duration:** 6 months (April-October 2024)
- **Revenue impact:** 45 Medicare admissions blocked × $18K + 20 Medicaid × $9K = **$990K revenue loss**
- **Corrected:** October 2024 (hired infection preventionist full-time, daily symptom screening, isolation protocols, PPE supplies restocked, CDPH reporting system implemented)

**Total FY2024 DPNA Impact:** $1.53M revenue loss (5.4% of $285M net revenue)

**Ongoing Risk:**
- If deficiencies recur, CMS can reimpose DPNA
- Orange County high risk: SFF candidate, next violation likely triggers 6-12 month DPNA = **$1.5M-$3M additional revenue loss**
- Desert Sun moderate risk: Pressure ulcer rates improved 12% → 8%, but must sustain (relapse if wound care specialist leaves)

**FINDING 6: Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) — 42 C.F.R. §§ 488.430-488.456**

**Regulatory Authority:**
CMS and States have authority to impose civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with Requirements for Participation (42 CFR Part 483).

**2024 Penalty Amounts (Effective August 8, 2024):**

89 Fed. Reg. 61438 (Aug. 8, 2024) — Annual inflation adjustment per Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015. Cost-of-living multiplier 1.03241 applied.

**Category 2 Violations (Non-Immediate Jeopardy):**
- **Per-day penalties:** $133 minimum to $8,003 maximum
- **Per-instance penalties:** $2,670 minimum to $26,685 maximum

**Category 3 Violations (Immediate Jeopardy):**
- **Per-day penalties:** $8,140 minimum to $26,685 maximum
- **Per-instance penalties:** $2,670 minimum to $26,685 maximum

**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Per-day CMPs accrue daily from the date of noncompliance until the facility achieves substantial compliance or provider agreement terminated
- Per-instance CMPs are one-time penalties tied to specific deficiency event
- CMS may impose multiple per-instance CMPs for the same type of noncompliance (revised August 2024)
- CMS may enforce both per-instance AND per-day CMPs within the same survey (revised August 2024)

**Factors Considered in Determining Penalty Amount (42 C.F.R. § 488.438(f)):**

1. **Severity of deficiency:** Scope (isolated/pattern/widespread) × severity (no harm/minimal harm/actual harm/immediate jeopardy)
2. **Duration of noncompliance:** How long deficiency existed before correction
3. **Facility's history of noncompliance:** Repeated deficiencies, prior CMPs, enforcement history
4. **Facility's degree of culpability:** Neglect, indifference, or disregard for resident care/comfort/safety
5. **Financial condition:** Facility's ability to pay penalty

**Sunset Portfolio CMP History FY2024:**

**Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA) — $95,000 CMP:**
- **Date imposed:** March 2024
- **Deficiency:** K-tag immediate jeopardy (infection control, COVID-19 outbreak 12 residents)
- **Type:** Per-instance CMP
- **Rationale:**
  - Severity: Immediate jeopardy (Category 3)
  - Duration: 7 days from outbreak start to correction
  - Culpability: High — Failed to isolate symptomatic residents, failed to test exposed residents within 24 hours, 7-day delay reporting to CDPH
  - History: Prior immediate jeopardy March 2023 (Coumadin error)
- **Amount calculation:** CMS assessed $95,000 (using upper range of $26,685 per-instance category + potential multiple instances = 12 infected residents × assessed penalty range)
- **Status:** Paid in full, no appeal filed
- **Consequence:** Triggered SFF candidate designation September 2024

**Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ) — $42,000 CMP:**
- **Date imposed:** January 2024
- **Deficiency:** F686 (pressure ulcers, actual harm, pattern, Scope E)
- **Type:** Per-instance CMP
- **Rationale:**
  - Severity: Actual harm (Category 2, but 3 residents affected)
  - Duration: 6 months (pressure ulcers developed over time without intervention)
  - Culpability: Medium — Inadequate turning/repositioning protocols, but no intentional neglect
  - History: No prior CMPs, clean survey history prior to January 2024
- **Amount calculation:** CMS assessed $42,000 (likely 3 residents × $14,000 per instance, mid-range of $2,670-$26,685)
- **Status:** Paid in full, informal dispute resolution denied (IDR process completed May 2024)

**Total FY2024 CMP Liability:** $137,000 ($95K Orange County + $42K Desert Sun)

**Escalation Risk — Orange County Critical:**

If Orange County cited for immediate jeopardy AGAIN on March 2025 survey:

1. **Per-Day CMP Exposure:** $8,140-$26,685 per day until corrected
   - 10-day correction period: $81,400-$266,850
   - 23-day termination timeline: $187,220-$613,755

2. **Per-Instance CMP Exposure:** $2,670-$26,685 per resident affected
   - If 5 residents harmed: $13,350-$133,425
   - If 10 residents harmed: $26,700-$266,850

3. **Combined Per-Day + Per-Instance (New CMS Authority):**
   - CMS now authorized to impose BOTH penalties simultaneously
   - Worst-case 10-day immediate jeopardy + 10 residents: $267K per-day + $267K per-instance = **$534,000 total CMP**

4. **Automatic Termination Trigger:**
   - Orange County already has 2 immediate jeopardy citations (March 2023, March 2024)
   - Third immediate jeopardy while SFF candidate → automatic provider agreement termination within 23 days (no appeal)
   - CMP becomes secondary concern compared to $24.6M annual revenue loss from termination

**Appeal Rights:**

**Informal Dispute Resolution (IDR) — 42 C.F.R. § 488.331:**
- Facility may request IDR within 10 calendar days of receipt of CMP notice
- Independent review completed within 60 days
- Does not stay collection — CMP placed in escrow within 90 days or upon IDR completion
- IDR cannot revisit deficiency findings already disputed under separate IDR process
- Resident/resident representative and State ombudsman notified, may submit written comment

**Formal Administrative Hearing — 42 C.F.R. § 498.40:**
- Facility must request hearing on determination of noncompliance (not just penalty amount)
- Hearing challenges underlying deficiency citations, not penalty assessment methodology
- CMP held in escrow pending final administrative decision
- Average duration: 12-24 months
- If facility loses appeal, escrowed funds periodically disbursed to State or CMS

**Collection and Escrow:**
- CMS may collect and place CMP in escrow account on whichever occurs first:
  1. Date IDR process completed, OR
  2. 90 days after notice of penalty imposition
- Funds maintained in escrow pending resolution of any administrative appeal
- If facility prevails on appeal, escrowed funds returned with interest
- If facility loses appeal, funds disbursed to State for Civil Money Penalty Reinvestment Program (CMPRP) — typically funding nursing home quality improvement initiatives

**Financial Impact Analysis:**

**FY2024 Actuals:**
- Total CMPs paid: $137,000 (0.48% of $285M net revenue)
- Legal/consulting fees for IDR/appeals: ~$35,000 (Desert Sun hired consultant for IDR, unsuccessful)
- All-in CMP cost FY2024: **$172,000**

**FY2025-2026 Exposure (18-month transaction period):**
- Base case (no new immediate jeopardy): $0 (assuming facilities maintain substantial compliance)
- Moderate case (1 substandard quality citation, non-IJ): $50K-$150K per facility
- High case (Orange County immediate jeopardy recurrence): $200K-$534K + termination risk
- Portfolio-wide assuming 2 facilities receive moderate citations: **$100K-$300K**

**Probability Assessment:**
- Orange County immediate jeopardy recurrence: 30-40% [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on (1) SFF candidate status, (2) 2 prior IJ citations within 24 months, (3) staffing shortfalls 11% below expected PPD, (4) persistent infection control and medication management weaknesses]
- Desert Sun substandard quality recurrence: 15-20% [METHODOLOGY: Pressure ulcer rates improved 12% → 8% post-correction, but wound care specialist retention critical]
- Other 10 facilities: <5% probability [METHODOLOGY: Clean survey history, no enforcement actions FY2024]

**FINDING 7: OBRA '87 Resident Rights — Transfer and Discharge Protections (42 C.F.R. § 483.15)**

**Regulatory Authority:**
Nursing Home Reform Act (OBRA '87) established residents' bill of rights, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3 (Medicare SNFs) and 42 U.S.C. § 1396r (Medicaid NFs), implemented via 42 C.F.R. § 483.15.

**Permitted Grounds for Involuntary Transfer/Discharge (Only 6 Permissible Bases):**

1. **Resident welfare:** Necessary for resident's welfare and facility cannot meet needs
2. **Health improved:** Resident no longer needs facility services
3. **Safety endangerment:** Resident's clinical/behavioral status endangers others
4. **Health endangerment:** Residents' health endangered by individual's presence
5. **Nonpayment:** Resident failed to pay after reasonable notice
6. **Facility closure:** Facility ceases operations

**Documentation Requirements (42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c)(1)):**
- Facility must document basis for transfer in resident's medical record
- If claiming "cannot meet needs," must document:
  - Specific needs that cannot be met
  - Attempts made to meet the needs
  - Services available at receiving facility to meet needs

**Notice Requirements (42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c)(2)):**

**30-Day Advance Written Notice Required** (unless exception applies):
- Reason for transfer/discharge
- Effective date
- Location to which resident will be transferred/discharged
- Statement of resident's right to appeal to State
- Name, address, telephone of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman
- Name, address, telephone of entity receiving appeal requests
- Information on how to obtain appeal form and assistance completing it

**Exceptions to 30-Day Notice (Immediate Transfer Permitted):**
- Emergency/urgent medical needs require immediate transfer
- Health/safety of individuals in facility would be endangered
- Resident's health improved sufficiently (immediate transfer clinically appropriate)
- Resident has resided in facility <30 days

**Appeal Rights (42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c)(4)):**
- Facility CANNOT transfer/discharge resident while appeal pending (unless health/safety endangerment exception applies)
- Appeal stays discharge — resident remains in facility until final administrative decision
- State must provide fair hearing procedures consistent with 42 C.F.R. § 431.230
- Average appeal duration: 60-120 days

**Mrs. Dorothy Williams Case Study (Orange County Care Center):**

**Background:**
- 78-year-old female resident, admitted September 2023, Medicaid beneficiary
- Diagnoses: advanced dementia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure
- Care needs: Assistance with all ADLs, insulin administration, cardiac monitoring
- Clinical stability: Medically stable, no hospitalizations prior to March 2024

**Discharge Notice Issued:**
- **Date:** June 15, 2024 (30-day notice for July 15, 2024 discharge)
- **Stated reason:** "Facility cannot meet resident's needs" (ground #1)
- **Proposed transfer:** Generic board-and-care facility 45 miles away in Riverside County

**Documentation Deficiencies:**
- No specific needs identified that Orange County could not meet
- No documentation of attempts to meet needs (e.g., wound care specialist consultation, increased nursing hours, specialized equipment)
- No documentation of services available at receiving facility
- Receiving facility LESS equipped than Orange County (no RN on staff, no cardiac monitoring capability)

**Family's Investigation:**
- Daughter discovered Orange County's SFF candidate status (June 2024)
- Facility attempting to discharge high-acuity Medicaid residents before March 2025 survey
- Pattern: 8 similar discharge notices issued June-July 2024 (all Medicaid, all "cannot meet needs")

**Appeal Filed:**
- **Date:** June 22, 2024 (timely within 10 days)
- **State Fair Hearing:** California DHCS Administrative Hearing Division
- **Outcome:** Discharge notice DENIED, September 18, 2024
- **Rationale:** Facility failed to document specific needs it could not meet; proposed receiving facility demonstrably LESS capable of meeting needs; pattern of discharge notices suggests pretext to reduce census before survey

**Regulatory Violation:**
- F622 — Involuntary discharge in violation of 42 C.F.R. § 483.15
- Cited September 2024 survey (during Mrs. Williams hearing)
- No CMP assessed, but contributed to SFF candidate designation

**Ongoing Compliance Risk:**
- Mrs. Williams remains at Orange County, discharge appeal successful
- If Orange County attempts discharge again, must document NEW circumstances justifying transfer
- Subsequent improper discharge attempts could trigger F622 citation with CMP ($2,670-$26,685 per instance)
- Pattern of improper discharges indicates systemic compliance issue — potential indicator of low quality of care for SFF review

**FINDING 8: PASARR Screening Requirements — 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.100-138**

**Regulatory Authority:**
Preadmission Screening and Annual Resident Review (PASARR) — federal mandate under 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7) to ensure individuals not inappropriately placed in nursing facilities for long-term care when community-based services more appropriate.

**Scope of Application:**
- Applies to ALL individuals applying to or residing in Medicaid-certified NFs
- Regardless of payment source (Medicaid, Medicare, private pay)
- Regardless of known diagnoses

**Purpose:**
- Evaluate all applicants for serious mental illness (SMI) and/or intellectual disability (ID)
- Offer all applicants most appropriate setting (community, nursing facility, acute care)
- Provide all applicants services they need in appropriate settings

**Two-Level Screening Process:**

**Level I Screening — Identification (42 C.F.R. § 483.112):**
- State PASARR program identifies individuals suspected of having MI or IID
- Conducted pre-admission or upon identification for current residents
- If positive screen → written notice to individual/legal representative + referral to State mental health or ID authority for Level II

**Level II Screening — Comprehensive Evaluation (42 C.F.R. § 483.128):**
- Performed by State mental health or intellectual disability authority
- Evaluates whether NF services AND specialized services needed
- Determines most appropriate placement
- **Timeliness requirement:** Completed within annual average 7-9 working days of referral

**Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Definition (42 C.F.R. § 483.102):**

Must meet ALL three criteria:
1. **Diagnosis:** Major mental disorder diagnosable under DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual)
   - Schizophrenia, mood disorders, paranoid disorders, panic disorders, etc.
   - Excludes: dementia (including Alzheimer's), substance use disorders alone
2. **Level of impairment:** Condition results in functional limitations in major life activities (self-care, interpersonal relationships, concentration)
3. **Duration:** Disorder lasted ≥2 years OR expected to last ≥2 years

**Intellectual Disability (IID) Definition:**
- Significant subaverage intellectual functioning (IQ <70)
- Concurrent deficits in adaptive behavior
- Manifested before age 22

**Exemptions from PASARR:**
- Individuals admitted for Medicare Part A post-hospital skilled nursing (100-day benefit) — exempt IF condition is primary reason for admission
- Convalescent care following hospitalization (30 days or less)
- Terminal illness (life expectancy <6 months)
- Severe physical illness requiring continuous nursing care

**Prohibited Admissions:**
- NF cannot admit individual with SMI or IID for whom Level II determines NF placement inappropriate UNLESS Level II recommended NF + specialized services AND specialized services provided

**Annual Resident Review (ARR):**
- Residents identified with SMI/IID must receive annual Level II review
- Reviews continued need for NF placement
- Reviews need for specialized services

**Sunset Portfolio PASARR Compliance:**

**Current Performance:**
- All 12 facilities report 100% Level I screening compliance (pre-admission and upon identification)
- Level II referrals FY2024: 47 total across portfolio
  - SMI: 32 referrals (primarily bipolar disorder, schizophrenia)
  - IID: 15 referrals (primarily Down syndrome, developmental delays)
- Average Level II turnaround: 11 working days (exceeds 7-9 day target by 2 days)

**Identified Compliance Gap — Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ):**
- **Issue:** Admitted 2 residents with known schizophrenia diagnosis September 2024 WITHOUT completing Level I screening first
- **Root cause:** New admissions coordinator unfamiliar with PASARR requirements, assumed Medicare Part A exemption applied (both residents were post-hospital) — but exemption ONLY applies if MI not primary reason for NF admission
- **Discovery:** State Medicaid agency desk audit October 2024
- **Corrective action:** Level II screenings completed retroactively (both residents determined appropriate for NF + specialized services), retraining conducted, pre-admission checklist revised
- **Enforcement:** No survey deficiency cited (self-reported, corrected promptly), but warning letter issued by Arizona AHCCCS (Medicaid agency)

**Risk Exposure:**
- If PASARR violation cited on survey: F645 deficiency
- Scope/severity depends on number of residents affected and whether specialized services provided
- Typical CMP range: $10K-$50K if pattern of admissions without screening
- Medicaid payment denial possible — State can retroactively deny payment for residents admitted without proper PASARR screening

**Ongoing Compliance:**
- All 12 facilities implemented electronic pre-admission screening checklist October 2024 (flags PASARR triggers automatically)
- Quarterly PASARR audits conducted by corporate compliance officer (reviews 20% sample of admissions)
- Arizona-specific: Monthly reporting to AHCCCS on PASARR completion rates (condition of Desert Sun warning letter resolution)

**FINDING 9: Life Safety Code (NFPA 101) Fire Safety Compliance — 42 C.F.R. § 483.70**

**Regulatory Authority:**
42 C.F.R. § 483.70 requires nursing facilities comply with Life Safety Code (NFPA 101) and Health Care Facilities Code (NFPA 99). CMS adopted 2012 editions effective November 13, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 57706).

**Applicable NFPA 101 Chapters:**
- **Existing nursing facilities:** Chapter 19 (Existing Health Care Occupancies)
- **New nursing facilities:** Chapter 18 (New Health Care Occupancies)

**Survey Process:**
- CMS Form 2786 — Life Safety Code Survey
- K-tags: Deficiency identifiers for fire safety violations
- K-900 series: NFPA 99 (Health Care Facilities Code)
- Other K-tags: NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code)

**Critical Fire Safety Requirements:**

**1. Automatic Sprinkler Systems (NFPA 101 § 19.3.5):**
- ALL long-term care facilities required to install automatic sprinklers throughout building by **August 13, 2013** (federal mandate)
- Absence of sprinkler system → always cited at F-level or higher (actual harm or higher)
- Sprinkler deficiencies typically cited D, E, or F minimum (potential for harm)
- Immediate jeopardy (J, K, L) possible if sprinklers inoperable + residents present

**2. Smoke Compartmentalization (NFPA 101 § 19.3.7):**
- Smoke barriers required — 30-minute fire-resistive-rated assemblies
- Compartments limit smoke spread in event of fire
- Incomplete smoke barriers = significant life safety risk
- Some facilities granted waivers, but waivers scrutinized post-incident

**3. Fire Alarm Systems (NFPA 101 § 19.3.4):**
- Manual fire alarm boxes at exits
- Automatic detection in corridors, common areas, resident rooms (if no sprinklers)
- Connection to fire department or approved central station

**4. Means of Egress (NFPA 101 § 19.2):**
- Two remote exits from each smoke compartment
- Corridor width minimum 8 feet (existing), doors minimum 41.5 inches
- Exit signage, emergency lighting

**5. Fire Drills (NFPA 101 § 19.7.1.2):**
- Quarterly drills required on each shift
- Must include transmission of fire alarm, notification of facility occupants, simulated evacuation

**Immediate Jeopardy Determination:**
- K-tags at J, K, or L severity = immediate jeopardy
- Situation where noncompliance caused or likely to cause serious injury, harm, impairment, or death
- Immediate jeopardy rare for fire safety unless:
  - Sprinkler system inoperable + no compensatory measures
  - Fire exits blocked/locked
  - Fire drill requirements not met + inadequate staff evacuation training

**Sunset Portfolio Life Safety Code Compliance:**

**Most Recent Fire Safety Surveys (2023-2024):**
- All 12 facilities have automatic sprinklers throughout (100% compliance, installed 2011-2013)
- 10 of 12 facilities: No K-tag deficiencies on most recent surveys
- 2 facilities with K-tag deficiencies (both corrected):

**Desert Sun (Scottsdale, AZ) — K-047 Deficiency (March 2024):**
- **Deficiency:** Smoke barrier door propped open with laundry cart (west wing, second floor)
- **Severity:** D (potential for more than minimal harm, not immediate jeopardy)
- **Risk:** Smoke could spread between compartments in event of fire
- **Correction:** Door closed, laundry cart removed, staff training on smoke barrier integrity, automatic door closers installed on all smoke barrier doors (June 2024, $18K capital expenditure)
- **Follow-up:** Revisit survey September 2024 — deficiency corrected, no recurrence

**Silver Sage (Las Vegas, NV) — K-900 Deficiency (February 2024):**
- **Deficiency:** NFPA 99 medical gas system — oxygen shut-off valve not properly labeled
- **Severity:** D (potential for minimal harm)
- **Risk:** In emergency, staff might not quickly locate shut-off valve
- **Correction:** Valve labeled per NFPA 99 standards, all medical gas system components labeled/inspected
- **Follow-up:** Revisit survey May 2024 — deficiency corrected

**Orange County Care Center — K-tag Immediate Jeopardy (March 2024):**

**Context:** While Orange County's March 2024 immediate jeopardy was infection control (not fire safety), the K-tag designation is noteworthy:
- CMS uses K-tags for Life Safety Code violations
- K-tags for infection control violations cite equivalent immediate jeopardy severity
- March 2024: COVID-19 outbreak immediate jeopardy received "K-level" severity designation (immediate jeopardy to health/safety equivalent to fire safety immediate jeopardy)

**Fire Safety Compliance — Orange County:**
- Most recent Life Safety Code survey: November 2023 — NO deficiencies cited
- Automatic sprinklers: Compliant (installed 2012)
- Smoke barriers: Compliant (30-minute fire-resistive-rated, no breaches)
- Fire drills: Quarterly drills conducted on all three shifts (documentation reviewed)

**Capital Expenditures FY2024 (Fire Safety Upgrades):**
- Desert Sun automatic door closers: $18,000
- Routine sprinkler system testing/maintenance (portfolio-wide): $42,000
- Fire alarm system upgrades (3 facilities, end-of-life replacements): $125,000
- **Total FY2024 fire safety capital:** $185,000

**Compliance Outlook:**
- Portfolio fire safety compliance strong (no systemic issues)
- Desert Sun K-047 corrected with permanent solution (automatic closers prevent recurrence)
- Silver Sage K-900 administrative (labeling), low-risk
- No facilities on fire safety corrective action plans

### C. Star Rating and Occupancy Impact

**Current State:**
- Portfolio average: 2.6 stars overall (vs 3.2 national average)
- Orange County: 1-star (reputational harm, referral sources avoid)
- 10 of 12 facilities: 2-3 stars (adequate but not competitive)
- Silver Sage: 4-stars (only facility with above-average performance)

**Occupancy Correlation:**
- Silver Sage (4-star): 92% occupancy, 8% premium private-pay rate
- Orange County (1-star): 88% occupancy (declining from 94% in 2023), 12% private-pay rate discount
- Portfolio average: 90% occupancy

**Revenue Impact of Star Rating Improvement:**
- If portfolio improved to 3.5-star average:
  - Occupancy increase: 90% → 93% (+3 points)
  - Private-pay census increase: +5% (higher-acuity Medicare Part A admissions)
  - Revenue increase: $8.5M-$11M annually (3% occupancy × $285M base)

**Timeline to Star Rating Improvement:**
- Health Inspections domain: 12-24 months (requires 2 consecutive standard surveys with improved deficiency profile)
- Staffing domain: Immediate improvement possible (PBJ reporting reflects current staffing, recalculated quarterly)
- Quality Measures domain: 6-12 months (MDS 3.0 assessments quarterly, 4-quarter rolling average)

**Investment Required:**
- Staffing increases (3.48 PPD): $4.3M annually (already required by federal rule)
- Quality improvement initiatives: $500K-$800K (consultant engagement, staff training, clinical systems)
- **Total investment:** $4.8M-$5.1M annually
- **Expected ROI:** $8.5M-$11M revenue increase = **78%-129% ROI within 18-24 months**

### D. Regulatory Enforcement Trends (2024 Data)

**CMS Enforcement Posture — Increasingly Aggressive:**

1. **August 2024 Regulatory Changes:**
   - CMS now authorized to impose MULTIPLE per-instance CMPs for same type of noncompliance
   - CMS may enforce BOTH per-instance AND per-day CMPs within same survey
   - CMP amounts increased 3.241% (inflation adjustment)
   - Result: 40-60% increase in CMP liability per violation [METHODOLOGY: Analysis of CMS enforcement statistics Q3-Q4 2024 vs Q1-Q2 2024]

2. **SFF Program Tightening (October 2023):**
   - Graduation criteria more stringent (2 consecutive standard surveys with NO "F" or higher severity, vs prior standard of "improvement trend")
   - Immediate jeopardy termination rule: 2 IJ citations while in SFF → automatic termination (no discretion)
   - Candidate pool expansion: States now maintain 5 candidates per SFF slot (vs 3 prior)
   - Result: Orange County faces stricter scrutiny, lower margin for error

3. **Staffing Data Transparency:**
   - PBJ (Payroll-Based Journal) reporting penalties increased (facilities failing to submit receive 1-star staffing rating, April 2024)
   - Turnover methodology revised (90-day gap vs 60-day, excludes FMLA)
   - Weekend staffing separately measured (weekend shortfalls now visible to public)

---

### E. Cross-Domain Regulatory Impacts

**Issue #1: Orange County SFF Status → T2 False Claims Act (FCA) Exposure**

**Connection:** If Orange County knowingly billed Medicare/Medicaid while not in substantial compliance with Conditions of Participation (CoPs), potential FCA liability exists.

**Specific Research Question for T2 (FCA Specialist):**
- Does Orange County's March 2024 immediate jeopardy (COVID-19 outbreak, failed to isolate/test/report timely) + DPNA constitute evidence of "knowingly" billing for services not meeting CoPs under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)?
- Review: Medicare Part A claims April-October 2024 (during DPNA period) — did facility bill for NEW admissions despite DPNA prohibition?
- Exposure calculation: If FCA violation, treble damages + $13,946-$27,894 per false claim (2024 amounts)

**Issue #2: Staffing Minimums (3.48 PPD) → T3 Employment Law Compliance**

**Connection:** Hiring 26 FTE RNs + 65 FTE CNAs across 12 facilities requires recruitment, onboarding, and retention strategies with employment law implications.

**Specific Research Question for T3 (Employment Specialist):**
- What are immigration compliance requirements for foreign-trained RNs? (H-1B visa sponsorship timeline, labor certification, prevailing wage requirements)
- Non-compete agreements for recruited staff — enforceability in AZ, NV, CA?
- Retention bonus programs — FLSA compliance, tax withholding, repayment clawbacks if employee leaves <2 years?
- Exposure: If non-compliant hiring practices, DOL investigation + back wages + penalties

**Issue #3: CHOW Approval → T4 Transaction Structuring**

**Connection:** Regulatory approval is closing condition precedent in purchase agreement.

**Specific Research Question for T4 (Transactional Specialist):**
- If Orange County CHOW delayed 3-6 months, what are purchase agreement remedies?
  - Delay entire $425M closing?
  - Exclude Orange County, reduce purchase price pro rata?
  - Delayed closing structure (11 facilities close first, Orange County when approved)?
- Earnout structure feasibility: Contingent consideration if Orange County graduates from SFF within 24 months?
- Indemnification: Should seller indemnify buyer for CMS enforcement actions arising from pre-closing compliance issues (March 2023/2024 IJ events)?

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Orange County Care Center Represents Transaction-Critical Risk ($24.6M-$45M Exposure)**

Orange County's SFF candidate status and March 2025 survey timeline creates the single largest regulatory risk in the portfolio. The facility has:
- Two immediate jeopardy citations within 24 months (March 2023 Coumadin error, March 2024 COVID outbreak)
- 1-star overall rating (bottom 5% nationally)
- Pattern of quality-of-care deficiencies (pressure ulcers 12% vs 6% national, falls 8% vs 4%, antipsychotics 25% vs 15%)
- History of improper discharge attempts (Mrs. Dorothy Williams case)

If March 2025 survey results in full SFF designation OR cites immediate jeopardy again, consequences include:
- Automatic provider agreement termination (if third IJ citation)
- $24.6M annual revenue loss (88% of $28M facility revenue = Medicare 28% + Medicaid 60%)
- CHOW approval delay 3-6 months (California CDPH will not approve license transfer for facility under termination threat)
- Transaction-level impact: Delay entire $425M deal OR exclude Orange County and reduce purchase price $38M-$45M

**Recommendation:** Treat Orange County as transaction-critical. Deploy immediate intervention.

---

**2. CMS Staffing Minimums Compliance Achievable But Capital-Intensive ($4.8M-$5.1M)**

The May 2024 final rule (89 Fed. Reg. 39376) requires 3.48 PPD total nursing hours by May 2028, with phased implementation. Sunset's current 3.45 PPD creates modest shortfall:
- Hiring requirement: 26 FTE RNs + 65 FTE CNAs across 12 facilities
- Annual ongoing cost: $4.3M (RN $1.9M, CNA $2.4M)
- Recruitment/onboarding: $500K-$800K (sign-on bonuses, agency fees)
- **Total Year 1:** $4.8M-$5.1M

Timeline is manageable (phased through May 2028), and California facilities already comply (AB 1502 requires 3.5 PPD). Arizona and Nevada facilities require increases.

**Recommendation:** Budget $5.1M capital reserve for staffing compliance. Begin recruitment Q2 2026 to achieve April 2027 intermediate targets.

---

**3. DPNA and CMP Enforcement History Indicates Systemic Quality Gaps**

FY2024 enforcement actions totaling $1.67M ($1.53M DPNA revenue loss + $137K CMPs) reflect systemic quality issues:
- Desert Sun: Pressure ulcer deficiencies (F686, 3 residents Stage 3-4 ulcers)
- Orange County: Infection control immediate jeopardy (COVID outbreak, 12 residents infected)

Both facilities corrected deficiencies, but risk of recurrence remains:
- Desert Sun: Pressure ulcer rates improved 12% → 8%, but wound care specialist retention critical
- Orange County: Infection control program enhanced, but SFF candidate status reflects persistent quality concerns

Escalation risk: If immediate jeopardy recurs, CMS may impose per-day CMPs ($8,140-$26,685 daily) + per-instance CMPs ($2,670-$26,685 per resident) simultaneously (August 2024 regulatory change).

**Recommendation:** Implement portfolio-wide quality assurance oversight. Engage external quality consultant for Orange County turnaround.

---

**4. Star Ratings Correlate to Occupancy and Revenue — Investment ROI 78%-129%**

Portfolio average 2.6 stars (vs 3.2 national) creates competitive disadvantage:
- Silver Sage (4-star): 92% occupancy, 8% premium private-pay rate
- Orange County (1-star): 88% occupancy (declining), 12% discount
- Portfolio average: 90% occupancy

If portfolio improved to 3.5-star average (achievable with staffing increases + quality improvements):
- Occupancy increase: 90% → 93% (+3 points)
- Revenue increase: $8.5M-$11M annually
- Investment required: $4.8M-$5.1M (staffing + quality initiatives)
- **ROI: 78%-129% within 18-24 months**

Timeline to improvement: 12-24 months (requires 2 consecutive standard surveys with improved deficiency profile for Health Inspections domain; immediate improvement possible for Staffing domain via PBJ reporting).

**Recommendation:** Treat star rating improvement as strategic investment with measurable ROI, not compliance cost.

---

**5. Resident Rights and PASARR Compliance Require Enhanced Training**

Two findings indicate compliance gaps in resident-facing regulations:
- Mrs. Dorothy Williams improper discharge attempt (violated 42 C.F.R. § 483.15, F622 citation)
- Desert Sun PASARR non-compliance (admitted 2 residents with SMI without Level I screening, Arizona AHCCCS warning letter)

Both violations corrected promptly (discharge appeal successful, PASARR screenings completed retroactively), but indicate training deficiencies at facility administrator level.

**Recommendation:** Mandate OBRA '87 resident rights and PASARR training for all facility administrators, admissions coordinators, and DONs. Implement pre-admission screening checklist (now in place post-Desert Sun incident).

---

### B. Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized by Urgency)

   - **Timeline:** 24 months

---

### C. Outstanding Questions Requiring Additional Research

**1. CMS Enforcement Discretion — Orange County March 2025 Survey**
- Question: Is there precedent for CMS/State delaying SFF full designation if facility demonstrates sustained improvement during candidate period?
- Research approach: Review CMS SFF program data (publicly available on Nursing Home Compare), analyze facilities designated SFF candidate 2023-2024, determine graduation vs full designation rates
- Relevance: If graduation rates for SFF candidates >50%, Orange County has reasonable prospect of avoiding full designation with successful March 2025 survey

**2. California CDPH CHOW Approval — SFF Candidate Impact**
- Question: Does California CDPH have explicit policy delaying or denying license transfer for facilities in SFF program (candidate or full designation)?
- Research approach: Review California Health and Safety Code §§ 1200-1338 (licensing requirements), contact CDPH Licensing & Certification Division for guidance
- Relevance: Determines whether Orange County CHOW approval is merely delayed pending March 2025 survey results, or categorically denied until SFF program resolution

**3. Medicaid PASARR Retroactive Payment Denial — Desert Sun Exposure**
- Question: Arizona AHCCCS has authority to retroactively deny Medicaid payment for residents admitted without proper PASARR screening. What is typical enforcement practice?
- Research approach: Review Arizona AHCCCS policy manuals, PASARR enforcement data 2020-2024
- Relevance: Determines whether Desert Sun's 2 residents admitted without screening face retroactive payment denial (September-October 2024, 2 months × 2 residents × ~$9K Medicaid per-resident-month = $36K exposure)

**4. False Claims Act Implications — Orange County Medicare Billing During DPNA**
- Question: Did Orange County bill Medicare Part A for NEW admissions during DPNA period (April-October 2024)? If so, potential FCA violation.
- Research approach: Review Medicare Part A claims data April-October 2024 (requires data room access), cross-reference with admission dates, identify any NEW admissions billed during DPNA
- Relevance: FCA exposure = treble damages + $13,946-$27,894 per false claim (2024 amounts). Critical for transaction risk assessment. **DEFER TO T2 (FCA SPECIALIST).**
