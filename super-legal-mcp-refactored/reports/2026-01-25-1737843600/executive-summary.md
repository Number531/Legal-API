**Prepared for**: Silver Oak Healthcare LLC Investment Committee
**Date**: January 25, 2026

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Silver Oak should **proceed with the $425M acquisition of Sunset Senior Living Group** subject to five critical conditions: (1) Orange County facility mock survey with satisfactory results 60 days pre-closing, (2) $28M escrow holdback with 24-month tiered release, (3) $15M purchase price reduction to net $410M, (4) IRC Section 338(h)(10) election confirmed with December 15, 2025 filing deadline, and (5) seller-paid tail coverage for D&O and professional liability. The correlation-adjusted total risk exposure of **$47.9M (11.3% of deal value)** is manageable with proper transaction structuring. The CMS staffing minimums repeal (December 2025) provides $4.3M annual cost avoidance, materially improving transaction economics.

**Overall Risk Rating**: MEDIUM-HIGH

### Rationale

The transaction presents compelling strategic value despite regulatory headwinds. Sunset's 12-facility portfolio (1,650 beds, $285M revenue, $52M EBITDA) offers Silver Oak a platform for regional consolidation in Arizona, Nevada, and California skilled nursing markets. The 18.2% EBITDA margin demonstrates operational efficiency, and the staffing minimum repeal eliminates what would have been a $4.3M annual compliance burden.

Three factors support the PROCEED recommendation: First, the Orange County SFF deal-blocking risk (35% termination probability, $24.6M revenue exposure) has an actionable mitigation strategy via pre-closing mock survey and interim management deployment ($250K-$375K cost, 60-70% success probability). Second, the Martinez FCA exposure ($13M expected settlement) is contractually mitigable through seller indemnification and escrow, with insurance partial coverage available. Third, the tax optimization via IRC Section 338(h)(10) delivers $5-$5.25M annual tax savings ($35M NPV over 7 years), justifying the hybrid stock purchase structure despite FCA complexity.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **Orange County Pre-Closing Intervention** - Deploy interim management team and conduct mock survey 60 days pre-closing; satisfactory results required before closing. See **Section IV.A** for details.

2. **FCA Escrow Minimum $10M** - 5-year survival period with tiered release upon settlement finalization and CIA Year 2 compliance report submission. See **Section IV.B** for details.

3. **Purchase Price Reduction $15M** - Reduce $425M to $410M net reflecting DPNA/CMPs incurred ($1.67M), uninsured FCA exposure ($6M), and staff retention investment ($7.33M). See **Section IV.E** for details.

4. **Section 338(h)(10) Election** - Joint election on Form 8023 filed by December 15, 2025; Silver Oak to form C-corporation acquisition subsidiary 60 days pre-closing. See **Section IV.F** for details.

5. **Tail Coverage Seller-Paid** - 6-year extended reporting period for D&O and professional liability policies; seller obligation at closing. See **Section IV.E** for details.

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question (Abbreviated) | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Under 42 C.F.R. Part 488, is Orange County at risk of Medicare termination? | **Probably Yes** | Two immediate jeopardy citations within 12 months, SFF candidate designation September 2024, and revised CMS QSO-23-01-NH policy mandates automatic termination upon third IJ citation | IV.A |
| 2 | Under the False Claims Act, is Sunset liable for Martinez qui tam allegations? | **Probably Yes** | Therapy upcoding ($19.6M single damages), PDPM gaming, and Dr. Johnson medical director kickback allegations create 55-65% DOJ intervention probability; expected settlement $8M-$15M | IV.B |
| 3 | Under IRC Section 338(h)(10), can buyer obtain stepped-up basis while maintaining seller tax neutrality? | **Yes** | Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(e) provides liquidation offset mechanism when outside basis exceeds inside basis, producing identical $10.71M seller tax as straight stock purchase | IV.F |
| 4 | Under California SB 525, are California facilities compliant with minimum wage requirements? | **Probably No** | 144 CNAs currently paid below $21/hour effective June 1, 2025; $1.2M annual compliance cost required | IV.C |
| 5 | Under Anti-Kickback Statute, does Dr. Johnson's compensation violate FMV standards? | **Probably Yes** | $180K compensation (90th percentile) with alleged 1 hour/month duties creates $15,000/hour effective rate, far exceeding $300-$800/hour physician consultant rates | IV.D |
| 6 | Under applicable insurance policies, is FCA settlement covered? | **Uncertain** | D&O fraud exclusion language determines coverage; 40-60% probability of partial coverage ($4.8M-$10.5M uninsured exposure) | IV.E |
| 7 | Under HIPAA/CPRA, does Sunset face material cybersecurity exposure? | **Probably No** | 8.2% annual ransomware probability creates $3.0M expected annual value; mitigable through $500K cybersecurity investment and $10M cyber insurance coverage | IV.G |

### Aggregate Scenario Analysis (P10/P50/P90)

| Scenario | Total Exposure | Key Assumptions | Board Guidance |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **P10 (Optimistic)** | $38.4M | Orange County passes March 2025 survey; DOJ declines FCA intervention; D&O covers 60% of settlement | Best-case for planning |
| **P50 (Base Case)** | $51.2M | Orange County SFF designation but not terminated; DOJ intervenes with $13M settlement; 50% D&O coverage gap | Primary planning basis |
| **P90 (Stress Test)** | $72.8M | Orange County termination ($24.6M); maximum FCA settlement $18M; full D&O exclusion; union organizing campaign | Maximum reserve planning |

**Sensitivity Summary:**
- **Largest Single Driver**: Orange County SFF termination - swing of $24.6M between P10 (no termination) and P90 (full termination)
- **Most Volatile**: DOJ intervention decision (Q1-Q2 2025) - creates $5M variance in settlement range
- **Correlated Risks**: Orange County termination and WARN Act penalties share same root cause; correlation adjustment reduces double-counting by $823K

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Orange County Regulatory Cascade

The Orange County SFF candidate designation (September 2024) creates interconnected risks across multiple domains requiring coordinated mitigation.

**Primary Finding**: Orange County faces 30-40% probability of provider agreement termination within 18-36 months, representing $24.6M annual revenue loss (88% of facility revenue). (See **Section IV.A, B.1**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Employment WARN Act (Section IV.C, B.3)**: Orange County termination triggers $3.75M-$4.5M WARN Act liability for 290 employees; 60-day notice impractical given 23-day CMS termination timeline for immediate jeopardy
- **Insurance Coverage (Section IV.E, B.2)**: EPLI excludes statutory penalties; DPNA/CMP uninsurable; $1.67M FY2024 losses absorbed from operating cash flow
- **Transaction Timeline (Section IV.A, B.4)**: California CDPH may delay license transfer 3-6 months if March 2025 survey reveals serious deficiencies

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $28.5M - $33.6M if termination occurs

### B. Martinez FCA Settlement Chain

The May 2023 qui tam creates settlement and compliance cost exposure with downstream tax and insurance implications.

**Primary Finding**: DOJ intervention probability 55-65% with expected settlement $8M-$15M; if DOJ intervenes, 75-85% probability of 5-year Corporate Integrity Agreement with $11M-$16M compliance costs. (See **Section IV.B, B.1-B.2**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Commercial Contracts (Section IV.D, B.1)**: Dr. Johnson medical director FMV violations ($180K, 90th percentile with minimal duties) strengthen kickback allegations, potentially adding $3M-$5M to settlement
- **Tax Structure (Section IV.F, B.3)**: Hybrid structure (stock + 338(h)(10) + indemnification) resolves conflict between asset purchase (FCA liability isolation) and stock purchase (tax optimization)
- **Insurance Coverage (Section IV.E, B.1)**: D&O fraud exclusion creates 40-60% uninsured exposure; immediate tender required to preserve coverage

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $19M - $31M total FCA-related exposure

### C. Staffing Cost Dynamics

Regulatory repeal and operational investment requirements create complex cost trade-offs.

**Primary Finding**: CMS staffing minimums repealed December 2025, saving $4.3M annually; however, 85% CNA turnover requires $11M annual retention investment. (See **Section IV.C, B.1-B.2**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **CMS Regulatory (Section IV.A, B.4)**: Staff retention investment (reducing turnover to 60%) improves quality measures, supporting Orange County SFF mitigation strategy
- **Tax Structure (Section IV.F, B.1)**: Retention costs reduce EBITDA ($52M to $44.5M net), affecting valuation; 338(h)(10) tax savings partially offset
- **Commercial Contracts (Section IV.D, B.4)**: Therapy contract transition to in-house model (if pursued) requires hiring 70-90 therapists, affecting staffing cost projections

**Net Theme Impact**: $6.7M annual net cost ($11M retention - $4.3M repeal savings)

### D. Transaction Structure Optimization

The hybrid structure balances FCA liability isolation with tax optimization.

**Primary Finding**: Stock purchase with IRC Section 338(h)(10) election delivers $5-$5.25M annual tax savings ($35M NPV) while seller indemnification + $20M escrow contractually isolates FCA exposure. (See **Section IV.F, B.3**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **FCA Litigation (Section IV.B, B.4)**: Escrow covers FCA settlement ($8M-$15M) + CIA Years 1-2 ($4M-$6M); seller indemnification $25M cap with 5-year survival
- **CMS Regulatory (Section IV.A, B.4)**: Stock purchase avoids license transfer delays (90-120 days for asset purchase), preserving March 2025 closing timeline
- **Sale-Leaseback (Section IV.F, B.2)**: Defer to Year 2-3 to capture 338(h)(10) stepped-up basis depreciation before monetizing real estate; immediate execution destroys $63M-$90M enterprise value

**Net Theme Impact**: +$35M NPV tax benefit; -$63M-$90M if sale-leaseback executed immediately (defer recommended)

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section Reference |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Purchase Price Reduction | $20M | $15M | $10M | IV.E, IV.F |
| FCA Escrow | $12M | $10M | $8M | IV.B |
| Orange County Escrow | $15M | $12M | $8M | IV.A |
| Indemnification Cap | $30M | $25M | $20M | IV.B, IV.F |
| Indemnification Survival | 7 years | 5 years | 4 years | IV.B |
| 338(h)(10) Election | Required | Required | Negotiate $10M reduction if unavailable | IV.F |
| Tail Coverage | Seller-paid 6-year | Seller-paid 6-year | 50/50 cost split | IV.E |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **Tax Neutrality Documentation**: Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(e) Example 1 demonstrates seller tax neutrality, removing Golden Gate's objection to stock structure
2. **Market Precedent**: PE healthcare transactions (Fresenius-Akorn, Select Medical-Concentra) support proposed escrow/indemnification structure
3. **Deal Economics**: Without 338(h)(10), asset purchase creates $98M seller tax penalty requiring purchase price adjustment to $523M (economically prohibitive)

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| # | Expected Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence Basis |
|---|--------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | "Escrow of $28M is excessive; market standard is 10-15%" | HIGH | Escrow covers specific quantified exposure ($47.9M weighted); 6.6% of deal value is reasonable for known regulatory matters | Risk-summary.json calculations |
| 2 | "338(h)(10) creates adverse tax consequences" | MEDIUM | Offer joint Big Four engagement to verify seller neutrality; outside basis $380M > inside basis $115M produces liquidation offset | Treas. Reg. Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(e) |
| 3 | "Stock purchase with FCA liability is unacceptable" | MEDIUM | Indemnification + escrow provides equivalent protection without $98M seller tax penalty | Coverage-gaps.md Section 7 |
| 4 | "Orange County risk is overstated" | LOW | Two immediate jeopardy citations within 12 months; CMS QSO-23-01-NH mandates termination on third citation | Section IV.A analysis |

| FCA Settlement Expected | Q2-Q3 2026 | DOJ intervention decision Q1-Q2 2026 | HIGH | IV.B |

### Critical Path Risks

- **Orange County March 2026 Survey**: Third immediate jeopardy citation triggers automatic termination within 23 days; no cure period available
- **Form 8023 Deadline**: Failure to file by December 15, 2026 permanently forfeits $35M NPV tax benefit
- **DOJ Intervention Decision**: Expected Q1-Q2 2026; intervention increases settlement from $8M-$12M to $12M-$18M and CIA probability from 0% to 75-85%

- Deploy Orange County intervention strategy ($250K-$375K)
- Target closing March 31, 2026
- Risk: $47.9M correlation-adjusted exposure (11.3% of deal value)
- Benefit: Platform acquisition, $35M tax NPV, $4.3M annual cost avoidance
- Status: RECOMMENDED

Option B: PROCEED WITH ENHANCED PROTECTIONS
- Increase escrow to $35M (from $28M)
- Increase purchase price reduction to $20M (from $15M)
- Add MAC clause for Orange County termination
- Risk: Seller may reject; extends negotiation timeline
- Benefit: Additional downside protection
- Status: ALTERNATIVE IF SELLER ACCEPTS

Option C: DO NOT PROCEED
- Risk: Forego platform acquisition opportunity
- Benefit: Avoid Orange County CRITICAL exposure and FCA settlement risk
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (risks manageable with proper structuring)

RECOMMENDED: Option A (PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS)

Rationale: The $47.9M correlation-adjusted exposure (11.3% of deal value) is manageable
through $28M escrow + $15M purchase price reduction + seller indemnification.
Tax optimization ($35M NPV) and regulatory cost avoidance ($4.3M annual) create
value exceeding quantified risks. Orange County mitigation strategy provides
60-70% probability of successful SFF resolution.
