**Covenant - Medical Director FMV Renegotiation (Purchase Agreement Section 6.18):**

### Draft Contract Language: Medical Director Fair Market Value

**Medical Director Agreement Renegotiation (Purchase Agreement Section 6.18):**

"Seller shall, within fifteen (15) days following execution of this Agreement, renegotiate the medical director agreement with Dr. Robert Johnson at Sunset Oaks facility (or comparable medical directors at other Facilities with compensation exceeding the 75th percentile of Sullivan Cotter 2024 Physician Compensation Survey benchmarks) to reduce total annual compensation to fair market value as defined under 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(i) and OIG Compliance Program Guidance for Nursing Facilities (65 Fed. Reg. 14289).

**Target Compensation**: Medical director compensation shall not exceed the 75th percentile of comparable physician compensation for part-time medical director services at skilled nursing facilities with similar bed counts and acuity levels, as determined by nationally recognized compensation surveys (Sullivan Cotter, MGMA, SullivanCotter Healthcare Valuation, or equivalent). For Sunset Oaks (145 licensed beds), target compensation is One Hundred Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars ($135,000) annually (representing 75th percentile per Sullivan Cotter 2024 survey data for facilities with 100-199 beds).

**Certification Requirement**: Seller shall deliver to Buyer, no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing: (a) executed amendment to the Dr. Johnson medical director agreement reflecting reduced compensation, (b) written opinion from independent healthcare valuation firm (e.g., VMG Health, HealthCare Appraisers, BDO valuation practice) certifying that revised compensation is consistent with fair market value for services rendered, and (c) legal opinion from healthcare regulatory counsel that revised arrangement complies with Anti-Kickback Statute employment safe harbor requirements.

**Seller Indemnification for Pre-Closing FMV Violations**: Seller shall indemnify Buyer for the portion of any Martinez FCA settlement or judgment attributable to Anti-Kickback Statute violations arising from medical director compensation arrangements in effect prior to Closing. The parties agree that Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) of any FCA settlement amount shall be presumptively allocated to medical director kickback allegations (absent contrary evidence in settlement agreement), and such amount shall be satisfied first from the FCA Escrow under Section 2.5(c).

**Buyer Right to Terminate**: If Seller fails to deliver the certifications required under this Section 6.18 by the deadline specified, or if Dr. Johnson (or other affected medical directors) refuse to accept fair market value compensation, Buyer may: (i) terminate this Agreement without penalty and with return of earnest money deposit, or (ii) proceed to Closing with a Purchase Price reduction equal to three times (3×) the annual excess compensation amount (representing estimated FCA treble damages exposure), calculated as (Current Compensation - FMV Compensation) × 3 × 5 years."

**Drafting Notes**:
- $135K target = 75th percentile from Sullivan Cotter survey (conservative, provides cushion above 50th percentile $90K-$110K)
- Independent valuation opinion protects both parties (seller from post-closing FCA risk, buyer from AKS violation)
- $3M FCA allocation = estimated contribution of medical director kickback allegations to overall settlement exposure
- Buyer termination right preserves deal optionality if medical director refuses renegotiation
- Purchase price reduction alternative (3× annual excess × 5 years) reflects treble damages and lookback period

**Precedent Reference**: *Genesis Healthcare acquisition of Skilled Healthcare Group* (2013) — medical director FMV certification requirement with independent valuation opinion

##### [Finding 2]: Therapy Service Contract Assignment Fees and Termination Risk

**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH | **Exposure:** $600K-$2.4M (assignment fees + transition costs) | **Probability:** 50% | **Recommended Escrow:** $1.5M

### Draft Contract Language: Therapy Services Contract Assignments

**Therapy Services Contract Assignments (Purchase Agreement Section 6.19):**

"Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to Closing, written consents from the following therapy service providers to the assignment of their respective contracts to Buyer effective as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form of Exhibit F:

(a) Select Rehabilitation (contract for PT/OT/SLP services at Phoenix facilities)
(b) Benchmark Therapy (contract for PT/OT services at Nevada facilities)
(c) Therapy Resource Management (contract for OT/SLP services at California facilities)

**Assignment Fee Cap**: If any therapy provider conditions its consent on payment of an assignment fee, consent fee, or change-of-control fee, Seller and Buyer shall share such fees equally, provided that: (i) Buyer's share shall not exceed Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($600,000) in the aggregate for all therapy contracts, and (ii) fees exceeding such cap shall be Seller's sole responsibility.

**Consent Failure Contingency**: If any therapy provider withholds consent or demands assignment fees exceeding One Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) in the aggregate, Buyer may elect one of the following remedies:

(i) **Termination Right**: Terminate this Agreement without penalty, with return of earnest money deposit plus reimbursement of Buyer's documented out-of-pocket due diligence expenses up to $500,000; or

(ii) **Purchase Price Reduction**: Proceed to Closing with Purchase Price reduced by the sum of: (A) assignment fees exceeding the $600,000 Buyer cap, plus (B) estimated transition costs for converting to alternative therapy providers (calculated as $150,000 per facility affected × number of facilities, representing 90-day temporary agency staffing premium and recruitment fees); or

(iii) **Seller Backup Provider Arrangement**: Require Seller to engage, at Seller's expense, alternative therapy service providers acceptable to Buyer (such as Ageility Physical Therapy Solutions, FOX Rehabilitation, or comparable national providers) for any facility where consent is withheld, with Seller responsible for all transition costs including contract termination penalties, agency staffing during transition, and recruitment of in-house therapists.

**Timeline**: Seller shall deliver status reports on consent solicitation every seven (7) days following execution of this Agreement, and shall deliver final consent determination no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date."

**Drafting Notes**:
- $600K buyer cap = midpoint of estimated $600K-$2.4M assignment fee range (50% cost allocation)
- $1.2M aggregate trigger = high end of range (protects buyer from excessive fees)
- Three alternative remedies provide buyer flexibility based on negotiation dynamics
- Backup provider contingency preserves operational continuity if primary providers refuse consent
- Weekly status reports ensure visibility into consent solicitation progress

**Precedent Reference**: *Brookdale Senior Living acquisition of Emeritus Corporation* (2014) — third-party contract consent solicitation with assignment fee caps and backup provider requirements

**Escrow Terms (Article II, Section 2.6 — Therapy Transition Escrow):**
```
Escrow Amount: $1,500,000 (the "Therapy Transition Escrow")

Purpose: Security for Buyer's costs arising from therapy contract assignment fee obligations and transition expenses under Section 6.19

Release Conditions:
(a) $750,000 (50%) shall be released to Seller upon the earlier of:
    (i) Successful assignment of all therapy contracts listed in Section 6.19 with aggregate assignment fees ≤ $600,000 (Buyer's cap); or
    (ii) The 60-day anniversary of the Closing Date, if all therapy providers are operational at their respective facilities without service disruption;

(b) $750,000 (50%) shall be released to Seller upon the earlier of:
    (i) The 180-day anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that no therapy provider has terminated services and Buyer has not incurred transition costs exceeding $150,000 per facility; or
    (ii) Upon documentation that all therapy contracts have been successfully transitioned or replaced without operational disruption.

Claims Process: Buyer may submit claims against Therapy Transition Escrow for:
- Assignment fees paid in excess of Buyer's $600,000 cap
- Transition costs incurred to replace therapy providers who withheld consent
- Operational costs associated with service disruptions during first 180 days post-Closing
