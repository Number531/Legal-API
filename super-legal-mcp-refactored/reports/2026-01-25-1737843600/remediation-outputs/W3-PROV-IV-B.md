## PROVISION 1: FCA INDEMNIFICATION

### Draft Contract Language: False Claims Act Indemnification

**Article VIII, Section 8.2 — FCA Special Indemnification:**

Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (collectively, "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses (as defined below) arising out of, resulting from, or related to:

**(a) Martinez Qui Tam Litigation:**

The qui tam action captioned *United States ex rel. Sarah Martinez v. Sunset Senior Living Group, LLC*, Case No. 2:23-cv-3847 (D. Ariz., filed May 15, 2023, unsealed December 10, 2024), including:

(i) Any settlement payments, judgments, awards, or damages (whether treble damages or otherwise);

(ii) Civil penalties assessed under 31 U.S.C. § 3729, whether per-claim penalties or per-instance penalties;

(iii) Defense costs, attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, investigative costs, and litigation expenses incurred in defending the Martinez action or related government investigations;

(iv) Government investigative costs recoverable under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(3);

(v) Relator's share of any recovery under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d); and

(vi) Interest on any judgment, settlement, or civil penalty from the date of assessment through payment.

**(b) Corporate Integrity Agreement:**

If the United States Department of Justice intervenes in the Martinez Litigation and settlement requires execution of a Corporate Integrity Agreement ("CIA") with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, all costs and expenses associated with CIA compliance during the first twenty-four (24) months following CIA execution ("CIA Years 1-2"), including:

(i) Independent Review Organization ("IRO") fees and expenses for claims review, physician arrangements review, and clinical quality audits;

(ii) Compliance training and monitoring systems implementation and maintenance;

(iii) Mandatory disclosure and overpayment reporting systems;

(iv) Senior executive certifications and associated legal review costs;

(v) Chief Compliance Officer dedicated staffing costs attributable to CIA compliance activities;

(vi) OIG reporting obligations, including quarterly and annual report preparation; and

(vii) Overpayments identified by IRO during Years 1-2 and required to be repaid under CIA terms.

For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall assume all CIA compliance costs for Years 3-5 (if applicable), as operational integration responsibility.

**(c) Related FCA Claims:**

Any other False Claims Act claims, investigations, enforcement actions, or qui tam complaints by federal or state authorities arising from or related to conduct, practices, events, or arrangements occurring prior to the Closing Date at any of the Facilities, including but not limited to:

(i) Therapy billing practices (RUG-IV therapy upcoding or PDPM case-mix manipulation);

(ii) Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM) classification practices, including MDS Section GG (functional status), Section C (cognitive patterns), Section I (active diagnoses), or Section M (skin conditions) scoring;

(iii) Medical director compensation arrangements or other physician referral relationships;

(iv) Medical necessity determinations for skilled nursing services, therapy services, or Part A Medicare admissions rendered prior to Closing; and

(v) Any practice or arrangement alleged in the Martinez complaint or disclosed to the Department of Justice during the Civil Investigative Demand process (August-September 2023).

**(d) Anti-Kickback Statute Violations:**

Claims under the Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b) related to pre-Closing arrangements with physicians, therapy providers, hospice agencies, hospital discharge planners, or other referral sources at any Facility, to the extent such violations constitute a predicate for False Claims Act liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(g) (claims tainted by kickback violations deemed per se false).

### Limitations on FCA Indemnification:

**(i) Cap:**

Seller's aggregate liability for all indemnification claims under this Section 8.2 (FCA Special Indemnification) shall not exceed Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (the "FCA Cap").

The FCA Cap is separate from and in addition to any General Indemnification Cap set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, provided that Seller's total liability under all indemnification provisions of this Agreement shall not exceed [General Cap Amount].

**(ii) Basket:**

Seller shall have no liability for any individual claim or series of related claims arising under this Section 8.2 unless the aggregate Losses from such claim(s) exceed Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "FCA Basket").

If Losses exceed the FCA Basket, Seller shall be liable for all Losses from the first dollar (i.e., the Basket operates as a deductible threshold, not a retention amount).

The FCA Basket shall not apply to Losses arising from the Martinez qui tam action specifically disclosed on Schedule 3.14, for which Seller shall have liability from the first dollar of Losses.

**(iii) Survival:**

This indemnification obligation shall survive for five (5) years following the Closing Date (the "FCA Survival Period").

The FCA Survival Period reflects: (A) the False Claims Act statute of limitations under 31 U.S.C. § 3731(b) (six years from violation or three years from government discovery, whichever is later, not to exceed ten years), and (B) the typical timeline for CIA execution and Years 1-2 compliance completion.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a claim under this Section 8.2 is asserted in writing by Buyer to Seller prior to expiration of the FCA Survival Period, Seller's indemnification obligation with respect to such claim shall continue until final resolution.

**(iv) Exclusions:**

Seller shall not be liable for Losses arising from:

(A) Buyer's or its Affiliates' intentional misconduct, fraud, willful breach of law, or gross negligence occurring after the Closing Date;

(B) Claims relating to services rendered, practices occurring, or arrangements entered into after the Closing Date (except for claims where Buyer continues a pre-Closing arrangement that Seller disclosed as potentially non-compliant);

(C) Buyer's material breach of any CIA obligations that Buyer expressly assumes under this Agreement or any CIA negotiated by Buyer post-Closing;

(D) Buyer's failure to cooperate with Seller in the defense of any third-party claim as required under Section 8.2(vi) (Procedural Requirements); or

(E) Any settlement entered into by Buyer without Seller's prior written consent where Seller was entitled to control the defense under Section 8.2(vi).

### Definitions:

**"Losses"** means any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, and expenses of whatever kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, investigative costs, and costs of defense), whether or not involving a third-party claim, and whether based on contract, tort, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable theory.

**"Facility" or "Facilities"** means the twelve (12) skilled nursing facilities owned or operated by Sunset Senior Living Group, LLC as listed on Schedule 1.1(a).

### Procedural Requirements:

**(v) Notice:**

Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice of any indemnifiable claim under this Section 8.2 within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of such claim (the "Claim Notice").

The Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail: (i) the nature of the claim, (ii) the factual basis for the claim, (iii) the alleged violations or conduct giving rise to the claim, (iv) the estimated amount of Losses (to the extent reasonably determinable), and (v) copies of any complaint, investigation notice, Civil Investigative Demand, or other documentation relating to the claim.

Failure to provide timely Claim Notice shall not relieve Seller of its indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent Seller is materially prejudiced by such delay.

**(vi) Defense:**

Seller shall have the right, at Seller's sole cost and expense, to control the defense of any third-party claim for which indemnification is sought under this Section 8.2, provided that:

(A) Seller acknowledges in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of Claim Notice its obligation to indemnify Buyer for such claim (or such shorter period as may be required to timely respond to any complaint or investigation);

(B) Seller retains counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer (with expertise in False Claims Act defense, such as Am Law 100 firm healthcare fraud practice groups);

(C) Seller conducts the defense diligently and in good faith, and consults regularly with Buyer regarding strategy and settlement negotiations;

(D) Seller does not settle, compromise, or admit liability with respect to any claim without Buyer's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) if such settlement would:
    (1) Impose non-monetary obligations on Buyer (including Corporate Integrity Agreement terms);
    (2) Admit liability on behalf of Buyer or adversely affect Buyer's reputation;
    (3) Result in exclusion from Medicare/Medicaid or suspension of any Facility's provider agreement;
    (4) Result in injunctive relief or ongoing monitoring beyond CIA Years 1-2; or
    (5) Involve a settlement amount exceeding $5,000,000 in the aggregate.

If Seller does not assume or diligently prosecute the defense as required herein, Buyer shall have the right to control the defense at Seller's cost and expense, and Seller shall remain liable for all Losses.

**(vii) Cooperation:**

Buyer shall cooperate fully with Seller in the defense of any third-party claim, including:

(A) Providing access to relevant documents, data, and electronic records in Buyer's possession or control;

(B) Making employees and former employees reasonably available for interviews, depositions, and testimony;

(C) Preserving documents and data relevant to the claim; and

(D) Refraining from admitting liability or settling any claim without Seller's consent if Seller is controlling the defense.

Seller shall reimburse Buyer's reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in providing such cooperation, excluding internal employee time and overhead.

### Drafting Notes:

**Indemnification Structure:**

- **$25M cap** = 175% of expected combined exposure:
  - Martinez settlement expected value: $13M (60% × $15M intervention scenario + 40% × $10M declination scenario)
  - CIA Years 1-2 expected value: $6.24M (48% probability × $13M PV)
  - Medical director AKS exposure: $2.6M (65% probability × $4M settlement contribution)
  - Combined: $21.84M × 1.15 cushion = $25M (rounded)

- **$250K basket** excludes de minimis FCA claims (e.g., isolated billing errors, minor overpayments) while preserving indemnification for material FCA exposure. Basket does NOT apply to Martinez qui tam (disclosed known claim).

- **5-year survival** period aligns with FCA statute of limitations (31 U.S.C. § 3731(b): 6 years from violation or 3 years from government discovery) and typical CIA duration. Provides reasonable tail coverage without indefinite exposure.

- **CIA limited to Years 1-2**: Seller indemnifies for setup and initial compliance costs (highest IRO intensity, highest overpayment identification risk). Buyer assumes Years 3-5 as operational integration responsibility, reflecting Buyer's control over compliance systems and ability to mitigate costs.

- **Buyer consent for settlements**: Protects against collusive Seller-DOJ settlement that disadvantages Buyer (e.g., onerous CIA terms, exclusion risk, admission of systemic fraud affecting Buyer's reputation). Consent standard is "not to be unreasonably withheld" for settlements <$5M; absolute consent required for >$5M or material non-monetary terms.

**Rationale:**

This indemnification structure is consistent with market precedent in healthcare M&A transactions involving disclosed FCA exposure. The $25M cap (5.9% of $425M purchase price) is within typical range for HIGH severity regulatory risks (5-10% of deal value). The 5-year survival period exceeds standard 18-36 month caps but is necessary given FCA's 6-year statute of limitations and CIA duration.

**Precedent Reference:**

*Community Health Systems acquisition of Health Management Associates* (2014) — $60M FCA indemnification cap with 6-year survival for pre-closing Medicare billing practices and physician alignment arrangements. Settlement included 5-year CIA; seller indemnified Years 1-3, buyer assumed Years 4-5.

## PROVISION 2: FCA ESCROW

### Draft Contract Language: FCA Escrow

**Article II, Section 2.5(c) — FCA Escrow:**

At Closing, Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) of the Purchase Price (the "FCA Escrow Amount") shall be deposited with [Escrow Agent Name] (the "Escrow Agent") into an interest-bearing escrow account (the "FCA Escrow") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit E.

The FCA Escrow Amount shall secure Seller's indemnification obligations under Article VIII, Section 8.2 (FCA Special Indemnification) and shall be released as follows:

### Release Conditions:

**(i) Partial Release Upon Settlement (50% Release):**

Fifty Percent (50%) of the FCA Escrow Amount ($5,000,000), plus all accrued interest attributable to such amount, shall be released to Seller within five (5) Business Days following the date on which all of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) Execution of a final, binding settlement agreement with the United States Department of Justice and/or the relator Sarah Martinez resolving all claims in the Martinez Litigation (Case No. 2:23-cv-3847), including all FCA claims, Anti-Kickback Statute claims, and any related government investigations disclosed to Buyer prior to Closing;

(b) Payment in full of all settlement amounts, civil penalties, relator's share, and government investigative costs required under such settlement agreement, either: (A) from the FCA Escrow pursuant to subsection (iii) below, or (B) from Seller funds outside the escrow;

(c) Dismissal with prejudice of all relator claims in the Martinez Litigation, with no right of appeal or right to pursue related claims;

(d) Delivery to Buyer of executed copies of: (A) the settlement agreement, (B) the stipulation of dismissal filed with the District Court, (C) evidence of payment of all settlement amounts, and (D) if applicable, any Corporate Integrity Agreement executed in connection with settlement; and

(e) No notice from the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General of intent to pursue permissive exclusion of any Facility from Medicare/Medicaid programs under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(7).

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Department of Justice declines to intervene in the Martinez Litigation and Buyer settles with relator Martinez alone, the conditions of this subsection (i) shall be deemed satisfied upon settlement with Martinez and dismissal with prejudice, without requiring DOJ participation.

**(ii) Final Release Upon CIA Compliance (Remaining 50% Release):**

The remaining Fifty Percent (50%) of the FCA Escrow Amount ($5,000,000), plus all accrued interest attributable to such amount, shall be released to Seller within five (5) Business Days following the earliest to occur of:

(a) **If No CIA Required:** If the settlement referenced in subsection (i) does not require execution of a Corporate Integrity Agreement, the second (2nd) anniversary of the settlement effective date; or

(b) **If CIA Required:** Delivery to Buyer of the Independent Review Organization's Year 2 Annual Report confirming Sunset Senior Living Group's substantial compliance with all Corporate Integrity Agreement obligations during the first twenty-four (24) months following CIA execution, with: (A) no material findings of noncompliance as defined in the CIA, (B) all overpayments identified in IRO reports repaid in full within required timeframes, and (C) no notice from OIG of potential breach or intent to pursue exclusion; or

(c) **Automatic Release:** The fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that: (A) the Martinez Litigation has been resolved and dismissed with prejudice, (B) no Corporate Integrity Agreement breach proceeding is pending, and (C) Seller has paid all indemnification amounts owed to Buyer under Section 8.2 (whether from the FCA Escrow or otherwise).

**(iii) Release to Buyer for Settlement Payment:**

If the total Martinez FCA settlement amount (including settlement payment to the United States, relator's share, civil penalties, government investigative costs, and defense costs incurred through settlement date) exceeds Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), the excess amount shall be paid from the FCA Escrow to Buyer as follows:

(a) Buyer shall deliver a Settlement Notice to the Escrow Agent and Seller at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the settlement payment deadline, setting forth: (i) the total settlement amount, (ii) the allocation among settlement payment, relator's share, penalties, and costs, (iii) the amount to be drawn from the FCA Escrow (not to exceed the lesser of the excess over $10M or the remaining FCA Escrow Amount), and (iv) supporting documentation (settlement agreement, payment schedule, invoice summary);

(b) The Escrow Agent shall release the specified amount to Buyer upon the earlier of: (i) joint written instruction from Buyer and Seller, or (ii) fifteen (15) Business Days after delivery of the Settlement Notice if Seller does not object in writing with specific basis for objection;

(c) Any remaining FCA Escrow balance after such release shall remain subject to the release conditions in subsections (i) and (ii) above.

**(iv) Release to Buyer for CIA Excess Costs:**

If Corporate Integrity Agreement compliance costs during Years 1-2 (as defined in Section 8.2(b)) exceed the amounts reserved in the FCA Escrow after deducting any settlement payment drawn pursuant to subsection (iii), Buyer may draw such excess amounts from the remaining FCA Escrow Amount as follows:

(a) Buyer shall deliver a CIA Cost Notice to the Escrow Agent and Seller on a quarterly basis (within thirty (30) days following each calendar quarter-end during CIA Years 1-2), setting forth: (i) itemized CIA compliance costs incurred during the quarter (IRO fees, compliance staffing, training, overpayments, OIG reporting), (ii) cumulative CIA costs to date, (iii) the amount to be drawn from the FCA Escrow for such quarter, and (iv) supporting documentation (IRO invoices, payroll records, overpayment repayment evidence);

(b) Seller shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of each CIA Cost Notice to object in writing to any cost items, specifying the basis for objection (e.g., cost not within Section 8.2(b) scope, cost duplicative of normal operations, cost inflated or unreasonable);

(c) If Seller objects, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) days. Any unresolved disputes shall be submitted to the Escrow Agent for resolution pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures in the Escrow Agreement;

(d) The Escrow Agent shall release undisputed amounts to Buyer within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of CIA Cost Notice, and shall release disputed amounts upon resolution per subsection (c).

**(v) Coordination with Indemnification:**

Amounts released to Buyer from the FCA Escrow pursuant to subsections (iii) or (iv) shall reduce dollar-for-dollar Seller's remaining indemnification obligations under Section 8.2 (FCA Special Indemnification).

For the avoidance of doubt: (A) Buyer's total recovery from the FCA Escrow and indemnification under Section 8.2 shall not exceed the FCA Cap of $25,000,000, and (B) Buyer may pursue indemnification claims under Section 8.2 for amounts exceeding the FCA Escrow Amount, up to the FCA Cap, without first exhausting the escrow.

**(vi) Early Termination:**

The FCA Escrow shall terminate and all remaining amounts shall be released to Seller on the earliest to occur of:

(a) The date on which all amounts have been released pursuant to subsections (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) above;

(b) The fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that: (i) the Martinez Litigation has been dismissed with prejudice, (ii) no Corporate Integrity Agreement is in effect or, if in effect, Buyer has confirmed in writing that no material CIA compliance issues exist, and (iii) no indemnification claims under Section 8.2 are pending;

(c) Written agreement of Buyer and Seller to earlier release.

### Escrow Administration:

**Escrow Agent:** [Insert Escrow Agent Name and Address] (national bank or trust company with escrow services experience, mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller).

**Interest:** The FCA Escrow Amount shall be invested in: (i) interest-bearing money market accounts, (ii) U.S. Treasury securities with maturity not exceeding 180 days, or (iii) other investment-grade instruments approved in writing by both Buyer and Seller. All interest and investment income shall be allocated pro rata to amounts released to Buyer or Seller.

**Taxes:** All taxes on interest income shall be reported and paid as required by the Escrow Agreement. Generally, interest attributable to amounts ultimately released to Seller shall be taxable to Seller; interest attributable to amounts released to Buyer shall reduce the amount of indemnification Losses (as a mitigation benefit).

**Disbursements:** The Escrow Agent shall disburse funds from the FCA Escrow only upon: (i) joint written instruction signed by authorized representatives of Buyer and Seller, or (ii) pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement (arbitration or court order).

**Fees:** All Escrow Agent fees and expenses shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. Estimated annual escrow administration fees are $15,000-$25,000 depending on escrow complexity and number of disbursement requests.

---

### Drafting Notes:

**Escrow Structure:**

- **$10M escrow amount** = 70% of expected Martinez settlement midpoint ($13M expected value: 60% × $15M intervention + 40% × $10M declination = $13M).

  Rationale: Seller retains $3M uncollateralized risk, incentivizing favorable settlement negotiation and cooperation with DOJ. Buyer has secured funds for base-case settlement outcome.

- **Tiered 50/50 release** aligns with risk resolution milestones:
  - **Tranche 1 (50%, $5M)**: Released upon settlement finalization and dismissal with prejudice. At this point, settlement amount is known and paid, eliminating primary exposure uncertainty.
  - **Tranche 2 (50%, $5M)**: Released upon CIA Year 2 compliance or 2-year anniversary if no CIA. Ensures seller has "skin in game" to support compliance during highest-risk CIA period.

- **Settlement shortfall protection**: If settlement exceeds $10M, buyer draws excess from escrow (up to full $10M). Example: $14M settlement → buyer draws $4M from escrow, $5M released to seller, $1M remains for CIA costs.

- **CIA excess cost protection**: If CIA compliance costs (IRO fees, overpayments, training) exceed reserved amounts, buyer draws quarterly from remaining escrow balance. Quarterly draw process balances buyer's need for cash flow with seller's right to verify cost reasonableness.

- **Coordination clause**: Prevents double recovery. If buyer draws $8M from escrow for settlement, buyer can still pursue $17M additional indemnification (up to $25M FCA Cap), but cannot recover same $8M twice.

- **5-year termination**: Aligns with Section 8.2 indemnification survival period (5 years from Closing). After 5 years, FCA statute of limitations for pre-Closing conduct will have substantially expired, and CIA (if any) will be in Years 4-5 (buyer's responsibility).

**Operational Mechanics:**

- **Settlement Notice (10 days pre-payment)**: Gives seller opportunity to verify settlement amount calculation and object if buyer inflating costs. 15-day automatic release (if no objection) ensures buyer can timely fund settlement without risking default or penalty interest.

- **CIA Cost Notice (quarterly)**: Quarterly reconciliation prevents end-of-Year-2 "surprise" draw request. Seller can monitor CIA cost trajectory and engage early if costs appear unreasonable. 30-day objection period balances seller's review needs with buyer's cash flow needs.

- **Dispute resolution**: Escrow Agreement should specify arbitration (JAMS, 1 arbitrator, healthcare/escrow expertise) for cost disputes. Faster and cheaper than litigation. Arbitration should be binding and final, with limited appeal rights.

**Tax Treatment:**

- Escrow interest income is taxable to the party ultimately entitled to the escrowed funds. Rev. Rul. 77-85 (1977) provides that interest on contested amounts is taxable to seller unless and until released to buyer as indemnification.

- If $5M released to buyer for settlement, the $5M is treated as purchase price adjustment (reduces seller's gain, increases buyer's basis in acquired assets). Interest on that $5M would be taxable to buyer as ordinary income in year of release.

**Precedent Reference:**

*Surgery Partners acquisition of National Surgical Healthcare* (2017) — $15M regulatory escrow with staged release upon resolution of OIG investigation (Tranche 1: 60% at settlement, Tranche 2: 40% at CIA Year 2 annual report). Similar tiered structure with quarterly CIA cost draws.

## INSERTION GUIDANCE

### Where to Insert in Section IV.B:

These provisions should be inserted in **Section IV.B, Subsection E.2 (Draft Contract Language)** immediately following the existing **Finding 1: Martinez FCA Settlement Exposure** representation and indemnification language (currently at lines 1840-1889).

**Recommended Insertion Point:** After line 1889 (end of current Section 8.3 FCA Special Indemnity), insert:

1. New heading: `##### FCA Indemnification - Enhanced Terms (Provision 1)`
2. Insert Provision 1 text (FCA Indemnification)
3. New heading: `##### FCA Escrow Structure (Provision 2)`
4. Insert Provision 2 text (FCA Escrow)

**Cross-Reference Updates Required:**

After insertion, update the following cross-references in Section IV.B:

- Line 1731: "Recommended Escrow: $10M" — Add reference: "(See Section IV.B.E.2, Provision 2 - FCA Escrow Structure)"
- Line 249 (Section I.D Transaction Structure Optimization): "Escrow covers FCA settlement ($8M-$15M) + CIA Years 1-2 ($4M-$6M)" — Update to reference "(See Section IV.B.E.2, Provisions 1-2)"
- Line 262 (Section V Negotiation Position Summary): "FCA Escrow: $12M | $10M | $8M" — Add footnote: "See Section IV.B.E.2, Provision 2 for detailed escrow terms including tiered release and CIA cost draws"

### Integration with Existing Content:

The existing Section IV.B.E.2 content (lines 1834-1889) provides high-level representation and indemnification language. These two provisions provide the **enhanced, transaction-ready contract language** with:

- Detailed scope definitions (Martinez litigation, CIA Years 1-2, related claims, AKS violations)
- Specific procedural mechanics (notice requirements, defense control, settlement consent)
- Escrow release conditions tied to objective milestones (settlement execution, dismissal with prejudice, CIA Year 2 report)
- Operational provisions for cost recovery (settlement shortfall draws, quarterly CIA cost notices)

The provisions are complementary and should replace or supplement the existing "Indemnification (Article VIII, Section 8.3)" and "Escrow Terms (Article II, Section 2.5)" outlined at lines 1867-1889.
