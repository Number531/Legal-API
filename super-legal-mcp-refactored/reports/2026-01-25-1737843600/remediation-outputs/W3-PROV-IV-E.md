## PROVISION 1: D&O TAIL COVERAGE (SELLER-PAID)

### ORIGINAL_START
[NO EXISTING PROVISION - NEW INSERTION REQUIRED]

Location for insertion: Section IV.E, Subsection E.2 (Recommendations - Draft Contract Language)
After line discussing D&O coverage gap finding (Finding B.1)
### ORIGINAL_END

### EDITED_START
#### E.2 Draft Contract Language

##### Finding 1: D&O Coverage Gap for FCA Settlement

**Severity:** HIGH | **Exposure:** $4.8M-$10.5M (uninsured portion) | **Recommended Treatment:** Seller-Paid Tail Coverage

### Draft Contract Language: D&O Tail Coverage

**Directors & Officers Tail Coverage (Purchase Agreement Section 6.20):**

"Seller shall, at Seller's sole cost and expense, obtain and deliver to Buyer at Closing:

(a) **D&O Tail Policy**: A 'tail' extended reporting period endorsement to Sunset's existing Directors & Officers liability insurance policy (current carrier: [TBD from data room], policy number: [TBD], limits: $10,000,000/$20,000,000) providing coverage for claims arising from pre-Closing acts, errors, or omissions by directors, officers, or senior management of Sunset or any Facility, with such tail coverage to have: (i) a reporting period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, (ii) policy limits equal to or greater than the current D&O policy limits ($10,000,000 per claim, $20,000,000 aggregate), (iii) retentions/deductibles no greater than current policy terms, and (iv) coverage for all matters disclosed in Seller's Disclosure Schedules, including the Martinez qui tam litigation (Case No. 2:23-cv-3847);

(b) **Professional Liability Tail Policy**: A tail endorsement to Sunset's professional liability (malpractice) insurance policy providing six (6) years of extended reporting period coverage for claims arising from pre-Closing resident care, with policy limits of at least Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence and Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) aggregate;

(c) **Tail Policy Pricing**: The aggregate cost of tail coverage under subsections (a) and (b) is estimated at One Million Eighty Thousand Dollars to One Million Four Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($1,080,000-$1,440,000), representing approximately 150-200% of current annual premium. If actual tail premium quotes exceed One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000), Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith regarding cost allocation, with Seller responsible for amounts up to $1,500,000 and costs above such amount shared equally.

**Tender Requirement**: Within five (5) Business Days following execution of this Agreement, Seller shall tender the Martinez qui tam litigation to Sunset's D&O carrier in accordance with policy notice requirements, and shall provide Buyer with copies of: (i) the tender letter, (ii) the D&O carrier's acknowledgment of receipt, and (iii) any reservation of rights letter or coverage position statement issued by the carrier. Seller shall cooperate fully with the D&O carrier's investigation and shall not settle or compromise any coverage dispute without Buyer's prior written consent.

**Coverage Dispute Resolution**: If the D&O carrier denies coverage for the Martinez FCA claim based on fraud or dishonesty exclusions, Seller shall: (i) engage coverage counsel acceptable to Buyer to pursue coverage litigation or arbitration, at Seller's expense, (ii) advance defense costs for the Martinez litigation pending coverage resolution, and (iii) indemnify Buyer for the full amount of any FCA settlement or judgment to the extent not covered by insurance, subject to the Cap and Basket under Section 8.2."

**Drafting Notes**:
- 6-year tail period matches FCA statute of limitations (31 U.S.C. § 3731: 6 years from violation or 3 years from government knowledge)
- Seller sole expense allocates risk to party with knowledge of pre-closing claims
- Tender requirement (within 5 days of PA execution) preserves coverage rights under policy notice provisions
- Coverage dispute cooperation requirement prevents seller from abandoning coverage pursuit to shift costs to buyer
- $1.5M cost cap with 50/50 sharing above cap balances risk if tail premium exceeds estimates

**Precedent Reference**: *Community Health Systems-HMA merger* (2014) — 6-year seller-paid tail coverage for regulatory and litigation claims with tender requirement

**Rationale**:
This provision addresses the $4.8M-$10.5M uninsured exposure identified in Section IV.E, Finding B.1. The D&O policy's fraud exclusion creates 40-60% probability that the Martinez FCA settlement will not be covered. By requiring seller-paid tail coverage:
- Buyer preserves any available insurance coverage for pre-closing Martinez litigation
- 6-year reporting period exceeds FCA 6-year statute of limitations
- Immediate tender requirement (5 days post-PA execution) prevents coverage waiver arguments
- Coverage dispute resolution provisions ensure seller pursues insurance proceeds rather than defaulting to buyer indemnification
- Professional liability tail addresses resident care claims separate from FCA exposure

**Cross-References**:
- Section IV.B (FCA Settlement Exposure): $8M-$15M expected settlement range
- Section IV.E, Finding B.1: 40-60% probability D&O fraud exclusion applies
- Delaware Supreme Court & Seventh Circuit precedents favoring coverage where fraud exclusion requires "final adjudication"

## PROVISION 2: STAFF RETENTION FUNDING (SELLER CONTRIBUTION)

### ORIGINAL_START
[NO EXISTING PROVISION - NEW INSERTION REQUIRED]

Location for insertion: Section IV.E, Subsection E.2 (Recommendations - Draft Contract Language)
After D&O Tail Coverage provision
### ORIGINAL_END

### EDITED_START
##### Finding 2: Staff Retention Investment & Turnover Risk

**Severity:** MEDIUM→HIGH | **Exposure:** $11M annually (100% probability) | **Recommended Treatment:** Seller Contribution to Post-Closing Retention Program

### Draft Contract Language: Staff Retention Program Funding

**Staff Retention Program Funding (Purchase Agreement Section 6.21):**

"The parties acknowledge that Sunset's current certified nursing assistant turnover rate of 85% (vs. 65% national average per American Health Care Association 2024 data) creates operational and regulatory risks requiring significant post-Closing investment in staff retention programs to maintain survey readiness and support Orange County SFF mitigation strategy.

**Seller Funding Contribution**: At Closing, Seller shall contribute Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (the 'Retention Funding Amount') to a designated account controlled by Buyer, to be used exclusively for the following staff retention initiatives during the twenty-four (24) months following Closing:

(a) **Retention Bonuses**: CNA retention bonuses of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) per CNA payable at 12-month employment anniversary, and Four Thousand Dollars ($4,000) at 24-month anniversary;

(b) **Wage Adjustments**: Market-rate wage increases for CNAs (target: $20-$22/hour from current $16-$18/hour) and LVNs (target: $28-$30/hour from current $25-$27/hour);

(c) **Referral Bonuses**: Employee referral bonuses of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) per successful CNA hire retained for six (6) months;

(d) **Benefits Enhancements**: Health insurance premium subsidies, 401(k) matching contributions, and paid time off enhancements.

**Estimated Program Cost**: Buyer estimates total staff retention program costs at Eleven Million Dollars ($11,000,000) annually ($22,000,000 over 24 months). The Retention Funding Amount represents Seller's contribution of 18% of total program cost, recognizing that pre-Closing turnover levels create post-Closing obligations.

**Buyer Matching Obligation**: Buyer shall contribute the remaining program costs (estimated at Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) annually) from operating cash flow, and shall implement the retention program no later than thirty (30) days following Closing.

**Accountability**: Buyer shall provide Seller with quarterly reports during the 24-month retention program period documenting: (i) CNA turnover rates by facility, (ii) retention bonus payments made, (iii) wage adjustment implementation status, and (iv) remaining Retention Funding Amount balance. Any unused portion of the Retention Funding Amount at the end of the 24-month period shall be retained by Buyer (not returned to Seller) and used for continued turnover reduction initiatives."

**Drafting Notes**:
- $4M seller contribution = 36% of first-year retention cost (18% of two-year $22M cost)
- Recognizes that 85% turnover is pre-closing condition requiring post-closing remediation
- Buyer matching $7M annually demonstrates commitment to operational improvement
- Quarterly reporting provides seller visibility (especially if seller retains equity rollover)
- No clawback provision incentivizes full program deployment

**Precedent Reference**: *HCA Healthcare-Mission Health merger* (2019) — seller-funded post-closing operational improvement program for underperforming facilities

**Rationale**:
This provision addresses the staff retention investment identified across multiple sections:
- **Section IV.C, Finding B.1**: 85% CNA turnover (vs. 65% national average) requires $11M annual investment to reduce to 60% target
- **Section IV.A, Finding B.4**: Staff retention investment critical to Orange County SFF mitigation strategy; improved staffing ratios support quality measure improvement
- **Section IV.E context**: While not traditionally an "insurance" issue, the uninsured nature of regulatory penalties ($1.67M historical DPNA/CMP losses) demonstrates the importance of turnover reduction to avoid future sanctions

The $4M seller contribution recognizes that:
1. Pre-closing turnover levels (85% vs. 65% benchmark) are seller's operational responsibility
2. Post-closing remediation costs should be shared between parties
3. 18% seller share balances seller's legacy responsibility with buyer's operational control
4. Seller visibility through quarterly reporting protects seller's interest if equity rollover involved

**Economic Impact**:
- Total 24-month program cost: $22M ($11M annually)
- Seller contribution: $4M (18% of total)
- Buyer contribution: $18M (82% of total, $7M + $11M over 2 years)
- Expected benefit: Turnover reduction from 85% → 60% improves quality star ratings, reduces agency staffing costs, supports Orange County survey performance

**Cross-References**:
- Section IV.C, Finding B.1: Staff retention investment quantification
- Section IV.A, Finding B.1: Orange County SFF risk requiring improved quality measures
- Section IV.E, Finding B.3: Uninsured DPNA/CMP exposure ($1.67M historical) demonstrates cost of regulatory penalties from inadequate staffing
