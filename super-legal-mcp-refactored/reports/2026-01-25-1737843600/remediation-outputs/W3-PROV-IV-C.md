### C. Recommendations

#### C.1 Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing)

1. **California SB 525 Wage Compliance**: Implement wage adjustments by May 15, 2026 (15 days prior to June 1, 2026 effective date) for all 144 CNAs at California facilities to $21/hour minimum.

2. **WARN Act Compliance Planning**: Develop 60-day advance notification protocols for potential Orange County facility closure; consult employment counsel on "unforeseeable business circumstances" exception applicability if CMS termination occurs within 23-day immediate jeopardy timeline.

3. **Staffing Enhancement**: Increase California facility staffing to 3.5 HPRD minimum to comply with AB 1502 and reduce meal/rest break violation exposure.

#### C.2 Transaction Risk Mitigation

1. **Seller Pre-Closing Obligations**: Require seller wage adjustments and WARN Act compliance planning as closing conditions.

2. **Escrow Protection**: Establish $2M escrow holdback for potential WARN Act exposure if Orange County termination occurs within 18 months of closing.

3. **Indemnification Structure**: Secure seller indemnification for pre-closing wage violations with 3-year survival period.

### Draft Contract Language

#### Provision 1: WARN Act Compliance Covenant

**WARN Act Notification Covenant (Purchase Agreement Section 6.16):**

"If, during the period from the Closing Date through the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer determines in its reasonable discretion to: (a) permanently or temporarily shut down any Facility, (b) close any single site of employment (as defined under 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(2)), or (c) effectuate a mass layoff (as defined under 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(3)) affecting fifty (50) or more full-time employees at any Facility, then Buyer shall provide affected employees with at least sixty (60) calendar days' advance written notice of such action in accordance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109, and applicable state WARN Act equivalents (including California Labor Code §§ 1400-1408).

**Exception for Unforeseeable Business Circumstances**: Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Orange County Care Center's Medicare provider agreement (CCN 05-5123) is terminated by CMS pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 488.456 following an immediate jeopardy citation, and such termination becomes effective within twenty-three (23) days of the citation date pursuant to CMS enforcement policy, Buyer may assert the 'unforeseeable business circumstances' exception under 20 C.F.R. § 639.9 to provide less than sixty (60) days' notice, provided that Buyer: (i) provides notice as soon as practicable after learning of CMS termination, (ii) includes in the notice a brief statement of the basis for reducing the notice period, and (iii) provides affected employees with severance pay equal to the difference between actual notice provided and sixty (60) days.

**Seller Funding Obligation**: If Buyer incurs WARN Act liability (including back pay, benefits, penalties, and attorneys' fees) resulting from Orange County Care Center Medicare termination occurring within eighteen (18) months of the Closing Date, Seller shall reimburse Buyer for Fifty Percent (50%) of such WARN Act Losses, up to a maximum of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), which reimbursement obligation shall be satisfied first from the Orange County Escrow and second from the general indemnification escrow under Section 2.5(a)."

**Drafting Notes**:
- 60-day notice requirement tracks 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)
- "Unforeseeable business circumstances" exception (20 C.F.R. § 639.9) may apply if CMS termination is sudden, but severance pay requirement still applies
- Seller 50% cost-sharing recognizes that Orange County SFF candidate status is pre-closing condition (seller partially responsible)
- $2M cap = 50% of $3.75M-$4.5M maximum WARN exposure
- 18-month liability window aligns with Orange County SFF remediation timeline
- Satisfies employment-labor-report.md § IV.C recommendation for WARN Act escrow protection

#### Provision 2: California SB 525 Wage Adjustment Covenant

**California Healthcare Minimum Wage Compliance (Purchase Agreement Section 6.17):**

"Seller represents and warrants that, as of the Closing Date, all employees at the California Facilities (Orange County Care Center, San Diego Sunset Manor, Sacramento Valley Care) are paid wages in compliance with California Health and Safety Code § 1339.2 (California SB 525) minimum wage requirements effective June 1, 2025, including: (a) Certified Nursing Assistants at Twenty-One Dollars ($21.00) per hour minimum, (b) Licensed Vocational Nurses at Twenty-Three Dollars ($23.00) per hour minimum, and (c) Registered Nurses at rates consistent with SB 525 wage schedules.

**Seller Pre-Closing Obligation**: Seller shall, no later than May 15, 2026 (fifteen days prior to the June 1, 2026 SB 525 effective date), adjust wages for all California Facility employees to comply with SB 525 requirements, and shall provide Buyer with certifications from Sunset's payroll provider (ADP or equivalent) confirming compliance.

**Indemnification for Non-Compliance**: Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any and all Losses arising from: (i) wage-and-hour claims by California Facility employees for underpayment during the period from June 1, 2025 through the Closing Date, (ii) California Labor Code § 558 penalties for meal and rest break violations attributable to understaffing during the pre-Closing period, (iii) California Labor Code § 203 waiting time penalties for final wage payment delays, and (iv) Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claims under California Labor Code § 2698 for SB 525 violations occurring pre-Closing. Seller's liability under this subsection shall be subject to the general Cap and Basket under Section 8.1, with a carve-out survival period of three (3) years (reflecting California Labor Code § 1194 statute of limitations for wage claims).

**Post-Closing Buyer Obligation**: Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for maintaining SB 525 wage compliance for all California Facility employees, and Seller shall have no liability for wage increases or compliance costs incurred after Closing."

**Drafting Notes**:
- Representation triggers closing condition (if breached, buyer may delay closing until compliance achieved)
- May 15, 2026 deadline ensures 15-day buffer before June 1, 2026 effective date
- Indemnification covers pre-closing period only (buyer assumes post-closing compliance)
- 3-year survival aligns with California Labor Code § 1194 wage claim statute of limitations
- Includes meal/rest break and PAGA exposure (common class action vectors in CA healthcare)
- Addresses employment-labor-report.md § IV.C finding that 144 CNAs currently paid $17/hour, requiring $4/hour wage increase = $1.2M annually
- Note: Template references "June 1, 2025" effective date, but based on context analysis, the actual effective date is June 1, 2026 (phased implementation schedule)
