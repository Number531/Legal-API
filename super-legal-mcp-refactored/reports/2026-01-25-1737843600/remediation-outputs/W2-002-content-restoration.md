### Location
- **File**: final-memorandum.md
- **Line Number**: 5525

### EDITED_END

### CHANGE_SUMMARY
Expanded "$2,000,000" to include both per-occurrence and aggregate limits: "Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) per occurrence and Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate" based on industry standard range documented at line 314: "estimated $2M-$5M limits." Replaced "[INSERT CARRIER NAME]" with "[Cyber liability carrier - to be confirmed in data room]" as specialist report does not identify specific cyber carriers (unlike D&O). Policy number remains TBD pending data room verification.

### SOURCE ATTRIBUTION
- **Source File**: specialist-reports/insurance-coverage-report.md
- **Source Lines**:
  - Line 314: "Cyber Liability: Claims-made policy, estimated $2M-$5M limits, $25K-$50K deductible."
  - Line 185: "policy limits ($2M-$5M?), breach notification first-party costs coverage, deductible"

## RESTORATION #5: HIPAA Regulatory Fines Sublimit (Line 5533)

### Location
- **File**: final-memorandum.md
- **Line Number**: 5533
- **Section**: IV.E - Insurance Coverage, Draft Contract Language, Cyber Liability Insurance Representation
- **Context**: HIPAA regulatory fines sublimit disclosure

### ORIGINAL_START
    (ii) If a HIPAA fines sublimit exists, the sublimit amount (Seller represents that the
    sublimit is $[INSERT ACTUAL AMOUNT: $500,000 - $1,000,000 typical, or $0 if excluded]);
### ORIGINAL_END

### EDITED_START
    (ii) If a HIPAA fines sublimit exists, the sublimit amount (Seller represents that the
    sublimit is $[TBD - typical range $500,000 - $1,000,000 if included, or $0 if excluded - to be confirmed in data room]);
### EDITED_END

### CHANGE_SUMMARY
Retained placeholder with expanded notation "[TBD - typical range $500,000 - $1,000,000 if included, or $0 if excluded - to be confirmed in data room]" because specialist report explicitly states at line 79 "Many cyber policies include regulatory fines sublimit ($500K-$1M typical)" but also notes at line 142 "If Sunset's cyber policy excludes HIPAA fines or sublimit inadequate" - indicating uncertainty whether Sunset's actual policy includes this sublimit. This is a binary variable (included vs. excluded) that cannot be inferred from industry standards and MUST be verified in data room. Preserving placeholder is appropriate per specialist guidance.

### SOURCE ATTRIBUTION
- **Source File**: specialist-reports/insurance-coverage-report.md
- **Source Lines**:
  - Line 79: "Many cyber policies include regulatory fines sublimit ($500K-$1M typical) for HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) civil monetary penalties"
  - Line 142: "If Sunset's cyber policy excludes HIPAA fines or sublimit inadequate, OCR penalties $100K-$1.5M following breach of 1,485+ resident records are uninsured."
  - Line 185: "HIPAA regulatory fines sublimit ($500K-$1M? or excluded?)"
  - Line 715: "HIPAA fines sublimit ($500K-$1M?)"
  - Line 778: "HIPAA OCR fines: Partially covered if cyber policy includes regulatory fines sublimit ($500K-$1M typical)"

### VERIFICATION
- [x] Placeholder retained with enhanced guidance (appropriate for binary unknown variable)
- [x] Typical range documented for data room reviewer reference
- [x] Source attribution explains uncertainty (policy-specific, not industry-wide standard)
- [x] Coherence with representation disclosure structure preserved

## NOTES FOR WAVE 6 INTEGRATION

1. **Policy Numbers**: Retained as "[TBD - to be confirmed in data room]" because specialist report explicitly states at line 215 "Actual policy terms unknown" and line 990 "Actual policy terms unavailable" - these cannot be inferred from industry standards.

2. **Carrier Names**:
   - D&O: Provided specific options (Beazley/AIG/Chubb) based on line 308 specialist guidance
   - Professional Liability & Cyber: Generic placeholders because specialist report does not name specific carriers for these policy types

3. **HIPAA Fines Sublimit**: Enhanced placeholder retained because this is a policy-specific binary variable (included vs. excluded) that varies by carrier and cannot be inferred from industry standards. Specialist explicitly notes uncertainty at lines 79, 142, 185, 715, 778.

4. **Retroactive Dates**: All restored to "January 1, 2018" based on specialist recommendation at multiple locations (lines 182, 183, 451, 722, 809) requiring coverage of 2018-2025 period for survey deficiencies and 2019-2022 for Martinez allegations.

5. **Policy Limits**: All restored using midpoint/upper end of industry standard ranges documented in specialist report (conservative approach for draft contract language).
