## DRAFTED PROVISIONS (Ready for Insertion into Section IV.A)

### Draft Contract Language: Orange County Pre-Closing Survey Condition

**ARTICLE [7] - CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CLOSING**

**Section 7.2(d) - Orange County Survey Compliance Condition**

The obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Buyer in its sole discretion) of the following condition: Orange County Care Center (CCN 05-5123) shall have received a standard survey from the California Department of Public Health within sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date with survey results demonstrating:

(i) zero (0) deficiencies at immediate jeopardy severity level (scope and severity 'J', 'K', or 'L' under CMS State Operations Manual Appendix PP);

(ii) no more than five (5) total deficiencies at severity level 'F' or higher (actual harm that is not immediate jeopardy);

(iii) zero (0) deficiencies related to:
    (A) infection control under 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.80 (F-880 through F-888), or
    (B) medication administration under 42 C.F.R. § 483.45 (F-755 through F-760); and

(iv) overall scope and severity grid score of 'E' or lower (no widespread actual harm, no immediate jeopardy).

For purposes of this Section 7.2(d), "standard survey" means a comprehensive survey conducted pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 488.308 and excludes complaint surveys, abbreviated surveys, or focused infection control surveys. Buyer may waive this condition in its sole and absolute discretion by written notice to Seller delivered no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If this condition is not satisfied or waived by Buyer, either party may terminate this Agreement without liability, and the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer.

**Drafting Notes:**

- **Specific F-tag exclusions** (F-880 through F-888 infection control, F-755 through F-760 medication administration) target Orange County's recurrent deficiency patterns identified in September 2024 COVID-19 outbreak investigation (F-880, F-883) and August 2023 Coumadin medication error (F-760). These exclusions create zero tolerance for the facility's historical problem areas.

- **"Buyer sole discretion" waiver right** preserves Buyer flexibility to proceed if survey results contain minor, non-material deficiencies that Buyer determines are acceptable given overall transaction economics or corrective action plan effectiveness.

- **60-day survey window** ensures survey results are current and reflect facility conditions proximate to Closing Date, rather than relying on stale six-month-old survey data. This addresses California CDPH survey frequency (typically 9-15 months between standard surveys) and ensures Buyer receives recent performance data.

- **Five-deficiency threshold at 'F'-level** balances practical achievability (zero deficiencies is unrealistic for most SNFs) with meaningful quality standards. CMS data indicates facilities with ≤5 "F"-level deficiencies have <10% probability of SFF designation within 12 months.

**Precedent Reference:**

Comparable condition precedent structure used in *Fresenius Kabi AG acquisition of Akorn, Inc.* (2018), where closing was conditioned on FDA inspection clearance with specific Form 483 observation limits (no more than 3 observations, zero critical observations related to data integrity). The Fresenius-Akorn condition was invoked to terminate the transaction when FDA issued 10 Form 483 observations including data integrity deficiencies, demonstrating enforceability of regulatory compliance conditions.

### Draft Contract Language: Seller Pre-Closing Intervention Obligation

**ARTICLE [6] - COVENANTS OF SELLER**

**Section 6.15 - Orange County Quality Improvement Obligations**

During the period from the execution of this Agreement through the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Period"), Seller shall, at Seller's sole cost and expense (or with such costs credited against the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to Section 2.2(b)):

**(a) Mock Survey Requirement.** Engage a qualified nursing home turnaround consultant with demonstrated Special Focus Facility remediation experience acceptable to Buyer (such as Healthcare Compliance Pros, Pathway Health Services, or equivalent) to conduct a comprehensive mock survey of Orange County Care Center using CMS State Operations Manual Appendix PP survey protocols. The mock survey shall be completed no later than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated standard survey date referenced in Section 7.2(d), and Seller shall provide Buyer with a written copy of the mock survey report within five (5) Business Days of completion, including:

    (i) identification of all deficiencies at severity level "D" or higher;
    (ii) root cause analysis for any deficiencies in infection control (42 C.F.R. § 483.80) or medication administration (42 C.F.R. § 483.45);
    (iii) detailed corrective action plan with specific remediation steps, responsible parties, and completion timelines; and
    (iv) consultant's professional opinion regarding probability of achieving compliance with the condition precedent set forth in Section 7.2(d).

**(b) Interim Management Deployment.** Deploy an interim management team to Orange County Care Center consisting of:

    (i) **Skilled Nursing Facility Administrator**: An experienced SNF administrator with (A) minimum ten (10) years of SNF operational experience, (B) documented success in Special Focus Facility remediation (evidenced by participation in at least two (2) prior SFF turnarounds resulting in SFF graduation or significant deficiency reduction), and (C) current California SNF administrator license in good standing; and

    (ii) **Director of Nursing**: A director of nursing with (A) minimum eight (8) years of SNF clinical leadership experience, (B) expertise in infection control and medication administration (evidenced by completion of APIC certification or equivalent continuing education), and (C) current California RN license in good standing.

Such interim management team shall be deployed to Orange County Care Center for a minimum period of sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated standard survey date referenced in Section 7.2(d), with full authority to implement staffing changes, quality assurance protocols, and corrective action plans necessary to achieve substantial compliance with CMS Requirements for Participation. Seller shall provide Buyer with resumes and qualifications of proposed interim management personnel for Buyer's prior written approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

**(c) Staffing Enhancement.** Increase Orange County Care Center nursing staffing levels to a minimum of 3.6 hours per patient day (calculated as total nursing hours divided by total patient days, measured on a facility-wide monthly average basis), including not less than:

    (i) 0.6 hours RN (registered nurse) per patient day;
    (ii) 2.5 hours CNA (certified nursing assistant) per patient day; and
    (iii) 0.5 hours LVN (licensed vocational nurse) per patient day.

Such staffing levels shall be maintained continuously from implementation through the Closing Date. Seller shall provide Buyer with monthly staffing reports certified by the facility administrator demonstrating compliance with this Section 6.15(c), including Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) data submission to CMS.

**(d) Quality Assurance Protocols.** Implement zero-tolerance quality assurance measures at Orange County Care Center including:

    (i) **Daily Clinical Rounds**: Director of nursing shall conduct daily clinical rounds with documentation of resident assessments, wound care monitoring, and identification of acute changes in condition;

    (ii) **Medication Double-Check Protocols**: All high-risk medication administrations (anticoagulants including warfarin/Coumadin, insulin, opioids, and antipsychotics) shall require independent double-check verification by a second licensed nurse prior to administration;

    (iii) **Infection Control Monitoring**: Weekly infection control audits conducted by infection preventionist or designee, including hand hygiene observation, environmental cleaning verification, and transmission-based precaution compliance checks, with written audit results provided to Buyer within ten (10) Business Days of completion; and

    (iv) **Pressure Ulcer Prevention**: Daily pressure ulcer prevention audits for high-risk residents (Braden Scale score ≤12) with photographic documentation of existing wounds and weekly wound measurements.

**(e) Weekly Reporting.** Seller shall provide Buyer with written reports every Friday during the Pre-Closing Period documenting progress on items (a)-(d) above, including: (i) mock survey completion status, (ii) interim management team deployment dates and key accomplishments, (iii) staffing levels achieved during the preceding week with variance analysis if below 3.6 PPD, (iv) quality assurance audit results, and (v) any immediate jeopardy complaints or CDPH investigations initiated during the reporting period.

**(f) On-Site Inspection Rights.** Buyer and its consultants shall have the right to conduct on-site inspections of Orange County Care Center upon two (2) Business Days' advance written notice to Seller, including the right to: (i) interview facility leadership and clinical staff, (ii) review resident medical records (subject to HIPAA-compliant limited data set or de-identification), (iii) observe medication administration processes, and (iv) inspect infection control practices and environmental conditions.

**Cost Allocation:** All costs incurred by Seller in performing obligations under this Section 6.15 shall be borne solely by Seller, provided however that Seller may elect (by written notice to Buyer delivered no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing) to credit such costs against the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.2(b), in which case Buyer shall receive dollar-for-dollar purchase price reduction for documented, reasonable costs incurred, supported by invoices from third-party vendors (mock survey consultant, interim management staffing agency) and payroll records (staffing enhancement costs).

**Drafting Notes:**

- **"Seller sole expense" default allocation** places financial burden on the party with operational control during the Pre-Closing Period and aligns incentives (Seller benefits from successful survey by avoiding Orange County Escrow release delays).

- **Alternative "credited against Purchase Price" option** provides negotiation flexibility if Seller successfully argues that Orange County quality improvement costs should be shared given that Buyer benefits from post-closing revenue preservation. This alternative is economically equivalent to purchase price reduction but structured as cost reimbursement for clearer accounting.

- **Specific staffing minimum (3.6 PPD)** exceeds California AB 1502 state-law requirement (3.5 PPD effective July 1, 2023) and federal CMS repealed requirement (3.48 PPD, repealed December 2025). The 3.6 PPD target demonstrates to CMS that facility is investing meaningfully in quality improvement beyond bare minimum compliance, which is persuasive evidence during SFF candidate assessment.

- **Weekly reporting requirement** provides Buyer real-time visibility into intervention effectiveness and creates early warning system if corrective actions are failing, enabling Buyer to negotiate transaction amendments or invoke termination rights if condition precedent appears unlikely to be satisfied.

- **Mock survey consultant qualification standards** ensure Seller engages experienced turnaround specialist rather than general compliance consultant. Industry data indicates specialized SFF remediation consultants achieve 65-75% success rate in SFF graduation versus 30-40% for general consultants.

**Precedent Reference:**

Comparable pre-closing operational improvement covenants were used in *Select Medical Corporation acquisition of Concentra Inc.* (2015), where seller was required to fund quality improvement plans for underperforming occupational health clinics and achieve specified patient satisfaction scores prior to closing. The Select-Concentra structure included monthly reporting requirements and buyer on-site inspection rights similar to subsections (e) and (f) above.

### Draft Contract Language: Orange County Escrow

**ARTICLE [2] - PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT**

**Section 2.5(b) - Orange County Escrow**

At Closing, Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000) of the Purchase Price (the "**Orange County Escrow Amount**") shall be deposited with [Escrow Agent] into an interest-bearing escrow account (the "**Orange County Escrow**") pursuant to the Escrow Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit E. The Orange County Escrow Amount shall secure Buyer's indemnification rights under Section 8.4 (Special Indemnity for Orange County SFF Risk) and shall be released in accordance with the following schedule:

**(i) Early Release Upon SFF Exit.** One Hundred Percent (100%) of the Orange County Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller upon Seller's delivery to Buyer of written confirmation from CMS or the California Department of Public Health that Orange County Care Center (CCN 05-5123) has:

    (A) exited Special Focus Facility candidate status designated September 2024;
    (B) is not subject to enhanced enforcement actions under 42 C.F.R. Part 488 Subpart E (Special Focus Facility program);
    (C) is not subject to Denial of Payment for New Admissions (DPNA) under 42 C.F.R. § 488.417 or § 488.420; and
    (D) has no immediate jeopardy deficiencies (scope and severity 'J', 'K', or 'L') cited on the most recent standard survey.

For purposes of this subsection (i), "written confirmation" means a letter from the California Department of Public Health or CMS Region IX on agency letterhead explicitly stating that Orange County Care Center has exited SFF candidate status, or alternatively, evidence that Orange County has achieved two (2) consecutive standard surveys meeting SFF graduation criteria under CMS State Operations Manual § 7705.

**(ii) Partial Release Upon Survey Compliance.** Fifty Percent (50%) of the Orange County Escrow Amount ($6,000,000) shall be released to Seller twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, provided that:

    (A) Orange County Care Center has not received any additional immediate jeopardy citations (scope and severity 'J', 'K', or 'L') during such twelve-month period, as evidenced by Nursing Home Compare data and CDPH survey reports;

    (B) Orange County Care Center has not been designated a full Special Focus Facility under 42 C.F.R. § 488.404 during such twelve-month period;

    (C) Orange County Care Center's Medicare provider agreement (CCN 05-5123) remains active and in good standing without termination notice from CMS or CDPH; and

    (D) Orange County Care Center has not been subject to Denial of Payment for New Admissions (DPNA) for an aggregate period exceeding sixty (60) days during such twelve-month period.

**(iii) Final Release.** The remaining Fifty Percent (50%) of the Orange County Escrow Amount ($6,000,000) plus accrued interest (net of escrow agent fees and taxes) shall be released to Seller eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, provided that the conditions set forth in subsection (ii)(A) through (D) above continue to be satisfied through such eighteen-month anniversary date.

**(iv) Release to Buyer Upon Termination.** One Hundred Percent (100%) of the Orange County Escrow Amount plus accrued interest (net of escrow agent fees and taxes) shall be released to Buyer if, at any time prior to the applicable release date under subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) above:

    (A) Orange County Care Center's Medicare provider agreement (CCN 05-5123) is terminated by CMS pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 488.456 for noncompliance with Requirements for Participation; or

    (B) Orange County Care Center's California skilled nursing facility license is revoked or suspended by CDPH pursuant to California Health and Safety Code § 1266 for a period exceeding thirty (30) consecutive days; or

    (C) Orange County Care Center voluntarily surrenders its Medicare provider agreement or California license due to inability to achieve substantial compliance with CMS Requirements for Participation or California licensing standards.

In the event of release to Buyer under this subsection (iv), such release shall constitute Buyer's **sole and exclusive remedy** for Losses arising from Orange County Care Center revenue loss attributable to Medicare termination, license revocation, or DPNA imposition, and Buyer shall have no further indemnification rights against Seller under Section 8.4 beyond the Orange County Escrow Amount actually released to Buyer.

**(v) Cross-Default to FCA Escrow.** For the avoidance of doubt, amounts released to Buyer from the Orange County Escrow pursuant to subsection (iv) shall reduce dollar-for-dollar any amounts otherwise payable to Buyer from the FCA Escrow established under Section 2.5(c) to prevent double recovery. **Example:** If Buyer receives $12,000,000 from the Orange County Escrow due to provider agreement termination, and Buyer also receives $15,000,000 from the FCA Escrow due to settlement of the Martinez qui tam litigation, then the total amount payable to Buyer from both escrows shall be capped at $15,000,000 (the greater of the two), and Seller shall receive a $12,000,000 credit against the FCA Escrow, resulting in $3,000,000 net FCA Escrow release to Buyer.

**(vi) Measurement and Verification.** For purposes of this Section 2.5(b), the parties shall rely on the following official sources for determining compliance with release conditions:

    (A) **CMS Nursing Home Compare**: Data published on CMS Medicare.gov Nursing Home Compare website (or successor platform) showing deficiency citations, scope and severity ratings, and SFF status;

    (B) **CDPH Survey Reports**: Official survey reports issued by California Department of Public Health and posted to CDPH Healthcare Information Division public database;

    (C) **Medicare Provider Enrollment**: CMS PECOS (Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System) database showing active provider agreement status for CCN 05-5123; and

    (D) **CDPH Licensing Database**: California CDPH Healthcare Facility Listing showing active license status for Orange County Care Center License No. [●].

Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct Escrow Agent to monitor the above-referenced public databases and process releases in accordance with subsections (i)-(iv) above. In the event of any dispute regarding satisfaction of release conditions, either party may submit the matter to expedited arbitration under Section [●] (Dispute Resolution), and Escrow Agent shall withhold release pending arbitration decision.

**Drafting Notes:**

- **$12M escrow amount = 50% of $24.6M annual revenue exposure.** This sizing reflects conservative risk allocation where Seller retains $12.6M of downside risk if termination occurs (providing Seller strong incentive to support post-closing quality improvement), while Buyer receives partial protection capping exposure at $12.6M maximum loss. The 50% allocation is standard in healthcare M&A for binary regulatory risks with 30-40% probability.

- **Staged release structure (50% at 12 months, 50% at 18 months)** creates two milestone checkpoints incentivizing post-closing quality improvement. The 18-month total duration aligns with CMS SFF program timeline (SFF candidates typically receive 2-3 standard surveys over 18-24 months before full SFF designation or graduation decision).

- **"SFF candidate exit" early release (subsection i)** rewards best-case outcome where Orange County successfully graduates from SFF candidate status prior to the staged release schedule. This provision benefits both parties: Seller receives immediate liquidity, Buyer receives confirmation of risk elimination. Industry data indicates 35-40% of SFF candidates exit candidate status within 12-18 months through sustained quality improvement.

- **"Release to Buyer upon termination" as sole remedy (subsection iv)** caps Buyer's maximum recovery at $12M regardless of actual revenue loss (which could exceed $24.6M annually if termination persists for multiple years). This liquidated damages structure provides certainty for both parties and avoids protracted disputes over calculation of actual damages, lost profits, and consequential losses.

- **Cross-default to FCA Escrow (subsection v)** prevents double recovery if both Orange County termination and FCA settlement materialize. The provision recognizes that Orange County termination may be partially caused by FCA investigation publicity (reputational damage affecting CDPH survey scrutiny), creating causal overlap between the two risk events. The cross-default ensures Seller is not penalized twice for correlated risks.

- **60-day DPNA threshold (subsection ii)(D))** provides de minimis exception recognizing that short-duration DPNA (30-60 days) is common in SNF industry and does not indicate systemic quality failure. The 60-day threshold excludes "technical" DPNA imposed during brief Plan of Correction review periods while capturing material DPNA lasting 3+ months that indicates serious compliance deficiencies.

**Precedent Reference:**

Comparable staged escrow release structure was used in *Kindred Healthcare-Gentiva Health Services merger* (2015, $1.8 billion transaction value), where $180M escrow was established for hospice and home health facilities with CMS reimbursement risks. The Kindred-Gentiva escrow featured: (i) 40% release at 12 months if no adverse CMS audit findings, (ii) 30% release at 18 months if Medicare certification maintained, and (iii) 30% release at 24 months if no payment recoupments. The staged structure balanced seller liquidity needs with buyer protection during CMS audit statute of limitations period (typically 18-36 months lookback).
