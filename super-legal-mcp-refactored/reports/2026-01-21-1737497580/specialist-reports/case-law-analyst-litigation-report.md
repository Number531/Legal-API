## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### PART A: THOMPSON v. LIBERTY LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY — IUL CLASS ACTION

#### A.1 Case Verification Status and Hypothetical Nature

**CRITICAL FINDING — CASE VERIFICATION [HYPOTHETICAL]:**

After comprehensive database searches of CourtListener, Justia Dockets, Nebraska federal and state court records, and specialized IUL litigation tracking resources, **no case titled "Thompson v. Liberty Life Insurance Company" filed in Nebraska District Court (Douglas County) in August 2023 was identified**. [HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO - verification not possible for fictional entity]

**Search Strategy Executed:**
1. CourtListener federal/state case database search: "Thompson v. Liberty Life Insurance Company Nebraska"
2. Justia Dockets Nebraska insurance cases filtering (2023-2025)
3. Web search: IUL class action lawsuits filed 2023-2024 Nebraska
4. Nebraska federal district court docket search (District of Nebraska)
5. Douglas County District Court (Nebraska state court) docket search

**Results:** Zero matching cases found across all databases.

**Context: Industry-Wide IUL Litigation Landscape**

While the specific Thompson v. Liberty Life case could not be verified, extensive IUL class action litigation has been filed nationally 2023-2025, establishing factual analogues and precedent patterns:

#### A.2 Comparable IUL Class Action Litigation (2023-2025)

**National Life Group (Vermont Federal Court, 2023-2024):**
- **Case:** Virani v. NLV Financial Corp., U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont (filed 2024)
- **Facts:** Plaintiff purchased IUL policy in 2023; policy returned 0% interest for policy year September 2023-September 2024; class action status requested
- **Claims:** Similar to hypothetical Thompson case — misleading illustrations, failure to disclose index crediting limitations
- **Status:** September 2025 Vermont judge dismissed two National Life companies from lawsuit¹
- **Source:** [New lawsuit accuses National Life of misleading IUL illustrations](https://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/new-lawsuit-accuses-national-life-of-misleading-iul-illustrations), Insurance News Net (2024)

**Pacific Life (Washington State, 2025):**
- **Settlement:** September 2025 settlement over misleading IUL illustrations
- **Issues:** Overstated returns in sales presentations
- **Significance:** Demonstrates carrier settlement practice for IUL misrepresentation claims²
- **Source:** [Complete Compilation of 2025 IUL Lawsuits](https://investorlosscenter.com/news/iul-lawsuits-2025/), RP Legal (2025)

**Kyle Busch Case (2025):**
- **Plaintiffs:** NASCAR driver Kyle Busch and wife Samantha
- **Damages:** $8.5 million net out-of-pocket losses; $10.4 million total policy value at risk
- **Claims:** Failed retirement strategy based on overstated returns, policy projected to expire within 16 months³
- **Source:** [Kyle Busch's $8M loss is a warning for those with life insurance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kyle-busch-8m-loss-warning-133100332.html), Yahoo Finance (2025)

**Broader IUL Litigation Recoveries:**
- $1.5 million jury verdict against Pacific Life for failed retirement strategy
- $10+ million in recoveries for 400+ clients in claims against Allianz, Transamerica, and others⁴
- **Source:** [Indexed Universal Life Insurance Lawsuits](https://investorlosscenter.com/iul-lawsuits/), Investor Loss Center

**Key Pattern:** Regulatory agencies have received thousands of complaints about misleading IUL illustrations and hidden fees (2020-2025).⁵

#### A.3 Legal Framework: Nebraska Consumer Protection Act

**Nebraska Consumer Protection Act §§ 59-1601 et seq.**

**Statutory Text (§ 59-1602):**
"Unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful."⁶

**Private Right of Action (§ 59-1609):**
- Damages capped at $1,000 over actual damages
- Attorney fees recoverable where reasonable
- **CRITICAL LIMITATION:** Statute does NOT discuss punitive damages⁷

**Insurance-Specific Application:**
"Actions and transactions prohibited or regulated under the laws administered by the Director of Insurance shall be subject to section 59-1602 and all statutes which provide for the implementation and enforcement of section 59-1602."⁸

**Public Interest Requirement:**
To be actionable under the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act, the unfair or deceptive act must have an impact upon the public interest. *State ex rel. Stenberg v. Consumer's Choice Foods*, 276 Neb. 481, 755 N.W.2d 583 (2008).⁹

**Implications for Hypothetical Thompson Case:**
- Count III (Nebraska Consumer Protection Act claim) would be **statutorily limited** to actual damages + $1,000 + attorney fees
- **Punitive damages NOT available** under § 59-1601 et seq.
- User-provided exposure range "$170M-$375M total exposure" including punitive damages 2-3× is **NOT consistent with Nebraska Consumer Protection Act statutory remedies**

#### A.4 Nebraska Punitive Damages — Constitutional Prohibition

**CRITICAL LEGAL FINDING:**

**Nebraska's Constitution PROHIBITS punitive damages in ALL civil suits, regardless of malice or recklessness.**¹⁰

This constitutional ban on punitive damages directly contradicts the user-provided assumption that the hypothetical Thompson v. Liberty Life case involves "punitive damages 2-3× compensatory" totaling "$170M-$375M total exposure."

**Legal Basis:**
- Nebraska courts have held that excessive damages (such as treble damages) beyond reasonable economic damages are "punitive" and thus unconstitutional under Nebraska law
- No multipliers (2×, 3×) exist in Nebraska civil litigation
- No caps on punitive damages exist **because punitive damages are entirely unavailable**¹¹

**Comparison to Other Jurisdictions:**
- Missouri: Punitive damages capped at 5× compensatory damages or $500,000, whichever is greater
- Kansas, Iowa: Punitive damages available with varying multiplier caps
- **Nebraska: Zero punitive damages permitted**¹²

**Impact on Hypothetical Case Analysis:**

If the Thompson v. Liberty Life case were litigated in Nebraska state court or Nebraska federal court applying Nebraska substantive law (*Erie* doctrine), the following exposure analysis applies:

**Revised Damages Exposure (Nebraska Law):**
- **Count I (Misrepresentation):** Actual damages $85M-$125M cash value shortfall (common law fraud)
- **Count II (Omissions):** Actual damages $85M-$125M (common law concealment)
- **Count III (Nebraska Consumer Protection Act):** Actual damages $85M-$125M + $1,000 statutory cap + attorney fees
- **Punitive Damages:** **$0 (constitutionally prohibited)**
- **Total Maximum Exposure:** $85M-$125M actual damages + attorney fees (typically 25-33% = $21M-$41M)
- **Aggregate Exposure:** **$106M-$166M** (actual damages + attorney fees), **NOT** $170M-$375M
