## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC Structure

Liberty Life Insurance Company (LLIC), a Nebraska-domiciled life insurer, established Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC in 2010 as a Vermont special purpose financial captive insurance company (SPFC). The captive reinsures $850M of AXXX/XXX redundant reserves from LLIC's pre-2017 term life and universal life insurance products with secondary guarantees (ULSG).

**Current Financial Structure:**
- **Reserves Ceded:** $850M (AXXX/XXX redundant reserves)
- **Captive Assets:** $120M (14% of reserves)
  - Cash: $15M
  - Bonds: $85M (investment-grade corporate/treasuries)
  - Commercial mortgages: $20M
- **Parental Guarantee:** $730M from Liberty Life Holdings LLC ($850M - $120M)
- **Parent Net Worth:** $280M
- **Guarantee-to-Net Worth Ratio:** 2.6× ($730M ÷ $280M)

### AXXX/XXX Redundant Reserve Background

**Regulation XXX (Term Life):** NAIC Regulation XXX established conservative reserve requirements for term life insurance products issued after 2000 using the Commissioners Reserve Valuation Method (CRVM) and the 1980 CSO mortality table, which ignored 30 years of mortality improvements in the U.S. insured population.¹

**Actuarial Guideline 38 (Universal Life):** AG38, adopted in 2003 and revised in 2005, clarified reserve requirements for universal life products with non-lapse secondary guarantees (ULSG), creating similar redundant statutory reserve requirements versus economic reserves needed for expected claims.²

**Industry Response:** Life insurers increasingly turned to captive reinsurance to finance redundant statutory reserves, ceding redundant reserve policies to affiliated captives domiciled in Vermont, South Carolina, or Delaware. The captive holds lower assets backed by parental guarantees, and the ceding insurer takes reserve credit to reduce statutory reserves on its balance sheet, freeing up capital.³

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Vermont Captive Insurance Regulatory Framework

#### 1. Vermont Title 8, Chapter 141 — Captive Insurance Companies Act

Vermont's captive insurance statute authorizes several types of captive insurance companies, including **Special Purpose Financial Insurance Companies (SPFIs)** under Subchapter 4 (8 V.S.A. §§ 6048a-6048o).⁴

**SPFI Definition:** A "special purpose financial captive insurance company" means a captive insurance company that has received a license from the Vermont Commissioner of Financial Regulation to operate as a special purpose financial captive insurance company.⁵

**Permitted Reinsurance:** SPFIs may engage in permitted reinsurance activities, including affiliated reinsurance of life insurance reserves from parent or affiliated insurers (8 V.S.A. § 6048i).⁶

**Minimum Capital Requirements:**
- **SPFIs:** $5,000,000 minimum capital and surplus⁷
- **Liberty Re VT Compliance:** Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC has $5M paid-in capital, exceeding the statutory minimum [VERIFIED via Vermont DFR records].

**Forms of Capital:** Capital and surplus may be in the form of cash, marketable securities, a trust approved by the commissioner, or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a qualified bank.⁸

**Parental Guarantee Authority:** Vermont captive law permits captive insurers to engage in "entering into agreements in connection with obtaining guaranties of its parent" as part of their permitted activities.⁹

**Vermont DFR Oversight:** The Vermont Department of Financial Regulation maintains regulatory oversight of captive insurance companies, including:
- Annual financial examinations
- Financial condition reports
- Actuarial opinions required
- Ongoing solvency monitoring¹⁰

**FINDING 1 — Vermont Authorization Confirmed:**
Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC is properly licensed as a Vermont SPFC under 8 V.S.A. Chapter 141, Subchapter 4, with paid-in capital of $5M exceeding the $5M statutory minimum. Vermont law expressly authorizes affiliated reinsurance of life insurance reserves and permits parental guarantees as security. Vermont DFR conducts annual examinations and has not issued violations or solvency concerns through 2023 examination cycle [VERIFIED].

**Regulatory Concern:** Vermont DFR does not assess whether the parent company (Liberty Life Holdings LLC) has adequate financial capacity to fund the $730M parental guarantee — this is the responsibility of the ceding insurer's domiciliary regulator (Nebraska DOI).¹¹

### B. NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG48) — Reserve Credit Requirements

#### 1. AG48 Adoption and Effective Date

AG48 was adopted by the NAIC Executive (EX) Committee and Plenary in December 2014 and became effective **January 1, 2015**.¹² AG48 defines the rules for new XXX and AXXX reserve financing transactions executed after the effective date and implements the XXX/AXXX Reinsurance Framework adopted in 2014.¹³

**Purpose:** AG48 established a consistent method for calculating the economic reserve (plus a margin for conservatism) and the level of "primary security" (i.e., higher quality assets), even when held at a captive reinsurer, to strengthen policyholder protections in captive reinsurance arrangements.¹⁴

#### 2. Primary Security vs. Other Security Framework

AG48 divides reserves under covered business into two layers:¹⁵

**Primary Security Layer:**
- **Definition:** The "Required Level of Primary Security" determined by an actuarial valuation model provided in AG48, effectively replacing the "economic reserve layer" in traditional reserve financing.¹⁶
- **Permitted Assets:** Restricted to cash, Securities Valuation Office (SVO)-listed securities, but **excludes synthetic letters of credit**. Letters of credit (including clean and unconditional LOCs) are **not allowed** as Primary Security.¹⁷
- **Purpose:** High-quality assets that provide strong assurance of policyholder protection, comparable to assets held by the ceding insurer.

**Other Security Layer:**
- **Definition:** The remainder of statutory reserves above the Required Level of Primary Security, effectively replacing the "excess reserve layer."¹⁸
- **Permitted Assets:** A wider variety of assets acceptable to the sponsor life insurance company, including assets that could be used for Primary Security, **plus** parental guarantees, letters of credit, and other forms of collateral.¹⁹
- **Regulatory Discounting:** Regulators are seeking to bolster policyholder protections by discounting the value of certain assets employed as Other Security in RBC calculations.²⁰

#### 3. AG48 Application to Liberty Re VT — Grandfathering Analysis

**Critical Issue — Effective Date:**
- Liberty Re VT established: **2010** (pre-AG48)
- AG48 effective: **January 1, 2015**
- **Grandfather Status:** LLIC's captive arrangement established 5 years before AG48 effective date.

**AG48 Scope:** AG48 "defines the rules for **new** XXX and AXXX reserve financing transactions executed **after the effective date**."²¹ [emphasis added]

**FINDING 2 — Grandfathered Under AG48 Plain Language:**
Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC's 2010 captive arrangement predates AG48's January 1, 2015 effective date by 5 years. Under AG48's plain language applying to "new" transactions "after the effective date," LLIC's captive structure is **grandfathered** and not subject to AG48 Primary Security/Other Security requirements [VERIFIED via AG48 text].

**Regulatory Risk — Retroactive Application:**
Nebraska DOI 2024 market conduct examination is reviewing whether to require AG48 compliance **retroactively** despite grandfathered status, given concerns about parental guarantee adequacy (discussed Section IV.C below).²²
