## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Securities Act of 1933 — Registration and Prospectus Delivery Requirements

#### 1. Statutory Framework: Section 5 Prospectus Delivery Requirements

The Securities Act of 1933, Section 5, establishes foundational requirements for the offer and sale of securities, including variable insurance products. Section 5(b)(2) mandates that when securities are delivered, the prospectus must also be delivered, and Section 5(a)(2) prohibits delivery of securities until the registration statement is effective.¹

For variable insurance products, the SEC adopted Rule 498A under the Securities Act, which permits satisfaction of prospectus delivery obligations by sending or giving a summary prospectus to investors and making the statutory prospectus available online.² This rule modernizes disclosures using a layered disclosure approach designed to provide investors with key information relating to the contract's terms, benefits, and risks in a concise and more reader-friendly presentation.³

**Timing Requirements:** The SEC has established that for investment companies that continuously offer their shares (including variable insurance products), there is a general ongoing duty to update prospectuses promptly for material changes in disclosures.⁴ This requirement applies to Liberty Life's variable product separate accounts, which must maintain current prospectuses within the prescribed timeframes.

#### 2. Form N-6 Registration Requirements for Variable Life Insurance

**Critical Update:** As of December 1, 2002, the SEC replaced Forms N-8B-2 and S-6 with Form N-6 as the registration form for insurance company separate accounts offering variable life insurance policies.⁵

Form N-6 is the mandatory registration form for separate accounts that are unit investment trusts offering variable life insurance contracts. It serves dual purposes:
- Registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 pursuant to Section 8(b)
- Registration under the Securities Act of 1933 for the securities of such separate accounts⁶

**Liberty Life Separate Account A (VUL) Analysis:** Based on the assignment background indicating that Liberty Life Separate Account A offers variable universal life insurance with 12 subaccounts, this separate account would be required to file Form N-6 registration statements (not the outdated Form S-6 mentioned in the assignment). The annual update requirement mandates filing updated prospectuses with current financial statements, fee schedules, subaccount performance data, and risk disclosures.

#### 3. Form N-4 Registration Requirements for Variable Annuities

Variable annuity separate accounts register using Form N-4 under both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Act of 1933. Liberty Life Separate Account B (VA), with 15 subaccounts offering variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) riders, would be required to maintain current Form N-4 registration statements.⁷

The registration statement must include comprehensive disclosure of:
- Investment objectives and strategies for each subaccount
- Fee structures (M&E charges, administrative fees, surrender charges, rider fees for GMWB)
- Risk factors specific to variable products (market risk, insurance company risk, rider costs)
- Historical performance data for subaccounts
- Tax consequences of variable annuity ownership and withdrawals

### B. Investment Company Act of 1940 — Separate Account Registration Structure

#### 1. Unit Investment Trust Registration for Insurance Separate Accounts

Insurance company separate accounts offering variable insurance products must register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, typically as unit investment trusts (UITs). The Investment Company Act defines three categories of investment companies: face-amount certificate companies, unit investment trusts, and management companies.⁸

**Unit Investment Trust Structure:** A UIT is an investment company organized under a trust indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar instrument, which does not have a board of directors and does not issue redeemable securities.⁹ This structure is the predominant registration form for insurance company separate accounts offering variable life insurance and variable annuities.

**Critical Distinction from Management Companies:** Unlike management companies (mutual funds) that have boards of directors or trustees with ongoing investment management oversight, unit investment trusts do not have boards of directors, corporate officers, or investment advisers in the traditional sense.¹⁰ Instead, UITs maintain a relatively fixed portfolio or, in the case of variable insurance separate accounts, invest in underlying mutual fund subaccounts (Portfolio Companies) that are themselves registered management companies.

#### 2. Separate Account A (VUL) and Separate Account B (VA) Registration Analysis

**Liberty Life Separate Account A (Variable Universal Life):** This separate account, offering variable universal life insurance with 12 subaccounts (equity, bond, money market), would be registered as a unit investment trust using Form N-6. Each subaccount invests in a corresponding Portfolio Company (mutual fund) that is registered as a management investment company under the Investment Company Act.¹¹

**Liberty Life Separate Account B (Variable Annuities):** This separate account, offering variable annuities with 15 subaccounts and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) riders, would be registered as a unit investment trust using Form N-4. Similar to Separate Account A, each subaccount serves as a vehicle for investment in underlying mutual funds.¹²

**No Board of Managers Required:** Because Liberty Life's separate accounts are structured as unit investment trusts rather than management companies, they do not require a board of directors or "Board of Managers" as described in some insurance contexts. The oversight and compliance responsibilities fall to Liberty Life Insurance Company as the sponsor and depositor of the separate accounts, with regulatory oversight provided by the SEC under the Investment Company Act and by FINRA for the broker-dealer distributing the products.¹³

#### 3. Rule 6c-8 and Other Exemptive Rules

The SEC has adopted several exemptive rules specifically for registered separate accounts, including Rule 6c-8, which provides exemptions for separate accounts to impose deferred sales loads and deduct certain administrative charges.¹⁴ These exemptions are conditioned on requirements that:
- The separate account assets are legally segregated from the insurance company's general account
- The separate account assets have a value at least equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities¹⁵

Additional exemptive rules applicable to variable insurance separate accounts include:
- **Rule 6c-6:** Exemptions for certain registered separate accounts and other persons
- **Rule 6c-7:** Exemptions for flexible premium variable life insurance separate accounts¹⁶

**Compliance Requirement:** Liberty Life must ensure that Separate Accounts A and B comply with the conditions for exemptive relief under Rules 6c-6, 6c-7, and 6c-8, including maintaining proper asset segregation and reserve adequacy. Any failure to meet these conditions could jeopardize the availability of exemptions and trigger SEC enforcement scrutiny.

### C. FINRA Rule 2111 — Suitability Requirements for Variable Products

#### 1. Three-Part Suitability Framework

FINRA Rule 2111 imposes comprehensive suitability obligations on broker-dealers recommending securities transactions, including variable life insurance and variable annuities. The rule requires that a member or associated person have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommended transaction or investment strategy involving a security is suitable for the customer.¹⁷

The rule establishes three distinct suitability obligations:

**a) Reasonable-Basis Suitability**

The reasonable-basis obligation requires a member or associated person to have a reasonable basis to believe, based on reasonable diligence, that the recommendation is suitable for at least some investors. This diligence must provide an understanding of the potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended security or strategy.¹⁸

For variable universal life insurance and variable annuities, reasonable-basis suitability requires the broker-dealer (Liberty Life Securities LLC) to conduct due diligence to understand:
- Product features: surrender charges (typically 7-10 years), mortality and expense (M&E) charges (0.90% for Liberty Life's VUL products), cost of insurance (COI) charges that increase with age, administrative fees
- Investment risks: market risk in separate account subaccounts, sequence of returns risk, volatility impact on cash value accumulation
- Insurance benefits: death benefit protection, guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) for variable annuities, tax-deferral advantages
- Costs and breakeven analysis: breakeven periods (10-15 years typical for VUL given front-loaded costs and surrender charges), total cost of ownership over policy life
- Alternative products: comparison to term life insurance plus separate investment, traditional whole life, fixed annuities

**b) Customer-Specific Suitability**

The customer-specific obligation requires that a member or associated person have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation is suitable for a particular customer based on that customer's investment profile.¹⁹ FINRA Rule 2111 defines "investment profile" to include:

- **Age:** Critical for variable products with long-term surrender charges and breakeven periods. Customers age 75+ generally have shortened time horizons inconsistent with 10-15 year breakeven periods.
- **Other investments:** Portfolio diversification and concentration risk assessment.
- **Financial situation and needs:** Income sources, expenses, liquidity requirements, emergency fund adequacy.
- **Tax status:** Income tax bracket impacts tax-deferral benefits (variable products provide greater tax advantages for high-income taxpayers in elevated tax brackets).
- **Investment objectives:** Growth, income, capital preservation, estate planning, retirement income.
- **Investment experience:** Sophistication level, understanding of equity market risk, prior securities ownership.
- **Investment time horizon:** Long-term (10+ years) appropriate for VUL/VA; short-term (<5 years) inappropriate due to surrender charges.
- **Liquidity needs:** Variable products are illiquid during surrender charge period; customers must have alternative liquid assets for emergencies.
- **Risk tolerance:** Variable products with separate account market exposure require willingness to accept potential losses; unsuitable for conservative risk-averse investors who cannot tolerate market volatility.²⁰

**c) Quantitative Suitability**

Quantitative suitability requires a member or associated person to have a reasonable basis for believing that a series of recommended transactions, even if suitable when viewed in isolation, are not excessive and unsuitable for the customer when taken together in light of the customer's investment profile. This obligation applies when the broker-dealer has actual or de facto control over the customer's account.²¹

For variable products, quantitative suitability concerns include:
- Multiple variable annuity contracts purchased within short time periods (stacking surrender charge periods)
- Excessive 1035 exchanges from existing annuities to new annuities, resetting surrender charges
- Over-concentration in variable products relative to customer's total portfolio

#### 2. FINRA Rule 2330 — Enhanced Requirements for Variable Annuities

FINRA adopted Rule 2330 to provide additional targeted protections specifically for deferred variable annuities. Prior to recommending the purchase or exchange of a deferred variable annuity, members must make reasonable efforts to obtain customer information including age, annual income, financial situation and needs, investment experience, investment objectives, intended use, investment time horizon, existing assets, liquidity needs, liquid net worth, risk tolerance, and tax status.²²

**Suitability Determination Requirements:**
- Member must have a reasonable basis to believe the customer has been informed of various features of deferred variable annuities, including potential surrender charges, tax penalties for early withdrawal, mortality and expense charges, investment advisory fees, potential changes to death and living benefit features, and market risk.
- Member must have a reasonable basis to believe that the customer would benefit from certain features of deferred variable annuities, such as tax-deferred growth, annuitization, or death or living benefits (e.g., GMWB riders on Liberty Life's variable annuities).²³

**Supervisory Requirements under Rule 2330:**
Rule 2330 imposes heightened supervisory obligations, requiring firms to implement surveillance procedures specifically designed to detect recommendations in violation of the rule. Failures to implement adequate surveillance have resulted in significant FINRA enforcement actions, including a $350,000 fine against VALIC Financial Advisors in 2021 and a $4 million fine against Fifth Third Securities in 2018 (with $2 million in customer restitution).²⁴

#### 3. Application to Liberty Life's October 2023 FINRA Violations

The assignment background describes three suitability violations identified in Liberty Life Securities LLC's October 2023 FINRA examination:

**Violation Pattern:** Three agents recommended variable universal life (VUL) insurance to customers age 75+ with limited income ($35,000-$45,000/year from Social Security and pension), no earned income, and limited liquid net worth.

**Customer-Specific Suitability Failures:**

a) **Age and Time Horizon Mismatch:**
- VUL products have breakeven periods of 10-15 years due to front-loaded costs (surrender charges, high first-year commissions embedded in M&E charges, COI charges)
- Customers age 75+ have actuarial life expectancies of approximately 11-13 years (male) or 13-15 years (female) per Social Security Administration life tables
- The probability of policy lapse or death before breakeven significantly reduces the likelihood that customers will benefit from the product
- **Suitability Violation:** Age 75+ creates time horizon incompatibility with VUL's long-term structure, violating customer-specific suitability requirements under Rule 2111

b) **Income and Affordability Concerns:**
- Limited income ($35,000-$45,000/year) from fixed sources (Social Security, pension) with no earned income growth potential
- VUL premiums must be maintained to prevent policy lapse; if premium payments cease, high policy charges (M&E 0.90%, COI, admin fees) rapidly erode cash value
- Customers with limited fixed income lack financial capacity to sustain premium payments over 10-15+ year periods, particularly if unexpected expenses arise
- **Suitability Violation:** Limited income creates affordability risk and likelihood of policy lapse, violating customer-specific suitability requirements

c) **Liquidity and Emergency Fund Deficiency:**
- VUL policies subject to surrender charges (typically 7-10 years, declining annually)
- Early surrender triggers surrender charges plus potential tax consequences (ordinary income on gains above basis)
- Customers age 75+ with limited income and limited liquid net worth lack emergency reserves; tying assets in illiquid VUL products creates financial distress risk
- **Suitability Violation:** Insufficient liquidity violates customer-specific suitability requirements under Rule 2111

d) **Cost Structure Unsuitability:**
- M&E charges: 0.90% annually
- Cost of insurance (COI): Increases exponentially with age; age 75+ COI charges typically 5-10× higher than younger insureds
- Administrative fees: Fixed annual charges
- Surrender charges: 7-10 year declining schedule
- **Combined Effect:** High ongoing costs erode cash value, making it unlikely customers age 75+ with limited income will accumulate meaningful cash value or achieve positive returns before death

**FINRA Enforcement Action — Acceptance, Waiver and Consent (AWC):**
- **Fine:** $75,000 paid by Liberty Life Securities LLC
- **Agent Discipline:** Three agents suspended 30 days; retraining required on suitability obligations, customer profiling, and senior investor protections
- **Settlement Structure:** AWC settlement without admitting or denying FINRA's findings (standard FINRA settlement format allowing resolution without protracted litigation)
- **Supervision Deficiency:** Branch manager failed to review 8 applications timely; applications submitted to home office without required principal approval, violating FINRA Rule 3110 supervision requirements (discussed in Section IV.D below)
