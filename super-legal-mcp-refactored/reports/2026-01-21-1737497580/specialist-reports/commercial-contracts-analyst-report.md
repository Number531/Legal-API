## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Transaction Context

Liberty Life Insurance Company ("LLIC"), a Nebraska-domiciled stock life insurance company, is the subject of a proposed $2.9 billion acquisition by American Financial Holdings LLC, a Connecticut-based private equity-backed financial services investment company. LLIC operates in 38 states plus the District of Columbia with $18.2 billion in gross assets and $1.85 billion in statutory surplus as of Q3 2024.

LLIC maintains four material reinsurance relationships that transfer significant portions of mortality risk and provide statutory reserve relief:

1. **Term Life Block:** $8.5 billion face amount (90% ceded to Global Re Bermuda via coinsurance)
2. **Indexed Universal Life Block:** $3.2 billion face amount (50% ceded to Swiss Re via modified coinsurance)
3. **Group Term Life:** Large claim excess coverage (Munich Re covers amounts exceeding $250K per life up to $5M)
4. **AXXX/XXX Redundant Reserves:** $850 million redundant reserves (100% ceded to Vermont captive Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC)

### B. Regulatory Framework for Reinsurance Credit

State insurance regulators permit ceding insurers to take reserve credit for reinsurance ceded only when reinsurers meet specific financial security standards. This protection ensures the ceding insurer can fulfill policyholder obligations even if a reinsurer defaults.

**Authorized vs. Unauthorized Reinsurer Status:**

- **Authorized reinsurers:** Licensed in the ceding insurer's state of domicile, allowing full reserve credit without collateral requirements
- **Unauthorized reinsurers:** Not licensed in the ceding insurer's state, requiring collateral (letter of credit, trust fund, or funds withheld) equal to reserves ceded for the ceding insurer to take reserve credit

For LLIC (Nebraska-domiciled), this distinction determines whether reinsurers must post hundreds of millions in collateral to secure statutory reserve credit.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### PART A: REINSURANCE TREATY TYPES AND STANDARD TERMS

#### 1. Coinsurance (Global Re Term Life, Vermont Captive AXXX/XXX)

**Structure and Mechanics:**

Coinsurance represents a proportionate sharing arrangement where the ceding insurer (LLIC) transfers both premiums and statutory reserves to the reinsurer, which assumes a proportionate share of all policy obligations.¹

**Key Commercial Terms:**

- **Premium Transfer:** LLIC cedes specified percentage of gross premiums to reinsurer (e.g., 90% of term life premiums to Global Re)
- **Reserve Transfer:** LLIC cedes proportionate statutory reserves to reinsurer, taking reserve credit that reduces LLIC's balance sheet liabilities
- **Risk Transfer:** Reinsurer assumes proportionate mortality/morbidity risk, paying its percentage share of death claims
- **Ceding Commission:** Reinsurer typically pays ceding commission to LLIC (80-120% of first-year premium) to offset the ceding insurer's deferred acquisition costs ("DAC"), including sales commissions, underwriting expenses, and policy issuance costs²

**Statutory Reserve Relief Mechanics:**

When LLIC cedes 90% of term life reserves to Global Re under coinsurance:
- LLIC establishes 100% of statutory reserves when policies issued
- LLIC takes 90% reserve credit for amount ceded to Global Re
- LLIC's net statutory reserves = 10% (retained portion only)
- This reserve relief increases LLIC's statutory surplus and Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio

**Example:** $2.3 billion term life reserves ceded to Global Re
- Gross reserves if retained: $2.3B liability on LLIC's balance sheet
- Reserve credit taken: $2.3B reduction in liabilities
- Net statutory reserves: $0 (offset by reinsurance recoverables asset)
- Surplus impact: +$2.3B improvement (all else equal)

**Experience Refunds:**

Many coinsurance treaties include profit-sharing provisions. If actual mortality experience proves more favorable than pricing assumptions (fewer death claims than expected), the reinsurer refunds a percentage of profits to the ceding insurer. The Global Re treaty provides for 50% experience refunds, incentivizing LLIC to maintain high underwriting quality while sharing in favorable results.

**Recapture Provisions:**

Coinsurance treaties typically allow the ceding insurer to recapture ceded business after a specified period (commonly 10-15 years). Recapture provisions serve multiple purposes:

- Allow ceding insurer to bring profitable business back onto its own books if mortality experience favorable
- Provide reinsurer protection during early high-expense years when ceding commission and acquisition costs create losses
- Create optionality for ceding insurer to optimize capital deployment based on evolving financial position

**When LLIC exercises recapture:**
1. Reinsurance treaty terminates for recaptured policies
2. LLIC reestablishes 100% of statutory reserves on its balance sheet
3. Collateral (if any) released back to reinsurer
4. LLIC resumes paying 100% of death claims
5. LLIC retains 100% of future premiums

**Capital Impact of Recapture:**

Recapture creates significant statutory surplus pressure because reserves return to LLIC's balance sheet but collateral (if posted by unauthorized reinsurer) is released. For Global Re:

- Reserves returning to LLIC: $2.3B (estimated 90% of term life block)
- Barclays LOC collateral released: $850M
- **Net surplus reduction: $1.45B** ($2.3B reserves minus $850M collateral)

This $1.45 billion surplus reduction would severely impact LLIC's RBC ratio, as analyzed in detail in Section IV.B.3.C below.

---

#### 2. Modified Coinsurance / "Mod-Co" (Swiss Re IUL)

**Structure and Mechanics:**

Modified coinsurance represents a hybrid structure where:
- **LLIC retains investment assets** (continues managing portfolio backing ceded policies)
- **Swiss Re assumes mortality risk only** (receives mortality charges, pays death claims)
- **Experience adjustment mechanism** settles financial differences quarterly³

This structure proves particularly advantageous for indexed universal life ("IUL") products where:
- LLIC maintains expertise in indexed account crediting strategies (S&P 500 caps, floors, participation rates)
- LLIC manages complex hedging programs for indexed account options
- Swiss Re gains mortality risk exposure without needing to manage IUL-specific investment operations

**Modified Coinsurance Reserve:**

Under statutory accounting principles:
- LLIC establishes "modified coinsurance reserve" liability equal to statutory reserves for ceded policies
- LLIC simultaneously establishes offsetting asset (retained portfolio backing the policies)
- Net statutory impact: Reserve credit taken (reduces net reserves), but asset retained on balance sheet
- **Key distinction from coinsurance:** Assets remain on LLIC's balance sheet; only net mortality risk transferred

**Experience Adjustment Quarterly True-Up:**

Each quarter, LLIC and Swiss Re perform an experience adjustment calculation:

**LLIC owes Swiss Re if:** Investment income earned on retained assets > Mortality charges credited to Swiss Re under policy terms

**Swiss Re owes LLIC if:** Mortality charges credited to Swiss Re > Investment income earned on retained assets

This quarterly settlement ensures Swiss Re receives appropriate compensation for assuming mortality risk while LLIC retains investment performance risk.

**Experience Adjustment Disputes:**

The experience adjustment calculation requires agreement on multiple assumptions:
- **Interest crediting rate:** What rate should be credited to Swiss Re for investment income? If LLIC earns 5.0% on IUL assets but treaty specifies 4.5% credited to Swiss Re, LLIC retains 0.5% spread—a common source of disputes.
- **Mortality charge accuracy:** Verification that cost of insurance ("COI") deductions from policyholders match treaty assumptions
- **Expense allocations:** Whether certain investment management or administrative expenses should adjust the experience settlement
- **Indexed account crediting:** For IUL policies with S&P 500 indexed accounts, how option costs and hedging expenses impact the settlement

Standard mod-co treaties include detailed dispute resolution procedures (typically binding arbitration) due to the complexity of quarterly calculations over multi-decade policy durations.

**No Collateral Requirement (Authorized Reinsurer):**

Swiss Re maintains authorization in Nebraska (licensed in the state), qualifying as an authorized reinsurer. LLIC takes full reserve credit for the 50% of IUL reserves ceded to Swiss Re without any collateral requirement. Swiss Re's A+ rating from A.M. Best provides additional financial strength assurance.

However, if Swiss Re were downgraded below specified thresholds (commonly BBB+ or A-), Nebraska Department of Insurance ("DOI") could require Swiss Re to post collateral retroactively even for an authorized reinsurer, or require LLIC to establish additional statutory reserves as a contingency buffer.

---

#### 3. Yearly Renewable Term / "YRT" (Munich Re Group Life)

**Structure and Mechanics:**

YRT reinsurance operates as excess of retention coverage, fundamentally different from quota share arrangements (coinsurance and mod-co):

- **LLIC retains first $250K per life** (retention layer)
- **Munich Re covers excess amounts** from $250K up to $5M per life
- **Annual renewable premium** paid by LLIC to Munich Re based on covered lives, ages, and amounts at risk
- **Catastrophic protection purpose:** Smooths large claim volatility from occasional high-value death benefits⁴

**No Statutory Reserve Relief:**

YRT excess coverage does not provide statutory reserve relief because:
- LLIC retains 100% of policy obligations up to $250K per life
- LLIC establishes statutory reserves for entire group term life block
- YRT covers only excess amounts (rare claims exceeding $250K)
- **No reserve credit taken** for YRT reinsurance

YRT serves a risk management function (reducing surplus volatility from large individual claims) rather than a capital relief function.

**YRT Premium Calculation:**

Munich Re charges annual YRT premium based on:
- **Age distribution** of covered lives in group policies
- **Amount at risk** above $250K retention for each covered life
- **Mortality assumptions** applied to excess layer
- **Renewal annually** with premium adjustments as covered population ages or coverage amounts change

**Example Calculation:**

Group life block with 50,000 covered lives:
- 45,000 lives with coverage ≤$250K (no reinsurance premium; within LLIC retention)
- 4,500 lives with coverage $250K-$1M (average excess $400K; Munich Re premium ~0.15-0.25% = $600-$1,000 per life)
- 450 lives with coverage $1M-$3M (average excess $1.5M; Munich Re premium ~0.20-0.35% = $3,000-$5,250 per life)
- 50 lives with coverage $3M-$5M (average excess $3.5M; Munich Re premium ~0.25-0.40% = $8,750-$14,000 per life)

**Total estimated annual YRT premium: $5M-$8M** for catastrophic excess coverage protecting against large claim volatility.

**Retention Adequacy Analysis:**

The $250K retention level represents LLIC's assessment of the claims size it can absorb within normal operations without material surplus impact. With statutory surplus of $1.85 billion and Total Adjusted Capital ("TAC") of $1.85 billion, LLIC can readily absorb multiple $250K claims in any given year.

**Estimated annual large claims:**
- 5-10 death claims exceeding $250K per year
- Total excess losses: $2M-$5M annually (paid by Munich Re)
- LLIC retention on these large claims: $250K × 5-10 = $1.25M-$2.5M annually

**Retention adequacy:** $1.25M-$2.5M annual retention represents only 0.07-0.14% of LLIC's $1.85B surplus—well within acceptable volatility tolerance. The $250K retention appears appropriately sized.

If LLIC reduced retention to $150K-$200K, YRT premium would increase significantly (Munich Re covering more of each large claim), and the incremental premium cost would exceed the value of reduced volatility on the additional $50K-$100K layer.

**Munich Re Credit Risk:**

- **A+ rating** from A.M. Best (strong financial strength)
- **Authorized reinsurer** in Nebraska (no collateral required)
- **Low absolute exposure:** Even if Munich Re defaulted, exposure limited to rare large claims exceeding $250K (5-10 claims per year = $2M-$5M annual exposure)
- **Operational risk:** LLIC could replace YRT coverage with alternative reinsurer within 30-60 days if Munich Re encountered financial difficulties

**Change of Control Provisions:**

YRT treaties traditionally include fewer restrictive change of control provisions than quota share coinsurance arrangements because:
- No reserve credit at stake (termination doesn't impact LLIC's statutory reserves)
- Annual renewable nature (either party can terminate on 90-180 days' notice)
- Limited capital impact (no recapture of reserves)

However, LLIC should review the Munich Re YRT treaty to confirm whether Munich Re consent is required for the American Financial Holdings acquisition. If consent required, Munich Re would likely grant consent given the limited financial impact and LLIC's continued operations.

#### 4. NAIC Model Law on Credit for Reinsurance

**Statutory Framework:**

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") developed the Model Law on Credit for Reinsurance to establish uniform standards across states for when ceding insurers may take statutory reserve credit for reinsurance.⁵ Nebraska has adopted substantially similar provisions in its insurance code governing reinsurance credit.⁶

**Core Principle:**

A ceding insurer may take reserve credit (reducing its statutory liabilities) for reinsurance ceded only if the reinsurer provides adequate security to protect policyholders. This ensures that if a reinsurer defaults, the ceding insurer has sufficient assets or guarantees to continue paying policyholder claims.

**Authorized Reinsurer Status — Full Credit Without Collateral:**

Reinsurers meeting any of the following criteria qualify for "authorized" status, allowing ceding insurers to take full reserve credit without collateral:

1. **Licensed in ceding insurer's state:** Reinsurer holds certificate of authority in the ceding insurer's state of domicile (e.g., Swiss Re and Munich Re licensed in Nebraska)

2. **Accredited reinsurer:** Reinsurer licensed in another U.S. state, meets minimum capital/surplus requirements, and submits to domiciliary state jurisdiction

3. **Certified reinsurer:** Foreign (alien) reinsurers not licensed in U.S. but certified by NAIC-participating states based on jurisdiction evaluation (commonly Bermuda, UK, Switzerland, Germany, Japan qualifications)

4. **Reciprocal jurisdiction:** Reinsurer domiciled in qualified jurisdiction with substantially equivalent regulatory standards (recent NAIC initiative for EU Solvency II jurisdictions)

**Unauthorized Reinsurer — Collateral Required:**

Reinsurers not meeting authorized status criteria are "unauthorized" reinsurers. Ceding insurers may still take reserve credit for reinsurance ceded to unauthorized reinsurers, but **only to the extent of collateral posted by the reinsurer.**⁷

**Acceptable Collateral Forms:**

**1. Letter of Credit ("LOC"):**
- Issued by a qualified financial institution (typically U.S. bank or foreign bank branch with U.S. presence)
- Bank must maintain minimum credit rating (commonly A- or better from S&P/Moody's/Fitch)
- Irrevocable and unconditional commitment
- "Clean" LOC (beneficiary can draw upon certification of amount due without proving reinsurer default)
- Beneficiary: Ceding insurer (LLIC) or its statutory successor (e.g., state insurance commissioner if LLIC enters receivership)
- Term: Typically annual with evergreen automatic renewal provisions, or multi-year with mandatory renewal 60-90 days before expiration
- Amount: Equal to statutory reserves ceded, adjusted annually as reserves change

**Example:** Global Re Bermuda (unauthorized in Nebraska) posts $850M LOC from Barclays Bank to secure LLIC's reserve credit for $850M estimated reserves ceded.

**2. Trust Fund:**
- Reinsurer deposits assets in trust for benefit of ceding insurer
- Trustee: Independent qualified financial institution
- Trust assets: Typically high-quality securities (U.S. Treasury securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, cash)
- Withdrawals: Ceding insurer may withdraw trust assets to pay claims if reinsurer fails to perform
- Trust agreement: Specifies permissible investments, withdrawal procedures, valuation frequency
- Amount: Equal to statutory reserves ceded plus often a surplus margin (5-10% additional cushion)

**3. Funds Withheld:**
- Ceding insurer retains premiums otherwise payable to reinsurer
- Establishes "funds withheld" liability account on ceding insurer's balance sheet
- Reinsurer's share of premiums accumulated in funds withheld account
- Investment income credited to reinsurer's account
- Claims paid from funds withheld account
- If funds withheld exceed reserves ceded, excess paid to reinsurer; if insufficient, reinsurer must remit additional collateral

Funds withheld arrangements are common for affiliated reinsurance (captive reinsurance) but less common for third-party commercial reinsurance due to reinsurers' preference to receive cash premiums and invest them directly.

**Collateral Adjustment Mechanisms:**

Statutory reserves change over time as:
- Policies mature and reserves increase (term life policies in later years)
- Policies lapse and reserves decrease
- New policies added to reinsurance treaty
- Mortality experience differs from assumptions

Reinsurance collateral must adjust correspondingly. Standard LOC and trust fund arrangements include **annual adjustment provisions:**

- Within 60-90 days after year-end, ceding insurer certifies required collateral amount based on year-end statutory reserves
- If reserves increased, reinsurer increases LOC amount or deposits additional trust assets
- If reserves decreased, excess collateral released back to reinsurer
- Failure to adjust collateral upward when required = statutory reserve credit reduced proportionately (ceding insurer cannot take credit exceeding collateral posted)

**Example:** Global Re Barclays LOC
- 2024 year-end: $850M LOC (covering estimated $2.3B reserves ceded × 37% collateral ratio based on treaty terms)
- 2025: New term life policies added, reserves increase to $2.5B ceded
- Required LOC increase: $850M × ($2.5B / $2.3B) = $924M
- Barclays must amend LOC to $924M by March 31, 2025, or LLIC's reserve credit limited to $850M ÷ 37% = $2.3B (cannot take credit for incremental $200M reserves)

**Collateral Cost to Reinsurer:**

LOC fees represent a significant cost for unauthorized reinsurers:
- **Annual LOC fee:** 0.50-1.00% of LOC face amount (varies based on reinsurer credit rating and LOC issuer bank pricing)
- **For $850M LOC:** $4.25M-$8.5M annual fee expense
- **Over 10-year term:** $42.5M-$85M cumulative cost

This LOC cost effectively increases the reinsurer's expense ratio, reducing profitability on the reinsurance treaty. Unauthorized reinsurers must price this collateral cost into premium rates charged to ceding insurers, making unauthorized reinsurance more expensive than authorized reinsurance (all else equal).

**Bank Credit Risk — LOC Issuer Ratings:**

The ceding insurer faces credit risk not only on the reinsurer but also on the LOC issuing bank. If the bank's credit rating declines below regulatory minimums, state insurance departments may:

- Require replacement LOC from higher-rated bank within 30-60 days
- Disallow reserve credit if replacement LOC not obtained
- Require ceding insurer to establish additional statutory reserves (eliminating reserve credit benefit)

For Global Re's $850M Barclays LOC:
- **Current Barclays rating:** A+ (S&P) — acceptable under Nebraska standards
- **Minimum acceptable rating:** Typically A- or better
- **Downgrade risk:** If Barclays downgraded to BBB+ or below, Nebraska DOI would likely require Global Re to obtain replacement LOC from higher-rated institution (e.g., JPMorgan A+, Bank of America A, Wells Fargo A+) within 60 days

**Failure to replace LOC within required timeframe:**
- Reserve credit disallowed immediately upon expiration of grace period
- LLIC must reestablish full statutory reserves on balance sheet
- Surplus reduction = reserves ceded minus collateral previously posted
- **For Global Re example:** $2.3B reserves reestablished, but only $850M LOC remains as recoverable asset = $1.45B surplus reduction
- RBC ratio impact analyzed in Section IV.B.3.C below

**State-Specific Variations:**

While most states have adopted the NAIC Model Law substantially, variations exist:

- **New York:** More stringent requirements, historically requiring 100% trust fund collateral (full reserves ceded) for unauthorized reinsurers; recent amendments allow certified reinsurers with reduced collateral for highly-rated reinsurers
- **California:** Detailed regulations on trust fund permissible investments and valuation procedures
- **Texas:** Specific provisions for reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurers (Lloyd's of London, Bermuda commercial reinsurers)
- **Florida:** Enhanced collateral requirements for hurricane catastrophe reinsurance

For LLIC (Nebraska-domiciled), Nebraska Insurance Code provisions govern. LLIC must comply with Nebraska's authorized/unauthorized reinsurer standards and collateral requirements. However, for policies issued in other states, those states' insurance departments may conduct examinations and question reserve credit taken if collateral arrangements do not meet the examining state's standards, even if they satisfy Nebraska requirements.

### PART B: FOUR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS — DETAILED ANALYSIS

#### 1. Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda) — Term Life Coinsurance Treaty

##### A. Treaty Terms and Structure

**Coverage Scope:**
- **Product line:** 90% quota share coinsurance on new issue term life insurance
- **Products covered:** 20-year level term and 30-year level term policies
- **Issue years:** 2020-2024 (five-year production period)
- **In-force face amount ceded:** $8.5 billion (LLIC retains 10% = $850M net retention, Global Re assumes 90% = $7.65B)

**Reserves Ceded:**
- **Estimated statutory reserves ceded:** $2.3 billion
  - Calculation basis: LLIC's total term life statutory reserves ~$2.55B × 90% quota share = ~$2.3B ceded to Global Re
  - These reserves represent Commissioner's Reserve Valuation Method ("CRVM") statutory reserves for level premium term life policies
  - Reserves increase each policy year as policies age (level premium design means premiums exceed mortality costs in early years, creating reserve buildup)

**Ceding Commission:**
- **Rate:** 85% of first-year premiums ceded
- **Purpose:** Offsets LLIC's deferred acquisition costs ("DAC")
  - Agent sales commissions: 100-120% of first-year premium (industry standard for term life)
  - Underwriting expenses: Medical exams, inspection reports, underwriting salaries
  - Policy issuance costs: Systems, printing, administrative setup
- **Economic effect:** Global Re finances LLIC's acquisition costs upfront; LLIC receives cash flow to pay agent commissions when policies issued

**Example Calculation:**
- New term life policy: $1,000 annual premium (level for 20 years)
- LLIC cedes 90% to Global Re: $900 first-year premium ceded
- Global Re pays ceding commission: $900 × 85% = $765
- LLIC total first-year cash flow: $100 retained premium + $765 ceding commission = $865
- LLIC pays agent commission: $1,000 × 110% = $1,100
- **LLIC net first-year cash outlay:** $235 per policy (acquisition cost financing benefit)

**Experience Refunds:**
- **Profit-sharing formula:** If actual mortality experience favorable (death claims < expected claims priced into reinsurance premium), Global Re refunds 50% of underwriting profit to LLIC
- **Calculation frequency:** Typically annual, based on treaty year results
- **Purpose:** Aligns LLIC's and Global Re's interests in maintaining high underwriting quality and anti-selection controls
- **Example:** Treaty year mortality ratio 45% (claims ÷ premiums) vs. expected 60% = 15% profit margin × 50% = 7.5% of premiums refunded to LLIC

**Experience refunds incentivize LLIC to:**
- Maintain rigorous underwriting standards (medical exams, paramedical screening, inspection reports)
- Implement effective anti-selection controls (contestability period investigations, fraud detection)
- Manage policy administration carefully (timely premium collection, lapse prevention for profitable policies)

##### B. Collateral Arrangement — $850M Barclays LOC

**Unauthorized Reinsurer Status:**

Global Reassurance Ltd. operates as a Bermuda-domiciled commercial reinsurer, not licensed in Nebraska. Under Nebraska Insurance Code provisions implementing the NAIC Model Law on Credit for Reinsurance, Global Re qualifies as an **unauthorized reinsurer** because it lacks a Nebraska certificate of authority.⁸

Consequently, LLIC may take statutory reserve credit for reserves ceded to Global Re only to the extent Global Re posts qualifying collateral.

**Letter of Credit Structure:**

- **Issuing bank:** Barclays Bank PLC (or Barclays Bank Delaware branch)
- **Beneficiary:** Liberty Life Insurance Company (LLIC)
- **Face amount:** $850 million
- **Type:** Irrevocable, unconditional, clean letter of credit
- **Governing law:** New York UCC Article 5 (Letters of Credit) or Delaware UCC Article 5
- **Term:** Likely annual with evergreen automatic renewal provisions (standard industry practice)

**"Clean" LOC Drawing Procedures:**

Barclays LOC likely permits LLIC to draw funds upon:
1. LLIC's certification that Global Re has failed to pay reinsurance recoverables when due, or
2. LLIC's certification of an amount due under the reinsurance treaty following notice to Global Re

"Clean" status means LLIC need not prove Global Re's default or insolvency—merely certify the amount due and present conforming documentation to Barclays. This streamlined drawing procedure ensures LLIC can access collateral quickly to pay policyholder claims if Global Re fails to perform.

**Why $850M LOC for $2.3B Reserves Ceded?**

The LOC amount ($850M) represents approximately 37% of estimated reserves ceded ($2.3B). This partial collateral arrangement likely reflects:

1. **Global Re credit quality:** A- rated by A.M. Best (adequate financial strength rating)
2. **Negotiated collateral percentage:** Treaty terms negotiated 80-90 cents collateral per dollar of reserves based on Global Re's credit rating and LLIC's risk tolerance
3. **Nebraska DOI acceptance:** Nebraska's insurance department accepted this collateral arrangement as adequate to permit LLIC's reserve credit
4. **Reserve credit calculation:** LLIC takes reserve credit for (a) collateral posted ($850M) plus (b) uncollateralized amount based on Global Re's authorized percentage under Nebraska regulations

**Alternative explanation:** The $850M may represent:
- **Funds withheld account** balance rather than LOC face amount, or
- **Modified coinsurance reserve** structure with $850M collateral requirement, or
- **Graduated collateral schedule** where initial years require lower collateral, increasing over time as reserves grow

**[METHODOLOGY: Standard industry treaty terms applied based on assignment description; actual treaty document review from data room required to confirm precise collateral calculation methodology and reserve credit formulae]**

**Annual Adjustment Mechanism:**

Standard LOC provisions require annual adjustment:
- **Determination date:** Within 60-90 days after each year-end (by March 31 for December 31 year-end)
- **LLIC certification:** Certifies statutory reserves ceded to Global Re as of year-end based on Annual Statement Schedule S (Reinsurance)
- **Adjustment calculation:** Required LOC amount = reserves ceded × collateral percentage
- **If reserves increased:** Global Re requests Barclays increase LOC face amount (Barclays amendment fee typically 0.10-0.25% of increase)
- **If reserves decreased:** Excess collateral released; Barclays reduces LOC face amount

**Failure to adjust upward when required:**
- Nebraska DOI quarterly/annual examination identifies insufficiency
- LLIC's reserve credit limited to collateral actually posted
- LLIC must establish additional statutory reserves for uncollateralized amount
- Surplus reduction = uncollateralized reserves
- RBC ratio declines proportionately

**Barclays Bank Credit Risk:**

- **Current Barclays rating:** A+ (S&P), Aa3 (Moody's) — strong investment grade
- **Minimum acceptable rating (Nebraska):** Typically A- or equivalent
- **Rating downgrade scenario:** If Barclays downgraded to BBB+ or below:
  - Nebraska DOI would require Global Re obtain replacement LOC from higher-rated bank within 60-90 days
  - If Global Re cannot obtain replacement LOC (due to Global Re's own credit deterioration or LOC market conditions), Nebraska DOI would disallow reserve credit
  - LLIC would suffer immediate $1.45B surplus reduction (reestablish $2.3B reserves, retain $850M LOC as recoverable asset until drawn or replaced)

**Barclays downgrade risk assessment:** LOW
- Major global systemically important financial institution ("G-SIB")
- Strong capital ratios under Basel III
- UK Prudential Regulation Authority oversight
- Historical rating stability (maintained A+ or equivalent through 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic)

However, replacement LOC provisions should be reviewed in data room to confirm Global Re's obligations and timeframes if Barclays downgrade occurs.

**LOC Cost to Global Re:**

- **Estimated annual LOC fee:** 0.50-0.75% of $850M face amount = $4.25M-$6.375M per year
- **Over 10-year treaty term:** $42.5M-$63.75M cumulative LOC fees
- **Economic impact on Global Re:** LOC fees reduce profitability; Global Re must price this cost into reinsurance premiums charged to LLIC

##### C. Recapture Provisions — 2030 First Cohort Eligibility

**Recapture Right:**

The Global Re treaty permits LLIC to recapture ceded policies after **10 years** from original policy issue date. This industry-standard recapture provision creates significant optionality for LLIC:

- **2020 policy issues:** Eligible for recapture beginning 2030
- **2021 policy issues:** Eligible for recapture beginning 2031
- **2022 policy issues:** Eligible for recapture beginning 2032
- **2023 policy issues:** Eligible for recapture beginning 2033
- **2024 policy issues:** Eligible for recapture beginning 2034

**Recapture Decision Factors:**

LLIC's decision whether to recapture involves multiple strategic considerations:

**1. Mortality Experience:**

*Favorable experience (actual mortality < expected):*
- Policies highly profitable
- Death claims lower than premiums less expenses = underwriting profit
- **LLIC incentive to recapture:** Bring profitable business back onto LLIC's books; stop sharing profits with Global Re (even with 50% experience refunds, LLIC forgoes 50% of profits to Global Re)
- **Economic value of recapture:** Present value of future profits on recaptured block minus recapture transition costs

*Unfavorable experience (actual mortality > expected):*
- Policies unprofitable or marginally profitable
- Death claims exceed premiums less expenses = underwriting losses
- **LLIC incentive NOT to recapture:** Leave unprofitable business with Global Re; let reinsurer absorb ongoing losses
- **Economic value of non-recapture:** Avoid losses; maintain capital for more profitable uses

**Industry context:** Term life insurance issued 2020-2024 reflects post-pandemic underwriting (2020-2021 included COVID-19 impacts on mortality assumptions). If actual mortality proves significantly better than pandemic-era pricing assumptions, the 2020-2024 term life block could be substantially profitable by 2030, creating strong recapture incentives.

**2. Capital Capacity:**

Recapture requires LLIC to reestablish statutory reserves on its balance sheet:

- **Reserves returning:** $2.3B (estimated for full block; proportionate if partial recapture)
- **Barclays LOC released:** $850M (collateral returns to Global Re upon recapture)
- **Net surplus reduction:** $1.45B

**RBC Ratio Impact Calculation:**

*Current LLIC position (2024):*
- Total Adjusted Capital ("TAC"): $1.85B
- Authorized Control Level ("ACL"): $982M
- RBC ratio: 188% ($1.85B ÷ $982M)

*Post-recapture scenario (2030 assuming no other changes):*
- TAC after recapture: $1.85B - $1.45B = $400M
- ACL (assumed constant): $982M
- **RBC ratio post-recapture: 41%** ($400M ÷ $982M)

This calculation demonstrates LLIC cannot recapture the Global Re term life block in 2030 without significant capital injection to absorb the $1.45B surplus reduction.

**More realistic 2030 scenario assumptions:**
- LLIC completes $150M capital injection Q1 2025 (per RBC Plan)
- TAC increases to $2.0B post-injection
- Earnings 2025-2030 add $500M-$750M to surplus (annual statutory net income $185M × 5 years, minus dividends to American Financial Holdings post-acquisition)
- 2030 pre-recapture TAC: $2.5B-$2.75B
- 2030 pre-recapture RBC ratio: ~210-230% (assuming ACL grows modestly to $1.2B with asset growth)

*2030 post-recapture scenario:*
- TAC after recapture: $2.5B - $1.45B = $1.05B
- ACL: $1.2B
- **RBC ratio post-recapture: 88%** ($1.05B ÷ $1.2B)

**88% RBC ratio = Below 100% Authorized Control Level ("ACL") threshold**
- Triggers mandatory regulatory control provisions
- State insurance commissioner authorized to rehabilitate or liquidate insurer
- **Seizure risk = deal-blocking for American Financial Holdings' investment**

**Capital Required for Recapture:**

To maintain RBC ratio ≥200% after recapture:
- Target TAC post-recapture: $2.4B (for ACL $1.2B, achieving 200% ratio)
- TAC before recapture: $2.5B (2030 projection)
- TAC after recapture before capital injection: $1.05B
- **Required capital injection: $1.35B-$1.50B**

Alternatively, LLIC could maintain higher RBC ratio before recapture (240-250% = $2.88B-$3.0B TAC) to absorb the $1.45B surplus reduction and end at 200-210% RBC ratio post-recapture.

**Recapture Mitigation Strategies:**

If LLIC desires to recapture term life business in 2030 but lacks capital capacity:

1. **Partial recapture:** Recapture only most profitable cohorts (e.g., youngest issue ages, best underwriting classes), leaving less profitable business with Global Re
   - Reduces capital requirement proportionately
   - Maintains ongoing reinsurance relationship for remaining block

2. **Retrocessional reinsurance:** Recapture from Global Re, immediately cede to new reinsurer under more favorable terms (higher retention, lower ceding commission, improved profit-sharing)
   - Maintains reserve relief through new reinsurance
   - Captures value difference between old treaty (Global Re expensive terms negotiated 2020) and new treaty (more competitive 2030 terms)

3. **Capital raise before recapture:** American Financial Holdings injects $1.5B-$2.0B additional capital into LLIC during 2029-2030 in anticipation of recapture
   - Requires parent company liquidity or debt financing capacity
   - Provides buffer for RBC ratio >200% post-recapture

4. **Negotiate recapture settlement:** Rather than full recapture, negotiate with Global Re for:
   - Recapture fee reduction (standard recapture fees = portion of future profits paid to reinsurer)
   - Partial LOC retention (Global Re continues to post $400M-$500M LOC as transitional security)
   - Experience account settlement (true-up experience refunds owed through recapture date)

**3. Strategic Considerations:**

*American Financial Holdings' post-acquisition strategy:*
- **Growth orientation:** If American Financial Holdings plans to grow LLIC's term life production significantly, recapturing profitable in-force business aligns with growth strategy (larger retained book generates higher premium income and statutory earnings)
- **Capital optimization:** If American Financial Holdings prioritizes capital efficiency, leaving business with Global Re may be optimal (avoids $1.5B capital injection; deploys capital elsewhere in portfolio)
- **Reinsurance cost:** If Global Re's reinsurance pricing is expensive relative to 2030 market rates (LOC costs increased, mortality assumptions prove overly conservative), recapture followed by retrocession to cheaper reinsurer creates value

*Rating agency implications:*
- A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's evaluate insurers' reinsurance strategies
- Large recapture transactions scrutinized for capital adequacy and operational risk (can LLIC administer recaptured block effectively?)
- If recapture causes RBC ratio to decline materially, rating agencies may downgrade LLIC's financial strength rating (currently estimated A- range), impacting competitive position and new sales

##### D. Global Re Credit Risk

**A.M. Best Rating: A- (Adequate)**

Global Re's A- rating from A.M. Best represents the fourth-highest rating category:

- **A++ / A+ (Superior):** Strongest financial strength
- **A / A- (Excellent to Adequate):** Strong capacity to meet obligations
- **B++ / B+ (Good to Adequate):** Adequate capacity under normal conditions; may be vulnerable to adverse conditions
- **Below B+:** Vulnerable or under regulatory supervision

**A- rating interpretation:**
- Adequate financial strength to meet reinsurance obligations
- Balance sheet strength sufficient for current risk exposures
- **Not top-tier:** Higher credit risk than A+ or A reinsurers (Swiss Re A+, Munich Re A++)
- **Pricing differential:** A- reinsurers typically charge 25-50 basis points lower premiums than A+ reinsurers to compensate for higher credit risk

**Downgrade Risk Scenarios:**

*Scenario 1: Global Re downgrade to BBB+ or lower*

If Global Re's A.M. Best rating declines to BBB+ or below:
- Nebraska DOI may require additional collateral (increase LOC from $850M to $1.0B-$1.2B to cover higher percentage of $2.3B reserves ceded)
- If Global Re cannot post additional collateral (due to its own financial constraints or LOC issuer unwillingness), Nebraska DOI may disallow partial reserve credit
- LLIC's statutory reserves increase proportionately, reducing surplus and RBC ratio

*Scenario 2: Global Re becomes insolvent*

If Global Re enters insolvency proceedings (Bermuda Monetary Authority places in run-off or liquidation):
- LLIC immediately draws on $850M Barclays LOC to secure reinsurance recoverables
- LLIC files claims in Global Re insolvency proceeding for uncollateralized recoverables (estimated $1.45B additional claim = $2.3B reserves minus $850M LOC)
- LLIC must reestablish statutory reserves for policies ceded to Global Re
- LLIC becomes direct obligor to policyholders for 100% of death claims (no longer has reinsurance protection)

**Global Re insolvency surplus impact:**
- Immediate: $850M LOC drawn (asset on LLIC balance sheet)
- Reserves reestablished: $2.3B liability
- Net immediate surplus reduction: $1.45B
- Future recoveries: If Global Re liquidation produces recoveries to creditors (30-60 cents on dollar typical for reinsurance insolvencies), LLIC may recover portion of $1.45B uncollateralized claim over 3-7 years
- **Present value of expected recoveries:** $400M-$800M (assuming 40-60% recovery discounted at 5-7%)
- **Net lifetime surplus impact:** $650M-$1.05B loss

**Global Re insolvency probability assessment:** LOW (5-10% over 10-year period)

Despite A- rating (not top-tier), Global Re insolvency remains unlikely:
- Bermuda reinsurers operate under robust prudential framework (Bermuda Monetary Authority supervision, Solvency II-equivalent capital requirements)
- Global Re has operated continuously since [establishment year not provided—typical Bermuda commercial reinsurer has 20-40 year history]
- Commercial reinsurance sector well-capitalized post-2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic
- No current indicators of Global Re financial distress available in public ratings reports

However, A- rating indicates elevated risk relative to A+ reinsurers. LLIC's $1.45B uncollateralized exposure represents material credit risk that should be monitored through:
- Quarterly A.M. Best rating reviews
- Annual Global Re financial statement analysis (Bermuda statutory filings public via Bermuda Monetary Authority)
- Reinsurance intermediary reports (if treaty placed through broker, broker provides credit monitoring)

**Comparison to Vermont Captive Risk:**

Global Re credit risk ($1.45B uncollateralized) is comparable in magnitude to Vermont captive parental guarantee risk ($730M uncollateralized). Both represent significant counterparty credit exposures requiring:
- Ongoing monitoring
- Contingency planning for credit deterioration scenarios
- Potential risk mitigation (additional collateral, retrocession, captial buffers)

##### E. Change of Control Consent Provisions

**Standard Reinsurance Treaty Language:**

Industry-standard reinsurance treaties include assignment/change of control provisions similar to:

> **"Assignment and Change of Control:** This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either party without the prior written consent of the other party. Any change in the ownership or control of the Ceding Insurer shall be deemed an assignment requiring the Reinsurer's consent. For purposes of this provision, 'change of control' means (i) the acquisition by any person or group of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the Ceding Insurer's voting securities, (ii) a merger or consolidation resulting in the Ceding Insurer's shareholders owning less than 50% of the surviving entity, or (iii) a sale of all or substantially all of the Ceding Insurer's assets or insurance business."

**[METHODOLOGY: Standard industry treaty terms; actual Global Re treaty language review required from data room to confirm precise change of control definition and consent procedures]**

**Application to American Financial Holdings Acquisition:**

The proposed acquisition transaction:
- American Financial Holdings LLC acquires 100% of LLIC stock (assumed structure; assignment indicates stock purchase but parent/subsidiary structure uncertain)
- Constitutes "change of control" under typical reinsurance treaty definitions
- **Triggers requirement to obtain Global Re's consent before closing**

**Consent Procedures (Typical):**

1. **Notice:** LLIC provides written notice to Global Re of proposed change of control, including:
   - Acquiring entity identity and background (American Financial Holdings LLC)
   - Transaction structure and terms
   - American Financial Holdings' financial statements and credit information
   - Representations regarding American Financial Holdings' intention to continue LLIC operations and maintain reinsurance treaty

2. **Global Re evaluation (30-60 days):**
   - Review American Financial Holdings' financial strength
   - Assess whether change of control impacts LLIC's claims-paying ability or reinsurance risk
   - Evaluate American Financial Holdings' reputation and regulatory compliance history
   - Determine whether to grant consent, withhold consent, or condition consent on treaty amendments

3. **Consent decision:**
   - **Grant consent (most common outcome):** Global Re consents to change of control; treaty continues on existing terms
   - **Conditional consent:** Global Re consents subject to conditions (e.g., increased collateral, parent guarantee from American Financial Holdings, premium rate adjustment, reduced ceding commission)
   - **Withhold consent (rare):** Global Re refuses consent; treaty terminates upon change of control

**Global Re Consent Probability Assessment: 90-95%**

Global Re likely grants consent to American Financial Holdings acquisition because:

**1. Treaty remains profitable for Global Re:**
- Term life reinsurance economically viable (Global Re priced transaction to be profitable over full policy term)
- 10-year recapture provision protects Global Re's investment (cannot be recaptured until 2030+)
- LOC collateral protects LLIC (reduces credit risk to Global Re if LLIC's financial condition deteriorates post-acquisition)

**2. American Financial Holdings appears financially strong:**
- $2.9B purchase price indicates substantial capital resources
- Private equity-backed financial services investment company suggests professional management and industry expertise
- Commitment to $150M capital injection (per RBC Plan) demonstrates willingness to support LLIC's financial strength

**3. LLIC operations continue:**
- Acquisition is stock purchase (not asset sale or wind-down)
- American Financial Holdings presumably intends to continue LLIC as going concern
- No indication of material operational changes impacting reinsurance risk

**4. Withholding consent rarely serves reinsurer interests:**
- If Global Re withholds consent, treaty terminates
- Global Re loses profitable ongoing reinsurance relationship
- Global Re must return $850M LOC collateral to Barclays (foregoes LOC fees that benefit Barclays relationship)
- Global Re has limited leverage to negotiate better terms (treaty already in force with established pricing)

**Consent Withholding Risk Factors:**

Circumstances where Global Re might withhold consent or demand conditions:

**1. American Financial Holdings financial concerns:**
- If American Financial Holdings heavily leveraged with weak credit profile
- If American Financial Holdings has history of insurance company failures or regulatory problems
- If American Financial Holdings lacks insurance industry experience, raising operational risk concerns

**2. Regulatory concerns:**
- If Nebraska DOI expresses concerns about acquisition (delays approval, imposes conditions)
- If American Financial Holdings subject to adverse regulatory actions in other jurisdictions

**3. Strategic conflicts:**
- If American Financial Holdings owns competing reinsurance operations creating conflicts
- If American Financial Holdings plans to restructure LLIC's reinsurance program (replace Global Re treaty with affiliated reinsurer)

**4. Market conditions:**
- If reinsurance market pricing has increased substantially since 2020 treaty inception, Global Re may seek opportunity to reprice (demand higher premiums or reduced ceding commission as condition of consent)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

To minimize consent withholding risk:

1. **Early notification:** Provide Global Re with acquisition notice as soon as definitive agreement signed (before public announcement if possible)

2. **Information transparency:** Supply comprehensive information about American Financial Holdings:
   - Audited financial statements
   - Business plan for LLIC post-acquisition
   - Confirmation of ongoing operations
   - Commitment to honor existing reinsurance treaties

3. **Personal engagement:** Senior executives from American Financial Holdings and LLIC meet with Global Re relationship managers to build confidence in transaction

4. **Negotiate consent conditions preemptively:** If Global Re expresses any concerns, proactively offer reasonable conditions (e.g., maintain RBC ratio >200%, provide quarterly financial reporting to Global Re, parent guarantee from American Financial Holdings for additional security)

**If Global Re Withholds Consent — Deal-Blocking Analysis:**

*Worst-case scenario:* Global Re refuses consent; treaty terminates upon change of control

**Immediate consequences:**
- LLIC must recapture $8.5B term life block immediately (cannot wait for 2030 recapture eligibility)
- $2.3B reserves return to LLIC's balance sheet
- $850M Barclays LOC released (collateral no longer needed if treaty terminated)
- **$1.45B surplus reduction** (identical impact to voluntary recapture scenario)
- RBC ratio plummets from 188% (current) or 204% (post-$150M injection) to well below 100% ACL

**RBC calculation if treaty terminates immediately:**
- Current TAC $1.85B (or $2.0B post-injection)
- Surplus reduction $1.45B
- Post-termination TAC: $400M-$550M
- ACL: $982M
- **RBC ratio: 41-56%** (well below 70% Mandatory Control Level)

**Nebraska DOI would immediately seize LLIC (under 70% MCL threshold triggers mandatory receivership)**

**Deal-blocking conclusion:** Global Re consent withholding is effectively a deal-breaker. American Financial Holdings cannot proceed with acquisition if Global Re refuses consent, unless American Financial Holdings commits to immediate $1.5B-$2.0B capital injection concurrent with closing to offset treaty termination impact.

**Replacement reinsurance option:**

If Global Re withholds consent, alternative mitigation:
- Negotiate with replacement reinsurer (Swiss Re, Munich Re, RGA, Hannover Re) to assume Global Re treaty via novation
- Replacement reinsurer issues new treaty covering identical terms
- LLIC maintains reserve relief (no surplus impact)
- **Timeline challenge:** Negotiating replacement reinsurance typically requires 90-180 days (underwriting review, pricing, documentation)
- **Pricing risk:** Replacement reinsurer may demand less favorable terms than existing Global Re treaty (higher premiums, lower ceding commission, more collateral)

**Pre-closing due diligence priority: Obtain Global Re consent in writing before closing**

Include as condition precedent to American Financial Holdings' obligation to close:
- Global Re delivers executed consent to change of control
- Consent unconditional (or conditions acceptable to American Financial Holdings)
- Consent delivered at least 10 business days before scheduled closing date (time to address any issues)
