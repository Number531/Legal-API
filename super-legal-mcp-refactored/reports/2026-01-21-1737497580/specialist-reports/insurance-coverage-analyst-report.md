## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Claims-Made vs. Occurrence Coverage Basis

#### 1. Claims-Made Policy Structure

E&O policies for financial services professionals are issued on a **claims-made basis**, which differs fundamentally from occurrence-based coverage:

**Claims-Made Coverage:** Covers claims **made** during the policy period, regardless of when the alleged wrongful act occurred (subject to retroactive date limitations). An active policy must be in force when the claim is reported.¹

**Occurrence Coverage:** Covers wrongful acts that **occur** during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is made or filed—even if the policy has expired by time of reporting.²

**Why Claims-Made is Standard for E&O:** Claims-made forms are the preferred format for errors & omissions and professional liability policies because they provide current policy limits for current claims and allow insurers to more accurately assess expenses when providing renewal quotes since all claims under a given policy are known by expiration.³

#### 2. Policy Period and Continuous Coverage

**Critical Coverage Issue:** The Chubb E&O policy must have been continuously in force during the relevant periods:
- **IUL Sales (Wrongful Acts):** 2015-2020 (when allegedly misleading illustrations were provided)
- **Thompson Class Action Filed:** August 2023 (claim made date)
- **FINRA Arbitrations Filed:** 2023-2024
- **Variable Annuity Sales (Wrongful Acts):** 2020-2022

**Coverage Verification Required:** Confirm that:
- LLIC maintained continuous E&O coverage from 2015 through present with no gaps
- Policy renewed annually without lapse
- Retroactive date covers wrongful acts back to at least 2015
- Thompson class action was reported to Chubb promptly after filing (August 2023)
- FINRA arbitrations were reported timely

**Late Notice Risk:** E&O policies require prompt notice of claims. If LLIC failed to notify Chubb timely when Thompson filed (August 2023) or when FINRA arbitrations were filed (2023-2024), Chubb may assert late notice as coverage defense, though insurer typically must show prejudice from late notice.⁴

#### 3. Extended Reporting Period (Tail Coverage)

If the Chubb policy is cancelled or not renewed, LLIC would need **Extended Reporting Period (ERP)** or "tail coverage" to report claims discovered after policy termination:

**Tail Coverage Function:** Extends time to report claims after policy ends, but only for wrongful acts that occurred during the policy period (not new acts after termination).⁵

**Duration Options:**
- Short-term: 12 months
- Long-term: 3-5 years
- Unlimited: Indefinite reporting period⁶

**Cost:** Typically 100-300% of annual premium, often 150-350%.⁷

**Current Status:** Assume Chubb policy remains in force; tail coverage becomes relevant only if LLIC does not renew post-acquisition by American Financial Holdings.

---

### B. Self-Insured Retention (SIR) vs. Deductible Mechanics

#### 1. Fundamental Distinction: SIR vs. Deductible

The $5 million self-insured retention operates differently than a deductible:

**Self-Insured Retention (SIR):**
- LLIC retains first $5M of each claim or related claims
- LLIC pays **all costs** within SIR, including **defense costs and indemnity**
- Insurer (Chubb) has **no obligation to defend or indemnify** until SIR exhausted⁸
- LLIC controls defense, selects defense counsel, manages claim within SIR⁹
- SIR does **not erode** policy limits (separate from $50M limit)¹⁰

**Deductible (by contrast):**
- Insurer pays defense and indemnity costs on insured's behalf
- Insurer then seeks **reimbursement** of deductible amount from insured
- Insurer owes **immediate duty to defend** even for claims subject to deductible¹¹
- Insurer controls defense and claims management
- Deductible typically **erodes** limit of liability¹²

#### 2. Application to Thompson Class Action

**Settlement Range:** $25M - $45M

**Coverage Analysis:**

| Settlement Amount | SIR (LLIC Retains) | Excess Coverage (Chubb Pays) | LLIC Net Cost |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| $25M | $5M | $20M | $5M |
| $35M | $5M | $30M | $5M |
| $45M | $5M | $40M | $5M |

**Defense Costs ($2.5M Incurred to Date):**
- Within $5M SIR, LLIC has paid defense costs out-of-pocket
- Critical question: Are defense costs **inside limits** (eroding) or **outside limits** (supplementary)?

#### 3. Defense Costs: Inside vs. Outside Limits

**Standard E&O Policy Terms:** Most professional liability policies (D&O, E&O, EPLI) structure defense costs as **inside limits** (also called "defense within limits" or "eroding limits"), meaning defense costs erode the policy limit.¹³

**Inside Limits (Eroding) - Likely Structure:**
- Defense costs **reduce** available coverage limit
- Example: If $2.5M spent on defense for Thompson case, only $47.5M remains of $50M aggregate limit for settlement/judgment
- For settlement of $45M + defense $2.5M = $47.5M total, within $50M limit
- Nevada (2023) became first state to ban defense-within-limits provisions; Louisiana and New Mexico have restrictions (with exemptions for E&O/D&O/EPLI if policy limit exceeds $500K)¹⁴

**Outside Limits (Supplementary) - Less Common:**
- Defense costs **supplementary** to policy limit
- Full $50M available for settlement/judgment regardless of defense costs
- More favorable to insured but less common for E&O policies

**For LLIC Coverage:**
- Assume standard inside limits structure (defense erodes $50M aggregate)
- $2.5M defense costs + $45M settlement = $47.5M, within $50M aggregate
- If settlement reaches high end ($45M), remaining coverage for other claims during policy period: $50M - $47.5M = $2.5M

#### 4. Per-Claim SIR vs. Aggregate SIR

**Typical E&O Structure:** $5M SIR applies **per claim** or **series of related claims**, not as aggregate across all claims in policy period.¹⁵

**Implications:**
- Each **separate, unrelated claim** triggers separate $5M SIR
- **Related claims** (addressed below) aggregate under single $5M SIR
- If Thompson class action and FINRA arbitrations are **unrelated**, LLIC would pay:
  - $5M SIR for Thompson
  - Separate SIR (up to amount of arbitrations ~$750K) for FINRA matters
- If **related claims**, single $5M SIR applies to all

### C. Related Claims Aggregation Analysis

#### 1. Related Claims Definition and Impact

**Purpose of Aggregation:** E&O policies typically include "related claims" or "interrelated wrongful acts" provisions that treat multiple claims arising from the same or related wrongful acts as a **single claim** subject to one SIR and one per-claim limit.¹⁶

**Policy Language (Typical):** "All claims arising from the same or related wrongful acts, errors, omissions, or series of related wrongful acts, errors, or omissions shall be considered a single claim."

**Impact on Coverage:**
- **Single SIR applies** to all related claims (LLIC pays $5M once, not per claimant)
- **Single per-claim limit** applies to aggregate of related claims
- **Benefits insured** by reducing number of SIRs paid
- **May limit coverage** if aggregate exposure exceeds single per-claim limit¹⁷

**Class Action Context:** Court decisions confirm that class actions with multiple claimants constitute a **single claim** when arising from same wrongful conduct, triggering single SIR and single deductible.¹⁸

#### 2. Application: Thompson Class Action + FINRA Arbitrations

**Arguments for Related Claims (Aggregate Under Single $5M SIR):**

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| **Common Wrongful Acts** | Both involve sales practices for insurance/investment products (IUL illustrations, VA suitability) |
| **Same Time Period** | IUL sales 2015-2020; VA sales 2020-2022 (overlapping/consecutive) |
| **Common Legal Theories** | Misrepresentation, omissions, suitability violations, consumer protection |
| **Same Distribution Channel** | Liberty Life captive agents and Liberty Life Securities LLC broker-dealer |
| **Pattern of Conduct** | Alleged systemic sales practices issues (not isolated incidents) |

**Arguments Against Aggregation (Separate SIRs):**

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| **Different Products** | IUL (insurance) vs. VA (securities); different regulatory frameworks |
| **Different Claimants** | Thompson class (850 IUL policyholders) vs. FINRA arbitrations (3 individual VA purchasers); no overlap |
| **Different Legal Claims** | Thompson: Nebraska Consumer Protection Act, state law misrepresentation; FINRA: federal securities suitability FINRA Rule 2111 |
| **Separate Compliance Failures** | IUL: illustration violations; VA: suitability violations per October 2023 FINRA exam |

#### 3. Coverage Implications of Aggregation

**Scenario A: Claims are RELATED (Single $5M SIR)**

| Item | Amount | Allocation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Thompson IUL settlement | $25M-$45M | Apply $5M SIR to Thompson |
| Thompson defense costs | $2.5M (to date) | Within SIR or eroding limits |
| FINRA arbitrations total | $623K-$776K | **Above $5M threshold** → Chubb pays |
| **LLIC Net Cost** | **$5M SIR only** | Significant benefit to LLIC |
| **Chubb Pays** | $20M-$40M (Thompson excess) + $623K-$776K (FINRA) | $20.6M-$40.8M |

**Benefit to LLIC:** If aggregated, Chubb covers FINRA arbitrations above the $5M already exhausted by Thompson settlement. LLIC does not pay separate SIR for arbitrations.

**Scenario B: Claims are UNRELATED (Separate SIRs)**

| Item | Amount | Allocation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Thompson IUL settlement | $25M-$45M | $5M SIR + Chubb pays $20M-$40M |
| FINRA arbitrations total | $623K-$776K | **LLIC retains 100%** (within separate SIR) |
| **LLIC Net Cost** | **$5M + $623K-$776K = $5.6M-$5.8M** | LLIC pays arbitrations out-of-pocket |
| **Chubb Pays** | $20M-$40M (Thompson excess only) | No coverage for FINRA within SIR |

**Likely Interpretation:** Given different products, claimants, and legal theories, Chubb may argue claims are **unrelated** and impose separate SIRs. However, if pattern of sales practices systemic across products, aggregation argument has merit.¹⁹

**Coverage Negotiation:** LLIC should assert related claims aggregation to maximize coverage for FINRA arbitrations. Chubb's position on aggregation may be addressed in reservation of rights letter (if issued).

### D. Coverage for Thompson v. Liberty Life IUL Class Action

#### 1. Insuring Agreement Coverage

**Standard E&O Insuring Agreement:** Covers "claims for damages arising from wrongful acts in providing professional services."²⁰

**Wrongful Act Definition:** "Any actual or alleged error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect, or breach of duty by the insured in providing or failing to provide professional services."²¹

**Thompson Allegations Fall Within Coverage:**
- **Misrepresentation:** IUL sales illustrations showing 8.5% crediting rate when actual rates averaged 4.2% = "misleading statement"
- **Omissions:** Failure to adequately disclose that caps/floors/participation rates could change = "omission"
- **Professional Services:** Sale of insurance products by licensed agents = professional services in financial services sector

**Conclusion:** Thompson allegations **prima facie covered** under standard E&O insuring agreement.

#### 2. Damages Covered vs. Excluded

**Compensatory Damages: COVERED**
- Cash value shortfall ($85M-$125M alleged) = economic damages
- Policy restoration/restitution = returning premiums/cash values = damages
- Settlement payments to class members = covered²²

**Punitive Damages: TYPICALLY EXCLUDED**
- Thompson seeks punitive damages 2-3× compensatory = $170M-$375M range
- Most E&O policies **exclude punitive damages**²³
- Exception: Some financial services E&O policies provide **limited punitive coverage** (e.g., $250K cap)²⁴
- State law variation: Nebraska allows punitive damages for fraud/willful misconduct
- **Coverage verification required:** Review Chubb policy exclusions for punitive damages language

**If Punitive Excluded:**
- Settlement $25M-$45M likely allocable primarily to compensatory damages (covered)
- Trial risk if jury awards $85M-$125M compensatory + $170M-$250M punitive = $255M-$375M total
- Chubb covers compensatory up to $50M limit
- **LLIC retains punitive damages exposure** (potentially $85M-$250M if excluded)

**Regulatory Fines/Penalties: EXCLUDED**
- Nebraska DOI fines (if imposed) typically excluded
- SEC/FINRA enforcement fines excluded
- Restitution to customers **may be covered** (compensatory, not punitive)²⁵

#### 3. Settlement Coverage Analysis ($25M-$45M Range)

**Low-End Settlement: $25M**

| Component | Amount | Coverage | LLIC Cost | Chubb Pays |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Settlement amount | $25M | Covered | $5M (SIR) | $20M |
| Defense costs to date | $2.5M | Covered | $2.5M (within SIR) | $0 |
| **Total** | **$27.5M** | **Covered** | **$5M SIR** | **$20M** |

*Assumes defense costs inside limits, already paid by LLIC within SIR; settlement paid $5M by LLIC + $20M by Chubb*

**High-End Settlement: $45M**

| Component | Amount | Coverage | LLIC Cost | Chubb Pays |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Settlement amount | $45M | Covered | $5M (SIR) | $40M |
| Defense costs to date | $2.5M | Covered | $2.5M (within SIR) | $0 |
| **Total** | **$47.5M** | **Covered** | **$5M SIR** | **$40M** |

**Within Policy Limits:** Both scenarios within $50M aggregate limit. After $45M settlement:
- Remaining aggregate coverage: $50M - $47.5M = **$2.5M** for other claims during policy period
- Adequate for FINRA arbitrations ($623K-$776K) if not aggregated

#### 4. Trial Risk Beyond Policy Limits

**Worst-Case Trial Scenario:**
- Jury verdict: $125M compensatory + $250M punitive = **$375M total**
- Chubb coverage: $50M limit (if compensatory covered, punitive excluded)
- **Excess exposure to LLIC:** $375M - $50M = **$325M uninsured**

**Punitive Exclusion Impact:** If punitive damages excluded:
- Chubb pays: Up to $50M for compensatory damages
- LLIC retains: $125M compensatory (excess above $50M limit) + $250M punitive = **$375M total** if compensatory exceeds limit
- OR: If compensatory $125M within $50M limit after SIR, Chubb pays $50M, LLIC pays $5M SIR + $250M punitive = **$255M LLIC exposure**

**Settlement Recommendation:** Settle within $25M-$45M range to:
- Avoid trial risk of $100M+ excess exposure
- Ensure coverage within $50M Chubb policy limits
- Minimize LLIC net cost to $5M SIR
