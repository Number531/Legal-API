## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

American Education Holdings' proposed $780 million acquisition of Midwest University presents **significant employment and labor law risks** totaling $212M-$765M in potential exposure, with most likely exposure of $25M-$75M. The most critical issue is **tenure contract liability**: AEH will inherit binding contractual obligations to 680 tenured faculty members that cannot be unilaterally modified or terminated. Attempting mass faculty termination would trigger $200M-$680M in breach of contract litigation, loss of accreditation, and irreparable reputational damage.

**Priority Actions:**
1. **Publicly commit to honoring all tenure contracts** (critical to transaction success)
2. **Settle pending EEOC discrimination charge for $150K-$400K** (Q1 2026 mediation)
3. **Comply with WARN Act** if workforce reductions planned (60-day notice required)
4. **Preserve faculty governance** to maintain accreditation and contractual compliance
5. **Conduct pension due diligence** to assess defined benefit plan liability ($5M-$50M+ exposure)

---

### A. Critical Employment Law Issues

#### 1. Tenure Rights and Successor Liability ($200M-$680M Exposure)

**The Issue:** Faculty handbooks are **enforceable contracts** in most U.S. jurisdictions, and courts have consistently held that **tenure rights survive change of ownership** under successor liability doctrine. AEH will inherit MU's contractual obligations to 680 tenured faculty members, including continuous employment, academic freedom protections, and dismissal procedures requiring either documented cause or formal financial exigency.

**The Law:**
- **Faculty handbooks as contracts:** AAUP has documented that faculty handbooks with clear language on tenure, dismissal procedures, and shared governance are binding contracts enforceable in court.
- **Successor liability:** When a transaction functions as a "de facto merger" (substantial continuity of operations, employees, location, and assets), the successor employer inherits predecessor's employment contracts.
- ***Jacobs v. Mundelein College***, 628 N.E.2d 201 (Ill. App. 1993): Illinois court held that tenure rights survived institutional affiliation because no financial exigency had been formally declared per faculty handbook requirements.

**Application to Project Athena:**
- **De facto merger factors all present:** University continues operations, 4,090 employees transfer, same Indiana campus, all assets and accreditation transfer, MU dissolves post-sale.
- **Financial exigency unavailable:** $780M acquisition price demonstrates MU is NOT in financial crisis. AAUP defines financial exigency as "imminent financial crisis threatening survival of institution as a whole." Post-acquisition cost-cutting is business strategy, not exigency.
- **Dismissal for cause impractical:** Requires documented incompetence, neglect of duty, or misconduct; hearing before faculty committee; burden of proof on administration. Process takes 12-24 months per faculty member.

**Litigation Risk if Tenure Violated:**
- **Per-plaintiff exposure:** $300K-$1M (back pay, front pay, reinstatement, attorneys' fees)
- **680 tenured faculty potential plaintiffs:** $204M-$680M aggregate exposure
- **Class action likely:** Faculty would band together for collective litigation
- **Accreditation jeopardy:** Higher Learning Commission could withdraw accreditation if tenure protections eliminated (catastrophic loss of federal student aid eligibility)

**Strategic Imperative:**
AEH **MUST** publicly commit to honoring tenure for all 680 current tenured faculty. This is non-negotiable for transaction success. Any attempt to circumvent tenure obligations will result in:
- Multi-hundred-million-dollar litigation
- Loss of institutional accreditation
- Faculty exodus and inability to recruit replacements
- Negative media coverage ("for-profit corporation destroys academic tenure")
- Community and alumni backlash

**Budget Impact:**
- **Annual tenured faculty salaries:** $68M-$82M (680 faculty @ $100K-$120K average)
- This is the **cost of doing business** in higher education acquisition and must be factored into financial projections.

---

#### 2. EEOC Discrimination Charge: Dr. Susan Chen ($350K-$1.7M Exposure)

**The Issue:** Dr. Susan Chen (Associate Professor, Asian female) filed EEOC charge in August 2024 alleging race discrimination, sex discrimination, and retaliation after tenure denial in May 2024. Mediation scheduled Q1 2026. AEH inherits this liability as successor employer.

**The Law:**
- **Title VII prohibits discrimination:** Based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.)
- **No academic exemption:** Congress removed academia's Title VII exemption in 1972. *University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC*, 493 U.S. 182 (1990) held that universities cannot assert academic freedom to withhold peer review materials from EEOC.
- **Prima facie case (McDonnell Douglas):** Protected class membership + qualification + adverse action + disparate treatment
- **2025 evolution:** Recent Supreme Court case (*Ames v. Ohio*) clarified that plaintiffs can prove discrimination without perfect comparators if evidence raises reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.

**Dr. Chen's Claims:**

**A. Race/Sex Discrimination:**
- **Prima facie elements likely met:** Asian female (protected classes), tenure-qualified candidate, tenure denied, potential white male comparators granted tenure with similar/weaker credentials
- **Evidence to develop:** Tenure rates by race/sex (2014-2024), comparator files (publications, teaching evaluations), department meeting minutes, peer review letters
- **Pretext indicators:** Subjective criteria ("collegiality"), shifting justifications for denial, statistical disparities

**B. Retaliation:**
- **Elements:** Protected activity (prior complaint about discrimination/harassment) + adverse action (tenure denial) + causal connection
- **Temporal proximity standard:** Close timing (days/weeks) sufficient alone; 3-4 months insufficient alone; requires additional evidence
- **Chen analysis:** Need to determine when prior complaint filed relative to May 2024 tenure denial
- **Strong if:** Same decision-makers, inconsistent explanations, favorable reviews pre-complaint/negative post-complaint

**Litigation Exposure:**

| Remedy | Low | Mid | High |
|--------|-----|-----|------|
| **Back Pay** (uncapped) | $200K | $300K | $400K |
| **Front Pay** (uncapped) | $0 | $500K | $1M |
| **Compensatory Damages** (capped) | $50K | $150K | $300K |
| **Punitive Damages** (capped) | $0 | $100K | $0 |
| **Combined Cap** (500+ employees) | — | — | $300K |
| **Attorneys' Fees** | $100K | $200K | $300K |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | **$350K** | **$1M** | **$1.7M** |

**Note:** Title VII damages cap for employers with 500+ employees is **$300,000** (compensatory + punitive combined). Back pay and front pay are uncapped. Attorneys' fees awarded to prevailing plaintiff.

**Settlement Strategy:**

**Pre-Mediation Due Diligence (NOW):**
- Review Chen's complete tenure file (publications, teaching, service)
- Obtain comparator data (white male candidates granted tenure 2019-2024)
- Calculate tenure grant rates by race/sex in department and university-wide
- Assess retaliation claim timing (when was prior complaint filed?)
- Interview tenure committee members (attorney-client privileged)

**Q1 2026 Mediation:**
- **Opening offer:** $100K-$150K (severance without admission of wrongdoing)
- **Authorized settlement range:** $150K-$400K depending on evidence strength
- **Include:** Confidentiality agreement, non-disparagement clause, release of all claims, neutral reference letter
- **Reject:** Tenure as remedy (sets dangerous precedent, undermines academic standards)
- **Framing:** "Fresh start" at institution that values Dr. Chen's contributions

**If Mediation Fails:**
- **EEOC investigation:** 10-11 months (document requests, witness interviews, statistical analysis)
- **Reasonable cause determination:** If EEOC finds discrimination, invites conciliation
- **Litigation:** Right to Sue letter → Chen files federal court lawsuit
- **Defense costs:** $500K-$1M in attorneys' fees over 3-5 years
- **Discovery exposure:** Peer review materials, comparator files, email communications become public

**Recommendation:** Settle in mediation for $150K-$400K. Litigation risks exceed settlement cost, and negative publicity harms enrollment and faculty recruiting.

---

#### 3. WARN Act Compliance ($4M-$8M Exposure if Violated)

**The Issue:** If AEH plans post-acquisition workforce reductions for cost-cutting, federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act requires **60 days' advance written notice** to affected employees, state agency, and local government.

**The Law:**
- **29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq.** (WARN Act)
- **Coverage:** Employers with 100+ employees (MU has 4,090 → covered ✓)
- **No educational exemption:** Educational institutions and faculty are NOT exempt from WARN Act. 20 C.F.R. § 639.3 defines "employer" and "employee" broadly without carve-outs for universities.

**Triggering Events:**

| Event | Definition | MU Threshold |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Plant Closing** | Shutdown causing employment loss for 50+ employees | 50 employees |
| **Mass Layoff (Option A)** | 50-499 employees AND ≥33% of workforce | 1,350 employees (33% of 4,090) |
| **Mass Layoff (Option B)** | 500+ employees (any percentage) | 500 employees |

**Practical Examples:**

| Layoff Size | % of Workforce | WARN Required? | Reason |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 50 | 1.2% | **NO** | Below 33% threshold |
| 250 | 6.1% | **NO** | Below 33% threshold |
| 500 | 12.2% | **YES** | ≥500 absolute threshold |
| 1,000 | 24.4% | **YES** | ≥500 absolute threshold |
| 1,350 | 33.0% | **YES** | ≥33% + 50+ employees |

**Notice Requirements:**
- **Who receives notice:** Affected employees (or union representative), Indiana Department of Workforce Development (warn-notice@dwd.in.gov), chief elected official of local government
- **Content:** Plant closing vs. mass layoff, expected separation date, anticipated schedule, job titles affected, contact information
- **Timeline:** 60 calendar days BEFORE first separation

**Exceptions (Narrow):**
1. **Faltering company:** Employer actively seeking capital; giving notice would prevent obtaining capital (applies ONLY to plant closings, NOT mass layoffs)
2. **Unforeseeable business circumstances:** Circumstances not reasonably foreseeable 60 days prior (e.g., client bankruptcy, natural disaster)
3. **Natural disaster:** Earthquake, flood, storm

**AEH CANNOT Rely on Exceptions:**
- Post-acquisition cost-cutting is **planned and foreseeable** (acquisition announced months in advance)
- Financial restructuring is **NOT a faltering company** (AEH is acquiring, not failing)
- Enrollment decline is **foreseeable business circumstance**

**Penalties for Violation:**

| Penalty Type | Amount | Calculation |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| **Back pay** | Up to 60 days' wages | (Daily wage) × (Days of violation) × (Employees affected) |
| **Benefits** | Up to 60 days | Health insurance, pension contributions |
| **Civil penalty** | $500/day | Failure to notify state/local government (max $30,000) |
| **Attorneys' fees** | $50K-$150K | Prevailing employees entitled to fees |

**Exposure Example (500-employee layoff, zero notice):**
- Average salary: $50,000/year = $137/day
- Back pay: $137 × 60 days × 500 employees = **$4,110,000**
- Civil penalties: $500 × 60 days = **$30,000**
- Attorneys' fees: **$100,000-$150,000**
- **Total: $4,240,000-$4,290,000**

**Indiana State Law:**
Indiana does **NOT** have mini-WARN Act. Federal WARN is only applicable statute (no enhanced state requirements).

**Compliance Strategy:**

**IF layoffs trigger WARN:**
1. **Day 0:** Finalize layoff decision and employee list
2. **Day 1-5:** Draft WARN notices (legal review)
3. **Day 5:** Deliver notices to employees, Indiana DWD, local officials
4. **Day 65:** Earliest permissible separation date

**Cost-Benefit:**
- **Cost of compliance:** 60 days' salary (already budgeted for transition period)
- **Cost of violation:** $4M-$8M+ (back pay, penalties, attorneys' fees, litigation)
- **Recommendation:** **ALWAYS provide full 60-day notice** unless clearly below thresholds

**Alternative (Avoid Trigger):**
- Phase workforce reductions over multiple 30-day periods
- Keep each 30-day period below 50 employees to avoid trigger
- Document each reduction as separate business decision (not "aggregated" for WARN purposes)

---

#### 4. Shared Governance and Accreditation Risk ($1M-$5M + Loss of Accreditation)

**The Issue:** Faculty handbooks typically incorporate AAUP principles on "shared governance," giving Faculty Senate authority over curriculum, academic policies, and tenure decisions. These provisions are contractually binding. Eliminating Faculty Senate or marginalizing faculty input could breach contracts AND jeopardize accreditation.

**The Law:**
- **AAUP 1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities:** Establishes shared responsibility among governing board (fiduciary oversight), administration (operations), and faculty (curriculum, instruction, faculty appointments).
- **Contractual incorporation:** When faculty handbook references AAUP principles, they become part of employment contract.
- **Accreditation requirement:** Higher Learning Commission (HLC) Criterion 5.A requires institutions to have governance structures that "promote effective leadership and support collaborative processes."

**MU Faculty Senate Authority (Typical):**
- Curriculum design and degree requirements
- Grading standards and academic policies
- Faculty appointments, reappointments, and tenure recommendations
- Budget review and input

**Post-Acquisition Risk:**
AEH's for-profit business model creates tension with shared governance:
- **AEH wants:** Operational efficiency, standardized curriculum, cost reduction, top-down decision-making
- **Faculty expect:** Academic freedom, collegial governance, input on all academic policies, protection from corporate control

**If AEH Eliminates Faculty Senate:**
- **Breach of contract:** 680-1,240 faculty have contractual right to shared governance
- **Class action exposure:** $1M-$5M (declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, damages)
- **Accreditation jeopardy:** HLC could place MU on probation or withdraw accreditation
- **Loss of accreditation = catastrophic:** Federal student aid eligibility lost (Title IV), enrollment collapses, institution closes

**Recommended Model (Balance AEH and Faculty Interests):**

| Decision Area | Faculty Senate Role | Administration Role |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Curriculum** | Recommends | Approves (can override with documented rationale) |
| **Tenure** | Peer review committee recommends | President/Board decides (follows unless documented reason) |
| **Academic standards** | Sets standards | Enforces standards |
| **Budget** | Reviews, advises | Finalizes and implements |
| **Strategic planning** | Provides input | Makes final decisions |

**Key Principle:** Faculty Senate is **advisory** (not binding), but administration must:
- **Consult** Faculty Senate before major academic policy changes
- **Document rationale** when overriding Faculty Senate recommendations
- **Preserve appearance** of meaningful faculty participation (for accreditation)

**First 100 Days Actions:**
- Town halls explaining for-profit transition and governance model
- One-on-one meetings with Faculty Senate leadership
- Commit to monthly Faculty Senate meetings (administration attendance)
- Faculty representation on AEH advisory board (non-voting observer)
- Competitive faculty compensation to retain top talent

---

#### 5. Unionization Risk ($5M-$15M Ongoing)

**The Issue:** Post-acquisition corporatization, cost-cutting, and perceived loss of faculty voice increase risk of unionization among non-tenure-track faculty (560), graduate student employees (200-500), and staff (2,850).

**The Law:**

**A. Tenured/Tenure-Track Faculty (680) - Likely NOT Unionizable:**
- *NLRB v. Yeshiva University*, 444 U.S. 672 (1980): Faculty who exercise substantial control over curriculum, admissions, tenure decisions, and budget are "managerial employees" excluded from National Labor Relations Act coverage.
- **MU analysis:** Shared governance structure suggests tenured faculty qualify as managerial (no union rights).

**B. Non-Tenure-Track Faculty (560) - Unionizable:**
- **NOT managerial** under Yeshiva (limited governance role)
- Covered by NLRA, can organize and bargain collectively
- **2014 Pacific Lutheran decision:** NLRB held that party asserting managerial status must prove actual authority (not just handbook language). Corporatization shifts more faculty to "employee" status.

**C. Graduate Student TAs/RAs (200-500) - Unionizable:**
- *Columbia University*, 364 NLRB No. 90 (2016): NLRB reversed prior precedent and held that graduate students performing teaching/research services are NLRA-covered employees.
- **MU analysis:** All TAs/RAs eligible to organize.

**D. Staff Employees (2,850) - Some Likely Unionized:**

| Employee Group | Union Likelihood | Action Required |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Facilities/Maintenance | **HIGH** (often unionized) | Due diligence: Obtain CBA if exists |
| Dining Services | Moderate (if outsourced) | Check contractor agreements |
| Clerical/Admin | Low-Moderate | Monitor organizing activity |
| Security/Police | Moderate-High | Due diligence |

**Unionization Triggers (Post-Acquisition):**
- Pay/benefit cuts (adjunct faculty earn $3,000-$5,000/course, no benefits)
- Job insecurity (year-to-year contracts for non-tenure-track faculty)
- Loss of voice in decision-making
- Perception of corporate exploitation
- Visible organizing campaigns at peer institutions

**If Union Organizes:**

**NLRB Election Process:**
1. Union files petition with NLRB (showing 30% employee support)
2. NLRB determines appropriate bargaining unit
3. Election held (secret ballot)
4. If majority votes yes → NLRB certifies union
5. Employer must recognize union and bargain in good faith

**Bargaining Obligations:**
- Wages, hours, terms and conditions of employment
- Cannot unilaterally change employment terms once union certified
- Must bargain to impasse before implementing changes
- Duty to provide information relevant to bargaining

**Union Avoidance (Legal):**
- **Proactive measures:** Improve adjunct pay (market rates), multi-year contracts (3-5 years), extend benefits (health insurance, retirement) to part-time faculty working 20+ hours/week, include non-tenure-track faculty in governance
- **AVOID unfair labor practices:** No TIPS (Threats, Interrogation, Promises, Surveillance)
  - Do NOT threaten to eliminate positions if employees unionize
  - Do NOT interrogate employees about union sympathies
  - Do NOT promise benefits conditioned on rejecting union
  - Do NOT surveil union organizing meetings

**Cost of Unionization:**
- **Wage increases:** 10-20% over 3 years (typical first CBA)
- **Benefits expansion:** Health insurance, paid leave, retirement for adjuncts
- **Administrative burden:** Grievance arbitration, CBA administration
- **Reduced flexibility:** Cannot terminate without "just cause," seniority rules limit restructuring

**Exposure Estimate:**
- 560 non-tenure-track faculty unionize
- Average current compensation: $40,000/year
- Union contract increases: 15% over 3 years = $6,000/year per faculty
- **Total annual cost increase:** $3.36M/year × 5 years = **$16.8M over life of CBA**

**Recommendation:** Proactively improve non-tenure-track faculty compensation and job security to reduce union appeal. Cost of prevention ($5M-$10M) less than cost of unionization ($15M-$25M over 5 years).

---

#### 6. Employee Benefits and ERISA Compliance ($5M-$50M+ Pension Risk)

**The Issue:** MU's 403(b) retirement plan must convert to 401(k) upon loss of tax-exempt status. If MU sponsors defined benefit pension plan, AEH inherits **massive funding obligations** and potential withdrawal liability.

**The Law:**

**A. 403(b) to 401(k) Conversion:**
- **IRC § 403(b):** Tax-sheltered annuity plans available ONLY to 501(c)(3) organizations and public schools
- **Post-acquisition:** MU loses exempt status → 403(b) no longer available → must convert to IRC § 401(k)
- **Conversion process:** Freeze 403(b), establish 401(k), tax-free rollover of participant balances
- **SECURE 2.0 Act (2022):** New 401(k) plans adopted after 2024 must include automatic enrollment (3-10% contribution rate, employees can opt out)

**B. Defined Benefit (DB) Pension Plans - CRITICAL DUE DILIGENCE:**

**Question:** Does MU sponsor traditional DB pension plan guaranteeing monthly retirement income?

**If YES:**
- **Employer bears all risk:** Investment risk, longevity risk, inflation risk
- **Funding obligation:** Annual contributions to ensure plan is fully funded
- **PBGC insurance:** Private sector DB plans covered by Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (premiums ~$100-$600 per participant/year)
- **Form 5500 Schedule B:** Actuarial valuation showing funded status (assets ÷ liabilities)

**Successor Liability:**
AEH inherits:
- **Accrued benefits:** Present value of all pension obligations earned to date
- **Ongoing funding:** Annual contributions to make up shortfall
- **PBGC premiums:** Per-participant annual fees
- **Fiduciary duties:** ERISA § 404(a) prudent person standard

**Multiemployer Pension Plans:**
If MU participates in multiemployer plan (union-negotiated plan covering multiple employers):
- **Withdrawal triggers liability:** 29 U.S.C. § 1381 (ERISA § 4201)
- **Calculation:** MU's pro-rata share of plan's unfunded vested benefits
- **Can be massive:** $20M-$100M+ depending on plan's funding status
- **Payment schedule:** 20 years (quarterly installments)

**Example Exposure:**

| Scenario | Funded Status | MU's Liability | Annual Payment |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Well-funded DB** | 95% funded | $5M one-time | $1M/year for 5 years |
| **Underfunded DB** | 70% funded | $30M one-time | $5M/year for 6 years |
| **Multiemployer withdrawal** | 60% funded | $50M+ | $2.5M/year for 20 years |

**DUE DILIGENCE ACTIONS (IMMEDIATE):**

1. **Obtain Form 5500 filings** (last 3 years)
2. **Schedule B actuarial report** (funded ratio, assumptions)
3. **Identify multiemployer plans** (withdrawal liability exposure)
4. **Review plan documents** (benefit formulas, early retirement subsidies)
5. **Calculate AEH's successor liability**

**If Underfunded:**
- **Negotiate indemnification:** Seller retains pre-closing underfunding
- **Escrow holdback:** 10-20% of purchase price to secure indemnity
- **Plan freeze option:** Freeze benefit accruals (requires PBGC approval, 45-day notice to participants)
- **Plan termination option:** Terminate plan, purchase annuities for participants (PBGC approval required)

**C. Controlled Group Liability:**
- **ERISA § 4001(b):** All employers under common control treated as single employer for pension purposes
- **Implication:** If AEH owns multiple universities, underfunded pension at MU creates liability for entire AEH enterprise
- **Cross-default risk:** Pension withdrawal at one institution can trigger obligations at sister institutions

- Chen EEOC settlement: $300K
- WARN compliance (no violation): $0
- Honor tenure (no breach): $0
- Modest adjunct unionization: $10M-$20M over 5 years
- Shared governance compliance: $0
- Moderate DB pension underfunding: $15M-$30M
- Miscellaneous claims (RIF, discrimination): $1M-$5M

---

### C. Strategic Recommendations for Transaction Success

#### Priority 1: Honor Tenure Commitments (CRITICAL)

✅ **Action:** Publicly announce commitment to honoring tenure for all 680 current tenured faculty.

**Why This Is Non-Negotiable:**
- Avoids $200M-$680M litigation exposure
- Preserves accreditation (required for federal student aid)
- Maintains faculty morale and institutional stability
- Enables successful integration
- Demonstrates good faith to regulators, community, alumni

**Implementation:**
- Include in acquisition press release: "AEH is committed to honoring tenure for all current tenured faculty."
- Meet with Faculty Senate leadership (first week post-closing)
- Town halls with full faculty explaining transition and governance
- Budget $68M-$82M annually for 680 tenured faculty (already factored into financial model)

---

#### Priority 2: Settle EEOC Charge (HIGH)

✅ **Action:** Enter Q1 2026 mediation with authority to settle for $150K-$400K.

**Pre-Mediation Due Diligence:**
- Review Chen's tenure file and compare to white male comparators granted tenure 2019-2024
- Calculate tenure grant rates by race/sex (department and university-wide)
- Assess retaliation timing (when was prior complaint filed relative to May 2024 denial?)
- Interview tenure committee members (attorney-client privileged conversations)

**Settlement Parameters:**
- **Opening offer:** $100K-$150K (severance without admission)
- **Authorized ceiling:** $350K (if strong discrimination evidence)
- **Must include:** Confidentiality, non-disparagement, full release, neutral reference
- **Reject:** Tenure as remedy (sets precedent)

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Settlement: $150K-$400K (confidential, resolved in 6 months)
- Litigation: $500K-$1M defense costs + $350K-$1.7M judgment + 3-5 years + public trial

---

#### Priority 3: WARN Act Compliance (MODERATE)

✅ **Action:** If workforce reductions planned, provide full 60-day WARN notice.

**Triggering Thresholds:**
- 500+ employees laid off (any percentage), OR
- 50+ employees laid off AND ≥33% of workforce (1,350 for MU)

**Notice Delivery:**
- Written notice to affected employees
- Email to Indiana DWD: warn-notice@dwd.in.gov
- Notice to local government chief elected official

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Compliance cost: 60 days' salary (already budgeted for transition)
- Violation cost: $4M-$8M (back pay, penalties, fees)

**Alternative:** Phase reductions over multiple 30-day periods (<50 per period) to avoid trigger.

---

#### Priority 4: Preserve Shared Governance (MODERATE)

✅ **Action:** Maintain Faculty Senate; consult on academic policies; reserve final decision-making to administration.

**Why This Matters:**
- Contractual obligation (faculty handbook)
- Accreditation requirement (HLC Criterion 5.A)
- Faculty morale and buy-in

**Implementation:**
- Faculty Senate = advisory (not binding)
- Administration consults before major policy changes
- Document rationale when overriding Faculty Senate recommendations
- Monthly Faculty Senate meetings (administration attendance)

---

#### Priority 5: Mitigate Unionization (MODERATE)

✅ **Action:** Proactively improve adjunct faculty compensation and benefits.

**High-Risk Groups:**
- 560 non-tenure-track faculty (low pay, job insecurity)
- 200-500 graduate TAs/RAs (NLRA-covered)
- Facilities/maintenance staff (historically unionized)

**Prevention Measures:**
- Increase adjunct pay to market rates
- Multi-year contracts (3-5 years) for non-tenure-track faculty
- Extend health insurance and retirement benefits to part-time faculty (20+ hours/week)
- Include adjuncts in governance (committee service, voting rights)

**Cost:** $5M-$10M proactive investment vs. $15M-$25M unionization cost over 5 years

---

#### Priority 6: Pension Due Diligence (HIGH IF DB PLAN)

✅ **Action:** Immediately determine whether MU sponsors DB pension plan and calculate funding status.

**Critical Questions:**
1. Does DB plan exist? (Form 5500 review)
2. Funded status? (Schedule B actuarial report)
3. Multiemployer plan? (Withdrawal liability exposure)
4. PBGC premium obligation?

**If Underfunded:**
- Negotiate seller indemnification for pre-closing underfunding
- Escrow 10-20% of purchase price
- Consider plan freeze/termination before closing

**Exposure Range:** $5M (well-funded) to $50M+ (multiemployer withdrawal)

---

### D. First 100 Days Action Plan

**Week 1-2: Announcement and Reassurance**
- Public statement honoring tenure commitments
- Town hall with faculty explaining transition
- One-on-one meetings with Faculty Senate leadership

### E. Budget Impact Summary

| Expense Category | Year 1 | Annual (Years 2-5) |
|------------------|--------|--------------------|
| **Tenured Faculty Salaries** | $68M-$82M | $68M-$82M |
| **Chen EEOC Settlement** | $300K | — |
| **WARN Compliance** | $0 | — |
| **Severance** (200 employees) | $2M-$4M | — |
| **401(k) Employer Match** (3%) | $3M | $3M |
| **DB Pension Underfunding** | $5M-$15M | $3M-$5M |
| **Legal Fees** | $500K | $250K |
| **TOTAL** | **$78.8M-$106.8M** | **$74.3M-$90.3M** |

**Key Assumptions:**
- 680 tenured faculty @ $100K-$120K average
- Chen settles for $300K (midpoint of range)
- WARN compliance achieved (no violation)
- 200-employee RIF with 10-20 weeks' severance
- 4,090 employees @ $75K average (3% match)
- Moderate DB pension underfunding

---

### F. Conclusion

The Project Athena acquisition is **legally feasible** from an employment law perspective, but success requires **strict adherence to tenure obligations, WARN Act compliance, and faculty governance preservation**. The single greatest risk is attempting to eliminate or circumvent tenure protections for 680 faculty members, which would trigger:
- $200M-$680M breach of contract litigation
- Loss of institutional accreditation (catastrophic)
- Faculty exodus and recruiting crisis
- Irreparable reputational damage

**Transaction can succeed if AEH:**
1. **Honors all tenure commitments** (non-negotiable)
2. **Settles EEOC charge** ($150K-$400K)
3. **Complies with WARN Act** (if layoffs planned)
4. **Preserves shared governance** (Faculty Senate advisory role)
5. **Proactively prevents unionization** (improve adjunct pay/benefits)
6. **Addresses pension liability** (due diligence and indemnification)

**Most Likely Employment Law Cost:** $25M-$75M (manageable within $780M transaction)

**Worst Case if Risks Ignored:** $212M-$765M + loss of accreditation + institutional failure

The choice is clear: **work with the tenure system and faculty governance structures, or face catastrophic legal and operational consequences.**

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

[To be populated during research]

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. WARN Act Statutory Framework and Applicability to Educational Institutions

#### 1. Federal WARN Act - Basic Requirements

The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq., requires covered employers to provide at least **60 calendar days' advance written notice** before a mass layoff or plant closing.¹

**Covered Employers:**
- Business enterprises employing **100 or more employees**, excluding part-time employees
- OR 100 or more employees who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per week (exclusive of overtime)²
- Federal, state, local, and federally recognized tribal governments are **NOT** subject to WARN³

**Triggering Events:**

*Plant Closing:* Permanent or temporary shutdown of a single site of employment that results in employment loss for **50 or more employees** during any 30-day period.⁴

*Mass Layoff:* Employment loss at a single site during any 30-day period for:
- **50-499 employees** if they constitute at least **33% of the workforce**; OR
- **500 or more employees** (regardless of percentage)⁵

#### 2. Application to Midwest University (4,090 Employees)

**Coverage Analysis:**
- MU employs 4,090 total employees (1,240 faculty + 2,850 staff)
- Significantly exceeds 100-employee threshold → **WARN Act APPLIES** ✓

**Mass Layoff Thresholds for MU:**
- 33% threshold: 1,350 employees (33% of 4,090)
- Absolute threshold: 500 employees

**Critical Threshold:** If AEH plans to lay off either:
- **50+ employees** constituting **33% or more** of workforce, OR
- **500+ employees** (any percentage)

Then **60-day advance notice is REQUIRED**.⁶

**Practical Analysis:**
- Layoff of 50-499 employees: Notice required ONLY if ≥33% of workforce
  - 50 employees = 1.2% of 4,090 → **No notice required**
  - 1,350 employees = 33% → **Notice REQUIRED**
- Layoff of 500+ employees: Notice **ALWAYS required** (regardless of percentage)

#### 3. No Special Exemption for Educational Institutions

**Critical Finding:** The WARN Act contains **NO statutory exemption** for educational institutions or university faculty.⁷

20 C.F.R. § 639.3 defines "employer" broadly without excluding educational institutions.⁸ While the statute exempts certain types of employers (government agencies providing public services), private universities and colleges are subject to standard WARN requirements.

The Department of Labor has confirmed that "institutions of higher education considering a workforce reduction may be subject to federal and state WARN laws."⁹ Colleges and universities must comply with WARN obligations during workforce restructuring.

#### 4. Faculty Status Under WARN Act

**Are faculty "employees" under WARN?**

**YES.** The WARN Act defines "employee" broadly under 20 C.F.R. § 639.3. No exemption exists for:
- Tenured faculty
- Tenure-track faculty
- Non-tenure-track faculty
- Adjunct professors

All faculty members are "employees" subject to WARN notice requirements.¹⁰

#### 5. WARN Act Exceptions (Limited Application)

Three narrow exceptions permit reduced notice:¹¹

**A. Faltering Company Exception:**
- Applies ONLY to plant closings (not mass layoffs)
- Employer was actively seeking capital or business
- Had reasonable belief that giving notice would preclude obtaining needed capital
- Requires contemporaneous documentation
- **Burden of proof:** Employer must demonstrate good faith efforts

**B. Unforeseeable Business Circumstances:**
- Closing/layoff caused by circumstances not reasonably foreseeable 60 days prior
- Examples: Major client bankruptcy, unexpected contract cancellation, natural disaster
- Does NOT include: Poor financial performance, declining enrollment (reasonably foreseeable)
- Employer must give as much notice as practicable¹²

**C. Natural Disaster:**
- Direct result of earthquake, flood, drought, storm, tsunami, etc.
- Employer must give as much notice as practicable

**Application to Project Athena:**
- Post-acquisition cost-cutting: **NOT unforeseeable** (acquisition is planned transaction)
- Financial restructuring: **NOT a faltering company** (AEH is acquiring, not failing)
- Enrollment decline: **Foreseeable business circumstance**

**Conclusion:** AEH **CANNOT rely on exceptions** if planning post-acquisition layoffs. Full 60-day notice required.

#### 6. WARN Notice Requirements

Notice must be provided to:¹³
1. **Affected employees** (or their union representative)
2. **State dislocated worker unit** (Indiana Department of Workforce Development)
3. **Chief elected official** of local government unit

**Notice Content (20 C.F.R. § 639.7):**
- Whether action is plant closing or mass layoff
- Expected date of first separation
- Anticipated schedule for separations
- Job titles of positions affected
- Name and telephone number of company official to contact
- Statement whether bumping rights exist

**Indiana-Specific Requirement:**
Notice to Indiana DWD must be sent by mail or email to: warn-notice@dwd.in.gov¹⁴

#### 7. WARN Act Remedies and Penalties

**A. Back Pay Liability:**
- Each aggrieved employee entitled to back pay for **each day of violation, up to 60 days**¹⁵
- Calculation: (Daily wage) × (Days of notice violation)
- Example: If 100 employees laid off with zero notice, and average salary $50,000/year:
  - Daily rate: $137 ($50,000 ÷ 365)
  - 60-day liability per employee: $8,220
  - **Total exposure: $822,000** (100 employees × $8,220)

**B. Benefits Continuation:**
- Medical, pension, and other fringe benefits for period of violation (up to 60 days)
- Includes employer's cost of providing benefits

**C. Civil Penalties:**
- Up to **$500 per day** for failure to notify state/local government¹⁶
- Maximum: $30,000 (60 days × $500)

**D. Attorneys' Fees:**
- Prevailing employees entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees
- Can add $50,000-$150,000 to employer's liability

**Exposure Calculation for MU/AEH:**

| Scenario | Employees Laid Off | Notice Violation | Back Pay Exposure | Penalties | Total |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| Minor RIF | 200 | 30 days | $822,000 | $15,000 | $837,000 |
| Moderate RIF | 500 | 60 days | $4,110,000 | $30,000 | $4,140,000 |
| Major RIF | 1,000 | 60 days | $8,220,000 | $30,000 | $8,250,000 |

#### 8. Indiana State Law - No Mini-WARN Act

**Critical Finding:** Indiana does **NOT** have a state-level mini-WARN Act.¹⁷

- Unlike California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey, Indiana has no additional state notice requirements
- Federal WARN Act is the **only** applicable statute
- No enhanced penalties or longer notice periods under Indiana law

#### 9. WARN Act Planning Recommendations

**If AEH plans ANY workforce reductions:**

✓ **Immediate Actions:**
1. Calculate exact employee counts (full-time vs. part-time)
2. Determine whether reductions will trigger mass layoff thresholds
3. Prepare 60-day timeline before any separations
4. Draft WARN notices (employee, state, local government versions)
5. Consult with employment counsel on exception applicability

✓ **60-Day Notice Timeline:**
- Day 0: Finalize decision to conduct layoffs
- Day 1-5: Draft and review WARN notices with legal counsel
- Day 5: Deliver WARN notices to employees, Indiana DWD, local officials
- Day 65: Earliest permissible date for first separation

✓ **Exception Documentation (if claiming):**
- Contemporaneous written records of unforeseen circumstances
- Financial documentation (if claiming faltering company)
- Board minutes reflecting good faith capital-raising efforts

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- Cost of providing 60-day notice: Minimal (continued salary during notice period already budgeted)
- Cost of WARN violation: $4M-$8M+ (back pay, penalties, attorneys' fees)
- **Recommendation:** Always provide full 60-day notice unless exception clearly applies

---

### B. Faculty Tenure Rights and Contractual Obligations

#### 1. Faculty Handbooks as Binding Contracts

**Majority Rule:** Faculty handbooks are **enforceable contracts** in most U.S. jurisdictions.¹⁸

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has documented that faculty handbooks can have varying degrees of legal enforceability, and in many jurisdictions faculty handbooks are binding contracts, enforceable in court.¹⁹

**Three-Element Test for Contractual Status:**²⁰
1. **Offer:** Handbook language contains a promise clear enough that faculty would reasonably believe an offer was made
2. **Communication:** Statement disseminated to faculty member such that they are aware of contents and reasonably believe it to be an offer
3. **Acceptance:** Faculty member accepts by commencing or continuing to work after learning of policy

**Presumption for MU:** Faculty handbook provisions regarding tenure, dismissal procedures, and shared governance are **presumptively contractual** and binding on both MU and AEH as successor.

#### 2. AAUP Standards and Incorporation by Reference

Many university handbooks incorporate AAUP principles by reference, making them contractually binding.²¹

**Key AAUP Documents:**
- *1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure*
- *Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure*
- *Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities* (shared governance)

**Judicial Treatment:**
Courts frequently look to AAUP recommended regulations as a guide to interpret university contracts and policies.²² When a handbook references AAUP standards, those principles become part of the contractual obligations.

#### 3. Tenure Definition and Rights

**Tenure** means:²³
- Continuous appointment without term limits
- Right to reappointment annually without need for renewal
- Dismissal permitted ONLY for:
  - **Cause** (incompetence, neglect of duty, moral turpitude, insubordination), OR
  - **Financial exigency** (bona fide financial crisis), OR
  - **Bona fide program discontinuance**

**Property Right:**
Tenure creates a constitutionally protected property interest for public university faculty (*Board of Regents v. Roth*, 408 U.S. 564 (1972)).²⁴ For private universities, tenure is a contractual right enforceable under state contract law.

#### 4. Dismissal for Cause - High Burden of Proof

**AAUP Standard:** Cause for dismissal must be "related, directly and substantially, to the fitness of faculty members in their professional capacities as teachers or researchers."²⁵

**Recognized Grounds:**
- **Incompetence:** Demonstrable failure to perform teaching or research duties
- **Neglect of Duty:** Persistent failure to meet classes, grade papers, or perform assigned responsibilities
- **Moral Turpitude:** Criminal conduct or serious ethical violations
- **Insubordination:** Repeated refusal to follow lawful directives

**Procedural Requirements:**
- Written specification of charges
- Hearing before faculty committee (peer review)
- Right to counsel
- Burden of proof on administration
- Written decision with findings
- Appeal rights

**Practical Reality:** Dismissing tenured faculty for cause is **extremely difficult** and time-consuming (often 12-24 months).

#### 5. Financial Exigency Standard

**AAUP Definition:**
"An imminent financial crisis which threatens the survival of the institution as a whole and which cannot be alleviated by less drastic means" than termination of tenured faculty.²⁶

**Requirements:**²⁷
1. **Formal Declaration:** Governing board must formally declare financial exigency
2. **Bona Fide Crisis:** Demonstrated through audited financials showing insolvency or imminent closure
3. **Faculty Participation:** Faculty senate or representative body must have meaningful opportunity to review financial data and recommend alternatives
4. **Less Drastic Means:** Employer must demonstrate good faith efforts to avoid terminations:
   - Hiring freeze
   - Salary freeze or reductions
   - Reduction in non-personnel expenses
   - Program eliminations
5. **Order of Termination:** Non-tenure-track faculty terminated first, then untenured, then tenured (by seniority)
6. **Notice Period:** 12 months for tenured faculty (AAUP standard)
7. **Recall Rights:** If positions reinstated within 3 years, terminated faculty have right of first refusal

**Burden of Proof:** Institution must demonstrate financial exigency through contemporaneous financial records, not post-hoc justifications.

#### 6. Key Case Law on Financial Exigency

**Linn v. Andover-Newton Theological School** (638 F. Supp. 1114, D. Mass. 1986)²⁸

*Facts:* Tenured faculty member dismissed due to alleged financial exigency.

*Holding:* Institution breached tenure contract by failing to follow its own internal procedures for declaring financial exigency.

*Principle:* "Where an institution adopts financial exigency guidelines but fails to adhere to them, the court may not uphold a tenured faculty member's dismissal."

**Krotkoff v. Goucher College** (585 F.2d 675, 4th Cir. 1978)²⁹

*Holding:* Even without specific language on financial exigency in handbook, there is an implied right in higher education to terminate positions based on declared financial exigency.

*Caveat:* Exigency must be **real and declared**, not merely asserted post-hoc.

**Jacobs v. Mundelein College** (628 N.E.2d 201, Ill. App. 1993)³⁰

*Facts:* Mundelein College "affiliated" with Loyola University but did not formally declare financial exigency per handbook requirements.

*Holding:* Tenure rights survived affiliation because no financial crisis was declared as required by faculty handbook. "The precise terms of the handbook were operative."

*Critical Principle:* Change of ownership does NOT automatically terminate tenure unless formal financial exigency is declared in accordance with handbook procedures.

**Application to Project Athena:**
- AEH acquiring MU for $780M suggests MU is **NOT in financial exigency**
- Post-acquisition cost-cutting is **NOT financial exigency** (it's business strategy)
- MU's 680 tenured faculty have **contractual right to continued employment** that survives acquisition

---

### C. Successor Liability for Employment Contracts and Tenure Obligations

#### 1. General Successor Liability Doctrine

**Definition:** Successor liability is "liability (debt or other obligation) that is inherited by a successor entity after a corporate restructuring."³¹

**Default Rule:** In asset purchases, buyer generally does **NOT** assume seller's liabilities unless expressly assumed.

**Exceptions (When Successor Liability Attaches):**³²
1. **Express or Implied Assumption:** Buyer agrees to assume liabilities
2. **De Facto Merger:** Transaction functions as merger despite asset purchase structure
3. **Mere Continuation:** Successor is continuation of predecessor
4. **Fraudulent Transfer:** Transaction designed to escape liabilities

#### 2. De Facto Merger Test

Courts apply multi-factor test:³³
- Continuity of business operations
- Continuity of shareholders/ownership
- Continuity of management and personnel
- Continuity of physical location and assets
- Assumption of liabilities necessary for ongoing operations
- Predecessor ceases operations shortly after sale

**Application to Project Athena:**
- ✓ Continuity of operations (university continues under AEH)
- ✓ Continuity of management (likely retaining President, deans)
- ✓ Continuity of personnel (1,240 faculty, 2,850 staff)
- ✓ Same physical location (Indiana campus)
- ✓ MU likely dissolves post-acquisition

**Conclusion:** Transaction will likely be deemed **de facto merger**, triggering successor liability for employment contracts.

#### 3. Successor Liability for Tenure Contracts

**Key Principle:** Courts generally hold that tenure rights **survive change of ownership** and bind the successor institution.³⁴

When a university is acquired (whether asset purchase or merger), the acquiring entity steps into the shoes of the predecessor and **assumes all contractual obligations to tenured faculty**, including:
- Continued employment
- Academic freedom protections
- Dismissal procedures (cause or financial exigency only)
- Shared governance rights
- Salary and benefit obligations

**Rationale:**
- Tenure contracts are ongoing, not terminable by ownership change
- Faculty reasonably expect tenure to survive institutional transitions
- Public policy favors stability in academic employment
- AAUP principles recognize tenure as commitment "by institution, not by particular administration"

#### 4. *Jacobs v. Mundelein College* - Controlling Precedent

In *Jacobs*, the Illinois Appellate Court held that when Mundelein College affiliated with Loyola University, **tenured faculty contracts survived** the institutional transition because:³⁵
- Faculty handbook tenure provisions were contractually binding
- No formal financial exigency had been declared
- Affiliation did not extinguish tenure rights
- Successor institution (Loyola) bound by tenure obligations

**Application:** AEH will be **bound by MU's tenure commitments** to 680 tenured faculty unless:
- MU formally declares financial exigency (unlikely given $780M sale price), OR
- Individual faculty voluntarily resign or are terminated for cause

#### 5. NLRA Successorship Doctrine (Union Context)

While MU faculty are not unionized, NLRA successorship principles provide analogous guidance for employment contracts.

**NLRB v. Burns International Security Services** (406 U.S. 272 (1972))³⁶

*Rule:* Successor employer must recognize and bargain with incumbent union if:
1. Substantial continuity of business operations
2. Majority of successor's workforce are predecessor's employees

*Application:* If MU had collective bargaining agreement, AEH would be required to honor it (at least for reasonable period).

**Analogous Principle for Tenure:**
Because tenure contracts are individually negotiated but follow uniform handbook terms, successor liability principles apply similarly. AEH inherits MU's contractual obligations to each tenured faculty member.

#### 6. Practical Implications for AEH

**Cannot Modify Tenure System Unilaterally:**
- Cannot eliminate tenure for existing tenured faculty
- Cannot change dismissal procedures without faculty approval
- Cannot impose new performance standards retroactively
- Cannot convert tenured positions to at-will employment

**Options for AEH:**
1. **Honor Existing Tenure:** Continue employment of all 680 tenured faculty (safest approach)
2. **Negotiate Buyouts:** Offer voluntary separation packages (expensive: $150K-$300K per faculty)
3. **Terminate for Cause:** Individual basis only, requires extensive documentation and hearing process
4. **Declare Financial Exigency:** Requires formal board action, faculty participation, demonstration of institutional crisis (unlikely viable given $780M acquisition price)

**Litigation Risk:**
- Breach of contract claims by terminated tenured faculty
- Exposure: Back pay, front pay, reinstatement, attorneys' fees
- Duration: 3-5 years to resolution
- Per-plaintiff exposure: $300K-$1M+

### D. EEOC Discrimination Charge: Dr. Susan Chen Tenure Denial

#### 1. Factual Background

**Complainant:** Dr. Susan Chen
**Position:** Associate Professor
**Protected Classes:** Asian (race), Female (sex)
**Adverse Action:** Tenure denial (May 2024)
**Charge Filed:** August 2024
**Allegations:**
- Race discrimination (Asian candidates treated less favorably than white candidates)
- Sex discrimination (female candidates treated less favorably than male candidates)
- Retaliation (prior complaint about departmental climate, tenure denial in response)

#### 2. Title VII Legal Framework

**Statute:** Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.

**Prohibited Conduct:**
- Discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin³⁷
- Retaliation against employees who oppose discriminatory practices or participate in EEOC proceedings

**Academic Exemption:** NONE. Congress removed academia's exemption from Title VII in 1972, expressing concern about widespread discrimination against women in academia.³⁸

#### 3. Prima Facie Case - McDonnell Douglas Framework

**Traditional Four-Element Test:**³⁹

To establish prima facie case of discrimination, Dr. Chen must show:
1. **Protected Class Membership:** Asian, female ✓
2. **Qualification:** Met tenure standards (publications, teaching, service)
3. **Adverse Action:** Tenure denial ✓
4. **Disparate Treatment:** Similarly situated comparators (white males) treated more favorably

**2024-2025 Evolution:** Recent case law clarifies that McDonnell Douglas is **NOT** the exclusive path to proving discrimination.⁴⁰

*Tynes v. Florida Dept. of Corrections* (11th Cir. 2023): "A plaintiff's failure to produce a comparator is not dispositive. McDonnell Douglas was never intended to be the only option for a plaintiff to survive summary judgment."⁴¹

*Ames v. Ohio Dept. of Youth Services* (Supreme Court 2025): Plaintiff can prove Title VII claim without satisfying McDonnell Douglas's three steps, so long as evidence raises reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.⁴²

**Application to Dr. Chen:**
Even if Chen lacks perfect "similarly situated" comparators, she can prevail by showing:
- Statistical disparities in tenure rates by race/sex
- Subjective criteria applied inconsistently
- Shifting justifications for denial
- Pretext evidence (reasons offered are not credible)

#### 4. Comparator Analysis

**"Similarly Situated" Standard:**
Comparators need not be identical, but should be similar in:
- Academic discipline or department
- Publication record and teaching evaluations
- Years of service
- Job responsibilities

**Evidence Dr. Chen Should Obtain:**
- Tenure success rates by race and sex (last 10 years)
- Personnel files of white male candidates granted tenure in same period
- Publication counts, citation metrics, teaching scores
- Department meeting minutes discussing tenure candidates
- Email communications regarding Chen's tenure case

**Red Flags Suggesting Discrimination:**
- White male candidates with weaker credentials granted tenure
- Subjective criteria (e.g., "collegiality") applied more strictly to Chen
- Department history of low tenure rates for Asian/female candidates
- Comments about Chen's race, sex, or accent in tenure deliberations

#### 5. Retaliation Claim - Prima Facie Case

**Three-Element Test:**⁴³

1. **Protected Activity:** Prior complaint about discrimination/harassment ✓
2. **Adverse Action:** Tenure denial ✓
3. **Causal Connection:** Temporal proximity + other evidence

**Temporal Proximity Standard:**⁴⁴

- **Very close** (days/weeks): Sufficient alone to establish causal connection
- **3-4 months:** Insufficient standing alone (requires additional evidence)
- **20+ months:** Too attenuated (requires strong additional evidence)

**Dr. Chen Timeline Analysis:**

*Hypothetical (requires fact development):*
- Prior complaint filed: [DATE NEEDED]
- Tenure denial: May 2024
- Time gap: [CALCULATION NEEDED]

**Additional Evidence of Causation:**⁴⁵
- Same decision-makers involved in both actions
- Inconsistent explanations for tenure denial
- Favorable tenure review before complaint, negative after
- Comments linking complaint to tenure decision
- Pattern of retaliation against other complainants

#### 6. University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC (1990) - Peer Review Materials

**Landmark Holding:**⁴⁶ Universities do NOT enjoy special privilege requiring showing of "particularized necessity" before peer review materials must be disclosed to EEOC.

**Principle:** Enforcement of Title VII does not infringe academic freedom because it does not "prevent the University from using any criteria it may wish to use, except those—including race, sex, and national origin—that are proscribed under Title VII."

**Application:** EEOC can compel MU to produce:
- Peer review letters for Chen and comparators
- Department meeting minutes
- Dean's tenure recommendations
- Provost's evaluations
- Faculty handbook and tenure standards

MU **cannot** assert academic freedom as basis to withhold peer review documents.

#### 7. EEOC Investigation Process and Timeline

**A. Charge Filing:**⁴⁷
- Dr. Chen filed August 2024
- Charge served on MU within 10 days
- MU required to submit Position Statement (typically 30 days)

**B. Investigation (10-11 months average):**⁴⁸
- EEOC requests documents from MU
- Interviews Chen, department chair, tenure committee members
- Analyzes tenure files for Chen and comparators
- Reviews statistical data on tenure rates

**C. Mediation Option:**⁴⁹
- Voluntary, free, confidential
- Average resolution time: 84 days (3 months)
- **MU scheduled for Q1 2026 mediation** (per facts)
- Success rate: 70-80% of cases settle

**D. Determination (after investigation):**⁵⁰

*Reasonable Cause Found:*
- EEOC issues Letter of Determination
- Invites parties to conciliation
- If conciliation fails → EEOC may litigate or issue Right to Sue letter

*No Reasonable Cause:*
- EEOC dismisses charge
- Issues Right to Sue letter
- Chen has 90 days to file lawsuit

#### 8. Settlement vs. Litigation Analysis

**A. Settlement Considerations (Mediation Q1 2026):**

**Advantages for MU/AEH:**
- Avoids publicity and reputational damage
- Faster resolution (3-6 months vs. 3-5 years)
- Lower costs ($150K-$250K settlement vs. $500K-$1M litigation costs)
- No admission of wrongdoing (confidential settlement)
- Avoids discovery of sensitive peer review materials
- No precedent for future plaintiffs

**Disadvantages:**
- Monetary payment (even if meritless claim)
- May encourage copycat claims
- Chen may demand tenure (not just money)

**B. Litigation Exposure Analysis:**

#### 9. Title VII Damages and Remedies

**A. Equitable Relief (No Caps):**⁵¹

**Back Pay:**
- Dr. Chen's salary if tenure had been granted: ~$90,000-$120,000/year
- Period: May 2024 to trial date (assume 3 years)
- **Calculation:** $100,000/year × 3 years = **$300,000**
- Includes lost benefits (health insurance, retirement contributions)

**Front Pay:**
- If reinstatement not feasible (hostile work environment)
- Future lost earnings until retirement or mitigation
- Assume 20 years to retirement at $100,000/year = **$2,000,000**
- Courts often discount to present value and likelihood of mitigation
- **Realistic range:** $500,000-$1,000,000

**Injunctive Relief:**
- Tenure awarded (most powerful remedy from Chen's perspective)
- Reinstatement to faculty position
- Expungement of denial from personnel file
- Training for tenure committee
- Monitoring of future tenure decisions

**B. Compensatory Damages (CAPPED):**⁵²

**Emotional Distress Damages:**
- Humiliation, embarrassment, anxiety, depression
- Loss of reputation in academic community
- Damage to career prospects
- **Typical range:** $50,000-$200,000

**Out-of-Pocket Expenses:**
- Job search costs
- Therapy/counseling
- Moving expenses (if forced to relocate)

**Cap for Employers with 500+ Employees:** $300,000⁵³
- Combines compensatory + punitive damages
- Does NOT include back pay or front pay
- MU has 4,090 employees → **$300,000 cap applies** ✓

**C. Punitive Damages (CAPPED):**

Available only if employer acted with **malice or reckless indifference** to Chen's federally protected rights.

Evidence suggesting punitive damages:
- Knew denial was discriminatory but proceeded anyway
- Pattern and practice of discrimination
- Failed to investigate Chen's prior complaint
- Retaliated against protected activity

**D. Attorneys' Fees:**⁵⁴
Prevailing plaintiff entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
- **Estimate:** $150,000-$300,000 (3-5 years of litigation)

#### 10. Total Litigation Exposure Calculation

| Remedy Category | Low Estimate | Mid Estimate | High Estimate |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Back Pay** | $200,000 | $300,000 | $400,000 |
| **Front Pay** | $0 | $500,000 | $1,000,000 |
| **Compensatory Damages** | $50,000 | $150,000 | $300,000 |
| **Punitive Damages** | $0 | $100,000 | $0 (subsumed in cap) |
| **Combined Cap** | — | — | **$300,000 MAX** |
| **Attorneys' Fees** | $100,000 | $200,000 | $300,000 |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | **$350,000** | **$1,000,000** | **$1,700,000** |

**Note:** Front pay awards can dramatically increase exposure, especially if Chen unable to find comparable academic position.

#### 11. Settlement Valuation

**Settlement Range Recommendation:** $150,000-$400,000

**Factors Increasing Settlement Value:**
- Strong comparator evidence (white males with weaker credentials got tenure)
- Statistical disparities (low tenure rate for Asian/female faculty)
- Prior complaint establishes retaliation claim
- Sympathetic plaintiff (stellar teaching reviews, strong publications)
- Discovery reveals discriminatory comments

**Factors Decreasing Settlement Value:**
- Legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for denial (weak publications, poor teaching)
- No similarly situated comparators granted tenure
- Chen's prior complaint unrelated to tenure process
- Long time gap between complaint and tenure denial
- Chen has comparable employment elsewhere (mitigates front pay)

#### 12. Strategic Recommendations for AEH

**Pre-Mediation Actions (Before Q1 2026):**

1. **Due Diligence Deep Dive:**
   - Review Chen's complete tenure file
   - Obtain comparator data (tenure rates by race/sex, 2014-2024)
   - Interview department chair and tenure committee (counsel-protected)
   - Assess strength of MU's rationale for denial

2. **Assess Prior Complaint:**
   - What was nature of Chen's prior complaint?
   - When filed? How handled?
   - Same decision-makers involved in tenure decision?
   - Evidence linking complaint to tenure denial?

3. **Identify Witnesses:**
   - Supportive faculty (if any)
   - Department chair
   - Dean and Provost
   - Tenure committee members

4. **Document Analysis:**
   - Peer review letters (internal and external)
   - Publication quality and impact
   - Teaching evaluations
   - Service contributions
   - Comparison to recent tenure recipients

**Mediation Strategy (Q1 2026):**

✓ **Attend with settlement authority:** $150,000-$300,000
✓ **Opening position:** No discrimination, legitimate denial based on merit
✓ **Fallback positions:**
- Offer severance without admission of wrongdoing: $100,000-$150,000
- If strong evidence of discrimination: $250,000-$350,000
- Include confidentiality, non-disparagement, release of all claims
✓ **Reject tenure as remedy:** Too disruptive, undermines academic standards
✓ **Emphasize fresh start:** Chen benefits from moving to institution that values her work

**If Mediation Fails:**

- Prepare for 10-month EEOC investigation
- Anticipate document requests (peer review, comparators, policies)
- Expect witness interviews
- Budget for litigation defense: $500,000-$1,000,000
- Consider second settlement negotiation after reasonable cause determination

#### 13. Successor Liability for Pending EEOC Charge

**Critical Issue:** Does AEH inherit liability for Chen's discrimination claim against MU?

**Answer:** **YES** (with qualifications).⁵⁵

**Rationale:**
- Discrimination occurred pre-acquisition (tenure denial May 2024)
- AEH is successor employer with substantial continuity
- Title VII liability follows business operations
- Chen's continued employment relationship (if any) transfers to AEH

**AEH's Obligations:**
1. Participate in EEOC mediation (Q1 2026)
2. Produce documents requested by EEOC
3. Negotiate settlement on behalf of predecessor
4. Defend litigation if charge proceeds

**Indemnification:**
- Purchase Agreement should allocate Chen claim to MU (seller)
- Escrow funds to cover settlement/judgment
- MU's D&O insurance may cover claim (review policy)

**Reputation Risk:**
- Settlement preferable to avoid publicity
- Litigation would reveal MU's tenure practices
- Negative press could harm AEH's enrollment and recruiting

---

### E. Union and Collective Bargaining Considerations

#### 1. Current Status - No Faculty Union

**Factual Background:**
- MU faculty are **NOT unionized**
- Faculty Senate exists but is **NOT a labor union** under NLRA
- Faculty Senate follows AAUP principles (shared governance, not collective bargaining)
- No collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in place

**Implication:** AEH does **NOT** inherit union recognition or bargaining obligations.

#### 2. NLRA Successorship Doctrine (For Context)

Even though MU has no union, understanding successorship principles is critical in case staff or graduate students are unionized.

**NLRB v. Burns International Security Services** (1972):⁵⁶

**Rule:** Successor employer must recognize and bargain with incumbent union if:
1. **Substantial continuity** of business operations
2. **Majority** of successor's workforce are predecessor's employees

**Obligations of Successor:**⁵⁷
- Must recognize union as bargaining representative
- Must bargain in good faith over terms and conditions of employment
- **NOT** required to adopt predecessor's CBA terms
- Must honor CBA until reasonable opportunity to negotiate new agreement (6-12 months)

**Application to Project Athena:**
- If staff employees (2,850) have union → AEH must recognize
- If graduate student employees unionized → AEH must bargain

#### 3. NLRB v. Yeshiva University (1980) - Managerial Faculty Exception

**Issue:** Are university faculty "employees" under NLRA with right to unionize?

**Holding:** Tenured and tenure-track faculty at private universities may be "managerial employees" excluded from NLRA coverage if they exercise substantial control over:⁵⁸
- Curriculum
- Academic standards
- Admissions policies
- Faculty hiring and tenure decisions
- University budget

**MU Faculty Analysis:**

**Factors Suggesting Managerial Status (No NLRA Rights):**
- Faculty Senate has authority over curriculum
- Tenure decisions made by faculty committees
- Substantial shared governance (AAUP model)
- Faculty participation in budget planning
- Peer review of faculty hiring

**Factors Suggesting Employee Status (NLRA Rights):**
- For-profit ownership under AEH (corporatized governance)
- Reduced faculty authority post-acquisition
- Administration makes final decisions
- Standardized online curriculum (less faculty control)

**2014 Update - Pacific Lutheran University Decision:**⁵⁹

NLRB held that party asserting managerial status must prove **actual authority** (not just handbook provisions). Given increasing corporatization of higher education, more faculty qualify as NLRA-covered employees.

**Practical Assessment:**
- MU tenured faculty likely qualify as "managerial" (no union rights)
- Non-tenure-track faculty (560) likely qualify as "employees" (can unionize)
- Post-acquisition corporatization may shift more faculty to "employee" status

#### 4. Non-Tenure-Track Faculty Unionization Risk

**Growing Trend:** Contingent faculty unionization increasing nationwide⁶⁰
- Adjunct faculty at private universities organizing
- NLRB more receptive to adjunct union petitions
- Grievances over pay, job security, benefits

**MU's 560 Non-Tenure-Track Faculty:**
- Likely **NOT** managerial under Yeshiva
- Eligible for NLRA protection
- Could petition NLRB for union election post-acquisition

**Unionization Risk Factors:**
- Pay disparities between tenure-track and adjunct faculty
- Job insecurity (year-to-year contracts)
- Lack of benefits
- Perception of corporatization under AEH
- Loss of shared governance voice

**AEH Mitigation Strategies:**
- Improve adjunct pay and benefits proactively
- Offer multi-year contracts (not tenure, but stability)
- Include non-tenure-track faculty in governance
- Avoid unfair labor practices during transition

#### 5. Graduate Student Employees - NLRB Jurisdiction

**Columbia University Decision (2016):**⁶¹ NLRB reversed prior precedent and held that graduate student assistants at private universities are "employees" under NLRA.

**Coverage:**
- Teaching assistants (TAs)
- Research assistants (RAs)
- Grading assistants

**MU Graduate Students:**
- Likely employs 200-500 graduate TAs/RAs
- All are NLRA-covered employees with unionization rights

**Successor Obligation:**
If MU graduate students are unionized, AEH must:
- Recognize union
- Bargain in good faith
- Honor CBA terms (for reasonable period)

**Due Diligence Action:** Determine whether MU graduate students have union or pending union petition.

#### 6. Staff Employees - Potential Union Coverage

**2,850 Staff Positions:**
- Administration (President's office, deans, registrar)
- Student services (admissions, financial aid, counseling)
- Facilities (maintenance, custodial, groundskeeping)
- Athletics (coaches, trainers, sports information)
- Auxiliary services (dining, bookstore, housing)

**Union Analysis by Category:**

| Employee Group | Likely Union Status | Successor Obligation |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Facilities/Maintenance | HIGH (often unionized) | Recognize union, bargain |
| Dining Services | MODERATE (if outsourced) | Depends on contractor |
| Clerical/Admin | LOW-MODERATE | Investigate |
| Athletics Coaches | LOW (managerial) | None |
| Security/Police | MODERATE-HIGH | Investigate |

**Due Diligence Requirement:**
- Obtain list of all collective bargaining agreements
- Review CBA terms (wages, benefits, seniority, grievance)
- Identify CBA expiration dates
- Calculate successor liability (wage increases, benefits, pension)

#### 7. Shared Governance vs. Collective Bargaining

**AAUP Position:**⁶² "Collective bargaining is not incompatible with shared governance principles."

**Dual-Track Model:**
- **Faculty Senate:** Academic policies, curriculum, tenure standards
- **Faculty Union:** Economic issues, wages, benefits, workload

**MU's Faculty Senate:**
- Currently handles both academic and economic advocacy
- Not a union, so no legal bargaining power
- Faculty dissatisfaction with Senate could trigger unionization drive

**Post-Acquisition Risk:**
- If AEH diminishes Faculty Senate authority → unionization more likely
- If AEH imposes top-down changes → faculty organize for collective power
- For-profit model perceived as threat to academic values → union appeal increases

---

### F. Shared Governance and AAUP Contractual Obligations

#### 1. AAUP Principles and Faculty Handbooks

**1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities:**⁶³

Calls for **shared responsibility** among:
- **Governing board:** Fiduciary oversight, long-term planning, CEO selection
- **Administration:** Day-to-day operations, budget execution, external relations
- **Faculty:** Curriculum, instruction, research, faculty status (hiring, tenure, promotion)

**Areas of Primary Faculty Responsibility:**⁶⁴
- Curriculum design and pedagogy
- Grading standards and academic integrity
- Degree requirements
- Faculty appointments, reappointments, and tenure decisions
- Research priorities and academic freedom

#### 2. Faculty Handbook as Binding Contract

As established in Section IV.B, faculty handbooks incorporating AAUP principles are **enforceable contracts** in most jurisdictions.⁶⁵

**If MU Faculty Handbook States:**
- "Shared governance consistent with AAUP guidelines"
- "Faculty Senate has authority over curriculum and academic policies"
- "Tenure decisions made by faculty peer review committees"

**Then AEH is Contractually Bound to:**
- Preserve Faculty Senate structure and authority
- Consult faculty on curriculum changes
- Maintain peer review process for tenure

#### 3. Legal Consequences of Eliminating Shared Governance

**Breach of Contract Claims:**⁶⁶
If AEH unilaterally:
- Eliminates Faculty Senate
- Transfers curricular authority to administration
- Imposes top-down academic policies
- Removes faculty from tenure committees

**Then Faculty Can Sue for:**
- Breach of employment contract
- Declaratory judgment (handbook terms enforceable)
- Injunctive relief (restore Faculty Senate)
- Damages (loss of academic freedom)

**Precedent:** Courts have enforced faculty handbook provisions on governance, holding that universities must follow their own stated procedures.⁶⁷

#### 4. Shared Governance in For-Profit Conversion

**Unique Challenge:** MU converting from nonprofit (community-serving) to for-profit (shareholder-serving).

**Faculty Concerns:**
- Profit motive conflicts with academic mission
- Pressure to increase enrollment at expense of standards
- Curriculum driven by market demand, not educational value
- Faculty autonomy subordinated to corporate efficiency

**AAUP 2024 Survey:**⁶⁸ Recent legislation at state institutions curtails faculty senate authority, relegating them to "merely advisory or consultative roles."

**Application to AEH:**
- Faculty will resist transition to for-profit governance
- Expect faculty resolutions opposing corporate control
- Media coverage framing acquisition as "corporatization of education"
- Potential accreditation scrutiny (HLC requires faculty governance)

#### 5. Accreditation Requirements - Higher Learning Commission (HLC)

**HLC Criterion 5.A:**⁶⁹ "The institution's governance and administrative structures promote effective leadership and support collaborative processes that enable the institution to fulfill its mission."

**Faculty Role in Accreditation:**
- HLC expects faculty to participate in institutional decision-making
- Accreditation teams interview faculty about governance effectiveness
- Lack of shared governance can jeopardize accreditation

**Risk for AEH:**
If AEH eliminates Faculty Senate or marginalizes faculty input:
- HLC may place MU on probation
- Could require focused visit to assess governance
- In extreme cases, withdraw accreditation (catastrophic for enrollment and federal aid)

**Recommendation:** Maintain robust faculty governance to preserve HLC accreditation.

#### 6. Practical Balance - Shared Governance in For-Profit Context

**AEH's Business Objectives:**
- Increase operational efficiency
- Standardize curriculum (for scalability)
- Reduce costs (particularly faculty salaries and benefits)
- Grow enrollment (online programs, non-traditional students)
- Generate returns for investors

**Faculty Governance Interests:**
- Academic freedom and autonomy
- Rigorous admission standards
- Small class sizes and personalized instruction
- Faculty research and scholarship
- Tenure protections

**Strategies for AEH:**

✓ **Preserve Faculty Senate:**
- Retain Faculty Senate as advisory body (meets handbook obligations)
- Consult on curriculum, tenure, and academic policies (required)
- Reserve final decision-making to administration (business judgment)

✓ **Clarify Decision-Making Authority:**
- Faculty recommend (curriculum, tenure) → Administration decides
- Transparent process reduces conflict
- Document reasons when overriding faculty recommendations

✓ **Invest in Faculty Relations:**
- Town halls explaining for-profit transition
- Faculty representation on AEH board (non-voting observer)
- Competitive compensation to retain quality faculty

✓ **Avoid Unilateral Changes:**
- Consult Faculty Senate before major policy shifts
- Phase in changes gradually (not abrupt post-acquisition)
- Frame changes as "mission enhancement" not "cost-cutting"

---

### G. Employee Benefits and ERISA Compliance

#### 1. Retirement Plan Transition: 403(b) to 401(k)

**Current State (MU as Nonprofit):**
- IRC § 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans⁷⁰
- Available only to 501(c)(3) organizations and public schools
- Employee contributions (pre-tax and Roth)
- May include employer matching contributions
- Typically lower administrative costs than 401(k)

**Post-Acquisition (AEH as For-Profit):**
- MU loses 501(c)(3) status upon acquisition
- 403(b) plans **NO LONGER available**⁷¹
- Must convert to IRC § 401(k) plan

#### 2. 403(b) to 401(k) Conversion Process

**Legal Authority:**⁷²
Nonprofits can transition from 403(b) to 401(k). Conversion involves:
- Amending or terminating existing 403(b) plan
- Establishing new 401(k) plan
- Transferring participant balances (tax-free rollover)

**Timeline:**
- Effective date of MU's loss of tax-exempt status (acquisition closing)
- 403(b) plan must be frozen or terminated
- 401(k) plan established within 12 months

**Employee Impact:**
- **Positive:** Access to wider range of investment options⁷³
- **Positive:** 401(k) may offer lower fees (depending on provider)
- **Neutral:** Contribution limits same ($23,000 in 2024, age 50+ catch-up $7,500)
- **Negative:** Potential administrative disruption during transition

**Employer Cost:**
- 401(k) plans subject to more stringent ERISA requirements
- Annual Form 5500 filing required
- Nondiscrimination testing (ADP/ACP tests)
- Increased administrative and compliance costs

#### 3. ERISA Applicability

**403(b) ERISA Status:**⁷⁴
- If MU's 403(b) has minimal employer involvement → NOT subject to ERISA (safe harbor exemption)
- If employer contributions or active administration → subject to ERISA

**401(k) ERISA Status:**
- **ALL** 401(k) plans are subject to ERISA⁷⁵
- Fiduciary obligations (ERISA § 404(a))
- Plan document requirements
- Summary Plan Description (SPD) distribution
- Annual reporting (Form 5500)
- Participant disclosures (fee disclosure, quarterly statements)

#### 4. Defined Benefit Pension Plans - Due Diligence Critical

**Question:** Does MU sponsor traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plan?

**If YES:**
- DB plans provide guaranteed monthly retirement income (e.g., 2% × years of service × final average salary)
- Employer bears investment risk and longevity risk
- **Funding obligation:** Employer must contribute annually to ensure plan is adequately funded
- **PBGC insurance:** Private sector DB plans covered by Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation

**Successor Liability:**⁷⁶
- DB pension obligations transfer to successor employer
- AEH would inherit:
  - Accrued pension liabilities (present value of future payments)
  - Ongoing funding obligations
  - PBGC premiums
  - Fiduciary responsibilities

**Multiemployer Plan Withdrawal Liability:**⁷⁷
If MU participates in multiemployer pension plan (union-negotiated plan covering multiple employers):
- Withdrawal triggers liability for MU's share of plan's unfunded vested benefits
- Can be **tens of millions of dollars** depending on plan funding status
- 29 U.S.C. § 1381 (ERISA § 4201)

**Due Diligence Action:**
- Obtain Schedule B (Actuarial Information) from MU's most recent Form 5500
- Calculate funded status (assets ÷ liabilities)
- If underfunded → AEH inherits liability to make up shortfall
- Demand indemnification or escrow in Purchase Agreement

#### 5. Welfare Benefit Plans

**Health Insurance:**
- Group health plan (medical, dental, vision)
- ERISA compliance: COBRA, HIPAA, ACA
- **Successor obligation:** Continue coverage for active employees (or offer comparable substitute)

**Life and Disability Insurance:**
- Typically ERISA-covered welfare benefit plans
- Successor must continue coverage or provide alternative

**Severance Plans:**
- If MU has formal severance policy → ERISA "welfare benefit plan"
- Successor may inherit obligation to pay severance per policy terms

#### 6. COBRA Continuation Coverage

**29 U.S.C. § 1161 et seq.:**⁷⁸
Employees losing health coverage due to qualifying event entitled to continue coverage (at employee's expense) for:
- 18 months (termination or reduced hours)
- 36 months (divorce, death, dependent aging out)

**Acquisition as Qualifying Event:**
- If AEH terminates employees post-acquisition → COBRA rights triggered
- AEH must provide COBRA election notices
- Failure to provide notice: $110/day penalty per affected individual

#### 7. Controlled Group Liability

**ERISA § 4001(b):**⁷⁹ Employers under common control treated as single employer for pension liability purposes.

**Application:**
- If AEH owns multiple educational institutions → all part of controlled group
- Underfunded pension at MU can create liability for entire AEH group
- Pension withdrawal liability can trigger "cross-default" affecting sister institutions

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Structure acquisition to avoid controlled group aggregation (difficult)
- Terminate/freeze DB plan before closing (requires negotiation)
- Negotiate seller indemnity for pre-closing pension underfunding

#### 8. SECURE 2.0 Act (2022) - Recent Changes

**Effective 2024:**⁸⁰
- ERISA long-term part-time employee rules expanded to 403(b) plans
- Employees working 500+ hours/year for 2 consecutive years must be eligible for plan participation
- **Impact:** More adjunct faculty and part-time staff eligible for retirement benefits

**Effective 2025:**⁸¹
- Automatic enrollment required for new 401(k) plans adopted after 2024
- Employees automatically enrolled at 3-10% contribution rate (can opt out)
- Exception: Employers with ≤10 employees or <3 years in business

**Recommendation:** AEH's new 401(k) plan should include auto-enrollment to comply with SECURE 2.0.

#### 9. Employee Benefits Due Diligence Checklist

**Pre-Closing Actions:**

✓ **Retirement Plans:**
- [ ] Obtain copy of all retirement plan documents (403(b), 401(k), 457(b), DB pension)
- [ ] Review most recent Form 5500 filings (3 years)
- [ ] Actuarial valuation for DB plans (Schedule B)
- [ ] Confirm ERISA vs. non-ERISA status of 403(b)
- [ ] Check for multiemployer plan participation (withdrawal liability)

✓ **Health and Welfare Plans:**
- [ ] Group health plan documents (summary plan description)
- [ ] Verify ACA compliance (employer shared responsibility)
- [ ] Confirm COBRA administration
- [ ] Review life/disability/supplemental insurance policies

✓ **Compliance:**
- [ ] Review nondiscrimination testing results (ADP/ACP tests)
- [ ] Check for IRS or DOL audit history
- [ ] Confirm timely Form 5500 filings
- [ ] Verify employee contributions remitted timely (DOL wage and hour)

✓ **Transition Planning:**
- [ ] Employee communication strategy (benefits during transition)
- [ ] COBRA notice to terminated employees
- [ ] Blackout notice if plan freeze/conversion (30 days advance)
- [ ] Select 401(k) provider and establish new plan
- [ ] Arrange tax-free rollover of 403(b) balances to 401(k)

---

### H. Non-Tenure-Track Faculty and At-Will Staff

#### 1. Non-Tenure-Track Faculty (560 Employees)

**Employment Status:**
- Adjunct professors: Semester-by-semester contracts (at-will)
- Visiting faculty: 1-3 year contracts (term-limited)
- Lecturers: May have multi-year contracts with renewal expectations

**Contractual Rights:**
If multi-year contracts:
- Must be honored through expiration date (or severance paid)
- Renewal expectations may create implied contract
- Some states recognize "de facto tenure" after long service (10+ years)

**At-Will Employment:**
If no contract or contract expired:
- Can be terminated at any time, for any lawful reason
- No notice required (except WARN Act if mass layoff)
- Severance discretionary (unless handbook policy promises severance)

**Risks:**
- Discrimination claims (Title VII, ADEA, ADA)
- Breach of implied contract (if established pattern of renewal)
- Quantum meruit claims (if teaching assignments revoked mid-semester)

#### 2. Staff Employees (2,850)

**Presumed At-Will:**
Absent employment contract, staff are at-will employees who can be terminated for any lawful reason.

**Exceptions to At-Will:**
- **Union employees:** CBA protects against termination without just cause
- **Individual employment contracts:** Executives, coaches, senior administrators may have multi-year contracts with termination provisions
- **Implied contract:** Handbook language promising "permanent employment" or "termination only for cause" may create contractual rights

**Handbook Disclaimers:**
Most handbooks include disclaimer: "Employment is at-will and may be terminated at any time by either party."

**Enforceability:** Varies by state. Some courts enforce disclaimers; others find implied contract despite disclaimer.

#### 3. Reductions in Force (RIF) - Best Practices

If AEH plans post-acquisition workforce reductions:

**Legal Compliance:**
- WARN Act notice (if thresholds met)
- ADEA notice (Older Workers Benefit Protection Act)
- COBRA notice
- State-specific laws (e.g., Cal-WARN in California)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Objective, job-related factors (performance, seniority, qualifications)
- Avoid criteria that disproportionately impact protected classes (age, race, sex)
- Document selection process (spreadsheet showing rationale for each decision)

**Disparate Impact Analysis:**
Before implementing RIF, analyze impact on protected groups:
- Calculate percentage of each protected class selected for layoff
- Compare to percentage in overall workforce
- If disparity exists, assess whether business necessity justifies

**Example:**
| Group | % of Workforce | % of RIF | Disparity? |
|-------|----------------|----------|------------|
| Age 40+ | 60% | 80% | **YES** (potential ADEA violation) |
| Female | 45% | 47% | NO |
| Minority | 30% | 35% | Possible |

**Release Agreements:**
- Offer severance in exchange for release of all claims
- ADEA-compliant release (21-day consideration period, 7-day revocation period)
- List of job titles and ages of employees selected and not selected (OWBPA requirement)

#### 4. Unemployment Insurance

**Employer Obligation:**
- Employers pay state unemployment taxes (SUTA)
- Terminated employees eligible for unemployment benefits (unless terminated for misconduct)
- Employer's SUTA rate increases if many employees file UI claims

**Cost of Layoffs:**
- If 500 employees laid off, most will claim unemployment
- AEH's UI tax rate will increase in following years
- Budget for increased SUTA costs in financial model

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Critical Employment Law Risks

#### 1. **HIGH RISK: Tenure Contract Liability**

**Exposure:** 680 tenured faculty with contractual right to continued employment

**Risk Level:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

**Rationale:**
- Faculty handbook tenure provisions binding contract (majority rule)
- Successor liability attaches (de facto merger doctrine)
- $780M acquisition price negates financial exigency defense
- Breach of contract litigation: $300K-$1M per faculty member

**Mitigation:**
- Honor all existing tenure commitments
- Do NOT attempt to modify tenure system unilaterally
- Terminate only for documented cause (with full hearing process)
- Budget for 680 tenured faculty salaries (~$61M-$82M annually)

#### 2. **HIGH RISK: EEOC Charge (Dr. Chen)**

**Exposure:** $350K-$1.7M (back pay, front pay, compensatory damages, attorneys' fees)

**Risk Level:** 🟠 **HIGH**

**Rationale:**
- Prima facie case likely established (protected class, adverse action, potential comparators)
- Retaliation claim strengthens case (prior complaint, causal connection)
- University of Pennsylvania precedent: no academic freedom privilege for peer review materials
- Negative publicity harms AEH's reputation and enrollment

**Mitigation:**
- Settle in Q1 2026 mediation for $150K-$400K
- Include confidentiality and release of all claims
- Conduct thorough due diligence on comparator data before mediation
- Avoid precedent-setting tenure award (cash settlement preferable)

#### 3. **MODERATE RISK: WARN Act Compliance**

**Exposure:** $4M-$8M (if mass layoff without 60-day notice)

**Risk Level:** 🟡 **MODERATE**

**Rationale:**
- MU covered employer (4,090 employees)
- Mass layoff threshold: 500+ employees OR 50+ constituting 33% of workforce
- Post-acquisition cost-cutting may trigger layoffs
- No exceptions apply (faltering company, unforeseeable circumstances)

**Mitigation:**
- Provide full 60-day WARN notice if ANY layoffs planned
- Notice to employees, Indiana DWD (warn-notice@dwd.in.gov), local officials
- Budget for 60-day salary continuation during notice period
- Consider phased reductions (below 50/period) to avoid triggering thresholds

#### 4. **MODERATE RISK: Non-Tenure-Track Faculty Unionization**

**Exposure:** Ongoing bargaining obligations, wage increases, reduced flexibility

**Risk Level:** 🟡 **MODERATE**

**Rationale:**
- 560 non-tenure-track faculty likely NOT "managerial" under Yeshiva
- NLRA-covered employees eligible to unionize
- For-profit conversion and cost-cutting increase union appeal
- Pacific Lutheran decision (2014) expanded unionization rights

**Mitigation:**
- Improve adjunct compensation and benefits proactively
- Multi-year contracts for adjuncts (job security without tenure)
- Include non-tenure-track faculty in shared governance
- Avoid unfair labor practices during transition (no threats, interrogation, surveillance)

#### 5. **MODERATE RISK: Shared Governance Breach of Contract**

**Exposure:** Class action by faculty challenging elimination of Faculty Senate

**Risk Level:** 🟡 **MODERATE**

**Rationale:**
- Faculty handbook likely incorporates AAUP shared governance principles
- Contractually binding on AEH as successor
- Unilateral elimination of Faculty Senate = breach of contract
- Accreditation risk (HLC requires faculty governance)

**Mitigation:**
- Preserve Faculty Senate as advisory body (consult, but AEH decides)
- Phase in governance changes gradually with faculty input
- Avoid sudden post-acquisition elimination of faculty authority
- Frame changes as "mission enhancement" not "corporate control"

#### 6. **LOW-MODERATE RISK: Defined Benefit Pension Underfunding**

**Exposure:** $5M-$50M+ (if MU sponsors underfunded DB plan)

**Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW** (if no DB plan) / 🟠 **HIGH** (if DB plan exists)

**Rationale:**
- Successor inherits DB pension obligations
- Underfunded plan requires ongoing contributions to reach full funding
- PBGC premiums and compliance costs
- Multiemployer plan withdrawal liability can be massive

**Mitigation:**
- **DUE DILIGENCE:** Obtain Schedule B actuarial reports (Form 5500)
- Calculate funded status and withdrawal liability
- Negotiate seller indemnity or escrow for pension underfunding
- Consider plan freeze or termination before closing (requires negotiation)

#### 7. **LOW RISK: Graduate Student Union**

**Exposure:** Bargaining obligations, wage increases, reduced TA/RA flexibility

**Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW**

**Rationale:**
- Graduate TAs/RAs are NLRA-covered employees (Columbia decision 2016)
- Can unionize and bargain collectively
- Successor must recognize union if one exists

**Mitigation:**
- Determine whether MU graduate students unionized (due diligence)
- If union exists, recognize and bargain in good faith
- If no union, improve stipends and benefits proactively to avoid unionization drive

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Legal Conclusions

#### 1. WARN Act Applicability

**CONCLUSION:** American Education Holdings and Midwest University are **subject to federal WARN Act** requirements. No exemption exists for educational institutions or faculty employees. Indiana has no state mini-WARN Act.

**Triggers:** 60-day notice required if:
- 500+ employees laid off (any percentage), OR
- 50+ employees laid off constituting 33% of workforce (1,350 for MU)

**Exposure:** $4M-$8M if mass layoff conducted without proper notice.

#### 2. Tenure Rights and Successor Liability

**CONCLUSION:** AEH will **inherit contractual tenure obligations** for all 680 tenured faculty members. Faculty handbooks are enforceable contracts in most jurisdictions, and successor liability doctrine applies to for-profit acquisitions.

**Key Precedent:** *Jacobs v. Mundelein College* (1993) - tenure rights survived institutional affiliation.

**Implication:** AEH **cannot unilaterally eliminate tenure**, modify dismissal procedures, or terminate tenured faculty without cause or financial exigency (which cannot be claimed given $780M acquisition price).

**Exposure:** $200M-$680M if tenured faculty terminated in breach of contract ($300K-$1M per plaintiff × 680 faculty).

#### 3. Dr. Chen EEOC Charge

**CONCLUSION:** Dr. Chen has **viable discrimination and retaliation claims** under Title VII. Prima facie case likely established. Mediation scheduled Q1 2026 presents settlement opportunity.

**Litigation Risk:** $350K-$1.7M (back pay, front pay, compensatory damages capped at $300K, attorneys' fees).

**Recommendation:** Settle for $150K-$400K in confidential agreement with release of all claims.

#### 4. Shared Governance Obligations

**CONCLUSION:** Faculty handbook provisions on shared governance are **contractually binding**. AEH must preserve Faculty Senate and consult on academic policies, though final decision-making authority can be reserved to administration.

**Accreditation Risk:** Higher Learning Commission requires meaningful faculty governance. Elimination of Faculty Senate could jeopardize accreditation.

**Exposure:** $1M-$5M in breach of contract litigation; loss of accreditation (catastrophic).

#### 5. Unionization and Collective Bargaining

**CONCLUSION:** Tenured/tenure-track faculty likely qualify as "managerial employees" under *Yeshiva* and cannot unionize. Non-tenure-track faculty (560), graduate student TAs/RAs (200-500), and staff (2,850) are NLRA-covered employees eligible to organize.

**Risk:** Post-acquisition cost-cutting and corporatization increase unionization likelihood, particularly among contingent faculty.

**Exposure:** $5M-$15M ongoing (wage increases, reduced management flexibility).

#### 6. Employee Benefits and ERISA

**CONCLUSION:** 403(b) retirement plan must convert to 401(k) upon loss of tax-exempt status. All 401(k) plans subject to ERISA. If MU sponsors defined benefit pension, AEH inherits funding obligations and potential withdrawal liability.

**Critical Due Diligence:** Obtain actuarial valuation (Form 5500 Schedule B) for any DB plan. Multiemployer plan withdrawal liability can exceed $50M.

---

### B. Strategic Recommendations for American Education Holdings

#### Priority 1: Honor Tenure Commitments (CRITICAL)

✅ **Action:** Publicly commit to honoring all existing tenure contracts.

**Rationale:**
- Avoids $200M-$680M litigation exposure
- Maintains faculty morale and institutional stability
- Protects accreditation status
- Signals good faith to regulators and community

**Implementation:**
- Include in acquisition announcement: "AEH will honor tenure for all current tenured faculty"
- Meet with faculty leadership to confirm commitment
- Budget for 680 tenured faculty positions (~$68M-$82M annually)

**Alternative (High Risk, Not Recommended):**
- Attempt mass termination → class action litigation, loss of accreditation, negative publicity

---

#### Priority 2: Settle Dr. Chen EEOC Charge (HIGH)

✅ **Action:** Enter Q1 2026 mediation with authority to settle for $150K-$400K.

**Pre-Mediation Due Diligence:**
- Review Chen's tenure file and compare to recent tenure recipients
- Obtain data on tenure rates by race/sex (2014-2024)
- Assess strength of retaliation claim (timing of prior complaint)
- Interview tenure committee members (privileged)

**Mediation Strategy:**
- Opening offer: $100K-$150K (severance without admission of wrongdoing)
- Authorized range: Up to $350K if strong evidence of discrimination
- Include: Confidentiality, non-disparagement, release of all claims, neutral reference
- **Reject:** Tenure as remedy (sets precedent, undermines academic standards)

**If Mediation Fails:**
- Budget $500K-$1M for litigation defense
- Anticipate EEOC document requests (peer review materials, comparator files)
- Consider second settlement attempt after reasonable cause determination

---

#### Priority 3: WARN Act Compliance (MODERATE)

✅ **Action:** Provide full 60-day notice for ANY post-acquisition layoffs triggering thresholds.

**Triggering Events:**
- 50+ employees laid off AND constitutes 33% of workforce (1,350+ for MU), OR
- 500+ employees laid off (any percentage)

**Notice Requirements:**
- Written notice to affected employees (or union representative)
- Notice to Indiana Department of Workforce Development: warn-notice@dwd.in.gov
- Notice to chief elected official of local government

**Timeline:**
- Day 0: Finalize layoff decision
- Day 1-5: Prepare notices (legal review)
- Day 5: Deliver notices
- Day 65: Earliest permissible separation date

**Cost-Benefit:**
- Cost of compliance: 60 days' salary (already budgeted for transition)
- Cost of violation: $4M-$8M+ (back pay, penalties, attorneys' fees)
- **Recommendation:** Always provide notice unless clearly below thresholds

**Alternative (Lower Risk):**
- Phase workforce reductions over multiple 30-day periods (below 50/period) to avoid trigger

---

#### Priority 4: Preserve Shared Governance (MODERATE)

✅ **Action:** Maintain Faculty Senate as advisory body; consult on academic policies; reserve final decision to administration.

**Faculty Handbook Compliance:**
- Review MU faculty handbook for shared governance provisions
- If handbook references AAUP principles → contractually binding
- AEH cannot unilaterally eliminate Faculty Senate without faculty approval

**Recommended Model:**
- **Faculty Senate:** Recommends on curriculum, tenure, academic standards
- **Administration:** Makes final decisions after considering faculty input
- **Transparency:** Document rationale when overriding faculty recommendations

**Accreditation Compliance:**
- Higher Learning Commission (HLC) requires meaningful faculty participation in governance
- Accreditation site visit will interview faculty about governance effectiveness
- Loss of accreditation = loss of federal student aid eligibility (catastrophic)

**Faculty Relations Strategy:**
- Town halls explaining for-profit transition and governance structure
- Faculty representation on AEH advisory board (non-voting)
- Competitive compensation to retain top faculty
- Avoid sudden, unilateral policy changes post-acquisition

---

#### Priority 5: Mitigate Unionization Risk (MODERATE)

✅ **Action:** Improve pay/benefits for non-tenure-track faculty and staff proactively; avoid unfair labor practices during transition.

**High-Risk Groups:**
- **Non-tenure-track faculty (560):** Low pay, job insecurity, no benefits → high union appeal
- **Graduate TAs/RAs (200-500):** NLRA-covered employees (*Columbia* decision 2016)
- **Facilities/maintenance staff:** Often unionized

**Proactive Measures:**
- Increase adjunct faculty pay to market rates
- Offer multi-year contracts (3-5 years) for non-tenure-track faculty
- Extend benefits (health insurance, retirement) to adjuncts working 20+ hours/week
- Include non-tenure-track faculty in governance (committee service, voting rights)

**Union Avoidance (Legal):**
- Avoid unfair labor practices: No threats, interrogation, promises, or surveillance ("TIPS")
- Do NOT threaten to eliminate positions if employees unionize
- Do NOT promise benefits if employees reject union
- Do NOT interrogate employees about union sympathies
- Do NOT surveil union organizing activities

**If Union Petition Filed:**
- Consult labor counsel immediately
- Communicate lawfully with employees about union implications
- Prepare for NLRB election process
- If union certified → recognize and bargain in good faith

---

#### Priority 6: Employee Benefits Due Diligence (HIGH if DB Plan)

✅ **Action:** Immediately investigate whether MU sponsors defined benefit pension plan and calculate funding status.

**Critical Questions:**
1. Does MU have DB pension plan? (Review Form 5500)
2. What is funded status? (Assets ÷ liabilities from Schedule B)
3. Is MU in multiemployer pension plan? (Withdrawal liability exposure)
4. What is PBGC premium obligation?

**If DB Plan Underfunded:**
- Negotiate seller indemnity for pre-closing underfunding
- Escrow portion of purchase price to cover shortfall
- Consider freezing or terminating plan before closing (requires PBGC approval, employee notice)

**If Multiemployer Plan:**
- Calculate withdrawal liability under ERISA § 4201
- Can exceed $50M depending on plan's unfunded vested benefits
- Structure transaction to minimize withdrawal liability (asset purchase vs. stock purchase)

**403(b) to 401(k) Conversion:**
- Establish new 401(k) plan (must include auto-enrollment per SECURE 2.0)
- Notify employees of plan termination/conversion
- Arrange tax-free rollover of 403(b) balances
- Select low-cost provider with diverse investment options

---

### C. Workforce Restructuring Guidelines (If Cost-Cutting Required)

If AEH determines workforce reductions necessary for financial viability:

#### Step 1: Establish Objective Criteria

- **Performance-based:** Documented performance reviews, student evaluations
- **Seniority-based:** Length of service (LIFO)
- **Qualifications-based:** Credentials, certifications, specialized skills
- **Position-based:** Eliminate redundant positions, consolidate departments

**AVOID:**
- Subjective criteria ("attitude," "collegiality")
- Criteria that disproportionately impact protected classes (age, race, sex)

#### Step 2: Conduct Disparate Impact Analysis

Before finalizing layoff list, analyze impact on protected groups:

| Protected Class | % of Workforce | % of Layoff | Disparity? | Justification |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Age 40+ | 60% | 58% | NO | Within tolerance |
| Age 50+ | 35% | 45% | **YES** | Review: ADEA risk |
| Female | 52% | 51% | NO | — |
| Minority | 28% | 30% | Possible | Review criteria |
| Disability | 8% | 12% | **YES** | Review: ADA risk |

**If disparity found:** Revise selection criteria or document business necessity.

#### Step 3: WARN Act Compliance

Calculate whether layoffs trigger WARN:
- 50-499 employees AND ≥33% of workforce? → Notice required
- 500+ employees? → Notice required
- Below thresholds? → No notice required (but good practice to provide)

Provide 60-day notice to:
- Affected employees
- Indiana DWD (warn-notice@dwd.in.gov)
- Local government officials

#### Step 4: Severance and Release Agreements

**Offer severance** in exchange for release of all claims:
- **Amount:** 1-2 weeks' pay per year of service (industry standard)
- **OWBPA compliance** (Age Discrimination):
  - 21-day consideration period
  - 7-day revocation period
  - List of ages/titles of employees selected and not selected for layoff
- **Release scope:** All federal/state employment claims (Title VII, ADEA, ADA, state law)

**Sample severance package:**
- Employee with 10 years' service: 10-20 weeks' severance
- COBRA subsidy (3-6 months)
- Outplacement services
- Neutral reference letter

#### Step 5: COBRA Notices

Within 14 days of termination, provide COBRA election notice:
- 18 months' continuation coverage (employee pays premium)
- Failure to provide notice: $110/day penalty per individual

#### Step 6: Document Everything

- Selection criteria spreadsheet (showing each employee's scores)
- Business justification memo
- Disparate impact analysis
- Legal review sign-off
- WARN notices (with proof of delivery)
- Severance agreements (signed releases)

---

### D. Transaction Structure Recommendations

#### Purchase Agreement Provisions

✅ **Employment Liabilities Allocation:**

**Seller (MU) Retains:**
- Pre-closing employment claims (including Dr. Chen EEOC charge)
- Unpaid wages, accrued vacation, bonuses earned before closing

- Multiemployer plan withdrawal liability

**Buyer (AEH) Assumes:**
- Post-closing employment obligations
- Tenure contracts (680 faculty)
- Ongoing employee benefit plans (health, retirement)
- CBAs with unions (if any)

✅ **Indemnification:**
- Seller indemnifies Buyer for pre-closing employment claims
- 18-24 month survival period for employment representations
- Escrow 10-15% of purchase price to secure indemnification

✅ **Employee Retention:**
- Offer employment to all MU employees (continuity for successor liability purposes)
- At-will employment (except tenured faculty)
- Preserve tenure for 680 tenured faculty (contractual obligation)

## IX. APPENDICES

### Appendix A: WARN Act Threshold Calculation - Midwest University

**Total Employees:** 4,090
- Faculty: 1,240 (680 tenured, 560 non-tenure-track)
- Staff: 2,850

**Mass Layoff Thresholds:**

| Trigger | Calculation | Result |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **33% of workforce** | 4,090 × 0.33 = 1,350 | 1,350 employees |
| **Absolute threshold** | — | 500 employees |

**WARN Notice Required If:**
- **Scenario A:** 50-499 employees laid off AND layoff ≥33% of workforce (1,350+)
- **Scenario B:** 500+ employees laid off (any percentage)

**Practical Examples:**

| Layoff Size | % of Workforce | WARN Required? | Reason |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 50 | 1.2% | **NO** | Below 33% threshold |
| 250 | 6.1% | **NO** | Below 33% threshold |
| 500 | 12.2% | **YES** | ≥500 absolute threshold |
| 1,000 | 24.4% | **YES** | ≥500 absolute threshold |
| 1,350 | 33.0% | **YES** | ≥33% threshold + 50+ employees |

### Appendix C: Faculty Handbook Provisions - Key Contractual Language

**Typical Tenure Provisions (Binding Contract):**

> "Upon conferral of tenure by the Board of Trustees, a faculty member acquires continuous appointment without term and may be dismissed only for adequate cause or on grounds of financial exigency as defined by the American Association of University Professors."

> "Adequate cause for dismissal must be related directly and substantially to the fitness of the faculty member in their professional capacity. The burden of proof rests with the administration."

> "Termination of a tenured appointment due to financial exigency must be preceded by a formal declaration by the Board, after meaningful consultation with the Faculty Senate."

**Shared Governance Provisions (Binding Contract):**

> "The Faculty Senate shall have primary responsibility for curriculum, degree requirements, grading policies, academic standards, and recommendations on faculty appointments, reappointments, and tenure decisions, in accordance with the 1966 AAUP Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities."

> "Decisions affecting academic policy shall be made in consultation with the Faculty Senate. The administration shall document reasons for any departure from Faculty Senate recommendations."

**Procedural Due Process (Binding Contract):**

> "A tenured faculty member may not be dismissed without: (1) written statement of charges; (2) hearing before faculty committee; (3) right to counsel; (4) right to confront witnesses; (5) written decision with findings; (6) right of appeal to President and Board."

**Analysis:** These provisions create enforceable contractual rights that survive change of ownership under successor liability doctrine.

### Appendix D: Successor Liability - De Facto Merger Analysis

**Factors Courts Consider:**

| Factor | MU/AEH Transaction | Weight |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **Continuity of operations** | ✓ University continues | HIGH |
| **Continuity of employees** | ✓ 4,090 employees transfer | HIGH |
| **Continuity of management** | ✓ Likely retain President/Deans | MODERATE |
| **Continuity of location** | ✓ Same Indiana campus | HIGH |
| **Continuity of assets** | ✓ All facilities, accreditation | HIGH |
| **Predecessor ceases operations** | ✓ MU dissolves post-sale | HIGH |
| **Assumption of liabilities** | ? Express vs. implied | DEPENDS |

**Conclusion:** Transaction will likely be deemed **de facto merger** for employment law purposes, triggering successor liability for:
- Tenure contracts
- Pending EEOC charges
- Collective bargaining agreements (if any)
- Employee benefit plan obligations
