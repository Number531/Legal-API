## I. REGIONAL ACCREDITATION - HIGHER LEARNING COMMISSION CHANGE OF CONTROL PROCESS

The proposed acquisition of Midwest University (MU) by American Education Holdings LLC (AEH) requires prior approval from the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), the regional accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education for the North Central region. HLC accreditation is a mandatory prerequisite for Title IV federal student aid eligibility, making HLC approval an absolute condition precedent to transaction consummation.¹ Without HLC approval, Midwest University would immediately lose accreditation upon change of ownership, rendering the institution ineligible for federal student aid and triggering catastrophic financial consequences including student refund obligations estimated at $435M-$539M (56-69% of the $780M purchase price).² Based on comprehensive analysis of HLC policies, federal accreditor recognition standards, and precedent for nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions, this transaction presents significant accreditation risk requiring sophisticated mission preservation commitments and substantial operational autonomy protections.

### I.A. HLC SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE FRAMEWORK

#### I.A.1. Federal Mandate for Change of Control Approval

Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, institutional accreditation by a federally recognized accrediting agency is a mandatory prerequisite for Title IV eligibility.³ The Department of Education recognizes accrediting agencies under criteria established in 34 C.F.R. Part 602.⁴ HLC's recognition status means its accreditation standards and processes are subject to federal oversight and must comply with Department recognition criteria.⁵

Federal regulations governing recognized accrediting agencies mandate that such agencies must have policies requiring approval of substantive changes, specifically including "any change in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution."⁶ This federal requirement ensures that accrediting agencies exercise gatekeeping authority over ownership changes that could threaten educational quality or institutional mission.

HLC has implemented this federal mandate through Policy INST.G.20.010, which provides that an institution must receive HLC approval prior to undergoing a Change of Control, Structure or Organization.⁷ Consummating the transaction without prior HLC approval results in immediate loss of accreditation.⁸ This policy creates an absolute sequencing requirement: HLC Board approval must occur before the parties execute the transaction closing.

#### I.A.2. Definition of Change of Control Under HLC Policy

HLC Policy INST.G.20.010 defines "Change of Control, Structure or Organization" to include any transaction involving:⁹

1. **Change in legal status or ownership**: Conversion from nonprofit to for-profit status, or transfer of ownership interests constituting control
2. **Change in corporate structure**: Merger, consolidation, or reorganization affecting institutional governance
3. **Change affecting institutional mission**: Modifications to educational purpose, degree-granting authority, or academic focus
4. **Transfer of substantial control**: Arrangements whereby another entity exercises substantial control over institutional operations

The Project Athena transaction constitutes a change of control under all four criteria. The acquisition involves: (a) conversion of MU from 501(c)(3) nonprofit status to for-profit proprietary institution; (b) transfer of 100% ownership from MU's current board of trustees to American Education Holdings LLC; (c) change in corporate structure from member-governed nonprofit to equity-owned limited liability company; and (d) transfer of control to for-profit private equity entity. Each ground independently triggers HLC's substantive change review requirement.

#### I.A.3. Application Content and Documentation Requirements

HLC requires submission of a comprehensive Application for Change of Control, Structure or Organization containing extensive documentation demonstrating continued compliance with HLC's Criteria for Accreditation.¹⁰ The application must include:

**Transaction Structure Documentation**:
- Definitive agreement and all material transaction documents
- Organizational charts showing pre- and post-transaction governance structure
- Detailed description of ownership changes and control transfer mechanics
- Timeline for transaction consummation and implementation
- Legal opinions regarding regulatory approvals required

**Financial Viability Analysis**:
- Pro forma financial statements for three years post-transaction
- Debt structure and debt service coverage analysis
- Composite score calculations under Department of Education financial responsibility standards (34 C.F.R. § 668.171-668.174)
- Evidence of adequate resources to support educational mission with acquisition debt burden
- Explanation of how $500M-$700M acquisition debt affects institutional sustainability¹¹

**Mission Continuity and Educational Quality**:
- Comparative analysis of pre- and post-transaction mission statements
- Demonstration that educational programs, student services, and academic quality will be maintained
- Faculty governance preservation commitments
- Evidence of continued compliance with HLC Criterion 2 (Integrity: Ethical and Responsible Conduct)¹²
- Explanation of how for-profit ownership structure aligns with educational mission

**Governance and Academic Autonomy**:
- Post-transaction governance documents (operating agreement, bylaws, board composition)
- Board independence analysis and academic representation on governing board
- Faculty senate authority and shared governance protections
- Demonstration of institutional autonomy from private equity ownership
- Conflict of interest policies addressing owner-institution relationship

**Stakeholder Impact Assessment**:
- Student enrollment impact analysis and student support continuity plan
- Faculty and staff impact analysis, including tenure preservation commitments
- Community engagement and institutional role in Indianapolis region
- Alumni relations and institutional reputation considerations

**New Owner Track Record**:
- Information on American Education Holdings' ownership and management
- Track record with other portfolio institutions (if applicable)
- Educational expertise and commitment to academic mission
- Financial capacity to support long-term institutional viability

The comprehensiveness of these documentation requirements reflects HLC's recognition that nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions present elevated risk to educational quality and mission preservation. Institutions converting to for-profit ownership have historically demonstrated higher rates of educational quality deterioration, particularly when combined with leveraged acquisitions creating debt service pressures.¹³

#### I.A.4. Review Timeline and Process

**Pre-Application Consultation (1-3 months)**: HLC strongly recommends that institutions engage in informal pre-application consultation with HLC staff before submitting a formal change of control application.¹⁴ This consultation allows institutions to preview transaction structure, address preliminary concerns, and clarify documentation requirements. For complex transactions like Project Athena involving nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion and substantial leverage, pre-application consultation is functionally mandatory to avoid application deficiencies that could delay Board consideration.

During pre-application consultation, HLC staff will likely raise concerns about: (a) financial sustainability with acquisition debt; (b) mission preservation under for-profit ownership; (c) faculty governance and academic freedom protections; (d) AEH's track record in higher education; and (e) structural protections preventing profit maximization from compromising educational quality. Early identification of these concerns allows the parties to structure the transaction and governance documents to address them proactively.

**Application Preparation and Submission (2-3 months)**: Following pre-application consultation, the institution prepares the formal application incorporating HLC staff feedback. Application preparation typically requires 2-3 months given the extensive documentation requirements and need for coordination among legal counsel, financial advisors, institutional leadership, and board of trustees. The application must be materially complete when submitted; incomplete applications will be returned without Board consideration, causing significant delay.¹⁵

**HLC Staff and Peer Review (2-4 months)**: Upon receipt of a complete application, HLC assigns the application to staff reviewers and convenes a peer review team.¹⁶ The peer review team typically includes current or former institutional leaders with expertise in governance, finance, and accreditation. For complex transactions involving change in tax status and substantial debt, HLC may engage external consultants including transactional attorneys and corporate finance experts to assess transaction structure and financial viability.¹⁷

During this phase, HLC may conduct an on-site Change of Control Visit.¹⁸ Federal regulations mandate that accrediting agencies "must undertake a site visit to a new branch campus or following a change of ownership or control as soon as practicable, but no later than six months, after the establishment of that campus or the change of ownership or control."¹⁹ HLC has discretion regarding whether to conduct a pre-approval site visit during application review or a post-approval monitoring visit during the Accredited Change of Control status period (discussed below).²⁰ For transactions presenting elevated risk—such as nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions—HLC typically conducts a pre-approval site visit to assess institutional preparedness, stakeholder support, and governance protections.

The site visit includes meetings with institutional leadership, board of trustees, faculty governance bodies (Faculty Senate), students, staff, and community stakeholders. HLC reviewers assess: (a) transparency of communication regarding transaction rationale and impacts; (b) faculty and staff confidence in mission preservation; (c) student understanding of ownership change and assurances regarding program continuity; (d) board of trustees understanding of fiduciary duties post-transaction; and (e) community perception of institutional commitment to regional service mission.

Following completion of staff and peer review, HLC prepares a comprehensive Change of Control Report synthesizing findings and providing a recommendation to the HLC Board of Trustees regarding approval, conditional approval, or denial.²¹

**HLC Board Decision (quarterly meetings)**: The HLC Board of Trustees has sole decision-making authority regarding whether to approve or deny change of control applications.²² The Board meets three times per year, typically in February, June, and November.²³ Applications must be completed and reviewed in advance of the Board meeting to allow adequate time for Board member review. In practice, applications submitted after the deadline for a given Board meeting will be deferred to the following meeting, potentially causing 4-5 month delays.

The Board may: (a) approve the change of control unconditionally; (b) approve with conditions (e.g., specific governance commitments, enhanced financial reporting, limitations on operational changes); (c) defer decision pending additional information; or (d) deny the application.²⁴ Conditional approvals are common for transactions presenting moderate risk; the Board establishes specific conditions that must be satisfied before transaction consummation and/or maintained during the post-approval monitoring period.

If the Board denies the application, HLC issues a Public Disclosure Notice containing information about the denial, the Board's findings, and the institution's right to appeal.²⁵ Appeals are heard by a special Board committee and face a highly deferential standard of review focused on procedural regularity rather than merits review of the Board's substantive judgment.²⁶

**Total Process Timeline**: The complete HLC change of control approval process requires 6-9 months from initiation of pre-application consultation to Board decision, depending on: (a) application complexity and completeness; (b) whether on-site visit is required; (c) responsiveness to HLC information requests; and (d) alignment with Board meeting schedule.²⁷ For Project Athena, assuming pre-application consultation begins in Q1 2026, formal application submission in Q2 2026, and Board consideration at the November 2026 meeting, approval could be obtained 8-10 months from initiation.

### I.B. MISSION PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS

#### I.B.1. HLC Criterion 2 (Integrity: Ethical and Responsible Conduct)

HLC's mission preservation requirements derive from Criterion 2 of the Criteria for Accreditation, which mandates that "the institution acts with integrity; its conduct is ethical and responsible."²⁸ Core Components of Criterion 2 require that:

- **Core Component 2.A**: The institution operates with integrity in its financial, academic, personnel, and auxiliary functions
- **Core Component 2.C**: The governing board of the institution is sufficiently autonomous to make decisions in the best interest of the institution and to assure its integrity
- **Core Component 2.D**: The institution is committed to freedom of expression and the pursuit of truth in teaching and learning
- **Core Component 2.E**: The institution's policies and procedures call for responsible acquisition, discovery and application of knowledge by its faculty, students and staff²⁹

Nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions create tension with these standards because for-profit ownership structures introduce profit maximization incentives that may conflict with educational mission and academic integrity. The InfiLaw precedent—in which all three for-profit law schools owned by private equity ultimately lost ABA accreditation—demonstrates the structural risks HLC must evaluate.³⁰ InfiLaw's law schools experienced enrollment quality deterioration, bar passage rate declines, and ultimately accreditation loss as profit pressures drove admission standards downward.³¹

HLC must assess whether American Education Holdings' ownership will preserve Midwest University's mission or create similar pressures toward educational quality compromise. This assessment focuses on governance structure, operational autonomy, and financial sustainability with debt burden.

#### I.B.2. Mission Statement Continuity Analysis

HLC requires demonstration that the institution's mission will remain substantially unchanged following the ownership change.³² Mission continuity analysis examines three dimensions:

**Stated Mission**: The institution must maintain mission statement language emphasizing educational purpose, service to students, and contribution to public good. Pure profit maximization language is incompatible with accreditation. MU's current mission emphasizes "transforming lives through education" and "serving the Indianapolis community through accessible, high-quality education."³³ Post-transaction mission statements that introduce explicit profit objectives or subordinate educational goals to financial returns would raise serious HLC concerns.

**Operational Mission**: HLC assesses whether operational decisions reflect mission fidelity or profit maximization. Key indicators include: (a) admission standards maintenance; (b) student support services investment; (c) faculty compensation and professional development; (d) financial aid policies; (e) program quality investments; and (f) community engagement activities. If post-acquisition operational changes reduce educational quality to maximize cash flow for debt service, HLC may determine that operational mission has diverged from stated mission, violating Criterion 2.

**Stakeholder Perception**: HLC considers whether faculty, students, and community stakeholders believe the institution's mission will be preserved. Widespread faculty opposition, student protests, or community concerns about mission compromise can influence HLC's assessment, even if governance documents contain mission preservation language. The Board evaluates whether institutional leadership has successfully communicated mission continuity and built stakeholder confidence.

#### I.B.3. Educational Quality Standards (Criteria 1-5)

HLC's five Criteria for Accreditation establish comprehensive educational quality standards that must be maintained following ownership change:³⁴

**Criterion 1 (Mission)**: Already discussed above regarding mission preservation.

**Criterion 3 (Teaching and Learning: Quality, Resources, and Support)**: This criterion requires demonstration that the institution provides high quality education, with particular focus on:
- Core Component 3.A: Faculty qualifications and effectiveness
- Core Component 3.B: Program curriculum and learning objectives
- Core Component 3.C: Faculty and staff roles supporting teaching and learning
- Core Component 3.D: Student support infrastructure (advising, tutoring, career services)

Leveraged acquisitions creating debt service pressures often lead to cost-cutting in precisely these areas: faculty salaries, professional development, student services, and academic support. HLC will scrutinize whether post-acquisition financial projections maintain adequate resources for Criterion 3 compliance or project reductions that could compromise educational quality.

**Criterion 4 (Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and Improvement)**: This criterion addresses assessment, continuous improvement, and data-driven decision-making. For-profit ownership may alter institutional culture regarding educational quality assessment if management focuses primarily on financial metrics. HLC expects continued robust assessment of student learning outcomes, program effectiveness, and institutional mission achievement.

**Criterion 5 (Resources, Planning, and Institutional Effectiveness)**: This criterion focuses on:
- Core Component 5.A: Resource sufficiency and institutional capacity
- Core Component 5.B: Institutional governance ensuring academic oversight
- Core Component 5.C: Budget planning aligned with mission

The $500M-$700M acquisition debt has direct implications for Criterion 5 compliance. Debt service will consume substantial cash flow that would otherwise be available for mission investment. HLC will assess whether financial projections demonstrate adequate resources to maintain current educational quality or project resource constraints requiring program cuts, faculty reductions, or service limitations.

#### I.B.4. Institutional Autonomy vs. Private Equity Control

A fundamental HLC concern in private equity acquisitions is whether the institution retains sufficient autonomy to make decisions in the educational interest of students, or whether private equity ownership will exercise control prioritizing financial returns.³⁵ This tension is particularly acute when acquisition debt creates pressure for rapid cash generation.

**Board Composition and Independence**: HLC expects governing boards to include substantial independent representation—individuals without financial interest in the acquiring entity who can exercise judgment regarding institutional best interests.³⁶ Boards consisting entirely or predominantly of AEH-appointed directors create concern that governance decisions will reflect AEH's financial interests rather than educational mission.

Best practice for HLC approval is board composition with:
- **Majority independent directors** (50%+ with no AEH financial interest)
- **Academic representation** (current or former university leaders, faculty)
- **Community representation** (Indianapolis business and civic leaders)
- **Student/alumni representation** (non-voting or voting as appropriate under state law)
- **Minority AEH representation** (sufficient to protect investment but not control decisions)

This structure provides confidence that board decisions will balance financial sustainability with educational mission, rather than subordinating mission to profit maximization.

**Reserved Matters Requiring Independent Director Approval**: HLC may condition approval on governance provisions requiring supermajority or independent director approval for decisions affecting educational mission:
- Changes to academic programs, admission standards, or degree requirements
- Faculty governance structure modifications
- Tenure policy changes
- Budget allocations for instruction, student services, and academic support
- Tuition and financial aid policy changes
- Institutional mission statement amendments

These reserved matters provisions prevent AEH from unilaterally implementing operational changes that could compromise educational quality for financial gain.

**Management Independence**: HLC distinguishes between strategic ownership and operational management. For-profit owners may exercise strategic direction (overall financial planning, capital investments, long-range planning), but operational management of academic programs and educational services should remain with institutional leadership accountable to the governing board, not directly to the private equity owner.³⁷ Management service agreements whereby AEH provides comprehensive operational management raise HLC concerns about institutional autonomy.

#### I.B.5. Faculty Governance Preservation Requirements

HLC Criterion 5.B requires that "the institution's governance and administrative structures promote effective leadership and support collaborative processes that enable the institution to fulfill its mission."³⁸ A core element of effective academic governance is faculty participation in institutional decision-making through shared governance.³⁹

**Shared Governance Definition**: The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) defines shared governance as "a process of joint decision-making in which trustees, administrators, and faculty members participate" regarding academic matters.⁴⁰ Faculty governance authority typically includes:
- Curriculum development and academic program approval
- Admission standards and academic policies
- Faculty hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions
- Academic calendar and degree requirements
- Research priorities and scholarly standards

**HLC Expectations for For-Profit Conversions**: When nonprofit institutions convert to for-profit ownership, HLC expects explicit contractual protection of faculty governance to prevent erosion of academic autonomy. These protections should appear in:

1. **Operating Agreement or Governance Documents**: Provisions establishing faculty senate authority over academic matters and requiring board consultation with faculty on academic policy decisions

2. **Faculty Handbook**: Contractually enforceable provisions (incorporated by reference into faculty employment contracts) guaranteeing faculty governance rights⁴¹

3. **Board Bylaws**: Reserved matters requiring faculty senate consultation or approval before board action

Without these structural protections, HLC may determine that for-profit ownership creates unacceptable risk to academic autonomy, warranting denial or conditional approval requiring governance amendments.

#### I.B.6. Academic Freedom Protections

Academic freedom—the right of faculty to teach, research, and publish without institutional censorship based on controversial content—is foundational to accreditation.⁴² HLC Criterion 2.D explicitly requires institutional commitment to "freedom of expression and the pursuit of truth in teaching and learning."⁴³

For-profit ownership creates potential academic freedom concerns if profit considerations influence academic content decisions. For example:
- Pressure to avoid teaching content that could offend donor constituencies
- Restrictions on research critical of industries associated with ownership
- Curricular pressure toward "marketable" programs at expense of liberal arts
- Limitations on faculty public commentary regarding institutional governance

HLC expects institutions undergoing for-profit conversion to adopt and maintain AAUP Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure (1940 Statement) or equivalent policy.⁴⁴ The 1940 Statement establishes that:
- Faculty are entitled to freedom in research and publication
- Faculty are entitled to freedom in classroom discussion of subject matter
- Faculty are citizens and should be free from institutional censorship when speaking as citizens

Incorporation of the 1940 Statement into faculty handbook and employment contracts provides structural protection demonstrating HLC commitment to academic freedom preservation.

### I.C. FINANCIAL VIABILITY ASSESSMENT

#### I.C.1. HLC Financial Review Criteria

HLC's financial viability assessment focuses on whether the institution possesses sufficient resources to support its educational mission following the ownership change.⁴⁵ This assessment examines:

**Debt Capacity and Debt Service Coverage**: HLC evaluates whether acquisition debt is sustainable given institutional revenue and cash flow. Key metrics include:
- Debt service coverage ratio (operating cash flow / debt service payments)
- Total debt to revenue ratio
- Interest coverage ratio (EBITDA / interest expense)
- Debt amortization schedule and balloon payment risks

For Project Athena, assuming $500M-$700M acquisition debt at 8-10% interest rates, annual debt service would be $40M-$70M (interest only) or $60M-$90M (amortizing over 10 years). MU's current operating revenue is $680M with operating margin approximately $45M-$50M.⁴⁶ Debt service consuming 80-140% of current operating margin leaves minimal resources for mission investment and creates financial fragility.

**Budget Adequacy for Educational Mission**: HLC assesses whether post-acquisition budgets maintain adequate resources for:
- Faculty salaries competitive with peer institutions
- Student-faculty ratios supporting educational quality
- Library resources and instructional technology
- Student services (advising, counseling, career development, disability services)
- Facilities maintenance and capital investment
- Financial aid maintaining access for economically disadvantaged students

If financial projections show systematic underfunding of these categories to maximize cash flow for debt service, HLC may determine that the transaction structure is incompatible with educational mission.

**Liquidity and Working Capital**: HLC evaluates whether the institution maintains adequate liquid reserves to manage cash flow volatility and respond to contingencies. Highly leveraged institutions with minimal reserves face existential risk if enrollment declines, economic recession reduces tuition revenue, or unexpected expenses arise (facility repairs, litigation settlements, regulatory penalties).

**Department of Education Composite Score**: While HLC and Department of Education are separate regulatory authorities, HLC considers Department financial responsibility determinations as evidence of institutional financial health. If the transaction causes MU's composite score (currently 2.3) to decline below 1.5 or below 1.0, requiring letter of credit and heightened cash monitoring, HLC may view this as corroborating evidence of financial instability.⁴⁷

#### I.C.2. Impact of $500M Debt on Financial Ratios

The proposed acquisition involves $780M purchase price, likely financed with $500M-$700M debt and $80M-$280M equity.⁴⁸ This debt level would fundamentally alter MU's financial profile:

**Current Financial Profile (Pre-Acquisition)**:
- Total assets: $850M
- Total liabilities: $180M
- Net assets: $670M
- Debt-to-asset ratio: 21%
- Composite score: 2.3 (financially responsible)

**Projected Financial Profile (Post-Acquisition with $500M Institutional Debt)**:
- Total assets: $850M (plus goodwill/intangibles from purchase accounting)
- Total liabilities: $680M ($180M existing + $500M acquisition debt)
- Net assets: $170M
- Debt-to-asset ratio: 80%
- Projected composite score: 1.3-1.6 (zone status, requiring 10% letter of credit)⁴⁹

**Projected Financial Profile (Post-Acquisition with $700M Institutional Debt)**:
- Total liabilities: $880M
- Net assets: -$30M (negative equity)
- Debt-to-asset ratio: >100%
- Projected composite score: 0.8-1.2 (not financially responsible, requiring 25% letter of credit)⁵⁰

These financial profiles present serious HLC concerns. An institution with 80%+ debt-to-asset ratio and minimal or negative equity has virtually no financial cushion to absorb adverse developments. Enrollment decline of 5-10% could trigger financial distress requiring emergency cost reductions, program closures, or layoffs—all of which compromise educational quality and mission.

#### I.C.3. Composite Score Implications

The Department of Education determines institutional financial responsibility using a three-ratio composite score methodology: Primary Reserve Ratio, Equity Ratio, and Net Income Ratio.⁵¹ Institutions converting from nonprofit to for-profit status are subject to different weighting:

**Nonprofit weighting** (current): Primary Reserve 40%, Equity 40%, Net Income 20%
**For-profit weighting** (post-acquisition): Primary Reserve 30%, Equity 40%, Net Income 30%⁵²

The for-profit weighting places greater emphasis on profitability, reflecting Department policy that for-profit institutions should demonstrate sustainable earnings, not merely asset preservation.

Composite score thresholds determine financial responsibility status:⁵³
- **1.5 to 3.0**: Financially responsible (no restrictions)
- **1.0 to 1.4**: Zone status (10% letter of credit, heightened cash monitoring level 1)
- **< 1.0**: Not financially responsible (25% letter of credit, heightened cash monitoring level 2, reimbursement payment method)

For MU with $182M annual Title IV funds, the letter of credit requirements would be:⁵⁴
- **Zone status (score 1.0-1.4)**: $18.2M letter of credit
- **Not responsible (score <1.0)**: $45.5M letter of credit

Letter of credit requires cash collateral or borrowing capacity, further constraining institutional liquidity. The combination of acquisition debt service and letter of credit cash collateral creates severe financial pressure.

#### I.C.4. Viability of For-Profit Business Model

HLC must assess whether the for-profit business model is viable for a private comprehensive university with MU's profile. Historical precedent for nonprofit-to-for-profit university conversions is limited, with most for-profit higher education concentrated in online/distance education, career-focused programs, and non-residential models.⁵⁵

**Structural Challenges**:
1. **Tax burden**: Conversion to for-profit status eliminates 501(c)(3) tax exemption, imposing federal income tax (21% corporate rate), state income tax (Indiana 4.9%), and property tax on previously exempt real estate. Research indicates this tax burden will reduce MU's net income by approximately $32.7M annually (73.5% reduction), severely constraining cash flow for debt service.⁵⁶

2. **Philanthropic support**: For-profit institutions are ineligible to receive tax-deductible charitable contributions under I.R.C. § 170(c). MU currently receives approximately $25M-$35M annually in charitable contributions.⁵⁷ Post-conversion, this revenue stream will likely decline dramatically, forcing tuition increases or cost reductions to offset lost philanthropy.

3. **Endowment restrictions**: MU's $468M endowment is subject to donor restrictions requiring use for charitable educational purposes.⁵⁸ Under Indiana's cy pres doctrine (Ind. Code § 30-4-3-27), donor-restricted endowment funds cannot be transferred to for-profit ownership without Indiana Attorney General approval and court supervision.⁵⁹ Probability of AG approval for unrestricted transfer to for-profit entity is estimated at 10-20%.⁶⁰ Loss of endowment investment returns ($18M-$25M annually at 4-5% spending rate) further constrains resources.

4. **Reputational concerns**: For-profit status may reduce institutional prestige, affecting enrollment, faculty recruiting, employer recognition of degrees, and graduate school admissions. Regional comprehensive universities rely heavily on reputation within their geographic market; perception of "buying a degree" from a for-profit institution could damage enrollment.

These structural challenges raise serious questions about business model viability that HLC must resolve before approving the transaction.

#### I.C.5. Historical Precedent: For-Profit University HLC Reviews

Research did not identify specific published examples of HLC approving or denying nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions for comprehensive residential universities comparable to Midwest University.⁶¹ This absence of precedent suggests either: (a) such transactions are exceptionally rare; (b) institutions contemplating such conversions abandoned plans during pre-application consultation after HLC indicated denial likelihood; or (c) denials occurred but were not publicly litigated.

The most relevant precedent is Grand Canyon University's 2018 application to convert from for-profit to nonprofit status, which the Department of Education denied, finding that the institution remained functionally controlled by its for-profit parent company.⁶² This precedent—though involving the opposite conversion direction—illustrates regulatory skepticism of transactions blurring nonprofit/for-profit boundaries when substantial financial interests are at stake.

The InfiLaw law school precedent, discussed extensively in case law research, demonstrates accreditor willingness to deny or revoke accreditation when for-profit ownership leads to educational quality deterioration.⁶³ All three InfiLaw law schools (Charlotte School of Law, Arizona Summit Law School, Florida Coastal School of Law) ultimately lost ABA accreditation between 2017-2021 after bar passage rates declined and the schools prioritized enrollment growth over admission standards.⁶⁴ While HLC and ABA are different accrediting agencies with different criteria, the InfiLaw failures inform HLC's risk assessment for for-profit conversions.

### I.D. TIMELINE AND PROCESS ANALYSIS

#### I.D.1. Pre-Application Consultation Period (2-3 months)

Pre-application consultation allows the institution and acquiring entity to present the proposed transaction to HLC staff, receive preliminary feedback, and identify potential concerns before investing resources in formal application preparation.⁶⁵ For Project Athena, pre-application consultation should address:

**Transaction Structure**: Presentation of acquisition structure, purchase price, debt financing arrangements, governance changes, and timeline for consummation.

**Mission Preservation**: Discussion of how for-profit ownership will preserve MU's educational mission, including specific governance protections, operational autonomy provisions, and financial commitments.

**Financial Viability**: Presentation of pro forma financial projections demonstrating sustainable debt service, adequate resources for educational mission, and Department of Education composite score projections.

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Description of stakeholder communication strategy and preliminary stakeholder feedback (faculty, students, community).

**Precedent Review**: Discussion of how this transaction differs from failed for-profit conversions (InfiLaw, Grand Canyon) and what structural protections distinguish this transaction.

HLC staff will provide informal feedback indicating areas of concern and suggesting modifications to enhance approval likelihood. This feedback is invaluable for transaction structuring; ignoring HLC concerns identified in pre-application consultation dramatically reduces approval probability.

#### I.D.2. Formal Application Submission and Completeness Review (1 month)

Following pre-application consultation, the institution prepares the formal Application for Change of Control incorporating HLC feedback.⁶⁶ Application preparation requires coordination among:
- Institutional leadership (President, CFO, Chief Academic Officer)
- Board of trustees
- Transaction counsel
- Financial advisors
- American Education Holdings management

The application must be materially complete when submitted, including all required documentation and exhibits. HLC conducts completeness review within 2-4 weeks of submission.⁶⁷ If the application is incomplete, HLC returns it without formal review, requiring resubmission after deficiencies are corrected. This can cause 1-2 month delays.

#### I.D.3. HLC Staff Review and Site Visit Scheduling (2-3 months)

Upon determining that the application is complete, HLC assigns staff reviewers and convenes a peer review team.⁶⁸ The peer review team examines all application materials and prepares preliminary questions for the institution. This desk review phase typically requires 4-8 weeks.

HLC then determines whether to conduct an on-site Change of Control Visit.⁶⁹ For high-risk transactions like nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions, HLC typically conducts pre-approval site visits to assess:
- Institutional capacity and operational readiness for ownership change
- Faculty confidence in mission preservation
- Student awareness and concerns regarding for-profit conversion
- Governing board understanding of fiduciary duties post-transaction
- Community stakeholder support

Site visits involve 2-3 days on campus with meetings including:
- Institutional leadership and administrative team
- Governing board of trustees
- Faculty senate and department chairs
- Student government and student groups
- Staff representatives
- Community stakeholders (business leaders, nonprofit partners, government officials)
- Alumni representatives

Site visit scheduling requires 3-4 weeks lead time to coordinate availability of institutional stakeholders and HLC peer reviewers. The site visit itself occurs over 2-3 days. Following the visit, peer reviewers prepare a site visit report requiring 2-3 weeks.

#### I.D.4. Site Visit and Evaluation Report (1-2 months)

The peer review team synthesizes desk review and site visit findings into a comprehensive Change of Control Evaluation Report.⁷⁰ This report addresses:
- Transaction structure and governance changes
- Financial viability with acquisition debt
- Mission preservation commitments and likelihood of implementation
- Educational quality maintenance capacity
- Stakeholder support and concerns
- Compliance with HLC Criteria for Accreditation
- Recommendation regarding approval, conditional approval, or denial

The evaluation report is reviewed by HLC senior staff and transmitted to the Board of Trustees with staff recommendations. Report preparation typically requires 3-4 weeks after site visit completion.

#### I.D.5. Commission Consideration and Vote (Quarterly Meetings)

The HLC Board of Trustees considers change of control applications at regularly scheduled Board meetings, typically in February, June, and November.⁷¹ Applications must be completed and evaluation reports finalized 3-4 weeks before the Board meeting to allow Board members adequate review time.

Board consideration involves:
- Presentation by HLC staff summarizing transaction and evaluation findings
- Discussion of key concerns and risk factors
- Deliberation regarding approval recommendation
- Vote on application (approve, conditionally approve, defer, or deny)

If the Board conditionally approves, conditions typically address identified risk areas:
- **Governance conditions**: Required board composition (e.g., majority independent directors), reserved matters requiring supermajority approval
- **Financial conditions**: Minimum liquidity requirements, debt service coverage ratio covenants, restrictions on distributions to owners
- **Academic conditions**: Faculty governance protections, limitations on program closures, admission standards maintenance commitments
- **Reporting conditions**: Enhanced financial reporting (quarterly instead of annual), monitoring of key performance indicators

Conditions become binding requirements; failure to satisfy conditions can result in accreditation withdrawal.

#### I.D.6. Total Timeline: 6-9 Months Pre-Closing

Based on the process phases described above, the complete HLC change of control approval timeline is:

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative Timeline |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Pre-application consultation | 2-3 months | Months 1-3 |
| Application preparation and submission | 1-2 months | Months 3-5 |
| Completeness review | 2-4 weeks | Month 5 |
| HLC staff and peer desk review | 1-2 months | Months 5-7 |
| Site visit scheduling and execution | 1 month | Month 7 |
| Evaluation report preparation | 3-4 weeks | Month 8 |
| Board review and decision | At next quarterly meeting | Month 8-9 |

**Minimum timeline**: 6 months (if every phase proceeds expeditiously and Board meeting timing aligns)
**Typical timeline**: 8-9 months (accounting for information requests, schedule coordination, Board meeting timing)
**Extended timeline**: 12+ months (if application deficiencies require resubmission, Board defers decision pending additional information, or appeal is necessary after denial)

For Project Athena transaction planning, the parties should assume **minimum 8 months** from pre-application consultation initiation to Board approval. This timeline should inform the definitive agreement outside date (recommended: 12-18 months from signing to accommodate HLC process and potential delays).

#### I.D.7. Post-Closing Approval vs. Closing Condition

A critical strategic decision is whether HLC approval must be obtained before closing (as a condition precedent) or whether the parties may close subject to post-closing HLC approval.

**HLC Policy Requirement**: HLC Policy INST.G.20.010 states that institutions "must receive HLC approval prior to undergoing" a Change of Control.⁷² This language indicates that HLC approval is legally required before transaction consummation. Closing before HLC approval would violate HLC policy and result in immediate loss of accreditation.⁷³

**Practical Implications**: HLC approval must be a **condition precedent to closing** in the definitive agreement. The parties cannot close and seek HLC approval post-closing. This sequencing requirement has significant implications:

1. **Financing commitment duration**: Debt financing commitments must remain valid throughout HLC review period (8-12 months minimum)
2. **Outside date**: The definitive agreement outside date must accommodate HLC timeline
3. **MAC risk allocation**: Between signing and closing (8-12 months), material adverse changes could occur affecting deal economics; MAC definitions must address this extended timeline
4. **Regulatory conditions**: HLC approval is one of multiple regulatory approvals required (Department of Education, state authorizations, programmatic accreditors); sequencing must be coordinated

**Recommendation**: The definitive agreement should include HLC change of control approval as an express condition precedent to closing, with outside date of 12-18 months from signing to accommodate the approval process and potential delays.

### I.E. APPROVAL PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

#### I.E.1. Base Case Probability: 75%

Based on comprehensive analysis of HLC policies, federal accreditor standards, and precedent for ownership changes, the base case probability of HLC approval for Project Athena is estimated at **75%**, assuming the transaction is structured with substantial mission preservation protections.⁷⁴

**Factors Supporting Approval (Positive Indicators)**:
1. **Strong institutional foundation**: MU has 100+ years of accreditation history, stable enrollment, strong academic reputation, and solid financial performance pre-acquisition
2. **Market position**: As a comprehensive university serving the Indianapolis region, MU fulfills educational access mission that HLC values
3. **Current compliance**: MU has no outstanding compliance issues, sanctions, or quality concerns with HLC
4. **Resource investment potential**: AEH acquisition could provide capital for facility improvements, technology investment, and program development that MU cannot fund as standalone nonprofit
5. **Proactive engagement**: Early HLC consultation and comprehensive application addressing concerns demonstrates institutional seriousness about accreditation maintenance

**Factors Creating Risk (Negative Indicators)**:
1. **Unprecedented transaction**: Nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion of comprehensive residential university is rare, creating uncertainty about educational impact
2. **Leveraged acquisition**: $500M-$700M acquisition debt creates financial pressure that could compromise educational quality through cost-cutting
3. **For-profit ownership concerns**: HLC philosophical concerns about profit motive conflicting with educational mission
4. **InfiLaw precedent**: ABA's experience with for-profit law school failures creates skepticism about for-profit ownership viability
5. **Stakeholder opposition risk**: Faculty, students, or community opposition could influence HLC assessment of institutional confidence in mission preservation
6. **Tax and endowment complications**: Loss of tax exemption and potential loss of endowment creates resource constraints affecting financial viability

The 75% probability reflects judgment that positive factors outweigh negative factors if the transaction is structured with robust governance protections, but significant risk remains due to novelty and complexity.

#### I.E.2. Mitigated Case Probability: 85%

Approval probability can be increased to approximately **85%** through implementation of enhanced academic and financial protections addressing HLC's core concerns:⁷⁵

**Governance Mitigations**:
1. **Board composition**: Majority independent directors (60%+ with no AEH financial interest), including academic leaders, community representatives, and mission-focused individuals
2. **Reserved matters**: Supermajority board approval (75%+) required for decisions affecting academic programs, admission standards, tenure policies, faculty governance, and mission statement amendments
3. **Academic oversight committee**: Board committee with majority independent directors exercising exclusive authority over academic quality matters
4. **Independent board chair**: Board chair must be independent director (not AEH representative), ensuring mission focus in board leadership

**Financial Mitigations**:
5. **Debt structure**: Structure acquisition debt at holding company level (AEH) rather than institutional level, preserving MU's balance sheet strength and composite score ≥2.0
6. **Cash reserve requirement**: Maintain minimum $100M unrestricted cash reserves for institutional stability and contingency capacity
7. **Distribution limitations**: Limit distributions to AEH to percentage of net income (e.g., 50% maximum), requiring retention of operating margin for mission investment
8. **Debt service coverage**: Covenant requiring minimum 1.5x debt service coverage ratio before distributions permitted

**Academic Mitigations**:
9. **Faculty governance**: Contractually enforceable faculty senate authority over curriculum, academic policies, and tenure decisions; board consultation required on academic matters
10. **Tenure preservation**: Absolute commitment to existing tenure policies and tenured faculty employment (no forced tenure buyouts or economic tenure eliminations)
11. **Academic freedom**: Adoption of AAUP 1940 Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure as institutional policy incorporated into faculty handbook
12. **Program quality commitments**: Contractual commitments regarding faculty-student ratios, instructional spending per student, library resources, and student services funding maintained at current levels (inflation-adjusted)

**Stakeholder Mitigations**:
13. **Faculty involvement**: Faculty senate approval or consultation required for major institutional decisions; faculty representation on board (non-voting or voting as state law permits)
14. **Student protections**: Tuition lock guarantees for enrolled students; prohibition on tuition increases exceeding CPI + 2% annually; maintenance of financial aid budgets
15. **Community engagement**: Continued commitment to Indianapolis community partnerships, service learning, and regional economic development contributions

Implementation of these fifteen mitigations would address virtually all HLC concerns regarding mission preservation, financial viability, and stakeholder protection. The residual 15% risk reflects inherent uncertainty in any unprecedented transaction and possibility of external factors (economic recession, enrollment decline, regulatory changes) affecting institutional stability during post-approval monitoring period.

#### I.E.3. Adverse Case Probability: 50-60%

If the transaction is structured without substantial academic protections—allowing AEH significant operational control and prioritizing financial returns over mission preservation—approval probability declines to **50-60%**.⁷⁶

**Adverse Structure Characteristics**:
1. **AEH board control**: Board majority or supermajority consists of AEH representatives, eliminating independent oversight
2. **Institutional debt**: Acquisition debt placed on MU's balance sheet, degrading composite score and financial stability
3. **Management control**: Comprehensive management services agreement whereby AEH exercises operational control over academic programs, enrollment management, and budget allocation
4. **Limited faculty governance**: Weak or advisory faculty senate without binding authority over academic policies
5. **Aggressive financial projections**: Pro forma budgets showing cost reductions in instruction, student services, and academic support to maximize cash flow
6. **No distribution limitations**: Unlimited distributions to AEH without earnings retention requirements

This structure would trigger HLC concerns that the transaction prioritizes profit extraction over educational mission, creating unacceptable risk of quality deterioration. HLC might:
- **Deny outright** (20-25% probability): Determine that transaction structure is fundamentally incompatible with accreditation standards
- **Conditionally approve with extensive requirements** (25-35% probability): Impose conditions effectively requiring adoption of governance protections described in mitigated case
- **Approve with enhanced monitoring** (20% probability): Approve but place institution on Accredited Change of Control status for maximum duration (2 years) with quarterly reporting and potential mid-term site visit

Even if HLC grants conditional approval under adverse structure, compliance burdens and reputational damage from enhanced monitoring status could compromise transaction value.

### I.F. RISK QUANTIFICATION AND EXPOSURE

#### I.F.1. HLC Denial: Transaction Termination

**Scenario**: HLC Board denies the change of control application, determining that for-profit conversion with leveraged acquisition structure presents unacceptable risk to educational mission and quality.

**Consequences**:
1. **Transaction cannot close**: HLC approval is mandatory for accreditation and Title IV eligibility; denial makes transaction legally impossible
2. **Sunk transaction costs**: Legal fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs, and financing arrangement fees (estimated $5M-$10M) are unrecoverable
3. **Institutional disruption**: Faculty and staff uncertainty during 8-12 month review period may cause retention challenges and enrollment concerns
4. **Reputational impact**: Public HLC denial creates perception of institutional instability, potentially affecting enrollment, fundraising, and faculty recruiting for 1-3 years post-denial

**Mitigation**: Structure definitive agreement with HLC approval as condition precedent. If HLC denies, transaction terminates without closing. Consider including:
- **Reverse break-up fee**: AEH pays MU termination fee ($10M-$20M) if HLC denies approval, compensating MU for disruption and opportunity cost
- **Expense reimbursement**: AEH reimburses MU's transaction expenses if regulatory approvals fail
- **Extended outside date**: 12-18 month outside date with extensions if HLC requests additional information, ensuring sufficient time for approval process

#### I.F.2. Post-Closing Conditional Approval: Provisional Certification

**Scenario**: HLC grants conditional approval with extensive monitoring requirements and conditions that must be satisfied during Accredited Change of Control status period (up to 2 years).

**Consequences**:
1. **Enhanced reporting burden**: Quarterly financial reports, enrollment reports, and key performance indicator dashboards submitted to HLC (vs. annual reporting for institutions without compliance concerns)
2. **Limitations on expansion**: HLC typically prohibits institutions under enhanced monitoring from adding new locations, substantive program changes, or acquisitions until monitoring period ends
3. **Site visit during monitoring**: HLC may conduct mid-term site visit at 12 months to assess condition compliance, requiring institutional resources for visit preparation and hosting
4. **Reputational concerns**: Enhanced monitoring status is publicly disclosed, potentially affecting institutional reputation with prospective students, employers, and transfer institutions
5. **Revocation risk**: Failure to satisfy conditions during monitoring period could result in accreditation revocation

**Impact Assessment**: Conditional approval with enhanced monitoring is not transaction-fatal but creates ongoing compliance burden and constrains operational flexibility. Transaction value may be reduced 5-10% compared to unconditional approval due to monitoring costs and growth constraints.

**Mitigation**:
- Proactively address HLC concerns through governance protections discussed in Section I.E.2
- Commit to comprehensive quarterly reporting demonstrating condition compliance
- Allocate internal resources (compliance officer, reporting systems) to manage monitoring requirements
- Build monitoring period constraints into business plan (delay expansion plans until enhanced monitoring status removed)

#### I.F.3. Student Refund Exposure: $435M-$539M

**Scenario**: HLC denies change of control approval (or Department of Education denies Title IV recertification), causing MU to lose Title IV eligibility. Students withdraw en masse, triggering refund obligations under enrollment agreements.

**Quantification**: Based on commercial contracts research, MU's enrollment agreements likely contain provisions requiring tuition refunds if the institution loses accreditation or federal financial aid eligibility.⁷⁷ Exposure calculation:

- **Current enrollment**: 18,400 students
- **Annual tuition revenue**: $435M (undergraduate and graduate)
- **Student refund obligation if loss of accreditation**:
  - **Conservative estimate** (pro-rata refunds for current term): $108M-$145M
  - **Moderate estimate** (full refunds for academic year): $435M
  - **Worst case** (full refunds plus consequential damages for lost degree value): $539M+

This exposure represents **56-69% of the $780M purchase price**, making accreditation denial potentially catastrophic.

**Cross-Domain Impact**: *See* Section X.A.2-3 at pp. 7-10 analyzing catastrophic $435M-$539M student tuition refund exposure if HLC denies change of control approval; refund exposure represents 56-69% of $780M purchase price and constitutes transaction-terminating risk absent HLC approval closing condition

**Mitigation**:
- Obtain HLC approval before closing (condition precedent) to eliminate post-closing denial risk
- Escrow portion of purchase price ($50M-$100M) until HLC Accredited Change of Control status successfully completed
- Purchase representations and warranties insurance covering losses from accreditation-related issues (if available—coverage may be limited or excluded for known risks)
- Maintain strong liquidity reserves ($100M+) to manage student refunds if worst-case scenario occurs

#### I.F.4. Reputational Damage: Enrollment Decline, Faculty Attrition

**Scenario**: Even if HLC approves the transaction, public controversy regarding for-profit conversion causes enrollment decline and faculty attrition during and after transition period.

**Quantification**:
- **Enrollment decline**: 5-10% enrollment decline over 2-3 years due to negative publicity and student concerns about degree value
  - Revenue impact: $21.8M-$43.6M annual revenue loss (5-10% × $435M tuition revenue)
  - Cumulative impact over 3 years: $65M-$131M
- **Faculty attrition**: 10-15% faculty departures during transition, requiring replacement hiring
  - Replacement costs: $5M-$10M (search costs, relocation, salary premiums for replacement faculty)
  - Teaching quality impacts: Use of adjuncts and temporary faculty during replacement process affects educational quality and student satisfaction
- **Rankings decline**: Negative publicity and faculty turnover could affect U.S. News & World Report rankings and other rankings, further deterring prospective students
  - Secondary enrollment impact: Additional 2-5% enrollment decline attributable to rankings decline

**Total reputational damage**: $70M-$150M cumulative revenue loss over 3-4 years, plus potential long-term brand damage affecting institutional position in Indianapolis market.

**Mitigation**:
- Proactive stakeholder communication emphasizing mission preservation commitments and resource investment benefits
- Faculty retention bonuses and enhanced compensation to reduce attrition risk
- Student communication campaign ensuring current students understand degree value protection
- Community engagement highlighting continued commitment to Indianapolis regional service
- Marketing investment emphasizing institutional quality and accreditation maintenance

### I.G. RECOMMENDED DEAL STRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS

#### I.G.1. HLC Approval as Absolute Closing Condition

**Recommendation**: The definitive purchase agreement must include HLC change of control approval as an express, non-waivable condition precedent to closing.⁷⁸

**Draft Closing Condition Language**:

```
Section 7.2(d) - Accreditation Approval

The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is conditioned upon receipt by the Company of approval from the Higher Learning Commission for the change of control, structure or organization resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby (the "HLC Approval"). The HLC Approval shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and shall not impose any condition or requirement that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on the Company or materially impair the economic benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby to Buyer.

For purposes of this Section 7.2(d), "material adverse effect" means any condition or requirement that:
(a) Restricts distributions to Buyer or its affiliates in excess of Twenty-Five Percent (25%) of the Company's annual net income;
(b) Requires governance or operational changes that would prevent Buyer from exercising customary investor oversight and approval rights;
(c) Imposes enhanced monitoring or reporting requirements extending beyond the standard Accredited Change of Control status period of two (2) years; or
(d) Requires capital commitments or operational expenditures exceeding $[X] in the aggregate.

The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain HLC Approval as promptly as practicable following execution of this Agreement, including:
(i) Engaging in pre-application consultation with HLC staff within thirty (30) days of the date hereof;
(ii) Submitting a complete Application for Change of Control to HLC within ninety (90) days of the date hereof;
(iii) Responding promptly to all HLC information requests;
(iv) Cooperating with HLC site visits and peer review processes; and
(v) Providing all documentation and assurances reasonably requested by HLC to facilitate approval.
```

**Rationale**: This language ensures that: (a) closing cannot occur without HLC approval; (b) approval with unduly burdensome conditions can be rejected by the buyer; (c) both parties are obligated to cooperate in obtaining approval; and (d) definition of materially burdensome conditions is established upfront to avoid closing disputes.

#### I.G.2. Pre-Application Consultation Covenant

**Recommendation**: The definitive agreement should require the parties to commence pre-application consultation with HLC within 30 days of signing, ensuring early engagement before formal application submission.

**Draft Covenant Language**:

```
Section 6.8 - Regulatory Approvals

(a) HLC Pre-Application Consultation: Within thirty (30) days following the date hereof, the Company and Buyer shall jointly request a pre-application consultation meeting with staff of the Higher Learning Commission to discuss the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties shall prepare and submit to HLC in advance of such consultation meeting:
    (i) Transaction structure summary including purchase price, debt financing arrangements, and governance changes;
    (ii) Preliminary financial projections demonstrating financial viability with acquisition debt;
    (iii) Draft governance documents including board composition and reserved matters provisions;
    (iv) Mission preservation commitments including faculty governance, academic freedom, and educational quality assurances; and
    (v) Stakeholder engagement plan and preliminary stakeholder feedback.

(b) HLC Formal Application: Within ninety (90) days following the date hereof (or such later date as agreed with HLC during pre-application consultation), the Company shall submit to HLC a complete Application for Change of Control, Structure or Organization meeting all HLC documentation requirements and addressing concerns identified during pre-application consultation.

(c) Cooperation: Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain HLC Approval, including executing and delivering all documents, providing all information, and taking all actions reasonably requested by HLC or reasonably necessary to obtain HLC Approval on terms satisfactory to Buyer as provided in Section 7.2(d).
```

**Rationale**: This covenant establishes affirmative obligations to engage HLC promptly, rather than permitting delays that could extend the closing timeline or cause financing commitments to expire.

#### I.G.3. Faculty Governance Protections

**Recommendation**: MU's post-acquisition operating agreement should contain binding provisions protecting faculty governance authority over academic matters, demonstrating to HLC that academic autonomy will be preserved.

**Draft Operating Agreement Provision**:

```
Section 5.7 - Faculty Governance and Academic Autonomy

(a) Faculty Senate Authority: The Company shall maintain a Faculty Senate (or equivalent faculty governance body) with authority over academic matters including:
    (i) Curriculum development and academic program approval;
    (ii) Academic policies and standards;
    (iii) Admission standards and degree requirements;
    (iv) Faculty hiring, promotion, and tenure recommendations;
    (v) Academic calendar; and
    (vi) Research priorities and scholarly standards.

(b) Board Consultation: Before the Board of Managers takes action on any matter within the Faculty Senate's authority under subsection (a), the Board shall consult with the Faculty Senate and consider in good faith the Faculty Senate's recommendations. The Board shall provide written explanation to the Faculty Senate if the Board's decision differs from the Faculty Senate's recommendation.

(c) Reserved Academic Matters: The following matters require approval by two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote of the Board of Managers, including affirmative votes from a majority of the Independent Managers (as defined in Section 5.3):
    (i) Material changes to the Company's mission statement or educational purpose;
    (ii) Elimination of academic programs enrolling more than one hundred (100) students;
    (iii) Changes to tenure policies or procedures;
    (iv) Changes to faculty governance structure or Faculty Senate authority;
    (v) Admission standards changes that would reduce average entering student academic credentials by more than ten percent (10%); and
    (vi) Budget allocations for instruction and academic support that represent reductions of more than ten percent (10%) from the prior fiscal year (inflation-adjusted).

(d) Academic Freedom: The Company affirms its commitment to academic freedom as articulated in the American Association of University Professors' 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure. The Company shall incorporate the 1940 Statement into its Faculty Handbook as institutional policy, and such policy shall not be amended or revoked without two-thirds (2/3) supermajority Board vote including majority Independent Manager approval.
```

**Rationale**: These provisions provide HLC with contractual assurance that faculty will maintain meaningful governance authority post-acquisition, addressing core concerns about for-profit ownership compromising academic autonomy.

#### I.G.4. Board Composition Requirements

**Recommendation**: MU's operating agreement should require board composition with majority independent directors unaffiliated with AEH, ensuring mission-focused governance.

**Draft Operating Agreement Provision**:

```
Section 5.3 - Board Composition and Independence

(a) Board Size and Composition: The Board of Managers shall consist of not less than nine (9) and not more than fifteen (15) members, of which:
    (i) At least sixty percent (60%) shall be Independent Managers (as defined below);
    (ii) Not more than forty percent (40%) shall be representatives designated by American Education Holdings LLC or its affiliates; and
    (iii) At least two (2) shall be individuals with senior academic leadership experience (current or former university presidents, provosts, or deans).

(b) Definition of Independent Manager: An "Independent Manager" is an individual who:
    (i) Is not employed by or affiliated with American Education Holdings LLC or any of its portfolio companies;
    (ii) Does not have a direct or indirect financial interest in American Education Holdings LLC or the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement;
    (iii) Is not a current or former employee of the Company (except for faculty representatives, if any);
    (iv) Has not received compensation from American Education Holdings LLC or its affiliates (other than Board compensation) exceeding $[X] in any twelve-month period; and
    (v) Otherwise satisfies the independence criteria established by the Board.

(c) Board Chair: The Chair of the Board of Managers shall be an Independent Manager and shall be elected by majority vote of the Independent Managers.

(d) Academic Oversight Committee: The Board shall establish an Academic Oversight Committee consisting exclusively of Independent Managers, with authority to review and approve (or disapprove) proposals regarding:
    (i) Academic program additions, eliminations, or material modifications;
    (ii) Changes to admission standards or academic policies;
    (iii) Tenure policy changes;
    (iv) Faculty governance structure modifications; and
    (v) Other matters affecting educational quality and academic integrity.

(e) Compensation: Independent Managers shall receive annual cash compensation of not less than $[X], plus reimbursement of reasonable expenses, ensuring that Independent Managers have sufficient resources to fulfill oversight duties and are not financially dependent on American Education Holdings LLC.
```

**Rationale**: This governance structure provides HLC with confidence that board decisions will reflect institutional mission and educational quality considerations, not solely AEH financial interests.

#### I.G.5. Academic Freedom Preservation Clause

**Recommendation**: The definitive agreement should include representations from AEH regarding academic freedom preservation, incorporated into post-closing governance documents.

**Draft Representation and Covenant**:

```
Section 4.18 - Educational Mission and Academic Freedom

(a) Buyer Acknowledgment: Buyer acknowledges and agrees that:
    (i) The Company is an accredited institution of higher education with an educational mission serving students and the Indianapolis community;
    (ii) Preservation of the Company's educational mission, academic quality, and accreditation is essential to the Company's value and operations;
    (iii) The Company's faculty are entitled to academic freedom in teaching, research, and publication consistent with professional standards; and
    (iv) The Company's students are entitled to high-quality education and degree programs maintaining institutional reputation and employer recognition.

(b) Mission Preservation Covenant: From and after Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to:
    (i) Maintain the Company's educational mission substantially consistent with the mission existing as of the date hereof;
    (ii) Preserve academic freedom protections for faculty consistent with the AAUP 1940 Statement;
    (iii) Maintain educational quality standards including faculty qualifications, student-faculty ratios, instructional resources, and student support services at levels substantially consistent with those existing as of the date hereof (adjusted for inflation and enrollment changes);
    (iv) Honor existing tenure commitments to tenured faculty and maintain tenure policies substantially consistent with those existing as of the date hereof;
    (v) Maintain faculty governance through Faculty Senate or equivalent body with authority over academic matters as set forth in the Operating Agreement;
    (vi) Maintain accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission and all programmatic accrediting agencies; and
    (vii) Cooperate with all accreditation reviews and comply with accreditor standards and requirements.

(c) Breach Consequences: The parties acknowledge that breach of the covenants in subsection (b) would cause irreparable harm to the Company, its students, and its faculty for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, the Company (through Independent Managers of its Board) shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce the covenants in subsection (b).
```

**Rationale**: These provisions establish contractual commitments to mission preservation enforceable by independent board members, providing legal recourse if AEH prioritizes profit over educational mission in violation of commitments.

#### I.G.6. Financial Reserves and Distribution Limitations

**Recommendation**: The operating agreement should establish minimum liquidity requirements and limit distributions to AEH to ensure resources are available for educational mission.

**Draft Operating Agreement Provision**:

```
Section 7.5 - Distributions and Financial Reserves

(a) Minimum Financial Reserves: The Company shall at all times maintain:
    (i) Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of not less than One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) (the "Minimum Reserve");
    (ii) Current assets sufficient to cover current liabilities plus six (6) months of projected operating expenses; and
    (iii) Debt service coverage ratio (calculated as operating cash flow divided by debt service payments) of not less than 1.5 to 1.0.

(b) Distribution Limitations: Distributions to Members (including American Education Holdings LLC) shall be permitted only if:
    (i) After giving effect to the distribution, the Company maintains the Minimum Reserve required by subsection (a)(i);
    (ii) The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants and financial responsibility standards applicable to Title IV institutional participation;
    (iii) The Company's composite score (as calculated under 34 C.F.R. § 668.171-668.174) is and will remain at least 2.0 after giving effect to the distribution;
    (iv) The Company has satisfied all accreditation conditions and is not subject to probation, show cause, or other accreditation sanctions; and
    (v) The aggregate distributions in any fiscal year do not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Company's net income for such fiscal year.

(c) Board Approval: Distributions exceeding Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in any fiscal year require approval by two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote of the Board of Managers, including affirmative votes from a majority of the Independent Managers.

(d) Regulatory Priority: Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall prioritize maintenance of accreditation and Title IV eligibility above distributions to Members. If at any time the Company's accreditation or Title IV eligibility is threatened, the Board shall immediately suspend distributions and take all necessary actions to preserve accreditation and eligibility, even if such actions reduce or eliminate returns to Members.
```

**Rationale**: These provisions ensure that the institution maintains financial stability and that resources are not extracted for AEH benefit at the expense of educational mission. HLC would view these protections favorably as demonstrating sustainable financial management post-acquisition.

#### I.G.7. Escrow for Accreditation Contingency

**Recommendation**: Structure the purchase price payment with escrow holdback released only upon successful completion of HLC monitoring period, ensuring AEH incentive to support accreditation maintenance.

**Draft Purchase Agreement Provision**:

```
Section 2.3(c) - Accreditation Escrow

(i) At Closing, Buyer shall deposit into escrow with [Escrow Agent] an amount equal to [Ten Percent (10%)] of the Purchase Price (the "Accreditation Escrow Amount"), to be held and disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D.

(ii) The Accreditation Escrow Amount shall be released to Buyer upon satisfaction of the following conditions (the "Accreditation Release Conditions"):
    (A) The Company has maintained Higher Learning Commission accreditation continuously from Closing through the [Second (2nd)] anniversary of Closing;
    (B) The Company has successfully completed any Accredited Change of Control status monitoring period imposed by HLC, and HLC has removed Accredited Change of Control status and any related conditions or enhanced monitoring requirements;
    (C) The Company has maintained Department of Education Title IV institutional eligibility and financial responsibility (composite score ≥1.5) continuously from Closing through the [Second (2nd)] anniversary of Closing;
    (D) The Company has maintained all programmatic accreditations held as of Closing (ABA law school accreditation, AACSB business school accreditation, and others identified on Schedule 3.15) without probation or sanctions; and
    (E) No material adverse determination has been made by any accrediting agency regarding the Company's educational quality or compliance with accreditation standards.

(iii) If HLC withdraws accreditation, places the Company on probation or show cause, or imposes sanctions based on circumstances arising from or related to Buyer's ownership or control of the Company (as determined by independent review under the Escrow Agreement), the Accreditation Escrow Amount shall be disbursed to the Company to fund costs associated with accreditation remediation, student refunds (if applicable), and related expenses.

(iv) If the Accreditation Release Conditions are not satisfied by the [Third (3rd)] anniversary of Closing due to Buyer breach of Section 4.18(b) (Mission Preservation Covenant), the Accreditation Escrow Amount shall be disbursed to the Company as partial compensation for damages resulting from such breach.
```

**Rationale**: Escrowing 10% of purchase price ($78M) until successful accreditation monitoring provides strong financial incentive for AEH to honor mission preservation commitments and support institutional compliance with accreditation standards. This structure also provides liquidity source for remediation if problems arise.

### I.H. CROSS-REFERENCES TO OTHER SECTIONS

The HLC accreditation analysis creates direct dependencies and implications across multiple other legal domains examined in this memorandum:

*See* Section II.A at pp. 10-11 analyzing 34 C.F.R. § 600.4(a)(5)(i) requiring regional accreditation as absolute prerequisite for Title IV eligibility; HLC denial immediately terminates Title IV eligibility triggering 90-day wind-down and loss of $182M annual federal student aid

*See* Section III.B.3 at pp. 45-48 analyzing ABA Standard 104 requiring law school organizational autonomy, which aligns with HLC Criterion 5 institutional autonomy requirements; structural protections addressing HLC concerns (board independence, faculty governance) simultaneously address ABA Standard 104 requirements

*See* Section IX.C.2 at pp. 78-82 analyzing how HLC Criterion 5.B faculty governance requirements strengthen legal foundation for tenured faculty employment rights; governance provisions required for HLC approval may convert at-will employment relationships into contractually enforceable tenure commitments

*See* Section X.C.2 at pp. 15-17 analyzing material adverse effect clauses in commercial contracts; HLC provisional status or denial constitutes triggering event allowing vendors to terminate or renegotiate contracts

*See* Section VIII.D.2 at pp. 89-92 analyzing how loss of fundamental research exemption under ITAR/EAR compromises research infrastructure required for HLC Criterion 3 compliance; export control violations could trigger HLC inquiry under Criterion 2.A ethical conduct standards

*See* Section II.B at pp. 22-26 analyzing composite score calculation methodology under 34 C.F.R. § 668.171-174; acquisition debt causing composite score decline below 1.5 provides corroborating evidence of financial instability influencing HLC Criterion 5 assessment; coordinated debt structuring required to satisfy both HLC and DOE financial standards

*See* Section V.D.3 at pp. 134-137 analyzing how loss of $468M donor-restricted endowment (if Indiana AG denies transfer to for-profit entity) eliminates $18M-$25M annual endowment spending, creating financial resource constraint that could cause HLC to determine institution lacks adequate resources under Criterion 5.A

*See* Section IV.A-C at pp. 1-15 analyzing how for-profit conversion eliminating 501(c)(3) exemption imposes $32.7M annual tax burden reducing operating margin by 73.5%; tax burden combined with acquisition debt creates unsustainable financial structure potentially warranting HLC denial under Criterion 5 financial viability standards

*See* Section I.G at pp. 38-42 analyzing HLC's institutional site visit protocol including stakeholder interviews with faculty, students, community members; faculty opposition or student protests during HLC site visit could influence Commission decision even if governance documents contain technical compliance provisions

*See* Section XI.B.2 at pp. 120-125 analyzing transaction closing conditions; HLC approval timeline of 6-9 months minimum establishes critical path requiring definitive agreement to structure HLC approval as non-waivable condition precedent with outside date of 12-18 months to accommodate approval process

*See* Section XI.B.1.c at pp. 68-70 analyzing purchase price adjustment mechanics; conditional HLC approval with extensive monitoring reduces value by 5-10% due to compliance costs and operational constraints; recommend 10% escrow ($78M) until HLC monitoring period completed

### I.I. RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY

| Risk Factor | Severity | Probability | Weighted Impact | Mitigation Available | Residual Risk |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| HLC denial of change of control (transaction-fatal) | CRITICAL | 25% (without protections) / 15% (with protections) | $195M / $117M | Yes - governance protections, faculty governance, board independence, financial reserves | MEDIUM |
| HLC conditional approval with burdensome conditions | HIGH | 40% (without protections) / 30% (with protections) | $31M-$62M / $23M-$47M | Yes - proactive structuring addressing anticipated conditions | LOW-MEDIUM |
| Student refund exposure if accreditation denied | CRITICAL | 25% (if HLC denies) | $109M-$135M | Yes - HLC approval as closing condition eliminates post-closing denial risk | LOW (if mitigation implemented) |
| Enrollment decline during/after conversion (5-10%) | HIGH | 60% | $39M-$78M over 3 years | Partial - stakeholder communications, mission commitments reduce but do not eliminate | MEDIUM |
| Faculty attrition during transition (10-15%) | MEDIUM | 50% | $2.5M-$5M replacement costs | Partial - retention bonuses, governance protections reduce attrition | LOW-MEDIUM |
| Extended HLC review timeline causing financing issues | MEDIUM | 30% | $5M-$15M (refi costs or deal breakage) | Yes - 12-18 month outside date, financing commitment extensions | LOW |
| **AGGREGATE HLCE ACCREDITATION RISK EXPOSURE** | **CRITICAL** | **Varies by structure** | **$381M-$442M (without protections) / $169M-$207M (with protections)** | **Yes - comprehensive governance protections** | **MEDIUM (with full mitigation implementation)** |

**Recommended Purchase Price Adjustment**: Based on probability-weighted HLC accreditation risks, recommend $25M-$40M purchase price reduction or equivalent escrow holdback to reflect regulatory approval risk and monitoring period compliance costs. This adjustment reflects:
- 15% denial probability × $780M transaction value = $117M weighted impact
- Minus 70% probability of unconditional or minimally conditional approval = net $35M risk premium
- Plus $5M-$10M compliance costs during monitoring period
- **Total recommended adjustment**: $40M purchase price reduction OR $78M escrow (10% of purchase price) released upon successful monitoring period completion

*See* Section XI.B.1.b analyzing risk-adjusted purchase price calculation; aggregate probability-weighted HLC risks warrant $25M-$40M purchase price reduction OR $78M escrow holdback released after successful completion of HLC Accredited Change of Control monitoring period
