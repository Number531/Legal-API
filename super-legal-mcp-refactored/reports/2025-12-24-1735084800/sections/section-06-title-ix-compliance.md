## VI. TITLE IX COMPLIANCE AND PENDING LITIGATION

The acquisition of Midwest University presents material exposure from pending Title IX litigation, regulatory compliance obligations under evolving federal regulations, and successor liability for pre-closing claims. This analysis examines the statutory framework governing sex discrimination in educational institutions, the pending *Doe v. Midwest University* litigation with exposure ranging from $500,000 to $2.05 million, coverage uncertainties arising from potential sexual misconduct exclusions in the Directors & Officers insurance policy, and the heightened compliance obligations that attach to Title IV-eligible institutions regardless of for-profit status. The conversion from nonprofit to for-profit status provides no relief from Title IX obligations and may subject the institution to intensified Office for Civil Rights scrutiny based on historical enforcement patterns against for-profit educational entities.

### A. Statutory and Regulatory Framework

#### 1. Title IX Statutory Prohibition

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination by educational institutions receiving federal financial assistance. The statutory text provides: "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."¹ This prohibition applies to all aspects of educational programs, including admissions, athletics, employment, and student discipline.

The statute contains no exemption for for-profit educational institutions. Any institution receiving Title IV federal student aid—including Midwest University's $182 million in annual federal aid—remains subject to Title IX regardless of tax status or ownership structure.² The conversion to for-profit status under American Education Holdings' ownership therefore provides no relief from Title IX compliance obligations.

#### 2. Implementing Regulations and Procedural Requirements

The Department of Education's implementing regulations at 34 C.F.R. Part 106 establish comprehensive procedural requirements for institutions' response to sexual misconduct allegations. These regulations govern investigation procedures, hearing requirements, evidentiary standards, and remedial measures.³

**Current Regulatory Framework (2020 Regulations):**
The 2020 Title IX regulations, effective August 14, 2020, require:
- Live hearings with opportunity for cross-examination in postsecondary institutions
- Presumption that respondent is not responsible until determination is made
- Preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing evidence standard (institution's choice)
- Specific timeframes for investigation and adjudication
- Written determination with findings of fact and conclusions
- Equal appeal rights for both parties⁴

**Midwest University's Current Procedures:**
Based on the case law research, Midwest University operates under procedures that deviate from certain 2020 regulation requirements. The university employs a single-investigator model where the same individual investigates and serves as decision-maker, and does not provide live hearings with cross-examination.⁵ This procedural structure has been identified in federal litigation as creating heightened risk of successful Title IX claims by accused students.

#### 3. The 2024 Regulatory Changes and Current Injunction Status

On April 24, 2024, the Department of Education published comprehensive revisions to Title IX regulations, scheduled to take effect August 1, 2024.⁶ These revisions significantly expanded the definition of sex discrimination to include discrimination based on gender identity, pregnancy, and related conditions, and modified investigation procedures to provide greater flexibility to institutions.

**Indiana Injunction:**
On July 2, 2024, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the 2024 regulations in Indiana and against Indiana-based institutions.⁷ The court found that the regulations likely exceed the Department of Education's statutory authority under Title IX and violate the Administrative Procedure Act. This injunction remains in effect pending final resolution of the merits, and Midwest University continues operating under the 2020 regulatory framework.

**Regulatory Uncertainty:**
The injunction creates compliance uncertainty for the post-acquisition period. If the injunction is dissolved or reversed on appeal, the 2024 regulations would immediately take effect, requiring:
- Updated investigation procedures
- Revised training for Title IX coordinators and investigators
- New grievance procedures addressing gender identity discrimination
- Comprehensive policy revisions and campus-wide notice
- Estimated implementation cost: $500,000 to $1 million one-time expense, plus $100,000 to $200,000 in increased annual compliance costs⁸

Conversely, if the injunction is affirmed and the 2024 regulations are permanently set aside, institutions would continue operating under 2020 requirements, though a future administration could initiate new rulemaking.

### B. Title IX Enforcement Mechanisms and Institutional Exposure

#### 1. Office for Civil Rights Administrative Enforcement

The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) possesses authority to investigate Title IX complaints, conduct compliance reviews, and enforce corrective action agreements.⁹ OCR enforcement operates independently of private litigation and can result in loss of federal funding for institutions found in violation.

**Funding Termination Authority:**
Title IX authorizes termination of all federal financial assistance to institutions found in noncompliance, not merely Title IX-specific funding.¹⁰ For Midwest University, this represents $182 million in annual federal student aid (26.8% of operating revenue), creating an existential enforcement risk. While OCR rarely invokes complete funding termination, the agency uses this authority to negotiate extensive compliance agreements requiring institutional reforms.

**Recent OCR Enforcement Actions:**
- Liberty University: $14 million fine (2023) for systemic failure to investigate sexual assault complaints¹¹
- Michigan State University: $4.5 million fine (2018) for inadequate response to Larry Nassar abuse reports¹²
- Pennsylvania State University: $2.4 million fine (2016) for Clery Act and Title IX violations related to Sandusky scandal¹³

**For-Profit Institution Scrutiny:**
OCR enforcement data indicates for-profit institutions face disproportionately high complaint rates and investigation intensity compared to nonprofit peers. Research shows for-profit colleges receive approximately twice the per-capita OCR complaints as traditional nonprofit institutions, and OCR resolution agreements with for-profit institutions contain more extensive monitoring provisions.¹⁴ This heightened scrutiny pattern suggests Midwest University may face increased OCR attention following conversion to for-profit status.

#### 2. Private Right of Action and Available Remedies

Title IX contains no express statutory language authorizing private lawsuits. However, in *Cannon v. University of Chicago*, 441 U.S. 677 (1979), the Supreme Court held that Title IX contains an implied private right of action, allowing individuals to sue educational institutions directly for sex discrimination without first exhausting administrative remedies.¹⁵

**Available Damages:**
Prior to 2022, Title IX plaintiffs could recover both compensatory damages (including emotional distress) and punitive damages. In *Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, PLLC*, 142 S. Ct. 1562 (2022), the Supreme Court held that emotional distress damages are not recoverable under Title IX or other Spending Clause statutes.¹⁶ This decision substantially reduces potential damages exposure in Title IX disciplinary cases.

**Post-*Cummings* Recoverable Damages:**
- Lost tuition and housing costs during suspension or following expulsion
- Lost scholarship value (including ROTC scholarships, athletic scholarships, academic merit awards)
- Lost career opportunities (military career foreclosure, graduate school admission denial)
- Costs of transferring to another institution
- Out-of-pocket losses (therapy costs, costs to expunge disciplinary records)
- Attorney's fees for prevailing plaintiffs¹⁷

**Punitive Damages:**
Punitive damages remain available where plaintiff proves deliberate indifference to known Title IX violations or intentional discrimination, though such awards are rare in student discipline cases.¹⁸

### C. Pending Litigation: *Doe v. Midwest University*

#### 1. Case Background and Procedural Posture

*Doe v. Midwest University* was filed in May 2024 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.¹⁹ The plaintiff, John Doe, was expelled from Midwest University in December 2023 following a Title IX investigation that found him responsible for sexual misconduct. Doe alleges that the university's investigation and disciplinary process violated Title IX through gender bias and procedural irregularities.

**Factual Allegations:**
According to the complaint, Doe was accused of sexual misconduct by a female student in October 2023. The university initiated a Title IX investigation using a single-investigator model, where the same individual gathered evidence, interviewed witnesses, and determined responsibility. Doe alleges he was provided only 10 days' notice before the decision, was not permitted to cross-examine his accuser or witnesses, and exculpatory evidence was excluded from consideration. The investigator found Doe responsible using a preponderance of evidence standard, and the university expelled him effective December 2023.²⁰

**Motion to Dismiss Denial:**
Midwest University moved to dismiss the complaint in May 2024, arguing that Doe failed to plausibly allege that sex was a motivating factor in the university's decision and that the procedures satisfied Title IX requirements. The district court denied the motion to dismiss in June 2024, holding that Doe sufficiently alleged a plausible inference of gender bias and procedural unfairness to proceed to discovery.²¹ This denial indicates the court found Doe's allegations, if proven, could establish Title IX liability.

**Current Status:**
The case is in discovery phase, with trial scheduled for April 2025. Discovery will involve production of the university's Title IX files, investigation records, training materials, and statistical data regarding disposition of sexual misconduct cases. Historical patterns of decision-making—particularly high responsibility rates for male respondents—constitute admissible evidence of gender bias under Sixth Circuit precedent.²²

#### 2. Controlling Legal Standards in the Seventh Circuit

The Seventh Circuit, which includes Indiana, applies a plaintiff-favorable standard for Title IX disciplinary claims. In *Doe v. Purdue University*, 928 F.3d 652 (7th Cir. 2019), then-Judge Amy Coney Barrett authored an opinion rejecting rigid doctrinal tests and adopting a flexible standard requiring plaintiffs to show that "sex was a motivating factor" in the university's disciplinary decision.²³

**The *Purdue* Standard:**
The Seventh Circuit held that Title IX disciplinary plaintiffs need not satisfy specific elements such as "erroneous outcome" or "selective enforcement" theories developed in other circuits. Instead, plaintiffs must present evidence, from the totality of circumstances, that sex was a motivating factor in the adverse decision.²⁴ This standard permits plaintiffs to proceed with claims based on various forms of circumstantial evidence:

- Procedural irregularities suggesting bias
- Investigator or decision-maker statements revealing bias
- Statistical patterns of decision-making (high responsibility rates for one sex)
- Pressure from external sources (OCR investigations, advocacy groups, media attention)
- Credibility determinations favoring one sex without evidentiary basis
- Departure from institution's own procedures in ways favoring complainant²⁵

**Application to *Doe v. MU*:**
Under the *Purdue* standard, John Doe can establish a Title IX claim by demonstrating that gender bias motivated the university's investigation or expulsion decision. Evidence supporting this showing may include:

1. **Single-Investigator Bias:** Courts have found that single-investigator models—where the same person investigates and decides—create structural bias risk, particularly when the investigator receives "believe survivors" training or operates under pressure to increase responsibility findings.²⁶

2. **Absence of Cross-Examination:** While the 2020 Title IX regulations require live hearings with cross-examination, the regulations only apply to formal complaints of sexual harassment. If Midwest University's procedures did not provide cross-examination, this procedural deficiency supports an inference of unfairness, particularly where credibility is contested.²⁷

3. **OCR Pressure:** Evidence that the university operated under OCR investigation or guidance encouraging aggressive discipline of male respondents supports an inference of gender bias.²⁸

4. **Statistical Patterns:** If discovery reveals that Midwest University found male respondents responsible at substantially higher rates than female respondents, or found responsibility in the vast majority of cases against males, this pattern evidence supports gender bias inference under *Doe v. Oberlin College*, 60 F.4th 345 (6th Cir. 2023).²⁹

#### 3. Comparable Case Outcomes and Settlement Benchmarks

Title IX student discipline cases have produced substantial settlement values and occasional large judgments, though post-*Cummings* outcomes have moderated.

**Representative Settlements:**
- $850,000: University of Cincinnati settlement with expelled student (2020)
- $640,000: Miami University of Ohio settlement (2019)
- $400,000: University of Tennessee Chattanooga settlement (2019)
- $350,000: University of Southern California settlement (2018)
- $250,000: Numerous mid-size settlements (2020-2024)³⁰

**Trial Verdicts (Pre-*Cummings*):**
Before the *Cummings* decision eliminated emotional distress damages, verdicts occasionally exceeded $1 million:
- $850,000: Jury verdict against university for Title IX gender bias (2018)
- $1.5 million: Verdict including emotional distress (later reduced on appeal)³¹

**Post-*Cummings* Trend:**
Following elimination of emotional distress damages, settlement values have declined moderately. Current settlements typically range from $200,000 to $500,000 depending on the student's out-of-pocket losses.³²

#### 4. Exposure Analysis for *Doe v. MU*

**Damages Calculation:**
John Doe's potential recoverable damages consist of:

| Damage Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Basis |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Lost tuition (3 years) | $120,000 | $150,000 | Private university tuition $40K-$50K/year |
| Lost room/board | $30,000 | $40,000 | Residential costs $10K-$13K/year |
| Lost scholarship value | $0 | $60,000 | If merit scholarship existed |
| Career opportunity cost | $0 | $100,000 | Foreclosure of graduate school, professional opportunities |
| Transfer costs | $10,000 | $20,000 | Application fees, credit transfer losses |
| Therapy/counseling | $15,000 | $30,000 | Out-of-pocket mental health treatment |
| **Total Compensatory** | **$175,000** | **$400,000** | |
| Punitive damages (if deliberate indifference proven) | $250,000 | $1,500,000 | Rare but potentially applicable |
| **Total Potential Judgment** | **$425,000** | **$1,900,000** | |

**Probability Assessment:**
- **Liability probability:** 40-60% (motion to dismiss denial suggests viable claim; discovery may reveal unfavorable evidence)
- **Compensatory damages range if liable:** $200,000-$400,000
- **Punitive damages probability:** 15-25% (requires proof of deliberate indifference)
- **Expected value of judgment:** $140,000-$300,000³³

**Defense Costs:**
Defending Title IX litigation through trial typically costs $300,000 to $500,000 in attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and litigation expenses.³⁴ If the case proceeds to trial in April 2025, the university will incur these costs whether it prevails or not.

**Settlement Value:**
Given the defense cost exposure, judgment risk, and reputational concerns, the case presents settlement value of $250,000 to $350,000. Early settlement avoids trial risk, defense costs, and potential adverse publicity from trial testimony regarding the university's investigative procedures.³⁵

**Total Exposure (Settlement vs. Trial):**

| Scenario | Best Case | Likely Case | Worst Case |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Settlement** | $250,000 | $300,000 | $350,000 |
| **Trial (if university prevails)** | $300,000 (defense costs only) | $400,000 | $500,000 |
| **Trial (if plaintiff prevails)** | $625,000 (damages + costs) | $900,000 | $2,050,000 |

### D. Insurance Coverage Analysis and Sexual Misconduct Exclusion Risk

#### 1. Directors & Officers Policy Structure

Midwest University maintains Directors & Officers (D&O) liability insurance with a $10 million per-claim limit and $250,000 self-insured retention (SIR).³⁶ D&O policies for educational institutions typically cover wrongful acts by administrators, officers, and employees acting in their insured capacity, including Title IX coordinators and disciplinary decision-makers.

**Coverage Trigger:**
The complaint in *Doe v. MU* alleges wrongful acts by university Title IX administrators—specifically, negligent investigation, procedural unfairness, and gender bias. These allegations fall within the "wrongful act" definition of standard D&O policies, which cover negligent acts, errors, omissions, and breaches of duty.³⁷

**Duty to Defend:**
D&O insurers generally owe a duty to defend when the complaint alleges any potentially covered claim, even if some allegations fall outside coverage. The *Doe v. MU* complaint alleges covered wrongful acts (negligent investigation, procedural errors), triggering the duty to defend.³⁸

#### 2. Sexual Misconduct Exclusion—Critical Coverage Issue

The most significant coverage uncertainty involves sexual misconduct exclusions that some insurers have added to educational institution D&O policies following high-profile abuse cases (Penn State, Michigan State, USC). These exclusions typically bar coverage for:

"Any claim arising from, based upon, or attributable to sexual misconduct, sexual molestation, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, or any allegation of such conduct, including any claim related to the investigation, reporting, or adjudication of such allegations."³⁹

**Critical Distinction:**
John Doe does not allege that the university committed sexual misconduct. Rather, he alleges that the university's *investigation and disciplinary process* for alleged sexual misconduct violated Title IX through gender bias and procedural unfairness. The question is whether claims challenging the disciplinary process are "related to" sexual misconduct allegations and therefore excluded.

**Seventh Circuit Interpretation:**
In an unreported case, a federal court in the Seventh Circuit held that a Title IX procedural claim by an expelled student was excluded under a sexual misconduct exclusion because the claim was "related to" allegations of sexual misconduct, even though the plaintiff challenged only the process, not the underlying conduct.⁴⁰ This interpretation, if applied by Midwest University's insurer, would eliminate coverage for the *Doe v. MU* litigation.

**Alternative Interpretation:**
Other courts have held that sexual misconduct exclusions apply only to claims alleging the insured committed sexual misconduct, not to claims challenging the fairness of investigative procedures.⁴¹ Under this interpretation, Doe's procedural claims would remain covered because they allege administrative wrongful acts, not sexual misconduct by insured persons.

**Coverage Probability:**
Based on insurance coverage research, the probability of coverage depends entirely on policy language:
- If policy contains broad "related to" sexual misconduct exclusion: **10-20% coverage probability**
- If policy contains narrow exclusion for sexual misconduct by insured persons: **80-90% coverage probability**
- If policy contains no sexual misconduct exclusion: **95%+ coverage probability**⁴²

**Immediate Action Required:**
The acquisition due diligence must immediately obtain and review the current D&O policy to determine whether a sexual misconduct exclusion exists and its scope. If a broad exclusion exists, the *Doe v. MU* litigation presents $500,000 to $2 million in uninsured exposure, requiring purchase price adjustment or establishment of litigation reserves.

#### 3. Insurance Coverage Scenarios and Buyer Exposure

**Best Case (Full Coverage):**
- No sexual misconduct exclusion in policy (or narrow exclusion inapplicable to procedural claims)
- Insurer accepts defense and indemnity obligations
- University pays $250,000 SIR
- Insurer pays all defense costs and settlement/judgment above SIR
- **Buyer exposure: $250,000**⁴³

**Likely Case (Coverage with Dispute):**
- Sexual misconduct exclusion exists but scope is ambiguous
- Insurer initially denies coverage; university litigates coverage dispute
- Parties settle coverage dispute with cost-sharing arrangement
- University pays $250,000 SIR plus 50% of excess costs
- **Buyer exposure: $400,000-$600,000**⁴⁴

**Worst Case (No Coverage):**
- Broad sexual misconduct exclusion eliminates coverage
- University bears full defense costs and any settlement/judgment
- **Buyer exposure: $500,000-$2,000,000 (full litigation and damages exposure)**⁴⁵

*See* Section X.D.1 at pp. 85-88 analyzing D&O policy sexual misconduct exclusions; if Doe v. MU falls within exclusion scope, creates $500K-$2M uninsured exposure warranting purchase price reduction or seller-funded litigation reserve

### E. Successor Liability for Pre-Closing Title IX Claims

#### 1. Federal Statutory Successor Liability

Title IX imposes statutory obligations that cannot be disclaimed through contractual provisions. When American Education Holdings acquires Midwest University through asset purchase, the buyer assumes all Title IX compliance obligations and successor liability for pre-closing violations.⁴⁶

**No Contractual Escape:**
Unlike commercial contract liabilities that can be allocated between buyer and seller through indemnification provisions, federal civil rights obligations follow the institution regardless of ownership changes. Courts have held that Title IX liability attaches to the institutional owner/operator, and asset purchasers cannot avoid successor liability for pre-closing violations through contractual disclaimers.⁴⁷

**Rationale:**
Title IX protects students' federal civil rights to education free from sex discrimination. Allowing buyers to disclaim Title IX liability would permit institutions to evade federal civil rights obligations through strategic asset sales, undermining the statute's remedial purposes. Accordingly, courts impose successor liability for Title IX claims as a matter of federal public policy.⁴⁸

#### 2. Scope of Successor Liability—Pending and Prospective Claims

**Pending Litigation:**
The *Doe v. MU* litigation, filed in May 2024 based on a December 2023 expulsion, will transfer to American Education Holdings as successor-in-interest. The buyer becomes the party defendant and assumes all liabilities for settlement or judgment, subject to any insurance coverage and seller indemnification provisions in the purchase agreement.⁴⁹

**Statute of Limitations for Future Claims:**
Title IX claims are subject to the statute of limitations for personal injury actions under the state in which the claim arises. In Indiana, the statute of limitations for personal injury claims is two years.⁵⁰ However, the discovery rule may extend this period when the plaintiff did not discover the injury until later.

For Title IX disciplinary claims, the limitations period typically begins running when the student receives notice of the expulsion or suspension decision. Claims based on incidents occurring within two to three years before acquisition may therefore be filed post-closing, with the buyer bearing successor liability.

**Estimated Additional Claims Exposure:**
Based on national data regarding Title IX complaint rates and the timeline for claims arising from pre-closing conduct:
- Midwest University enrolls approximately 8,000 students
- Average Title IX complaint rate: 2-4 complaints per 1,000 students annually⁵¹
- Expected complaints over past 3 years: 48-96 total
- Typical responsibility finding rate: 30-50%⁵²
- Expected responsible findings: 14-48 cases
- Typical appeal/litigation rate: 5-15% of responsible findings⁵³
- **Expected additional Title IX claims (post-closing): 2-7 cases**

**Financial Exposure from Additional Claims:**
Assuming settlement values of $150,000 to $400,000 per claim:
- Low estimate (2 additional claims × $150,000): **$300,000**
- Mid estimate (4 additional claims × $250,000): **$1,000,000**
- High estimate (7 additional claims × $400,000): **$2,800,000**
- **Estimated three-year tail exposure: $1 million to $3 million**⁵⁴

*See* Section XI.B.2.f at pp. 142-145 analyzing mandatory closing conditions; successor liability for undisclosed pre-closing Title IX claims creates $1M-$3M tail exposure requiring six-year Extended Reporting Period insurance coverage or $2M-$3M seller-funded litigation reserve

### F. Post-Conversion Title IX Compliance Obligations

#### 1. No Exemption for For-Profit Status

Title IX applies to all educational institutions receiving federal financial assistance, without distinction between nonprofit and for-profit status.⁵⁵ The statutory text conditions the prohibition on "receiving Federal financial assistance," which includes all Title IV-eligible institutions regardless of tax status or corporate structure.

**Regulatory Confirmation:**
The Department of Education's regulations at 34 C.F.R. § 106.2 define "recipient" as "any public or private agency, institution, or organization, or other entity, or any person to which Federal financial assistance is extended" for an education program or activity.⁵⁶ This definition encompasses proprietary institutions, and the Department has consistently applied Title IX to for-profit colleges and universities.

**Heightened Scrutiny for For-Profit Institutions:**
Empirical research on OCR enforcement demonstrates that for-profit educational institutions face disproportionately high Title IX complaint rates and investigation intensity:
- For-profit institutions receive approximately 2.1x complaints per 1,000 students compared to nonprofit institutions⁵⁷
- OCR resolution agreements with for-profit institutions contain more extensive monitoring provisions⁵⁸
- For-profit institutions are more likely to face multiple simultaneous OCR investigations⁵⁹

This heightened enforcement risk reflects several factors:
1. Higher rates of nontraditional students (older, part-time, online) who may face different harassment patterns
2. Institutional culture differences and lower investment in compliance infrastructure
3. OCR policy prioritizing oversight of institutions with federal student aid compliance concerns
4. Greater regulatory skepticism of for-profit motives in Title IX adjudications⁶⁰

**Implication for Midwest University:**
Following conversion to for-profit status, Midwest University should anticipate increased OCR scrutiny and potentially higher complaint rates. The institution must maintain robust Title IX compliance infrastructure to withstand this heightened oversight environment.

#### 2. Required Title IX Compliance Infrastructure

Federal regulations mandate specific organizational and procedural requirements for Title IX compliance:⁶¹

**Title IX Coordinator (Required):**
- Full-time designated Title IX Coordinator with authority and resources
- Salary range for qualified coordinators at institutions of Midwest University's size: $120,000-$150,000⁶²
- Coordinator must have sufficient staff support (typically 1-2 additional FTEs at 8,000-student institution)
- Total Title IX office personnel costs: $180,000-$250,000 annually

**Investigation and Adjudication Personnel:**
- Trained investigators (may be outsourced or in-house)
- Hearing officers or panels for live hearings (under 2020 regulations)
- Appeals officers separate from initial decision-makers
- Estimated costs: $50,000-$100,000 annually (combination of staff time and contracted services)

**Training Requirements:**
- Mandatory training for Title IX Coordinator, investigators, decision-makers, appeals officers
- Specialized training on trauma-informed investigation, bias reduction, procedural requirements
- Annual refresher training
- Faculty and staff awareness training
- Student orientation training
- Estimated costs: $50,000-$75,000 annually⁶³

**Campus Climate Surveys:**
- Biennial campus climate surveys to assess sexual misconduct prevalence and institutional response
- Professional survey administration and analysis
- Estimated costs: $25,000-$50,000 per survey (every 2 years)⁶⁴

**Policy Development and Review:**
- Comprehensive Title IX policies and procedures
- Annual policy review and updates for regulatory changes
- Student handbook integration
- Estimated costs: $15,000-$25,000 annually (legal review and policy development)

**Total Annual Title IX Compliance Costs: $250,000-$400,000**

This compliance cost represents a permanent operating expense for maintaining Title IV eligibility and avoiding OCR enforcement actions.

*See* Section I.D.1 at pp. 20-23 analyzing HLC Criterion 2.A requiring ethical and responsible conduct; OCR Title IX violations or inadequate Title IX infrastructure could trigger adverse HLC action including sanctions or loss of accreditation

*See* Section IX.J at pp. 95-98 analyzing post-acquisition personnel cost increases; Title IX Coordinator position ($120K-$150K salary) plus 2-3 support staff positions increases annual personnel costs by $250K-$400K

#### 3. Clery Act Coordination and Overlapping Obligations

The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1092(f), imposes reporting obligations that substantially overlap with Title IX.⁶⁵ The Clery Act requires institutions to:

- Publish annual security reports with crime statistics
- Issue timely warnings for threats to campus safety
- Maintain daily crime logs
- Report sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking statistics
- Describe institutional policies for responding to sexual misconduct⁶⁶

**Clery-Title IX Integration Requirements:**
The 2013 Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) amended the Clery Act to incorporate many Title IX procedural requirements, including prompt investigation, interim protective measures, and grievance procedures.⁶⁷ Institutions must maintain integrated compliance systems ensuring that Title IX investigations generate required Clery Act statistical reporting and policy disclosures.

**Enforcement Risk:**
Clery Act violations carry civil penalties up to $66,035 per violation.⁶⁸ Institutions with inadequate Title IX response systems often face concurrent Clery Act violations, multiplying financial exposure. Recent examples include:
- Liberty University: $14 million (2023)—combined Title IX and Clery violations⁶⁹
- Michigan State University: $4.5 million (2018)—Title IX and Clery failures⁷⁰
- Penn State University: $2.4 million (2016)—Clery Act violations related to Sandusky case⁷¹

**Compliance Implication:**
Midwest University's Title IX compliance program must integrate Clery Act reporting obligations, requiring coordination between Title IX Coordinator, campus security, student affairs, and legal counsel. This integrated approach adds complexity and cost to compliance infrastructure.

### G. Regulatory Risk: 2024 Rule Implementation Scenarios

#### 1. Current Litigation Status and Timeline

The 2024 Title IX regulations face legal challenges in multiple federal circuits, with preliminary injunctions issued in 26 states including Indiana.⁷² The litigation challenges raise three primary arguments:

1. **Statutory Authority:** Department of Education exceeded its authority under Title IX by expanding "sex" to include "gender identity" without Congressional authorization⁷³
2. **Administrative Procedure Act:** Regulations were arbitrary and capricious, inadequately considered costs and alternatives⁷⁴
3. **First Amendment:** Regulations compel speech regarding gender identity and restrict religious expression⁷⁵

**Anticipated Timeline:**
- District court preliminary injunction appeals: 2025
- Circuit court decisions: Late 2025 or early 2026
- Potential Supreme Court review: 2026-2027 term
- Final resolution: 2026-2028⁷⁶

**Regulatory Uncertainty Period:**
For at least the next 2-4 years, institutions face uncertainty regarding which regulatory framework will ultimately govern Title IX compliance. This uncertainty complicates policy development, training programs, and resource allocation.

#### 2. Compliance Scenarios and Cost Implications

**Scenario A: 2024 Regulations Upheld (35-45% Probability)**

If appellate courts and the Supreme Court uphold the 2024 regulations, or if injunctions are dissolved, Midwest University must immediately implement comprehensive compliance measures:

**Required Actions:**
1. **Policy Revisions:**
   - Expand sex discrimination definition to include gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, and related conditions
   - Revise investigation procedures to comply with modified procedural requirements
   - Update grievance procedures and appeal processes
   - Implement new recordkeeping requirements
   - Estimated cost: $150,000-$250,000 (legal review, policy drafting, campus-wide notice)⁷⁷

2. **Training Programs:**
   - Comprehensive retraining for all Title IX personnel on expanded definitions and new procedures
   - Faculty and staff training on gender identity discrimination
   - Student training and orientation materials
   - Estimated cost: $75,000-$150,000⁷⁸

3. **Facility and Program Modifications:**
   - Review and potentially modify sex-separated facilities (restrooms, locker rooms, housing)
   - Evaluate athletics policies under expanded discrimination definition
   - Update forms and systems to accommodate gender identity
   - Estimated cost: $100,000-$300,000⁷⁹

4. **Ongoing Compliance Costs:**
   - Increased complaint volume (expanded definitions typically generate more complaints)
   - Additional investigation complexity (gender identity discrimination claims)
   - Enhanced OCR oversight and potential compliance reviews
   - Estimated additional annual cost: $100,000-$200,000⁸⁰

**Total Implementation Cost (2024 Regulations): $425,000-$900,000 one-time, plus $100,000-$200,000 ongoing**

**Scenario B: 2024 Regulations Struck Down (30-40% Probability)**

If federal courts permanently enjoin the 2024 regulations and set them aside, institutions would continue operating under 2020 regulatory requirements. This scenario presents the lowest compliance cost but does not eliminate regulatory risk.

**Compliance Posture:**
- Maintain current policies compliant with 2020 regulations
- Continue live hearing procedures with cross-examination
- No expansion of sex discrimination definition
- Current compliance costs continue ($250,000-$400,000 annually)⁸¹

**Risk Factor:**
A future presidential administration could initiate new Title IX rulemaking, potentially reimposing expanded discrimination definitions or modified procedures. Institutions cannot assume permanent regulatory stability even if 2024 regulations are struck down.

**Scenario C: Regulatory Limbo/Hybrid Framework (20-30% Probability)**

The most operationally challenging scenario involves continued preliminary injunctions in some states while regulations take effect in others, creating a geographically fragmented regulatory landscape. Multi-state institutions and online programs would face compliance with multiple conflicting standards.

For Midwest University, Indiana's injunction would continue indefinitely while regulations are litigated, but online programs serving students in non-enjoined states might face argument that 2024 regulations apply to those students. This hybrid framework creates maximum compliance complexity and cost.⁸²

### H. Risk Mitigation Strategies and Deal Structure Recommendations

#### 1. Pre-Closing Risk Mitigation

**Immediate Due Diligence Actions (Complete Within 14 Days):**

1. **Insurance Policy Review (CRITICAL - 48 Hours):**
   - Obtain complete D&O policy with all endorsements and exclusions
   - Identify whether sexual misconduct exclusion exists and its scope
   - If broad exclusion exists: Negotiate $1 million to $2 million purchase price reduction⁸³
   - Confirm policy renewal dates for prior knowledge exclusion analysis
   - Estimated cost: Legal review ($5,000-$10,000)

2. **Settle *Doe v. MU* Litigation (60-90 Days Pre-Closing):**
   - Initiate settlement negotiations targeting $250,000-$350,000 resolution
   - Settlement removes $2 million worst-case verdict risk
   - Eliminates insurance coverage uncertainty
   - Avoids April 2025 trial and associated defense costs
   - Recommended settlement authority: Up to $400,000⁸⁴
   - Expected settlement cost: $300,000

3. **Title IX Compliance Audit (30-45 Days):**
   - Retain external Title IX compliance consultant to audit current practices
   - Identify deficiencies in investigation procedures, training, documentation
   - Assess additional claims risk from past cases
   - Review statistical data regarding responsibility findings (gender disparities)
   - Estimated cost: $75,000-$125,000⁸⁵

4. **OCR Records Check:**
   - Search Department of Education OCR database for pending or resolved complaints against Midwest University
   - Identify any ongoing OCR investigations not disclosed in due diligence materials
   - Review resolution agreements and compliance obligations
   - Estimated cost: $5,000-$10,000 (legal research and records requests)

**Tail Insurance Coverage (MANDATORY Closing Condition):**

Given the two-to-three-year statute of limitations for Title IX claims and the estimated $1 million to $3 million exposure from undisclosed pre-closing claims, the transaction must include six-year extended reporting period (tail) coverage for D&O and Employment Practices Liability (EPL) insurance.⁸⁶

**Tail Coverage Terms:**
- Coverage period: Six years post-closing
- Policy limits: $10 million (matching current D&O limits)
- Retention: $250,000 per claim
- Premium: $500,000-$700,000⁸⁷
- **Allocation: Seller pays tail premium as closing condition**

The six-year tail period ensures coverage for claims filed within Indiana's two-year statute of limitations plus tolling, and provides margin for discovery rule extensions. Without tail coverage, American Education Holdings would bear full uninsured exposure for any pre-closing Title IX claims filed post-closing.

*See* Section X.D.3 at pp. 92-95 analyzing Extended Reporting Period tail insurance requirements; six-year ERP tail coverage for Title IX claims exposure represents $500K-$700K premium cost that should be borne by seller as pre-closing liability

#### 2. Transaction Structure and Purchase Price Adjustments

**Escrow for *Doe v. MU* Litigation:**
Establish $1 million escrow holdback from purchase price for 18 months post-closing or until *Doe v. MU* litigation resolves, whichever is earlier.⁸⁸

**Release Scenarios:**
- If case settles for ≤$500,000: Seller receives escrow balance minus settlement amount and defense costs
- If judgment ≤$500,000: Seller receives escrow balance minus judgment amount and defense costs
- If judgment >$500,000: Seller receives no escrow funds; buyer recovers $1 million against judgment
- If insurance covers claim: Seller receives escrow minus $250,000 retention

**Representations and Warranties Insurance:**
Consider R&W insurance policy with Title IX-specific sublimit addressing:
- Undisclosed Title IX complaints or OCR investigations
- Unrecorded sexual misconduct allegations
- Statistical data misrepresentations regarding disciplinary patterns⁸⁹

**R&W Policy Terms:**
- Title IX sublimit: $5 million
- Retention: $500,000
- Premium: Approximately $175,000-$225,000 (3.5-4.5% of sublimit)⁹⁰
- Coverage for unknown Title IX claims beyond the $1 million escrow

**Purchase Price Adjustment Recommendations:**

| Condition Discovered | Recommended Adjustment | Rationale |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Broad sexual misconduct exclusion in D&O policy | $(1,500,000) | Eliminates coverage for *Doe v. MU* and potential additional claims |
| No EPL policy or inadequate employment practices coverage | $(200,000) | Increased retention exposure for Title IX employment claims |
| Evidence of 3+ undisclosed potential Title IX claims | $(500,000) per claim | Expected settlement cost for additional claims |
| Ongoing undisclosed OCR investigation | $(750,000) to $(2,000,000) | Resolution cost and remedial measures |
| Statistical evidence of systemic gender bias (>90% male responsibility rate) | $(2,000,000) | Class action risk and OCR enforcement exposure |

#### 3. Post-Closing Compliance Program

**Year 1 Implementation (First 12 Months):**

1. **Personnel Changes:**
   - Retain new Title IX Coordinator not involved in prior claims (avoids appearance of continuity with potentially problematic practices)
   - Hire or contract additional investigative staff
   - Establish separate hearing officer panel
   - Total staffing cost: $250,000-$350,000 annually⁹¹

2. **Policy and Procedure Overhaul:**
   - Implement 2020 regulation-compliant procedures with live hearings and cross-examination
   - Adopt trauma-informed investigation protocols
   - Establish clear timelines and documentation requirements
   - Annual policy review and update process
   - Cost: $100,000-$150,000⁹²

3. **Comprehensive Training Program:**
   - Train all Title IX personnel on updated procedures
   - Conduct campus-wide awareness training for faculty, staff, and students
   - Specialized training for hearing officers and appeal panels
   - Document all training for OCR compliance
   - Annual training cost: $75,000-$125,000⁹³

4. **Campus Climate Survey (Within 12 Months):**
   - Administer comprehensive sexual misconduct climate survey
   - Analyze results and identify areas requiring institutional response
   - Develop action plan addressing survey findings
   - Cost: $40,000-$60,000⁹⁴

5. **Technology and Systems:**
   - Implement case management system for Title IX investigations
   - Develop secure recordkeeping for investigation files
   - Integrate Clery Act reporting systems
   - Cost: $50,000-$100,000⁹⁵

**Total Year 1 Implementation Cost: $515,000-$785,000**

**Ongoing Annual Costs (Years 2+):**
- Title IX office personnel: $250,000-$350,000
- Training and professional development: $75,000-$100,000
- Climate survey (biennial): $20,000-$30,000 (averaged annually)
- Policy review and legal consultation: $25,000-$40,000
- Case management and technology: $15,000-$25,000
- **Total Ongoing Annual Cost: $385,000-$545,000**⁹⁶

*See* Section XI.A.3 at pp. 48-52 analyzing post-acquisition operating cost increases; Title IX compliance infrastructure buildout requires $515K-$785K Year 1 implementation cost plus $385K-$545K ongoing annual operating expense for personnel, training, and systems

#### 4. Litigation Reserve and Financial Planning

**Recommended Reserves:**

| Risk Category | Reserve Amount | Duration | Rationale |
|--------------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| *Doe v. MU* settlement/judgment | $500,000 | Until case resolves | Covers settlement or partial judgment if insurance dispute |
| Additional known potential claims (2-3 cases) | $750,000 | 24 months | Settlement cost for disclosed borderline cases |
| Unknown tail exposure | $1,500,000 | 36 months | Statistical estimate of 3-5 undiscovered claims |
| OCR investigation reserve | $500,000 | 24 months | Potential OCR enforcement action and remedial costs |
| **Total Litigation Reserve** | **$3,250,000** | **Rolling 36-month period** | Adequate for expected Title IX exposure |

This reserve should be established at closing and maintained as restricted funds separate from operating cash. As claims resolve or statutes of limitations expire, reserves can be released.⁹⁷

### I. Cross-Domain Integration Points

The Title IX compliance obligations and litigation exposure intersect with numerous other transaction risk areas:

**Insurance Coverage:**
The sexual misconduct exclusion issue represents the single most critical insurance coverage question in the transaction. If the D&O policy contains a broad exclusion, the buyer faces $1.5 million to $2 million in additional uninsured exposure beyond amounts already disclosed. This coverage gap would materially impact transaction value and require either purchase price reduction or enhanced seller indemnification.⁹⁸

*See* Section X.D.1 at pp. 85-88 analyzing D&O policy sexual misconduct exclusions; determination of exclusion scope must occur within 48 hours of LOI execution; if broad exclusion exists, require $1M-$2M purchase price reduction or enhanced seller indemnification

**HLC Accreditation:**
The Higher Learning Commission's Criterion 2.A requires institutions to demonstrate ethical and responsible conduct and compliance with federal regulations.⁹⁹ Title IX violations, OCR enforcement actions, or systemic failures in responding to sexual misconduct complaints constitute grounds for adverse HLC action including probation, show-cause orders, or loss of accreditation. The pending *Doe v. MU* litigation and any additional Title IX claims could trigger HLC inquiry during the change of control review process.

*See* Section I.D.1 at pp. 20-23 analyzing HLC Criterion 2.A ethical conduct standards; pattern of Title IX compliance failures or adverse litigation outcomes may trigger HLC inquiry; OCR resolution agreement or multiple adverse Title IX judgments could result in probationary accreditation status

**Employment and Labor:**
Title IX compliance requirements impose significant personnel costs including a full-time Title IX Coordinator ($120,000-$150,000), support staff, investigators, and hearing officers. These positions represent $250,000-$400,000 in annual personnel expense that must be incorporated into post-acquisition staffing budgets.¹⁰⁰

*See* Section IX.J at pp. 95-98 analyzing organizational structure; Title IX Coordinator must have sufficient authority and independence under 34 C.F.R. § 106.8(a), requiring direct reporting relationship to president/CEO and complicating corporate reporting structures

**Federal Student Aid:**
Title IV regulations at 34 C.F.R. § 668.15 incorporate Title IX compliance as an institutional eligibility requirement.¹⁰¹ Institutions found in substantial violation of Title IX may face Title IV sanctions including fine, limitation, suspension, or termination of federal student aid eligibility. For Midwest University, with $182 million in annual federal aid (26.8% of revenue), Title IX violations that trigger Title IV sanctions would constitute an existential threat.

*See* Section II.F at pp. 52-55 analyzing Department of Education administrative capability standards under 34 C.F.R. § 668.16; substantial Title IX violations triggering OCR enforcement action may also trigger FSA sanctions including temporary Title IV suspension (has occurred in 12% of major Title IX cases)

**Statutory Compliance Framework:**
Title IX obligations continue regardless of for-profit conversion under 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), which applies to all Title IV-eligible institutions.¹⁰² The statutory framework provides no exemption or reduced obligations for proprietary institutions, and empirical enforcement data suggests for-profit institutions face enhanced OCR scrutiny.

*Note*: 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (Title IX statutory language) contains no exemption for proprietary institutions; all institutions receiving federal financial assistance must comply regardless of tax status or ownership structure

### J. Conclusion and Risk Summary

Title IX compliance and pending litigation present material but manageable risks in the Midwest University acquisition, provided appropriate pre-closing actions are completed and adequate reserves are established. The critical path items include:

**HIGH Severity Findings Requiring Immediate Action:**
1. **D&O Insurance Sexual Misconduct Exclusion (48-Hour Deadline):** Obtain and review D&O policy for sexual misconduct exclusion. If broad exclusion exists, negotiate $1 million to $2 million purchase price reduction.¹⁰³

2. **Settle *Doe v. MU* Litigation (60-90 Days Pre-Closing):** Initiate settlement negotiations targeting $250,000-$350,000 resolution. Settlement eliminates $2 million worst-case verdict risk and insurance coverage uncertainty.¹⁰⁴

3. **Six-Year Tail Coverage (Mandatory Closing Condition):** Require seller to obtain and pay for six-year extended reporting period D&O and EPL coverage ($500,000-$700,000 premium). Tail coverage protects against $1 million to $3 million exposure from unknown pre-closing Title IX claims.¹⁰⁵

**MEDIUM Severity Findings Requiring Transaction Structure:**
1. **Litigation Escrow:** Establish $1 million escrow holdback for *Doe v. MU* resolution, released to seller upon settlement/judgment within specified parameters.¹⁰⁶

2. **Title IX Compliance Audit:** Conduct comprehensive audit identifying procedural deficiencies and assessing statistical patterns that could indicate systemic bias risk.¹⁰⁷

3. **$3.25 Million Litigation Reserve:** Establish reserve for *Doe v. MU*, known potential claims, tail exposure, and potential OCR enforcement.¹⁰⁸

**Post-Closing Compliance Program:**
Year 1 implementation costs of $515,000-$785,000 plus ongoing annual costs of $385,000-$545,000 reflect the permanent compliance infrastructure required for Title IV-eligible institutions. These costs constitute a baseline operating expense and cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing federal student aid eligibility and regional accreditation.¹⁰⁹

**Summary Exposure Table:**

| Risk Category | Gross Exposure | Probability | Weighted Impact | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| *Doe v. MU* litigation (if no settlement) | $500K-$2.05M | 50% liability | $500K-$1M | Escrow $1M; settle for $250K-$350K |
| Sexual misconduct exclusion (if exists) | $500K-$2M uninsured | 30% exists | $150K-$600K | Review policy immediately; adjust price $1M-$2M if confirmed |
| Tail exposure (2-7 additional claims) | $300K-$2.8M | 60% occurrence | $180K-$1.7M | Six-year ERP tail coverage ($500K-$700K seller cost) |
| OCR investigation/enforcement | $500K-$2M | 25% probability | $125K-$500K | $500K reserve; enhanced compliance program |
| 2024 regulations implementation | $425K-$900K one-time | 40% probability | $170K-$360K | Budget contingency; defer capital projects |
| **Total Weighted Title IX Exposure** | **$2.2M-$8.75M gross** | **Various** | **$1.13M-$4.16M** | **Settlement + tail + escrow + reserve** |

**Recommended Total Transaction Adjustment for Title IX Risks: $2.5 million to $4 million**, structured as:
- Purchase price reduction (if sexual misconduct exclusion): $1M-$2M
- Seller-funded tail coverage: $500K-$700K
- Litigation escrow: $1M
- Buyer-established reserve: $1M-$1.3M (beyond escrow)

This comprehensive risk mitigation approach addresses both known litigation exposure and prospective successor liability while ensuring adequate compliance infrastructure to maintain federal student aid eligibility and regional accreditation post-conversion.¹¹⁰
