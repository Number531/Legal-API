## VII. NCAA DIVISION I ATHLETICS COMPLIANCE AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY

The conversion of Midwest University from non-profit to for-profit status creates substantial risks to the institution's NCAA Division I membership and Missouri Valley Conference affiliation, threatening $3.7M-$6.2M in annual athletic revenue while imposing a $19.8M annual athletic subsidy that directly increases American Education Holdings' tax burden. This analysis examines NCAA governance restrictions on for-profit institutions, conference membership jeopardy, athletic department financial sustainability, and strategic recommendations regarding potential Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) transition.

### A. NCAA Division I Membership Framework for For-Profit Institutions

#### 1. Legal Status of For-Profit Members Under NCAA Constitution

The NCAA Constitution does not expressly prohibit for-profit institutions from maintaining Division I membership, but imposes severe operational restrictions that fundamentally alter the economic value of athletic program participation. NCAA Article 20 establishes distinct governance and revenue distribution rules for for-profit members.¹

Grand Canyon University (GCU) represents the sole precedent for a for-profit institution competing at the Division I level. GCU initially transitioned from Division II to Division I in 2012 while operating as a for-profit institution.² This move prompted significant controversy within the NCAA and triggered a yearlong study examining whether for-profit membership threatened the association's own tax-exempt status.³ Following extensive review, the NCAA Board of Directors recommended "creating a new classification for for-profit institutions as a way to balance preserving its nonprofit status while allowing for-profit colleges to remain members."⁴

The NCAA's resolution determined that "the association can continue to comply with its nonprofit status if the financial benefits of for-profit colleges are delivered through conferences and not the NCAA itself."⁵ This finding established that for-profit institutions may participate in Division I competition but face categorical exclusion from NCAA-level financial distributions, effectively shifting the economic burden to conference-level revenue sharing arrangements.

#### 2. Governance Restrictions on For-Profit Institutions

NCAA bylaws impose strict governance participation limits on for-profit members. For-profit institutions "are not permitted to directly participate in the NCAA's governance process, neither as voting members at the NCAA Convention nor as institutional representatives on committees."⁶ This exclusion prevents for-profit members from influencing rule-making, policy development, or enforcement decisions affecting their operations.

However, the bylaws permit limited governance participation by allowing staff members from for-profit institutions to "participate on committees as representatives of their conferences."⁷ This carve-out enables conference-level representation while maintaining the NCAA's position that for-profit institutions themselves remain excluded from direct governance.

**Application to Midwest University**: Upon conversion to for-profit status, Midwest University will immediately lose its governance participation rights at the NCAA level. The university will forfeit its Convention voting privileges and cannot place institutional representatives on NCAA committees. This governance exclusion may affect the institution's ability to influence rule changes affecting mid-major basketball programs, transfer portal policies, or Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) regulations particularly relevant to Midwest University's competitive position.

#### 3. Revenue Distribution Exclusions

The most financially significant consequence of for-profit status involves categorical exclusion from NCAA revenue distributions. According to NCAA policy, for-profit members "are not eligible for the organization's revenue distributions, grants or scholarships."⁸ This exclusion affects multiple revenue streams:

**NCAA Basketball Tournament Units**: NCAA member institutions earn tournament "units" for each game their conference participates in during March Madness. Each unit generated approximately $338,000 in the 2024 distribution cycle, with units paid over a six-year rolling period.⁹ Mid-major conferences like the Missouri Valley Conference typically generate 2-3 units annually from automatic qualifiers and occasional at-large bids, translating to $2M-$3M in annual distributions across conference members.¹⁰

**Student Assistance Fund**: The NCAA distributes Student Assistance Fund allocations to member institutions based on sport sponsorship, scholarship counts, and conference affiliation, typically providing $300K-$500K annually to Division I institutions for student-athlete welfare programs including emergency financial assistance, professional clothing for interviews, graduate school application fees, and medical expenses not covered by insurance.¹¹

**Conference Grants Program**: The NCAA provides annual conference grants supporting basketball officiating, compliance assistance, and conference championship operations, typically totaling $200K-$400K annually distributed across conference members.¹²

**Total Annual Revenue Loss**: Midwest University's conversion to for-profit status will result in approximately $3M-$4.9M in annual revenue loss compared to non-profit Division I institutions.¹³ This represents 10.7%-17.5% of the current $28M athletic department budget.

**Critical Distinction**: While NCAA-level distributions cease for for-profit members, conference-level media rights, tournament revenue shares, and sponsorship income remain available if conference membership continues. The $2.2M annual Missouri Valley Conference media distribution that Midwest University currently receives is not affected by NCAA for-profit exclusions—but is threatened by potential conference expulsion as analyzed in Section VII.B below.

*See* Section IV.C at pp. 89-95 analyzing net income impact of tax conversion; NCAA revenue exclusion reduces athletic self-generated revenue from $8.2M to approximately $5.2M-$6.2M, increasing net athletic subsidy burden from $19.8M to $21.8M-$22.8M annually, thereby reducing deductible expenses and increasing taxable income by approximately $2M-$3M, generating $420K-$630K in additional tax liability at 21% federal corporate rate plus 4.9% Indiana rate.

### B. Missouri Valley Conference Membership Risk Analysis

#### 1. MVC Constitutional Framework and Membership Requirements

The Missouri Valley Conference Constitution governs membership eligibility, withdrawal procedures, and change of control notifications.¹⁴ While specific MVC bylaws provisions regarding institutional type are not publicly disclosed, conference constitutional principles emphasize institutional mission alignment, academic integrity, and commitment to the student-athlete welfare model characteristic of non-profit higher education.¹⁵

The MVC Constitution specifies that "a minimum of 24 months' notice of an institution's intention to withdraw from the Conference is required."¹⁶ This extended notice period enables the conference to plan facility scheduling, adjust revenue distribution formulas, maintain NCAA automatic qualification thresholds (which require minimum conference membership numbers), and recruit replacement members.¹⁷

**Exit Fee Structure**: While MVC-specific exit fees are not publicly disclosed in accessible conference documents,¹⁸ comparable mid-major conferences typically impose exit fees ranging from $500K to $2M. When Valparaiso University left the Horizon League to join the Missouri Valley Conference in 2017, the Horizon League claimed Valparaiso owed a $500K exit fee, ultimately resolved through litigation.¹⁹ Given the MVC's larger media contracts and stronger competitive profile compared to the Horizon League, exit fees likely fall in the $1M-$2M range.

#### 2. Change of Control and For-Profit Status Compatibility

MVC bylaws likely contain change of control notification requirements consistent with standard conference membership agreements, though specific provisions are not publicly available.²⁰ Typical conference membership agreements require advance notification of ownership changes, conference approval of control transactions, and compliance certification that new ownership will maintain NCAA and conference eligibility standards.²¹

**Risk Assessment**: When American Education Holdings acquires Midwest University and converts it from non-profit to for-profit status, the Missouri Valley Conference may exercise several options:

1. **Require change of control approval**: MVC constitutional provisions likely mandate advance notification and approval of ownership changes affecting member institutions;

2. **Deny approval based on for-profit incompatibility**: If MVC membership requirements include express or implied limitations on institutional type, the conference may determine that for-profit status violates eligibility criteria;

3. **Terminate membership for proceeding without approval**: If Midwest University completes the transaction without securing conference consent, the MVC may exercise termination rights based on material breach of membership obligations;

4. **Impose modified membership conditions**: The MVC may approve continued membership subject to enhanced financial guarantees, restricted governance participation (parallel to NCAA restrictions), or modified revenue distribution formulas.²²

**Precedent Analysis**: Grand Canyon University's experience provides limited guidance. GCU joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2013 as a Division I provisional member while operating as a for-profit institution.²³ GCU later transitioned to the Mountain West Conference, demonstrating that some conferences accept for-profit members.²⁴ However, the Missouri Valley Conference maintains a different institutional profile than the WAC or Mountain West, with stronger emphasis on traditional academic mission and private school membership (Bradley, Drake, Illinois State, Indiana State, Missouri State, Murray State, Northern Iowa, Southern Illinois, UIC, Valparaiso).²⁵ No current MVC member operates as a for-profit institution, and conference culture emphasizes values-based membership criteria that may prove incompatible with for-profit conversion.

#### 3. Financial Impact of Conference Membership Loss

If the Missouri Valley Conference terminates Midwest University's membership or if the institution is forced to withdraw due to incompatibility concerns, the financial consequences are severe:

**Loss of Conference Media Rights**: $2.2M annually from MVC media distribution agreements, which provide baseline revenue independent of team performance.²⁶ This represents 7.9% of the athletic department's $28M annual budget.

**Loss of NCAA Tournament Revenue Units**: $500K-$1M annually from six-year rolling distribution of NCAA tournament units earned by MVC teams.²⁷ Conference tournament automatic qualifiers and occasional at-large bids generate units shared across all conference members regardless of individual school participation.

**Loss of Automatic NCAA Tournament Bid**: The Missouri Valley Conference receives an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship as a recognized Division I conference. Loss of conference membership eliminates access to this automatic qualification path, requiring Midwest University to compete as an independent or secure membership in another conference to access postseason competition. Independent status effectively eliminates NCAA tournament access for mid-major programs.

**Conference Transition Costs**: $1M-$3M in one-time costs including exit fees ($1M-$2M estimated), travel budget increases for independent scheduling, and potential facility upgrades required by alternative conference membership criteria.²⁸

**Total Estimated Annual Financial Impact**: $3.7M-$6.2M when combining lost media revenue, tournament units, and operational inefficiencies.²⁹

#### 4. Independent Athletic Program Status Risks

If Midwest University cannot secure alternative conference membership as a for-profit institution, independent status creates compounding operational challenges:

**Scheduling Disadvantages**: Independent institutions face 30-50% increases in travel and scheduling costs due to absence of conference-mandated scheduling frameworks, requiring individual negotiation for each competition.³⁰ Conference members typically play 18-20 league games with pre-determined opponents and dates; independents must negotiate all schedules annually.

**Recruiting Disadvantages**: Student-athletes prefer conference affiliation for guaranteed television exposure, postseason tournament access, and rivalry game participation. Recruiting mid-major talent becomes substantially more difficult without conference membership, creating competitive deterioration.

**Revenue Loss from Reduced Media Exposure**: Independent institutions receive minimal television coverage compared to conference members, directly reducing guarantee game fees (payments received for playing at high-major schools), corporate sponsorship value, and ticket sales.

**Accreditation Concerns**: The Higher Learning Commission may view athletic program instability—particularly forced conference exit—as an indicator of institutional distress, potentially triggering enhanced monitoring or focused evaluation during accreditation reviews.³¹

*See* Section I.C at pp. 28-35 analyzing HLC Criterion Three compliance risks; MVC membership loss could be interpreted by HLC as institutional instability signal under Criterion Five (Resources, Planning, and Institutional Effectiveness), particularly if combined with governance changes, faculty concerns, and financial restructuring, potentially triggering focused evaluation or monitoring requiring additional reporting and site visits.

### C. Athletic Department Financial Analysis and Sustainability

#### 1. Current Athletic Department Financial Structure

Midwest University operates an NCAA Division I athletic program with 18 varsity sports and an annual budget of approximately $28M.³² The financial structure reflects a heavily subsidized model characteristic of mid-major athletic programs:

**Revenue Sources**:
- Self-generated athletic revenue: $8.2M annually (29% of budget)
  - Ticket sales: $3.5M (estimated)
  - Corporate sponsorships: $2.2M (estimated)
  - Conference media distributions: $2.2M (confirmed)
  - NCAA tournament units: $300K (six-year average)

- Institutional subsidy: $19.8M annually (71% of budget)³³

**Expenditure Categories**:
- Athletic scholarships: $12M annually (420 scholarship student-athletes × $28,571 average)³⁴
- Coaching salaries and support staff: $4.5M annually (estimated)
- Facilities operations and maintenance: $3.3M annually (estimated)
- Travel, equipment, and game operations: $8.2M annually (estimated)

**Per-Student Athletic Assessment**: The $19.8M institutional subsidy represents $364 per full-time equivalent student across 22,500 total enrollment, or approximately $880 per undergraduate assuming 65% undergraduate composition.³⁵ This subsidy level falls within typical ranges for Division I mid-major institutions but represents 4.4% of Midwest University's total operating expenses.

#### 2. Tax Impact on Athletic Department Economics

Prior to conversion, the $19.8M institutional subsidy represented an internal allocation from general operating funds. As a non-profit institution, Midwest University paid no income tax, making the subsidy effectively a pre-tax expense.

**Post-Conversion Tax Treatment**: Upon conversion to for-profit status, the $19.8M athletic subsidy becomes subject to corporate income taxation. The subsidy must be funded from after-tax dollars, increasing the true economic cost:

- Annual athletic subsidy: $19.8M
- Corporate income tax rate (federal): 21%³⁶
- Additional tax burden attributable to athletic subsidy: $4.16M
- **Total after-tax cost of athletics**: $23.96M annually

This $4.16M additional tax burden represents 14.9% of the athletic budget and reduces American Education Holdings' net income by an equivalent amount, directly affecting acquisition return on investment calculations.

*See* Section IV.B-C at pp. 55-95 analyzing comprehensive state and local tax consequences; athletic subsidy tax burden of $4.16M combines with federal corporate income tax ($9.45M), Indiana corporate income tax ($2.205M), property tax ($15.6M), and sales tax ($5.95M) to create total first-year tax obligation of $33.205M, reducing post-acquisition net income from $44.5M to $11.795M, representing 73.5% net income decline and fundamentally threatening transaction economic viability.

#### 3. Financial Sustainability Analysis

**Current Model Viability**: The 71% subsidy rate significantly exceeds Power Five conference averages (where subsidies typically range 20-40% for profitable athletic programs) but aligns with mid-major Division I norms. Programs in the Missouri Valley Conference, Atlantic 10, West Coast Conference, and similar mid-major conferences typically subsidize 60-80% of athletic department budgets.³⁷

However, the conversion to for-profit status fundamentally alters sustainability calculus. The effective cost increase from $19.8M to $23.96M (accounting for tax burden) represents 20.1% growth in true economic cost without corresponding revenue increases.

**Revenue Diversification Challenges**: Increasing self-generated athletic revenue from $8.2M to reduce subsidy dependence faces structural constraints:

- **Ticket Sales Growth Limited**: Midwest University's mid-major profile limits premium seating opportunities, season ticket demand, and single-game attendance pricing power. Absent sustained NCAA tournament success or conference championship performance, ticket revenue growth typically tracks inflation (2-3% annually) rather than providing material subsidy reduction.

- **Corporate Sponsorship Constraints**: Mid-major athletic programs compete for local and regional corporate sponsors against professional sports teams, Power Five conference members, and other entertainment options. Sponsorship revenue growth requires either expanded inventory (additional venue signage, digital assets) or pricing increases dependent on competitive success.

- **Media Rights Already Allocated**: Conference-level media rights represent collective bargaining agreements. Individual institutions cannot independently increase media revenue absent conference-wide contract renegotiation.

**Subsidy Growth Pressure**: Multiple factors create upward pressure on athletic department expenses:

- **Coaching salary arms race**: Competitive coaching markets require salary increases of 3-5% annually to retain quality staff, particularly following successful seasons.

- **Facility maintenance and upgrades**: Aging athletic facilities require capital investment cycles averaging $2M-$5M every 5-7 years for competitive positioning.

- **NIL competitive landscape**: Name, Image, and Likeness compensation created new competitive dynamics. While institutions cannot directly fund NIL payments, supporting NIL collectives through facilitation, marketing, and infrastructure creates indirect institutional costs.

- **Transfer portal recruiting expenses**: The NCAA transfer portal increased roster turnover rates, requiring enhanced recruiting budgets for annual roster management rather than traditional four-year development models.

**Projected Subsidy Trajectory**: Absent intervention, athletic subsidy growth will likely track 3-5% annually, reaching $21.5M-$23.4M by Year 5 post-acquisition. Combined with tax burden, the true economic cost escalates to $26M-$28.3M annually within five years.

### D. Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Transition Analysis

#### 1. FBS Transition Framework and Requirements

Midwest University currently sponsors Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) football, competing at the subdivision below the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) that includes Power Five conferences and Group of Five conferences. The NCAA removed its moratorium on FCS-to-FBS transitions in 2024, theoretically opening pathways for programs to elevate their competitive level.³⁸

**FBS Transition Requirements**:
- **Conference Affiliation Requirement**: Must secure invitation from an FBS conference. Independent FBS status is extremely rare (current independents: Notre Dame, UConn, UMass, Army, Liberty) and generally requires unique circumstances like Notre Dame's national profile and television contract.³⁹

- **Stadium Capacity**: Must have a stadium seating at least 15,000 fans. Midwest University's current football stadium seats approximately 12,000, requiring $8M-$15M expansion.⁴⁰

- **Scholarship Requirements**: Must fund 90% of the maximum 85 FBS scholarships, compared to 63 scholarships at the FCS level. This represents 22 additional scholarships at $28,571 each = $628,380 annually in incremental scholarship costs.⁴¹

- **Sport Sponsorship**: Must sponsor minimum 16 varsity sports (Midwest University currently sponsors 18, satisfying this requirement).

- **Attendance Requirements**: Must average 15,000 actual or paid attendance once every two years. Midwest University's current FCS attendance averages approximately 8,500, requiring substantial attendance growth or paid attendance subsidies.⁴²

- **Transition Period**: Two-year provisional period during which the institution is ineligible for conference championships or bowl games while meeting all other FBS requirements.

#### 2. Financial Analysis of FBS Transition Costs

**One-Time Capital Costs**:
- Stadium expansion (3,000-5,000 seats): $8M-$15M
- Practice facility upgrades: $5M-$10M
- Locker room and training facility enhancements: $3M-$5M
- Video/technology infrastructure: $2M-$3M
- **Total One-Time Costs**: $18M-$33M

**Incremental Annual Operating Costs**:
- Additional scholarships (22 × $28,571): $628,380
- Coaching staff expansion and salary increases: $2M-$3M (FBS coordinator salaries significantly exceed FCS levels)
- Enhanced recruiting budget: $500K-$1M (FBS recruiting is national rather than regional)
- Increased travel costs: $800K-$1.5M (longer distances to conference opponents)
- Game guarantee payments to FBS opponents: $1M-$2M (FBS teams demand higher guarantees for scheduling FCS/transitional opponents)
- Additional administrative and support staff: $500K-$800K
- **Total Incremental Annual Costs**: $5.4M-$9.3M

**Five-Year Transition Cost Total**: $45M-$78M (combining one-time capital and five years of incremental operating costs)

#### 3. FBS Revenue Potential Assessment

**Conference Media Revenue**: Group of Five FBS conferences (American Athletic Conference, Conference USA, MAC, Mountain West, Sun Belt) provide media revenue distributions of $2M-$7M annually per member institution.⁴³ Midwest University's Missouri Valley Conference provides $2.2M currently, representing potential incremental media revenue of $0-$4.8M annually depending on conference secured.

However, securing Group of Five conference membership as a for-profit institution creates additional challenges. Conference realignment dynamics favor institutions with large enrollment, strong media markets, and established fan bases. Midwest University's geographic location and for-profit status may disadvantage membership applications.

**Bowl Game Revenue**: FBS bowl eligibility (requiring 6-win season) provides access to bowl game payouts ranging from $500K to $4M for Group of Five participants.⁴⁴ However, bowl payouts are typically distributed to conferences and shared among members, with individual school retention averaging 20-40% of total payout. Assuming one bowl appearance every three years with $2M conference payout and 33% institutional retention = $220K annually.

**Increased Ticket Revenue**: FBS status may increase season ticket sales and per-game attendance through enhanced competition level and bowl eligibility. Conservatively estimating 2,000 additional tickets per game × 6 home games × $40 average ticket price = $480K annually.

**Corporate Sponsorship Growth**: FBS status increases corporate sponsorship value through enhanced media exposure and perceived prestige. Incremental sponsorship revenue estimated at $500K-$1M annually.

**Total Incremental FBS Revenue Potential**: $1.2M-$6.5M annually in optimistic scenarios.

#### 4. Return on Investment Analysis

**Base Case FBS Transition ROI** (assuming mid-range cost and revenue projections):
- Total five-year investment: $60M ($30M capital + $30M cumulative operating)
- Annual incremental revenue (steady state): $3.5M
- Payback period: 17 years
- Net present value at 8% discount rate: **Negative $22M**

**Optimistic Case** (securing American Athletic Conference membership with $7M media payout, maximizing sponsorship growth):
- Total five-year investment: $58M
- Annual incremental revenue (steady state): $6M
- Payback period: 9.7 years
- Net present value at 8% discount rate: **Negative $8M**

**Realistic Case for For-Profit Institution** (no FBS conference acceptance due to for-profit status, forcing independent FBS status):
- Total five-year investment: $65M
- Annual incremental revenue: $1.5M (no conference media revenue, minimal bowl access)
- Payback period: 43 years
- Net present value at 8% discount rate: **Negative $55M**

#### 5. Strategic Recommendation: Do Not Pursue FBS Transition

**Conclusion**: FBS transition is **financially non-viable** for Midwest University post-conversion to for-profit status. The combination of substantial capital requirements ($18M-$33M), significant annual operating cost increases ($5.4M-$9.3M), and limited revenue growth opportunities ($1.2M-$6.5M) creates negative returns on investment across all scenarios analyzed.

The for-profit status creates additional barriers to FBS conference membership, as no current Group of Five conference includes a for-profit member institution. Without conference affiliation, FBS independent status provides minimal economic benefit while imposing maximum cost burden.

**Recommended Alternative**: Maintain FCS football status, focus investment on basketball program competitive excellence within Missouri Valley Conference framework, and preserve financial resources for academic program enhancement and Title IV 90/10 ratio compliance initiatives that directly affect institutional viability.

*See* Section XI.B.1 at pp. 118-125 analyzing purchase price adjustment recommendation; decision to maintain FCS status and reject FBS transition eliminates $60M-$85M potential capital commitment for stadium expansion, facility upgrades, and recruiting infrastructure, preserving liquidity for mandatory $75M-$125M Title IV letter of credit requirement and reducing acquisition financing burden by equivalent amount.

### E. Student-Athlete Financial Aid and Title IV Compliance Interaction

#### 1. Athletic Scholarship Accounting in 90/10 Calculation

Midwest University provides approximately $12M annually in athletic scholarship aid to 420 student-athletes.⁴⁵ Under the Higher Education Act's 90/10 rule applicable to for-profit institutions, athletic scholarships constitute "institutional aid" (non-federal funds) in the 90/10 ratio denominator.⁴⁶

**90/10 Ratio Calculation Treatment**:
- **Numerator (Federal Title IV Aid)**: Athletic scholarship recipients may simultaneously receive federal Pell Grants, Direct Loans, and other Title IV aid. The federal aid received by student-athletes counts in the numerator.
- **Denominator (Total Revenue)**: Athletic scholarships provided by the institution count as "cash revenue" in the denominator to the extent they represent tuition, fees, and other charges that would otherwise be paid.⁴⁷

**Positive Impact on 90/10 Compliance**: The $12M in athletic scholarship aid effectively adds $12M to the denominator while adding only the federal aid those students receive to the numerator. Assuming athletic scholarship recipients average 50% federal aid utilization compared to general student population (due to athletic scholarships covering tuition, reducing need for federal loans), athletic aid provides favorable 90/10 ratio impact:

- Without athletic scholarships: 90/10 ratio = [Federal Aid] / [Total Revenue]
- With athletic scholarships: 90/10 ratio = [Federal Aid + $6M athlete federal aid] / [Total Revenue + $12M athletic scholarships]

This arithmetic improves the ratio by adding twice as much to the denominator as to the numerator, helping satisfy the requirement that no more than 90% of revenue derive from federal Title IV sources.

**Cost-Benefit Reality**: While athletic scholarships mathematically improve the 90/10 ratio, they cost the institution $12M to provide this benefit. The 90/10 compliance benefit could be achieved more cost-effectively through alternative revenue diversification strategies (corporate partnerships, endowment growth, non-federal grants) that generate revenue without corresponding expense.

**Strategic Consideration**: Athletic aid should not be justified solely on 90/10 compliance grounds. The primary justification remains institutional mission, student-athlete welfare, and competitive positioning. The 90/10 benefit represents a secondary positive externality rather than primary rationale.

*See* Section II.C.3 at pp. 37-42 analyzing 90/10 rule compliance mechanics under 34 C.F.R. § 600.5(a)(8); athletic scholarship aid of $12M annually contributes to 90/10 compliance by adding $12M to cash revenue denominator while adding approximately $6M in federal aid received by student-athletes to numerator, improving ratio from 88-89% to 85-86%, but requires $12M annual institutional subsidy funded through general operations.

### F. Conference Realignment Risk Scenarios and Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Trigger Events for Conference Membership Review

Several scenarios could prompt Missouri Valley Conference review or termination of Midwest University's membership:

**For-Profit Status Incompatibility**: If MVC membership criteria include express or implied requirements for non-profit institutional status, conversion triggers material breach. Even absent explicit prohibition, mission misalignment between for-profit operation and conference values-based membership philosophy may create grounds for termination.

**Academic Reputation Decline**: Conversion to for-profit status historically correlates with declining academic reputation as measured by U.S. News rankings, faculty qualifications, and research productivity.⁴⁸ If Midwest University's academic standing deteriorates post-acquisition, the MVC may determine that continued membership harms conference brand value.

**HLC Accreditation Sanctions**: If the Higher Learning Commission places Midwest University on probation, issues sanctions, or withdraws accreditation, the MVC would likely exercise immediate termination rights. NCAA Division I membership requires accreditation by a Department of Education-recognized accreditor; loss of accreditation triggers automatic conference and NCAA membership termination.⁴⁹

**Academic Progress Rate Decline**: NCAA Academic Progress Rate (APR) requirements mandate minimum 930 APR for postseason eligibility.⁵⁰ Midwest University currently maintains 980 APR, well above the minimum threshold. However, if for-profit conversion degrades academic support services funding, student-athlete academic performance may decline, potentially falling below the 930 threshold and triggering postseason ineligibility. Two consecutive years below 930 APR creates substantial conference membership jeopardy.

**Declining Athletic Competitiveness**: If athletic program competitiveness deteriorates significantly—particularly in revenue sports (men's basketball)—due to recruiting challenges associated with for-profit status or reduced athletic investment, the conference may determine that Midwest University no longer contributes to conference strength.

#### 2. Financial Impact Quantification by Scenario

| Trigger Event | Probability | Annual Financial Impact | Estimated Timeline | Mitigation Difficulty |
|--------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| For-profit status incompatibility | 20-30% | $3.7M-$6.2M | 12-36 months post-conversion | High (requires nonprofit status preservation or alternative conference) |
| Academic reputation decline | 15-25% | $3.7M-$6.2M | 3-5 years post-conversion | Medium (requires sustained academic investment) |
| HLC accreditation sanctions | 10-15% | $3.7M-$6.2M + loss of Title IV eligibility | 18-24 months post-conversion | Very High (accreditation loss effectively terminates institution) |
| APR sanctions | 5-10% | $500K-$2M (postseason ineligibility impact) | 2-4 years post-conversion | Low (maintain academic support funding) |
| Athletic competitiveness decline | 10-20% | $1M-$3M (recruiting and ticket revenue decline) | 3-5 years post-conversion | Medium (requires sustained athletic investment) |

**Aggregate Weighted Risk**: Combining probability-weighted annual impacts across scenarios yields $1.57M-$4.56M in expected annual value at risk from conference membership jeopardy.

#### 3. Alternative Conference Options Analysis

If Missouri Valley Conference membership becomes untenable, Midwest University must identify alternative conference options:

**Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN)**: Mid-major conference with recent acceptance of transitioning institutions. Geographic footprint extends to Midwest region. Media revenue distribution approximately $1M-$1.5M annually, representing $700K-$1.2M annual decline from MVC.⁵¹ ASUN has accepted for-profit members historically (predecessor conference to Liberty University's membership).

**Summit League**: Midwest-focused Division I conference with lower profile than MVC. Estimated media revenue $800K-$1.2M annually, representing $1M-$1.4M decline from MVC.⁵² Conference includes several public regional universities with mission profiles that may prove more compatible with for-profit membership.

**Independent Status**: As analyzed in Section VII.B.4 above, independent status is non-viable for mid-major basketball programs. Loss of automatic NCAA tournament access, television exposure, and scheduling framework effectively eliminates competitive viability.

**Conclusion**: Alternative conference membership would result in $700K-$2M annual revenue decline compared to Missouri Valley Conference membership, but represents substantially superior outcome to independent status. However, securing alternative conference membership as a for-profit institution remains uncertain, as most mid-major conferences prioritize institutional mission alignment.

#### 4. Recommended Mitigation Strategies

**Pre-Closing MVC Engagement**: American Education Holdings must engage Missouri Valley Conference leadership immediately upon execution of definitive purchase agreement to:
- Notify conference of proposed ownership change and institutional restructuring
- Request written confirmation of continued membership eligibility post-conversion
- Negotiate any modified membership terms (reduced governance participation, adjusted revenue distribution) before closing
- Obtain formal conference approval as closing condition

**Mission Preservation Documentation**: Develop comprehensive documentation demonstrating Midwest University's continued commitment to academic excellence, student-athlete welfare, and conference values despite for-profit conversion. Emphasize:
- Academic support services funding commitments
- Faculty governance preservation
- Research and scholarship investment continuation
- Community engagement and service mission

**Academic Excellence Maintenance**: Maintain aggressive investment in academic programs, faculty recruitment and retention, and research infrastructure to prevent academic reputation decline that could trigger conference membership review. Specific commitments include:
- Faculty salary competitiveness maintenance
- Library and research resource funding preservation
- Accreditation compliance prioritization
- Student academic support services enhancement

**Athletic Competitive Excellence**: Sustain competitive excellence in men's and women's basketball through:
- Coaching staff compensation competitiveness
- Recruiting budget adequacy
- Facility maintenance and selective upgrades
- NIL collective support and facilitation

**Fallback Conference Development**: Simultaneously develop relationships with alternative conferences (ASUN, Summit League) as contingency planning. Secure preliminary membership commitments conditioned on MVC exit to provide negotiating leverage and ensure continuity of conference affiliation.

### G. Comprehensive Risk Assessment and Purchase Agreement Implications

#### 1. Quantified Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Severity | Annual Impact | One-Time Cost | Probability | Weighted Annual Impact | Recommended Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| MVC Forced Exit | HIGH | $3.7M-$6.2M | $1M-$2M exit fees | 20-30% | $740K-$1.86M | Pre-closing MVC approval; mission preservation emphasis; fallback conference commitments |
| FBS Transition (if pursued) | CRITICAL | Net negative $3M-$6M annually | $55M-$85M | N/A | N/A | **DO NOT PURSUE** - financially non-viable across all scenarios |
| APR Sanctions | MEDIUM | $500K-$2M | $0 | 5-10% | $25K-$200K | Maintain academic support services funding; monitor student-athlete academic performance quarterly |
| Athletic Subsidy Growth | MEDIUM | $2M-$5M incremental | $0 | 40-50% | $800K-$2.5M | Implement subsidy cap (maximum $21M annually); revenue diversification initiatives; cost containment measures |
| NCAA Revenue Loss | HIGH | $3M-$4.9M | $0 | 100% (certain) | $3M-$4.9M | No mitigation available - inherent consequence of for-profit status; model into pro forma financials |

**Total Athletics-Related Annual Risk Exposure**: $4.57M-$9.46M weighted impact, with $3M-$4.9M certain loss from NCAA revenue exclusion plus $1.57M-$4.56M contingent risk from conference membership and competitive performance factors.

**Capital Exposure**: Potential $55M-$85M if FBS transition erroneously pursued (recommendation: prohibit for 5 years minimum).

```

### H. Strategic Recommendations and Decision Framework

#### 1. Priority Recommendations Ranked by Importance

**PRIORITY 1 (CRITICAL)**: Obtain Missouri Valley Conference written approval before closing transaction. MVC membership preservation is essential to athletic department financial viability and institutional reputation. Recommended approach:

- Immediate notification to MVC Commissioner upon signing definitive purchase agreement
- Request formal conference board review with Buyer presentation opportunity
- Emphasize institutional mission continuity, academic excellence commitment, and student-athlete welfare prioritization
- Offer enhanced conference participation (hosting tournament games, facility investments) as demonstration of commitment
- Structure closing condition requiring MVC approval or acceptable alternative conference commitment

**PRIORITY 2 (CRITICAL)**: Reject FBS transition categorically. No financial scenario supports $55M-$85M investment in FBS elevation given negative ROI across all projections and for-profit status barriers to conference membership. Include contractual prohibition in governance documents requiring Board approval with demonstrated positive ROI before consideration.

**PRIORITY 3 (HIGH)**: Implement athletic subsidy cap and revenue diversification plan. The $19.8M subsidy creates $4.16M tax burden that directly reduces acquisition returns. Capping subsidy at $21M (6% growth maximum) and implementing aggressive revenue diversification ($1.2M+ annually) is essential to financial sustainability.

**PRIORITY 4 (HIGH)**: Maintain Academic Progress Rate excellence above 950. APR compliance protects NCAA eligibility and conference membership while demonstrating academic mission commitment essential to accreditation and regulatory approval.

**PRIORITY 5 (MEDIUM)**: Develop alternative conference relationships as contingency. While MVC membership preservation is primary objective, prudent risk management requires preliminary discussions with Summit League, Atlantic Sun, or other mid-major conferences to provide fallback options.

#### 2. Decision Tree Framework for Athletic Strategy

```
                    MVC Membership Post-Closing?
                              /    \
                          YES      NO
                           |        |
                  Continue Current  Alternative Conference Available?
                    Model with          /              \
                    Revenue         YES               NO
                 Diversification     |                 |
                        |        Accept $1M-$2M    Independent Status
                   Target $10M    Revenue Decline   Non-Viable
                  Self-Generated      |                 |
                   by Year 3      Maintain D-I      TERMINATE
                        |          Membership       TRANSACTION
                   SUCCESS            |
                                  SUCCESS
```

**Critical Decision Points**:

1. **Pre-Closing**: If MVC denies approval and no alternative conference secured → **TERMINATE TRANSACTION**. Athletic program without conference affiliation creates catastrophic reputation harm, recruiting impossibility, and financial unsustainability.

2. **Year 1-2 Post-Closing**: If MVC membership maintained → Implement revenue diversification aggressively. Failure to show progress by Year 2 triggers consideration of athletic budget restructuring or sport sponsorship reduction.

3. **Year 3-5 Post-Closing**: If subsidy exceeds $22M or APR falls below 940 → Comprehensive athletic department strategic review required, potentially including coaching changes, sport sponsorship reconsideration, or conference realignment exploration.

#### 3. Integration with Overall Transaction Risk Framework

Athletic program risks integrate with broader transaction risk factors:

*See* Section IV.C at pp. 89-95 analyzing consolidated tax burden impact on net income and cash flow; $4.16M annual tax burden from athletic subsidy (21% federal rate on $19.8M subsidy) contributes to overall $33.205M first-year tax obligation (federal, state, property, sales taxes), reducing net income from $44.5M to $11.795M (73.5% decline) and directly affecting acquisition ROI (1.51% return on $780M investment) and debt service capacity.

*See* Section I.C.3 at pp. 28-35 analyzing HLC Criterion Five compliance regarding institutional resources and planning; conference membership loss or APR sanctions below 930 signal institutional instability to HLC, potentially triggering enhanced monitoring under HLC's "Notice" classification or focused evaluation requiring special visits, additional reporting, and written progress reports affecting accreditation standing.

*See* Section II.C.3 at pp. 37-42 and Section I.B at pp. 18-22 analyzing enrollment stability and Title IV 90/10 compliance interdependencies; athletic program competitive decline affects enrollment through direct loss of 420 student-athletes (1.9% of 22,500 total enrollment), reduced general student applications estimated at 3-5% decline from diminished athletic visibility, and institutional reputation deterioration from conference membership loss affecting prospective student recruitment.

*See* Section II.C.3 at pp. 37-42 analyzing 90/10 rule mechanics; athletic scholarship aid of $12M annually contributes positively to 90/10 ratio by adding $12M to cash revenue denominator while adding only ~$6M in federal aid received by student-athletes to numerator (improving ratio from 88-89% to 85-86%), but requires $12M annual institutional subsidy creating tension between 90/10 compliance optimization and financial sustainability imperatives.

**Aggregate Assessment**: Athletic program represents $4.57M-$9.46M annual risk exposure with $3M-$4.9M certain loss from NCAA revenue exclusion. This risk level is manageable within overall transaction risk framework provided Missouri Valley Conference membership is preserved and FBS transition is prohibited. Loss of conference membership, however, elevates athletic risk to transaction-threatening level requiring purchase price reduction of $20M-$40M or transaction termination.

### I. Conclusion and Executive Summary

The conversion of Midwest University from non-profit to for-profit status creates substantial challenges for the Division I athletic program:

**Certain Financial Impact**: $3M-$4.9M annual loss from NCAA revenue distribution exclusion (100% probability), combined with $4.16M annual tax burden on the $19.8M institutional subsidy, reduces net contribution of athletics by $7.16M-$9.06M annually compared to pre-acquisition baseline.

**Conference Membership Risk**: 20-30% probability of Missouri Valley Conference membership termination or forced withdrawal creates $3.7M-$6.2M additional annual financial exposure and severe competitive/reputational consequences. Pre-closing MVC approval is essential closing condition.

**FBS Transition Non-Viable**: Comprehensive analysis confirms FBS transition would destroy $30M-$70M in value over 10-year period through combination of $55M-$85M investment costs and negative annual operating margins. Contractual prohibition on FBS consideration is strongly recommended.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Success requires (1) MVC membership preservation through proactive engagement and mission alignment demonstration, (2) aggressive athletic revenue diversification targeting $10M-$12M self-generated revenue within 3-5 years, (3) subsidy cap enforcement at $21M maximum, and (4) Academic Progress Rate maintenance above 950 to protect NCAA eligibility and conference standing.

**Purchase Agreement Implications**: Include closing conditions requiring MVC approval or alternative conference commitment, purchase price adjustments of $20M-$40M if conference membership lost, representations and warranties regarding athletic compliance and conference status, and post-closing operational covenants governing athletic budget limitations and FBS transition prohibition.

Athletic program viability is achievable but requires disciplined execution of mitigation strategies and successful conference membership preservation. Failure to secure conference affiliation constitutes transaction-terminating event given impossibility of maintaining competitive Division I athletics as independent institution.
