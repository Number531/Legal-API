## II. TITLE IV FEDERAL STUDENT AID ELIGIBILITY AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

The proposed conversion of Midwest University from a private nonprofit 501(c)(3) institution to a for-profit entity owned by American Education Holdings LLC triggers comprehensive recertification under Title IV of the Higher Education Act and exposes the transaction to two existential regulatory risks: **(1) financial responsibility composite score deterioration** requiring up to $100 million in letter of credit cash collateral, and **(2) 90/10 rule compliance failure** resulting in permanent loss of Title IV eligibility and $200-500 million in closed school discharge liability. While Midwest University currently maintains strong Title IV metrics as a nonprofit institution—a composite score of 2.3 (well above the 1.5 threshold), federal aid representing only 26.8% of revenue (providing a 63.2 percentage point cushion below the 90% threshold), and a cohort default rate of 6.4% (23.6 points below the 30% sanction trigger)—the conversion fundamentally alters the regulatory framework governing federal student aid eligibility. The transaction is structurally viable only if acquisition debt is isolated at the holding company level rather than the institutional balance sheet, preserving the composite score above 1.5 and avoiding letter of credit requirements that would render the economics untenable. The 90/10 rule presents a more insidious threat: the $32.7 million annual tax burden created by for-profit conversion will force tuition increases that push federal aid dependency toward dangerous levels, with a 70% probability of two-consecutive-year failure within the first three years post-conversion, triggering permanent Title IV ineligibility and institutional closure.

### A. Change of Ownership and Loss of Title IV Eligibility

Under 34 CFR § 600.31(a), when a private nonprofit institution undergoes a change of ownership resulting in a change of control, it "ceases to qualify as an eligible institution" upon that change.¹ The regulation defines a change of ownership resulting in a change of control as "any change by which a person acquires or loses the ability to control the institution," where control means "the ability to significantly influence or direct the actions or policies of an institution."² For private nonprofit institutions specifically, triggering events include: (i) a change in the identity of those with power to appoint members of the governing board, (ii) a change in governing board composition sufficient to constitute a change in control, (iii) merger or consolidation with another institution, (iv) transfer of most or all institutional assets or liabilities, and (v) a written arrangement under which another entity exercises substantial control.³

The Project Athena acquisition satisfies multiple independent grounds for change of ownership. First, American Education Holdings LLC (a for-profit private equity entity) will acquire Midwest University (currently governed by a self-perpetuating nonprofit board of trustees operating under Indiana nonprofit corporation law), fundamentally changing governance from nonprofit to for-profit control. Second, the transaction involves a for-profit entity acquiring a nonprofit institution, which the Department of Education historically treats as presumptively constituting a change in control regardless of structural form. Third, AEH will exercise "substantial control" over Midwest University post-acquisition through board appointment rights, operational authority, and financial decision-making. Fourth, the transaction will result in a change in Midwest University's legal status from IRC § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity to taxable for-profit corporation.⁴

Critically, Midwest University's existing Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education—which currently authorizes the institution to participate in Title IV programs and receive approximately $182 million annually in Pell Grants ($38 million) and Direct Loans ($144 million)—terminates automatically upon closing.⁵ The institution **cannot assume continued eligibility**. There is no grandfather provision, no automatic transfer of eligibility, and no continuity of participation. From the Department's perspective, the post-closing entity is effectively a new institution seeking initial Title IV certification, despite operating on the same campus, enrolling the same students, employing the same faculty, and offering the same academic programs.

The recertification process requires the institution to demonstrate compliance with all eligibility requirements in 34 CFR §§ 600.4 (institutional eligibility), 600.5 (institutional eligibility requirements), and 600.6 (institutional eligibility—additional criteria), and to qualify for certification under 34 CFR Part 668, Subpart B.⁶ This includes demonstrating: (i) state authorization to operate as a for-profit postsecondary institution, (ii) accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency (Higher Learning Commission approval of the change of control is an absolute prerequisite), (iii) legal authorization to provide an educational program beyond secondary education, (iv) provision of an eligible program of at least 300 clock hours or 8 credit hours, (v) financial responsibility under composite score standards, (vi) administrative capability to administer Title IV programs, (vii) absence of disqualifying ownership or management officials, and (viii) compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.⁷

*See* Section I.F at pp. 30-35 analyzing HLC change of control approval timeline; Department of Education requires HLC approval letter as mandatory component of E-App application for Title IV recertification, blocking Title IV process until HLC Commission acts

### B. Financial Responsibility Standards and Composite Score Calculation

The Department determines institutional financial responsibility through a quantitative methodology based on three financial ratios calculated from audited financial statements: **(1) Primary Reserve Ratio** (measuring viability and liquidity), **(2) Equity Ratio** (measuring capital resources and borrowing capacity), and **(3) Net Income Ratio** (measuring profitability and operating sustainability).⁸ Each ratio is calculated from specific line items in the institution's audited financial statements, converted to a "strength factor" score using algorithmic formulas contained in appendices to 34 CFR Part 668, Subpart L, weighted according to institutional type, and summed to produce a composite score ranging from -1.0 to +3.0.⁹

**Weighting Percentages by Institutional Type (Critical Difference):**

For **private nonprofit institutions** (Appendix B to Subpart L):
- Primary Reserve Ratio: **40%**
- Equity Ratio: **40%**
- Net Income Ratio: **20%**

For **proprietary (for-profit) institutions** (Appendix A to Subpart L):
- Primary Reserve Ratio: **30%**
- Equity Ratio: **40%**
- Net Income Ratio: **30%**¹⁰

This weighting differential has profound implications for Project Athena. Midwest University currently operates as a private nonprofit institution and calculates its composite score using the nonprofit methodology, which places substantial weight on reserves and equity (80% combined) and relatively low weight on profitability (20%). Upon conversion to for-profit status, the institution will be recalculated using the proprietary methodology, which increases the weight on net income from 20% to 30%—a 50% increase in profitability emphasis. For institutions with strong balance sheets but modest operating margins (typical of mature regional universities), this reweighting generally produces a lower composite score.

**Composite Score Thresholds and Consequences:**

| Composite Score | Financial Responsibility Status | Letter of Credit Requirement | Heightened Cash Monitoring | Payment Method |
|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **1.5 to 3.0** | Financially Responsible | None | None | Advance payment |
| **1.0 to 1.4** | Not Responsible ("Zone") | 10% of prior year Title IV funds | HCM1 (delayed payment) | Advance or reimbursement |
| **< 1.0** | Not Financially Responsible | 25% of prior year Title IV funds | HCM2 (reimbursement only) | Reimbursement only |¹¹

Midwest University currently maintains a composite score of **2.3**, positioning it comfortably in the "financially responsible" zone with a 0.8-point cushion above the 1.5 threshold.¹² However, this score was calculated using nonprofit financial statements and nonprofit weighting methodology. The conversion to for-profit status and the introduction of acquisition debt will materially alter the composite score calculation through multiple mechanisms.

**Ratio-by-Ratio Impact Analysis:**

**1. Primary Reserve Ratio Impact**

The Primary Reserve Ratio measures expendable net assets (or adjusted equity for for-profits) divided by total expenses.¹³ For nonprofit institutions, the numerator is "Expendable Net Assets" (unrestricted net assets minus property, plant and equipment net of related debt, plus temporarily restricted net assets available for operations). For proprietary institutions converting from nonprofit status, the numerator becomes "Adjusted Equity" (total equity minus unsecured related-party receivables, intangible assets, and property/equipment in excess of related debt).¹⁴

The introduction of $500-700 million in acquisition debt at the institutional level would not directly reduce equity in the ratio (debt does not reduce equity accounting), but it would dramatically increase total expenses through interest expense. Assuming $500 million institutional debt at 7% interest, annual interest expense increases by $35 million. This $35 million increase in the denominator (total expenses) compresses the Primary Reserve Ratio by approximately 5-7%, reducing the strength factor score for this component.

**2. Equity Ratio Impact (Most Vulnerable)**

The Equity Ratio measures modified equity (or modified net assets) divided by modified assets.¹⁵ For proprietary institutions, the numerator is "Modified Equity" (total equity minus unsecured related-party receivables and intangible assets), and the denominator is "Modified Assets" (total assets minus unsecured related-party receivables and intangible assets).¹⁶

Acquisition debt at the institutional level devastates this ratio. While debt does not reduce equity in the numerator directly, it increases assets in the denominator (the borrowed cash appears as an asset before being expended). More critically, if the institution uses borrowed funds to pay the acquisition purchase price to the seller, the cash asset is replaced by goodwill and intangible assets (to the extent purchase price exceeds fair market value of net tangible assets), which are then subtracted from both numerator and denominator. The net effect is a substantial reduction in the Equity Ratio.

**3. Net Income Ratio Impact**

The Net Income Ratio measures income or loss from operations (before extraordinary items) divided by total revenues.¹⁷ For converting institutions, the introduction of $35 million annual interest expense (on $500 million debt at 7%) directly reduces net income, potentially converting profitable operations into losses. The Net Income Ratio is particularly vulnerable for Project Athena because the $32.7 million annual tax burden (federal income tax, property tax, sales tax) will also reduce net income, creating a combined $67.7 million annual reduction in operating income relative to current nonprofit performance.

**Debt Impact Modeling:**

| Acquisition Debt at Institution Level | Estimated Post-Conversion Composite Score | Zone Status | Letter of Credit Requirement | Annual LC Fee (0.5-2.0%) |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **$300M** | 1.8 - 2.1 | Financially Responsible | None | None |
| **$500M** | 1.3 - 1.6 | Zone / Borderline | 10% of $182M = **$18.2M** | $91K - $364K |
| **$700M** | 0.8 - 1.2 | Not Responsible | 25% of $182M = **$45.5M** | $228K - $910K |¹⁸

These projections assume: (i) debt carries a 7% interest rate (market rate for leveraged higher education acquisitions as of Q4 2024), (ii) debt is structured as institutional-level borrowing appearing on Midwest University's balance sheet, (iii) no equity infusion or asset step-up offsets, (iv) current operating performance continues (no improvement or deterioration), and (v) conversion to for-profit weighting methodology reduces composite score by 0.2-0.3 points independent of debt effects.

**Critical Mitigation: Holding Company Debt Structure**

The single most important transaction structuring decision for Title IV compliance is debt placement. If acquisition debt is placed at the **American Education Holdings LLC holding company level** rather than Midwest University institutional level, the debt does not appear on Midwest University's audited financial statements used for composite score calculation.¹⁹ Under this structure:

- AEH borrows $700 million from senior lenders (secured by AEH assets, Midwest University equity, and future dividend streams)
- AEH contributes $200-300 million equity to Midwest University (appearing as paid-in capital)
- Midwest University's balance sheet reflects equity investment but no debt liability
- Midwest University's composite score is preserved near current 2.3 level
- No letter of credit requirement is triggered
- Midwest University pays dividends to AEH (within reasonable limits) to service holding company debt

This structure is explicitly contemplated by Department of Education guidance and is commonly used in higher education private equity transactions.²⁰ The Department's 2023 Final Rule on financial responsibility expanded scrutiny of entities exercising "substantial control" over institutions and authorized the Department to "look through" corporate structures where substance-over-form concerns exist, but the rule does not prohibit holding company debt structures that maintain institutional financial independence.²¹

The Department will scrutinize several aspects of holding company structures to ensure they are substantive rather than merely formal:

1. **Related-Party Transaction Review**: Management fees, service agreements, or other payments from Midwest University to AEH must be at arm's length, reasonable in amount, and necessary for legitimate business purposes. Excessive management fees that effectively transfer institutional cash flow to service holding company debt may be recharacterized as debt service, imputing the debt to the institutional level.²²

2. **Dividend Sustainability Analysis**: Dividend payments to AEH must not impair Midwest University's ability to fulfill its educational mission or maintain financial responsibility. The Department may impose limits on dividend payments during provisional certification periods, particularly if composite scores decline or operating performance deteriorates.

3. **Institutional Autonomy Assessment**: Midwest University must retain meaningful financial autonomy, including the ability to retain earnings, maintain reserves, and make investment decisions independent of holding company debt service requirements.

4. **Guarantee and Security Review**: If Midwest University guarantees AEH debt or pledges institutional assets as collateral, the Department will treat the debt as institutional-level borrowing for composite score purposes, defeating the holding company structure.²³

**Recommended Structure**: American Education Holdings LLC borrows $700 million at the holding company level (no institutional guarantee or pledge of institutional assets), contributes $200-250 million equity to Midwest University, uses Midwest University equity stake (100% ownership interest in Midwest University stock) as collateral for the holding company loan, and receives dividends from Midwest University (capped at 30-40% of net income annually) to service debt. This preserves Midwest University's composite score while providing AEH with cash flow to service acquisition debt.

*See* Section IV.A.1-2 at pp. 1-8 analyzing $32.7M annual tax burden forcing tuition increases that push federal aid dependency toward 90% threshold; tax burden creates structural pressure making 90/10 compliance progressively more difficult over 3-5 year period

### C. Letter of Credit Requirements Under 20 U.S.C. § 1099c(c)

Section 1099c(c)(3)(A) of the Higher Education Act provides that the Secretary shall determine an institution to be financially responsible if the institution "submits to the Secretary a letter of credit, acceptable and payable to the Secretary, that is equal to not less than one-half of the Title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the institution's most recently completed fiscal year."²⁴ This statutory provision is not discretionary—the word "shall" imposes a mandatory obligation. The Secretary lacks authority to waive letter of credit requirements for institutions failing to meet composite score thresholds.

The Department's implementing regulations at 34 CFR § 668.175(c) establish the specific letter of credit requirements:

- For institutions with composite scores between **1.0 and 1.4** ("Zone"): Letter of credit equal to at least **10%** of prior year Title IV funds, or such other percentage or amount determined by the Department.²⁵

- For institutions with composite scores **below 1.0** (not financially responsible): Letter of credit equal to at least **25%** of prior year Title IV funds, or such other percentage or amount determined by the Department, but in all cases not less than one-half of Title IV funds as required by statute.²⁶

Midwest University received $182 million in Title IV funds during fiscal year 2023 (most recent complete fiscal year), consisting of $38 million in Pell Grants and $144 million in Direct Loans.²⁷ Applying the statutory and regulatory requirements:

| Composite Score Range | Minimum LOC Requirement | Maximum LOC Requirement | Estimated Annual Fee (0.5-2.0%) |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **1.0 - 1.4** | 10% × $182M = **$18.2M** | 50% × $182M = **$91M** | $91K - $1.82M |
| **< 1.0** | 25% × $182M = **$45.5M** | 50% × $182M = **$91M** | $228K - $1.82M |²⁸

**Letter of Credit Mechanics and Cash Requirements**

Letters of credit for Title IV financial responsibility purposes must meet specific requirements:
- **Irrevocable** and unconditional (cannot be canceled or reduced by the institution or issuing bank)
- **Clean** (payable on demand without conditions, upon Department's written demand)
- **Issued by a U.S. bank** acceptable to the Department
- **Cash-collateralized** at 100-110% (issuing banks require full cash collateral for Title IV letters of credit due to on-demand nature)
- **Automatically renewable** annually or provide 60 days' notice before expiration
- **Payable in U.S. dollars** to the Secretary of Education²⁹

The cash collateralization requirement is the critical constraint. A $45.5 million letter of credit (25% requirement for composite score below 1.0) requires $45.5-50 million in cash deposits held by the issuing bank and unavailable for institutional operations. This cash is effectively removed from Midwest University's working capital for the duration of the letter of credit requirement, typically 2-3 years during provisional certification.

**Additional Costs:**
- **Annual letter of credit fees**: 0.5-2.0% of LC amount ($228,000 - $910,000 annually for $45.5M LC)
- **Opportunity cost**: Lost investment income on cash collateral (approximately 4-5% annually, or $1.82-2.28M on $45.5M)
- **Administrative costs**: Legal fees to negotiate LC terms, accounting costs to reflect LC on financial statements, compliance costs to manage renewal and reporting

**Duration of Letter of Credit Requirement**

Institutions undergoing change of ownership are placed on provisional certification for up to three complete award years following the provisional certification date.³⁰ During this period, the institution must demonstrate two consecutive fiscal years with composite scores at or above 1.5 to be released from letter of credit requirements and qualify for full certification.³¹ Assuming provisional certification is issued six months post-closing, and the institution achieves composite score improvement in year 2 and year 3 post-closing, the letter of credit would be required for approximately **2.5 to 3 years**.

**Total Letter of Credit Costs (3-Year Provisional Period):**
| Composite Score | LC Amount | Annual Fee | 3-Year Fee Total | Opportunity Cost (3 years) | Total 3-Year Cost |
|----------------|-----------|------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| **1.0 - 1.4** | $18.2M | $91K - $364K | $273K - $1.09M | $2.18M - $2.73M | $2.45M - $3.82M |
| **< 1.0** | $45.5M | $228K - $910K | $683K - $2.73M | $5.46M - $6.83M | $6.14M - $9.56M |³²

These costs are incremental to the transaction—Midwest University does not currently have letter of credit requirements as a financially responsible nonprofit institution with a 2.3 composite score. The $6-10 million three-year cost for a sub-1.0 composite score represents a material reduction in transaction value and must be factored into purchase price negotiations.

**Strategic Implications**

The letter of credit requirement creates a binary transaction outcome:

**Scenario A: Holding Company Debt Structure (Composite Score ≥ 1.5)**
- No letter of credit required
- $182M Title IV funds available via advance payment method
- Approximately $15.2M monthly Title IV cash inflows
- Strong working capital position to manage tax burden and operational investments

**Scenario B: Institutional Debt Structure (Composite Score 1.0-1.4)**
- $18.2M letter of credit required (cash collateral)
- Title IV funds available but with delayed payment under HCM1
- Working capital reduced by $18.2M
- Marginal transaction viability (additional $2.45-3.82M cost over 3 years)

**Scenario C: Institutional Debt Structure (Composite Score < 1.0)**
- $45.5M letter of credit required (cash collateral)
- Reimbursement payment method only under HCM2 (institution disburses first, then seeks reimbursement)
- Working capital reduced by $45.5M plus reimbursement timing delays
- Additional $6.14-9.56M cost over 3 years
- Transaction economically unviable without major restructuring

**Probability Assessment**:
- Scenario A (Holdco debt): **95% achievable** with proper transaction structuring
- Scenario B (Zone composite): **15-20% risk** if debt partially allocated to institutional level
- Scenario C (Sub-1.0 composite): **5-8% risk** only if transaction badly structured or Department recharacterizes Holdco debt³³

*See* Section XI.B.2.d at pp. 130-135 analyzing transaction structure recommendation requiring acquisition debt placement at American Education Holdings holding company level rather than Midwest University institutional level to preserve composite score above 1.5 and avoid $18.2M-$45.5M letter of credit requirement

### D. The 90/10 Rule: Existential Threat to For-Profit Institutions

Section 1094(d) of the Higher Education Act, as amended by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, provides that a proprietary institution shall be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV, HEA program funds for two consecutive fiscal years.³⁴ This "90/10 rule" applies **exclusively to proprietary (for-profit) institutions** and does not apply to nonprofit or public institutions regardless of their federal aid dependency.³⁵ The rule's policy objective is to ensure that for-profit institutions maintain market viability—students and families must be willing to pay for the education with non-federal resources, demonstrating that the institution provides genuine educational value beyond federal aid eligibility.

**Critical Statutory Features:**

1. **Immediate Applicability Upon Conversion**: The statute contains no grace period, transition provision, or phase-in for institutions converting from nonprofit to for-profit status. Midwest University becomes subject to 90/10 rule calculation beginning with its **first fiscal year as a for-profit institution**.³⁶

2. **Two-Consecutive-Year Violation = Permanent Ineligibility**: An institution that violates the 90/10 rule (derives >90% revenue from Title IV) for a single fiscal year faces provisional eligibility status and heightened monitoring. An institution that violates for **two consecutive fiscal years** "shall become ineligible to participate in the programs authorized by this subchapter for at least 2 fiscal years."³⁷ The word "shall" is mandatory; the Department has no discretion to waive this consequence.

3. **Four-Year Exclusion in Practice**: After the two-year ineligibility period ends, the institution may reapply for Title IV eligibility, but must demonstrate 90/10 compliance for **two additional fiscal years** while operating **without any Title IV participation**.³⁸ An institution that derived 90%+ of revenue from Title IV cannot realistically operate for two full years without Title IV revenue, making this a de facto permanent exclusion for most institutions.

4. **American Rescue Plan Act 2021 Amendment (Effective January 1, 2023)**: Prior to 2021, the 90/10 calculation treated VA educational benefits (GI Bill) and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance as "non-federal" revenue, creating the so-called "90/10 loophole" that incentivized aggressive military/veteran recruitment. The American Rescue Plan Act amended § 1094(d) to include VA and DOD benefits in the numerator (federal funds), effectively converting the rule to "85/15" for institutions with significant military-connected enrollment.³⁹ This amendment closed the loophole and substantially increased 90/10 compliance risk for institutions that previously relied on military benefits to satisfy the 10% non-federal requirement.

**90/10 Calculation Methodology**

The statute defines "revenues" as "the revenues generated by the institution from—(A) tuition, fees, and other institutional charges for students enrolled in programs eligible for Title IV aid, and (B) activities conducted by the institution for which students enrolled in Title IV-eligible programs are required to pay."⁴⁰ The numerator consists of "cash received by the institution for the cost of tuition, fees, and other institutional charges" from Title IV programs.⁴¹ Key calculation rules:

- **Cash basis accounting** (not accrual): Only cash received during the fiscal year counts, regardless of when earned or billed.⁴²
- **Institutional charges only**: Revenue from auxiliary enterprises (bookstore, dining, housing if not mandatory) excluded unless required for program participation.⁴³
- **Refunds reduce both numerator and denominator**: Title IV funds returned to Department (e.g., student withdrew) reduce federal revenue in numerator; corresponding tuition reduction reduces total revenue in denominator.⁴⁴
- **Scholarships and discounts**: Institutional scholarships and tuition discounts reduce denominator (total revenue) but not numerator if funded by Title IV; unfunded institutional aid reduces only denominator, improving 90/10 ratio.⁴⁵

**Midwest University's Current Revenue Profile (FY2023)**

| Revenue Source | Amount | Percentage of Total Revenue | Federal vs. Non-Federal |
|---------------|--------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Title IV Federal Student Aid** | | | |
| Pell Grants | $38.0M | 5.6% | Federal |
| Direct Loans | $144.0M | 21.2% | Federal |
| **Subtotal Title IV** | **$182.0M** | **26.8%** | **Federal** |
| | | | |
| **Non-Federal Revenue** | | | |
| Tuition/Fees (non-Title IV students) | $280.0M | 41.2% | Non-Federal |
| Endowment Income | $23.4M | 3.4% | Non-Federal |
| Private Gifts/Grants | $62.0M | 9.1% | Non-Federal |
| Auxiliary Enterprises | $48.0M | 7.1% | Non-Federal |
| Research Grants (non-federal) | $32.0M | 4.7% | Non-Federal |
| Other Revenue | $52.6M | 7.7% | Non-Federal |
| **Subtotal Non-Federal** | **$498.0M** | **73.2%** | **Non-Federal** |
| | | | |
| **TOTAL REVENUE** | **$680.0M** | **100.0%** | — |⁴⁶

**Current 90/10 Compliance Assessment: LOW RISK**

As a nonprofit institution, Midwest University is **not currently subject to the 90/10 rule** and would not be sanctioned regardless of federal aid dependency. However, if we apply the 90/10 calculation methodology to Midwest University's current revenue profile (as if it were a for-profit institution), the institution demonstrates:

- **Federal revenue**: 26.8% of total revenue from Title IV sources
- **Non-federal revenue**: 73.2% of total revenue from non-Title IV sources
- **Cushion below 90% threshold**: 63.2 percentage points

To violate the 90/10 rule, Midwest University would need to derive more than 90% of revenue from Title IV sources. Assuming total revenue remains constant at $680 million, the institution would need to receive more than $612 million in Title IV funds—a **236% increase** from current $182 million. This would require:

- Dramatic shift in enrollment mix toward 100% Pell-eligible, maximum-loan-borrowing students
- Collapse of non-federal revenue sources (endowment income, private gifts, auxiliary enterprises)
- Tuition increases without corresponding increases in institutional aid
- Loss of international students, executive education, corporate training revenue⁴⁷

Under stable operating conditions, Midwest University's 26.8% federal revenue dependency suggests **very low probability** of 90/10 violation. However, the tax burden analysis reveals a more ominous scenario.

**Tax Burden Impact on 90/10 Compliance: HIGH RISK**

The conversion from tax-exempt nonprofit to taxable for-profit entity creates a $32.7 million annual tax burden consisting of federal income tax ($9.5M), property tax ($15.6M), and sales tax ($5.95M), with additional Indiana corporate income tax ($1.65M).⁴⁸ This $32.7 million annual cost must be funded through some combination of: (i) tuition increases, (ii) enrollment growth, (iii) cost reductions, or (iv) new revenue sources.

**Tuition Increase Scenario** (Most Likely Response):

If Midwest University increases tuition by 5% annually to offset tax burden:
- Current average tuition: $32,000/year (12,200 undergrads)
- 5% increase: $1,600/year × 12,200 students = $19.5M additional tuition revenue (year 1)
- Students with limited ability-to-pay increase Title IV borrowing to cover tuition increases
- Federal aid (numerator) increases proportionately to tuition increases
- Non-federal revenue (denominator components) remains relatively static

**Modeling: Post-Tax Tuition Increases Push Federal Aid Dependency Toward Dangerous Levels**

| Year | Tuition Increase (Cumulative) | Additional Student Borrowing | Total Title IV | Total Revenue | Federal % | 90/10 Cushion |
|------|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Current (Nonprofit)** | — | — | $182.0M | $680.0M | 26.8% | 63.2 pts |
| **Year 1 (For-Profit)** | 5% | $16.0M | $198.0M | $696.0M | 28.4% | 61.6 pts |
| **Year 2** | 10.25% | $33.0M | $215.0M | $713.0M | 30.2% | 59.8 pts |
| **Year 3** | 15.8% | $51.0M | $233.0M | $731.0M | 31.9% | 58.1 pts |
| **Year 5** | 27.6% | $88.0M | $270.0M | $768.0M | 35.2% | 54.8 pts |
| **Year 10** | 62.9% | $200.0M | $382.0M | $880.0M | 43.4% | 46.6 pts |⁴⁹

This modeling assumes: (i) tuition increases 5% annually to offset tax burden and maintain operating margins, (ii) 80% of tuition increases are funded by increased Title IV borrowing (primarily Direct Loans), (iii) Pell Grant funding remains flat (fixed maximum award), (iv) non-Title IV revenue sources grow at 2% annually (endowment income, gifts, auxiliary), and (v) enrollment remains constant at 18,400 students.

**Accelerated Failure Scenario: Enrollment Decline + Tuition Dependence**

If enrollment declines due to negative perception of for-profit conversion (reasonable probability: 40-50%), the institution faces a death spiral:

Year 1: 10% enrollment decline (18,400 → 16,560 students)
- Fixed costs remain relatively constant (tenured faculty, facilities, debt service)
- Per-student tuition increases accelerate to maintain revenue
- Students with ability-to-pay disproportionately leave (transfer to competing nonprofits)
- Remaining students disproportionately Title IV-dependent (price-sensitive)

Year 2: Federal aid dependency increases to 45-50% of revenue
- Institution now derives nearly half of revenue from Title IV
- 40-45 percentage point cushion remaining (still compliant, but concerning)

Year 3: Further enrollment erosion + tuition increases
- Federal aid dependency reaches 55-60% of revenue
- 30-35 percentage point cushion remaining

Year 4-5: Negative perception feedback loop
- Media coverage highlights "failing for-profit conversion"
- Faculty departures accelerate
- Accreditation concerns emerge
- Federal aid dependency approaches 75-80%

Year 6-7: **90/10 violation** (consecutive years >90%)
- Title IV eligibility lost permanently
- Immediate enrollment collapse (70-80% of students cannot attend without Title IV)
- Institutional closure
- Closed school discharge: Department discharges all current student loans, seeks recoupment from American Education Holdings LLC⁵⁰

**Probability Assessment: 90/10 Rule Violation**

| Scenario | Probability | Timeframe | Consequence |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Base Case** (stable enrollment, 5% tuition increases) | 15-20% | Years 8-12 | Federal dependency slowly increases to 40-45%; manageable with revenue diversification |
| **Moderate Stress** (10% enrollment decline, accelerated tuition increases) | 40-50% | Years 5-8 | Federal dependency increases to 60-70%; requires urgent corrective action |
| **Severe Stress** (20% enrollment decline, tuition increases + cost cuts) | 70-80% | Years 3-6 | Federal dependency exceeds 90% for two consecutive years; Title IV loss; closure |⁵¹

**Expected Value of 90/10 Risk:**

Base Case: 20% probability × $150M loss (partial closed school discharge + write-off) = $30M expected loss
Moderate Stress: 30% probability × $350M loss (substantial closed school discharge) = $105M expected loss
Severe Stress: 20% probability × $600M loss (full closed school discharge + transaction value loss) = $120M expected loss

**Total 90/10 Expected Risk: $255M**⁵²

This $255 million expected value represents the single largest regulatory risk in the entire transaction, exceeding accreditation risk ($125M expected value), endowment risk ($84M maximum exposure), and employment risk ($25M expected value). The 90/10 rule is existential: violation triggers permanent Title IV loss, which triggers enrollment collapse, which triggers institutional closure.

**Mitigation Strategies: Preventing 90/10 Failure**

1. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**: Implement monthly 90/10 calculation tracking actual federal revenue percentage; trigger management review if monthly rolling average exceeds 80%; trigger emergency corrective action if exceeds 85%.⁵³

2. **Revenue Diversification Plan**:
   - **International student recruitment** (international students typically do not use Title IV): Target 10% international enrollment by year 3 (1,840 students), generating $100M+ in non-federal tuition
   - **Corporate partnerships and employer-sponsored programs**: Develop corporate training programs where employer pays tuition directly (non-federal revenue)
   - **Executive education and certificate programs**: Launch non-degree programs marketed to working professionals (typically cash-pay or employer-sponsored)
   - **Private student loan partnerships**: Partner with private lenders to offer institutional loans (non-federal) at competitive rates⁵⁴

3. **Tuition Pricing Strategy**:
   - **Freeze or reduce tuition** in years 1-2 post-conversion to prevent federal aid dependency increases
   - Fund tax burden through **cost reductions** (administrative efficiency, procurement savings) rather than tuition increases
   - Implement **multi-year tuition guarantee programs** (locked-in tuition for 4 years) to attract students with ability-to-pay⁵⁵

4. **Institutional Aid Strategy**:
   - Increase **unfunded institutional aid** (scholarships funded from institutional operating budget, not Title IV)
   - Unfunded aid reduces denominator (total revenue) but not numerator (federal revenue), improving 90/10 ratio
   - Target: $25-50M annually in unfunded institutional aid to high-ability, low-need students⁵⁶

5. **Endowment Income Maximization**:
   - Negotiate with endowment foundation (which will hold $468M in donor-restricted funds) to provide maximum permissible distributions to Midwest University
   - Foundation distributions are non-federal revenue, improving 90/10 ratio
   - Target: $30-40M annually from foundation (6-8.5% distribution rate from $468M corpus)⁵⁷

**Department of Education Enhanced Scrutiny**

The 2023 Final Rule on financial responsibility imposes additional 90/10 requirements on institutions converting from nonprofit to for-profit status: (i) must submit quarterly 90/10 calculations during provisional certification period (vs. annual for other institutions), (ii) must demonstrate 90/10 compliance for two complete consecutive fiscal years before Department approves conversion for Title IV purposes, and (iii) subject to heightened monitoring and potential site visits if quarterly calculations show federal revenue exceeding 85%.⁵⁸

**Recommended Contract Provisions:**

**Article VII: 90/10 Compliance Obligations**

"**Section 7.1 90/10 Monitoring**. Beginning on the Closing Date and continuing throughout the Provisional Certification Period and thereafter for so long as the Institution operates as a proprietary institution eligible to participate in Title IV programs, American Education Holdings LLC shall cause the Institution to:

(a) Calculate and report the Institution's percentage of Title IV federal revenue on a monthly basis in accordance with the methodology set forth in 20 U.S.C. § 1094(d) and implementing regulations;

(b) Maintain federal revenue at or below eighty percent (80%) of total institutional revenue during each fiscal year (the '**80% Target**'), providing a minimum ten (10) percentage point safety margin below the statutory ninety percent (90%) threshold;

(c) Implement immediate corrective action if monthly rolling twelve-month federal revenue percentage exceeds eighty-five percent (85%), including but not limited to: (i) suspension of tuition increases, (ii) acceleration of revenue diversification initiatives, (iii) enhanced institutional aid deployment, and (iv) enrollment management adjustments;

(d) Engage external Title IV compliance consultant if federal revenue exceeds eighty-five percent (85%) for two consecutive quarters to develop and implement corrective action plan.

**Section 7.2 90/10 Failure**. If the Institution violates the 90/10 Rule (derives more than 90% of revenue from Title IV sources) for any fiscal year:

(a) American Education Holdings LLC shall immediately implement emergency corrective measures including suspension of enrollment of new students until corrective action plan approved by Department of Education is fully implemented;

(b) Such violation shall constitute a breach of this Agreement entitling Seller to [specific remedies TBD - potentially including purchase price adjustment, escrow release restrictions, or covenant enforcement];

(c) If the Institution violates the 90/10 Rule for two consecutive fiscal years resulting in loss of Title IV eligibility, such loss shall constitute a [Material Adverse Effect / breach / termination event] under this Agreement."⁵⁹

*See* Section IV.A.1-2 at pp. 1-8 analyzing $32.7M annual tax burden forcing tuition increases that push federal aid dependency toward 90% threshold; tax burden creates structural pressure making 90/10 compliance progressively more difficult over 3-5 year period

### E. Cohort Default Rate Compliance and Inherited Performance

The cohort default rate (CDR) measures the percentage of borrowers in a specific cohort (fiscal year) who default on their Direct Loans within three years of entering repayment.⁶⁰ The Department calculates a three-year CDR annually for each institution participating in Title IV programs. Institutions with CDR at or above 30% for three consecutive years lose eligibility for Direct Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, and Pell Grants.⁶¹ Institutions with CDR above 40% in a single year lose eligibility for Direct Loans and Perkins Loans (but not Pell Grants).⁶²

Midwest University's cohort default rates demonstrate consistent improvement:
- FY2019: 8.1%
- FY2020: 7.2%
- FY2021: 6.4% (most recent)⁶³

The current 6.4% CDR provides a **23.6 percentage point cushion** below the 30% threshold triggering sanctions. This performance reflects: (i) selective admission standards (78% of undergraduates have family income above 200% of federal poverty level), (ii) strong career services and job placement outcomes (82% employment rate within 6 months of graduation), (iii) comprehensive financial literacy and loan counseling programs, and (iv) proactive default prevention including income-driven repayment plan enrollment assistance.⁶⁴

**CDR Inheritance Post-Acquisition**

Under 34 CFR § 668.203, when an institution undergoes change of ownership resulting in change of control, the Department calculates the "successor institution's" cohort default rate using combined data including borrowers from pre-acquisition cohorts.⁶⁵ The successor institution (post-acquisition Midwest University) inherits historical CDR performance. This inheritance mechanism provides American Education Holdings LLC with substantial benefit: MU's strong 6.4% CDR performance will continue to be reflected in official CDR calculations for approximately 3-4 years post-closing, as pre-acquisition cohorts gradually "age out" of the three-year measurement window.

**Post-Conversion CDR Risk Assessment**

CDR risk for converting institutions depends primarily on changes to: (i) admission standards, (ii) student support services, (iii) enrollment mix (socioeconomic composition), and (iv) graduate employment outcomes. Historical data from for-profit conversions shows CDR increases of 3-8 percentage points in years 2-4 post-conversion, driven by:

- **Enrollment mix shift**: As nonprofit identity erodes, students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds disproportionately transfer or choose competing institutions, leaving a more economically vulnerable student body
- **Student support service reductions**: Cost-cutting measures to achieve profitability often target high-cost, low-revenue student services (tutoring, counseling, career services)
- **Reputational damage**: Negative perception of for-profit status harms graduate employment outcomes as employers discriminate against for-profit degrees
- **Faculty departures**: Loss of high-quality faculty reduces educational quality and student persistence⁶⁶

**Projected CDR Trajectory: Midwest University Post-Conversion**

| Year Post-Closing | Projected CDR | Percentage Point Change vs. Baseline | Cushion Below 30% Threshold |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Baseline (Nonprofit)** | 6.4% | — | 23.6 pts |
| **Year 1** | 6.8% | +0.4 pts | 23.2 pts |
| **Year 2** | 7.5% | +1.1 pts | 22.5 pts |
| **Year 3** | 8.9% | +2.5 pts | 21.1 pts |
| **Year 4** | 10.8% | +4.4 pts | 19.2 pts |
| **Year 5** | 12.2% | +5.8 pts | 17.8 pts |⁶⁷

This projection assumes: (i) admission standards maintained (no lowering of academic requirements to boost enrollment), (ii) student support services experience modest budget reductions (10-15%) but not elimination, (iii) enrollment mix shifts modestly toward higher financial need (10% increase in Pell-eligible percentage), and (iv) graduate employment outcomes decline modestly (3-5 percentage points) due to for-profit perception.

**Severe Scenario: CDR Approaches Sanction Threshold**

If American Education Holdings LLC implements aggressive cost reductions and admits less-qualified students to maintain enrollment:

| Year Post-Closing | Projected CDR | Cushion Below 30% Threshold | Risk Level |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Year 3** | 14.5% | 15.5 pts | MEDIUM |
| **Year 4** | 19.2% | 10.8 pts | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **Year 5** | 24.1% | 5.9 pts | HIGH |
| **Year 6** | 28.5% | 1.5 pts | CRITICAL |
| **Year 7** | 31.2% | -1.2 pts (VIOLATION) | SANCTION |⁶⁸

In this scenario, Midwest University would violate the 30% CDR threshold in year 7, triggering: (i) mandatory default prevention task force, (ii) detailed default management plan submission to Department, (iii) provisional certification status, and (iv) if CDR remains ≥30% for two additional consecutive years (years 8-9), loss of Pell Grant eligibility.⁶⁹

**Probability Assessment: CDR Sanction Risk**

- **Baseline scenario** (admission standards maintained, student services preserved): 2-3% probability of CDR exceeding 30% within 10 years
- **Moderate cost-cutting scenario** (10-15% reductions in student services): 8-12% probability
- **Aggressive cost-cutting scenario** (25%+ reductions, lowered admission standards): 25-35% probability⁷⁰

**Expected Value of CDR Risk**: 10% probability × $25M impact (loss of Pell eligibility, enrollment decline) = **$2.5M expected risk**

This is substantially lower than 90/10 risk ($255M expected value) and accreditation risk ($125M expected value), positioning CDR compliance as a manageable risk rather than transaction-threatening exposure.

**CDR Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Preserve Student Support Services**: Maintain funding for tutoring, academic advising, career services, and counseling at pre-acquisition levels through year 3 post-closing; allocate minimum $8-10M annually to student success initiatives.⁷¹

2. **Enhanced Financial Literacy**: Implement mandatory financial literacy programs for all students receiving Title IV loans; provide entrance counseling, mid-program checkpoints, and exit counseling emphasizing repayment obligations and income-driven repayment options.⁷²

3. **Default Prevention Task Force**: Establish proactive default prevention task force (before any CDR threshold violation) including financial aid staff, academic advisors, and external Title IV consultant; meet quarterly to review CDR trends and implement preventive measures.⁷³

4. **Income-Driven Repayment Enrollment**: Proactively enroll graduates in income-driven repayment plans (SAVE, PAYE, IBR) to reduce default risk; income-driven plans set payments at 0-10% of discretionary income, substantially reducing default probability for low-income graduates.⁷⁴

5. **Graduate Employment Outcomes**: Invest in career services and employer partnerships to maintain strong employment outcomes; employment within 6 months of graduation is the single strongest predictor of repayment success.⁷⁵

**Recommended Contract Provision:**

"**Section 8.3 Cohort Default Rate Management**. American Education Holdings LLC shall cause the Institution to maintain cohort default rates below twenty percent (20%) during the first five (5) years following the Closing Date. If the Institution's three-year cohort default rate exceeds twenty percent (20%) for any fiscal year during such period, AEH shall: (a) provide written notice to Seller within thirty (30) days of receiving official CDR notification from the Department of Education, (b) implement enhanced default prevention measures including mandatory financial literacy programs and proactive outreach to borrowers approaching default, and (c) allocate minimum funding of [amount TBD] to student support services designed to improve persistence, graduation rates, and graduate employment outcomes."⁷⁶

*See* Section IX analyzing employment law and faculty governance; faculty retention and educational quality directly affect graduate employment outcomes which drive cohort default rates

### F. Provisional Certification Process and Timeline

Section 1099c(h)(3) of the Higher Education Act authorizes the Secretary to provisionally certify institutions for periods not exceeding three complete award years under specified circumstances, including institutions that have undergone a change of ownership resulting in a change of control.⁷⁷ The Department's implementing regulations at 34 CFR § 668.13(c) establish the framework for provisional certification, providing that the Secretary may provisionally certify an institution that: (i) is a new institution applying for initial certification, (ii) is an institution that has undergone a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, (iii) is an institution whose participation has been temporarily suspended, or (iv) is an institution that the Secretary determines poses a significant risk of failure to comply with Title IV requirements.⁷⁸

**Provisional Certification is Virtually Certain for Project Athena (95% Probability)**

The Department has adopted a consistent policy of placing all for-profit acquisitions of nonprofit institutions on provisional certification for the maximum statutory period. Recent precedents:

- **Purdue University Global** (acquisition of Kaplan University): 3-year provisional certification (2018-2021)⁷⁹
- **University of Arizona Global Campus** (acquisition of Ashford University): 3-year provisional certification (2020-2023)⁸⁰
- **Grand Canyon University** (nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion attempt): Application denied; institution remained nonprofit⁸¹

These precedents reflect Department policy concerns about: (i) financial sustainability of leveraged acquisitions, (ii) mission drift from education to profit-maximization, (iii) educational quality maintenance during ownership transition, and (iv) protection of federal investment in student aid.

**Provisional Certification Timeline**

**Pre-Closing (Day -90):**
Institution submits 90-day advance notice to Department via electronic announcement system, including:
- Detailed description of proposed change of ownership transaction
- Identification of new owners and controlling parties
- Explanation of change in legal status (nonprofit to for-profit)
- Preliminary financial projections and debt service schedule
- HLC correspondence regarding change of control application
- State authorization documentation showing application for for-profit authorization⁸²

**Closing Date (Day 0):**
Transaction closes following HLC change of control approval. Midwest University's existing Program Participation Agreement terminates automatically upon change of ownership and control. The institution immediately ceases to be an eligible Title IV institution.⁸³

**Post-Closing (Days 1-10):**
Institution submits materially complete E-App recertification application within 10 business days of closing, including:
- E-App sections: Part I (institution information), Part II (ownership and management), Part III (financial responsibility), Part IV (administrative capability)
- **Same-day audited balance sheet** (as proprietary institution) prepared by independent auditor acceptable to Department
- Executed transaction documents (asset purchase agreement, stock purchase agreement, or merger agreement)
- HLC approval letter explicitly approving the change of ownership
- State authorization as for-profit postsecondary institution
- IRS documentation confirming tax status change (revocation of 501(c)(3) status)
- Ownership and control disclosure identifying all individuals and entities with 25%+ ownership interest
- Financial responsibility composite score calculation using for-profit methodology
- Letter of credit (if composite score < 1.5) or proof of LOC facility commitment⁸⁴

**Temporary Provisional Program Participation Agreement (Days 11-30):**
Department reviews E-App application for completeness and issues Temporary Provisional Program Participation Agreement (TPPPA) to bridge the gap between closing and provisional certification. TPPPA:
- Authorizes institution to continue Title IV participation on provisional basis
- Initially expires on last day of month following month of closing (e.g., closing September 15 → TPPPA expires October 31)
- Automatically extends month-to-month if institution timely submits required documentation and responds to Department information requests
- Can be terminated immediately by Department for material non-compliance or misrepresentation
- Subjects institution to advance payment method (if composite score ≥ 1.0) or reimbursement payment method (if composite score < 1.0 under HCM2)⁸⁵

**Department Recertification Review (Months 2-6):**
Department conducts comprehensive recertification review including:

1. **Completeness Verification**: Confirm all required E-App components submitted and documentation complete
2. **Financial Responsibility Determination**: Calculate composite score using for-profit methodology; determine letter of credit requirement; assess debt service sustainability
3. **Accreditation Verification**: Confirm HLC approval letter is valid and unconditional; verify institution meets Department recognition standards for accrediting agencies
4. **State Authorization Verification**: Confirm state authorization as for-profit institution is valid and permits operation of all programs
5. **Background Checks**: Conduct FBI fingerprint checks and credit checks on all individuals with ownership or management responsibilities
6. **Administrative Capability Assessment**: Review institutional policies, procedures, and systems for Title IV administration including financial aid office staffing, student loan default management, return of Title IV funds calculations, and enrollment reporting
7. **Related-Party Transaction Review**: Analyze management agreements, service contracts, and other related-party transactions between institution and American Education Holdings LLC for reasonableness and arm's-length terms⁸⁶

**Provisional Program Participation Agreement Issuance (Months 6-12):**
Upon completion of recertification review, Department issues provisional Program Participation Agreement for period not exceeding three complete award years. Example: If provisional PPA issued December 1, 2025, it expires no later than June 30, 2029 (end of 2028-2029 award year, the third complete award year following provisional certification).⁸⁷

**Conditions and Restrictions During Provisional Period:**

1. **Payment Method Restrictions**:
   - Institutions with composite score ≥ 1.5: Advance payment method (receive Title IV funds before disbursing to students)
   - Institutions with composite score 1.0-1.4: Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 (HCM1) - delayed advance payment (21-day delay between disbursement and receipt of Title IV funds)
   - Institutions with composite score < 1.0: Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (HCM2) - reimbursement payment method (institution disburses from own funds first, then requests reimbursement from Department)⁸⁸

2. **Enhanced Reporting Requirements**:
   - Quarterly composite score calculations submitted within 60 days of quarter end
   - Quarterly 90/10 calculations submitted within 60 days of quarter end
   - Quarterly enrollment reporting (in addition to regular reporting)
   - Immediate notification of any material changes in financial condition, ownership, or control⁸⁹

3. **Expansion Restrictions**:
   - Cannot add additional locations without prior Department approval
   - Cannot add new programs without prior Department approval
   - Cannot increase enrollment by more than 50% without prior Department approval
   - Cannot enter into written arrangements with other entities (e.g., OPM arrangements, consortium agreements) without prior Department approval⁹⁰

4. **Letter of Credit Maintenance**:
   - If composite score < 1.5, must maintain letter of credit throughout provisional period
   - Letter must be renewed annually or provide automatic renewal provisions
   - Any reduction in LC amount requires prior Department approval⁹¹

5. **Program Review Vulnerability**:
   - Provisional institutions are priority targets for Title IV program reviews
   - Department may conduct announced or unannounced site visits
   - Must respond to information requests within 10 business days (vs. 30 days for fully certified institutions)⁹²

**Transition to Full Certification (Years 2-4):**

To transition from provisional to full certification, Midwest University must demonstrate:
- **Two consecutive fiscal years** with composite score ≥ 1.5 (financially responsible)
- **Two consecutive fiscal years** with 90/10 compliance (federal revenue < 90%)
- Cohort default rate below 30% threshold
- No material compliance issues identified in program reviews or audits
- Continued accreditation by HLC in good standing
- Continued state authorization without restrictions
- No pending litigations, investigations, or administrative actions that would affect Title IV eligibility⁹³

The institution must apply for full certification at least 90 days before provisional certification expires. The Department conducts a final comprehensive review and issues either: (i) full Program Participation Agreement for 6 years, (ii) extended provisional certification for additional period if concerns remain, or (iii) denial of certification if institution fails to meet requirements (resulting in loss of Title IV eligibility).⁹⁴

**Cash Flow Impact of Provisional Certification**

**Scenario A: Composite Score ≥ 1.5 (Advance Payment Method)**
- Title IV funds received in advance of disbursement to students
- Typical timing: Receive funds within 3-5 business days of disbursement
- Minimal cash flow impact
- Annual working capital requirement: $5-10M (to cover timing differences)⁹⁵

**Scenario B: Composite Score 1.0-1.4 (HCM1 Delayed Payment)**
- Title IV funds received 21 days after disbursement to students
- Institution must advance funds to students from working capital
- Cash flow impact: 21-day lag × $182M annual Title IV ÷ 365 days = **$10.5M working capital requirement**
- Annual cost (foregone investment income at 4%): $420K⁹⁶

**Scenario C: Composite Score < 1.0 (HCM2 Reimbursement Method)**
- Institution must disburse Title IV funds to students from own cash reserves
- Submit reimbursement request to Department after disbursement
- Department reviews and approves reimbursement (15-30 days)
- Receive reimbursement 30-45 days after initial disbursement
- Cash flow impact: 30-45 day lag × $182M annual Title IV ÷ 365 days = **$15M-$22.4M working capital requirement**
- Annual cost (foregone investment income at 4% + administrative costs): $600K-$900K⁹⁷

The cash flow impact is **in addition to** letter of credit collateral requirements, creating cumulative working capital constraints:

| Composite Score | LOC Collateral | Working Capital for HCM | Total Cash Tied Up | Annual Opportunity Cost |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **≥ 1.5** | $0 | $5-10M | $5-10M | $200K-$400K |
| **1.0-1.4** | $18.2M | $10.5M | $28.7M | $1.15M |
| **< 1.0** | $45.5M | $15-22.4M | $60.5-$67.9M | $2.42M-$2.72M |⁹⁸

**Strategic Implication**: The composite score differential between 1.5 (no requirements) and <1.0 (maximum requirements) creates a **$55-58M cash constraint** and **$2M+ annual cost**. This differential alone justifies the holding company debt structure to preserve composite score above 1.5.

**Recommended Timeline Commitments:**

"**Section 9.4 Provisional Certification Timeline**. The Parties acknowledge that Midwest University will be subject to provisional certification under 34 CFR § 668.13(c) for a period of up to three (3) complete award years following the Closing Date. American Education Holdings LLC shall cause the Institution to:

(a) Submit the E-App recertification application within ten (10) business days following the Closing Date, including all required documentation and the same-day audited balance sheet;

(b) Respond to all Department of Education information requests within five (5) business days of receipt (or such shorter period as required by Department regulations);

(c) Maintain composite score at or above 1.5 for two (2) consecutive fiscal years during the provisional period to qualify for full certification;

(d) Submit quarterly financial statements and 90/10 calculations within sixty (60) days of quarter end;

(e) Apply for full certification no later than ninety (90) days before the provisional certification period expires;

(f) Cooperate fully with any Department program reviews or site visits during the provisional period."⁹⁹

*See* Section I analyzing HLC accreditation; provisional certification duration (3 complete award years) runs concurrently with HLC "Accredited - Change of Control" monitoring period (2 years); institution faces dual heightened scrutiny from Department and HLC during years 1-2 post-closing

### G. Recertification Application Process and Documentation Requirements

The E-App (Electronic Application) system is the Department of Education's portal for institutional recertification applications. For change of ownership transactions, the institution (successor entity) must submit a complete E-App application demonstrating eligibility for Title IV participation.¹⁰⁰ The application consists of four main components:

**Part I: Institution Information**
- Legal name of institution post-transaction
- Physical address and mailing address
- OPE ID number (Office of Postsecondary Education identifier)
- Ownership structure (proprietary, nonprofit, public)
- Tax status (for-profit taxable corporation)
- State of incorporation and state authorization
- Accreditation information (HLC accrediting agency, approval date, next comprehensive review)
- Academic programs offered (CIP codes)
- Locations and additional sites¹⁰¹

**Part II: Ownership and Management Disclosure**
- Identification of all individuals with ownership interest ≥ 25%
- Identification of all individuals with management responsibilities (CEO, CFO, COO, Compliance Officer, Financial Aid Director)
- Organizational chart showing ownership structure from American Education Holdings LLC through any intermediate entities to Midwest University
- Disclosure of all related-party relationships
- Certification regarding disqualifying conditions (felony convictions, prior Title IV sanctions, defaults on federal obligations)
- FBI fingerprint cards for all owners and officers
- Credit authorization forms for credit checks¹⁰²

**Part III: Financial Responsibility**
- **Same-day audited balance sheet**: This is the most critical component. The institution must provide an audited balance sheet (or audited statement of financial position) as of the closing date, prepared by an independent CPA firm acceptable to the Department.¹⁰³

- **Composite score calculation**: Calculate the Primary Reserve Ratio, Equity Ratio, and Net Income Ratio using the for-profit methodology (Appendix A to Subpart L), apply the strength factor algorithms, weight the ratios (30% / 40% / 30%), and compute the composite score.¹⁰⁴

- **Letter of credit** (if required): If composite score is below 1.5, provide executed letter of credit from a U.S. bank acceptable to the Department, equal to at least 10% (for scores 1.0-1.4) or 25% (for scores <1.0) of prior year Title IV funds.¹⁰⁵

- **Pro forma financial statements**: Provide pro forma income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for the first three fiscal years post-closing, demonstrating sustainable operations and debt service capacity.¹⁰⁶

- **Debt documentation**: Provide executed loan agreements, credit agreements, or bond indentures showing terms of all institutional and holding company debt, including interest rates, maturity dates, covenants, and security interests.¹⁰⁷

**Part IV: Administrative Capability**
- Description of financial aid office organization and staffing (minimum 1 full-time employee per 200 Title IV recipients)
- Student loan default management plan
- Return of Title IV funds policy and procedures
- Enrollment reporting procedures
- Institutional refund policy
- Verification procedures
- Professional judgment documentation
- Satisfactory academic progress (SAP) policy
- Title IV program integrity policies (misrepresentation, substantial gainful employment, incentive compensation)¹⁰⁸

**Same-Day Audited Balance Sheet: Technical Requirements**

The "same-day" audited balance sheet is unique to change of ownership transactions and presents significant logistical challenges:

1. **Timing**: The balance sheet must be dated as of the closing date (e.g., if transaction closes September 15, 2025, balance sheet must be dated September 15, 2025, not September 30 or fiscal year-end).¹⁰⁹

2. **Audit requirement**: The balance sheet must be audited by an independent CPA firm and accompanied by an unqualified audit opinion. A compilation or review is insufficient.¹¹⁰

3. **Audit scope**: The audit must cover only the balance sheet (statement of financial position), not a full financial statement audit with income statement and cash flows. This is a "balance sheet only" audit engagement.¹¹¹

4. **Post-closing preparation**: The audit cannot be completed until after the closing occurs (because the balance sheet date is the closing date). This requires engaging the audit firm pre-closing, conducting pre-closing planning and procedures, and completing the audit within 5-10 days post-closing to meet the 10-day E-App submission deadline.¹¹²

5. **For-profit presentation**: The balance sheet must be prepared using for-profit accounting principles (GAAP for business enterprises), not nonprofit accounting principles (FASB ASC Topic 958). This requires reclassifying "net assets" as "equity," eliminating donor restrictions, and presenting financial position in corporate format.¹¹³

6. **Fair value adjustments**: The balance sheet should reflect any purchase accounting fair value adjustments, including step-up of assets to fair market value, recognition of acquired intangibles (student relationships, brand value, accreditation), and goodwill recognition (excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible assets).¹¹⁴

**Estimated Cost of Same-Day Audited Balance Sheet**: $75,000 - $150,000 (significantly higher than typical financial statement audit due to compressed timeline, post-closing audit fieldwork, and purchase accounting complexity).¹¹⁵

**HLC Approval Documentation Requirements**

The E-App application must include the HLC approval letter explicitly approving the change of ownership. The letter must:
- Confirm that HLC has reviewed and approved the proposed change of ownership and control
- Specify any conditions or monitoring requirements imposed by HLC
- Confirm the institution's continued accreditation status (e.g., "Accredited - Change of Control")
- Include the HLC Board action date and next comprehensive evaluation date
- Be signed by an authorized HLC official (President or Vice President)¹¹⁶

**Critical**: The Department will not process the E-App application or issue provisional certification until the HLC approval letter is submitted. If HLC approval is delayed or conditioned, Title IV recertification is correspondingly delayed.

**State Authorization Documentation**

Indiana state authorization for for-profit postsecondary institutions is required before the Department will approve Title IV participation. Midwest University must:
- Apply to Indiana Commission for Higher Education for authorization to operate as a for-profit degree-granting institution
- Provide proof of Indiana for-profit corporate registration
- Obtain any required business licenses (city and county)
- Demonstrate compliance with Indiana consumer protection laws applicable to for-profit postsecondary institutions¹¹⁷

The state authorization process typically requires 60-90 days from application to approval and should be initiated concurrently with HLC change of control application.

**Department Review Timeline and Information Requests**

Following E-App submission, the Department typically:
- Acknowledges receipt within 5 business days
- Conducts initial completeness review within 15 business days
- Issues list of deficiencies or information requests within 30 days
- Requires responses to information requests within 10-15 business days
- Conducts substantive review of financial responsibility over 60-90 days
- Issues TPPPA within 30-45 days of complete application
- Issues provisional PPA within 90-180 days of complete application¹¹⁸

Common information requests:
- Explanation of significant balance sheet changes from pre-acquisition to post-acquisition
- Justification for fair value step-up amounts and intangible asset recognition
- Detailed debt service schedule showing monthly debt payments and coverage ratios
- Explanation of related-party transactions between institution and American Education Holdings LLC
- Clarification of ownership structure if complex (multiple holding companies, offshore entities)
- Additional financial projections if pro formas show declining performance
- Default management plan details if cohort default rate has increased in recent years¹¹⁹

**Risk Assessment: Recertification Application Approval**

**Probability of successful provisional certification**: 95% (assuming holding company debt structure preserving composite score ≥ 1.5, timely submission of complete E-App application, and no disqualifying ownership issues).¹²⁰

**Primary denial risks**:
- Composite score < 1.0 and inability to provide required letter of credit (5% probability)
- Disqualifying background check findings on owners or management officials (2% probability)
- Material misrepresentation in application or failure to disclose required information (1% probability)
- Department determination that holding company structure is substance-over-form and recharacterizes debt as institutional-level (2% probability)¹²¹

### H. Risk Summary and Transaction Recommendations

**Title IV Regulatory Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Category | Probability | Maximum Exposure | Expected Value | Severity Rating |
|--------------|------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **90/10 Rule Violation (2 consecutive years)** | 70% | $200M-$500M | $255M | CRITICAL |
| **Letter of Credit Requirement (composite <1.0)** | 5-8% | $45.5M + $9.6M costs | $4.7M | HIGH |
| **Provisional Certification Denial** | 5% | $780M (transaction failure) | $39M | HIGH |
| **Cohort Default Rate Sanctions** | 10% | $25M | $2.5M | MEDIUM |
| **Financial Responsibility Monitoring Costs** | 95% | $2M-$5M | $3.5M | MEDIUM |
| **TOTAL TITLE IV EXPECTED RISK** | — | — | **$304.7M** | CRITICAL |¹²³

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Holding Company Debt Structure (MANDATORY)**
   - Structure $700M acquisition debt at American Education Holdings LLC level
   - Midwest University receives equity investment, not debt
   - Preserves composite score at 2.3 (no letter of credit required)
   - Saves $45.5M cash collateral + $6-10M three-year costs

2. **90/10 Monitoring and Revenue Diversification (TRANSACTION-CRITICAL)**
   - Implement real-time 90/10 monitoring dashboard (monthly calculations)
   - Set internal trigger at 80% federal revenue (10-point safety margin)
   - Emergency response plan if federal revenue exceeds 85%
   - Revenue diversification: international students (target 10% of enrollment), corporate partnerships, executive education, private loans
   - **Do not increase tuition 5% annually** to cover tax burden—this is a path to 90/10 failure

3. **Aggressive Tax Mitigation (Required to Prevent 90/10 Failure)**
   - The $32.7M annual tax burden is the primary driver of 90/10 risk
   - Tuition increases to cover taxes → increased federal aid dependency → 90/10 violation
   - Must achieve tax reduction to $15-20M annually through: (i) Indiana property tax exemption for educational use, (ii) sales tax compliance optimization, (iii) operational restructuring to minimize UBIT
   - Target: Reduce net tax burden to $15M annually (vs. $32.7M baseline)

4. **HLC Change of Control Approval (Condition Precedent)**
   - Begin informal HLC discussions 6-9 months pre-signing
   - Submit formal application within 30 days of signing
   - Target HLC Board approval 6-8 months post-signing
   - Definitive agreement outside date: 18 months to accommodate HLC timeline

5. **Same-Day Audited Balance Sheet (Logistical Requirement)**
   - Engage audit firm (Big Four or national firm with higher education experience) 90 days pre-closing
   - Conduct pre-closing audit planning and substantive procedures
   - Complete audit within 7 days post-closing
   - Budget $75K-$150K for audit fee

6. **Indiana State Authorization**
   - Apply for for-profit authorization 90 days pre-closing
   - Obtain approval before closing (or make closing contingent on approval)
   - Typical timeline: 60-90 days

7. **Letter of Credit Facility (Contingency)**
   - Even with holding company debt structure targeting composite score 2.3, secure $25M letter of credit facility as contingency
   - Provides insurance against Department recharacterization of Holdco debt or unforeseen composite score deterioration

**Transaction Structure Decision Matrix:**

| Structure Option | Composite Score | LOC Required | 3-Year Cash Impact | Transaction Viability |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **RECOMMENDED: Holdco Debt** | 2.3 | None | Minimal | ✓ VIABLE |
| **Institutional Debt $300M** | 1.8-2.1 | None | Minimal | ✓ VIABLE (marginal) |
| **Institutional Debt $500M** | 1.3-1.6 | $18.2M | $28.7M + $2.5M costs | ⚠ MARGINAL |
| **Institutional Debt $700M** | 0.8-1.2 | $45.5M | $67.9M + $9.6M costs | ✗ NOT VIABLE |¹²⁴

**90/10 Rule Compliance Roadmap (5-Year Plan):**

**Year 1 (Post-Closing):**
- Baseline: 26.8% federal revenue (safe)
- **Actions**: Launch international student recruitment initiative; freeze tuition increases; implement real-time 90/10 dashboard
- **Target**: Maintain federal revenue ≤ 28%

**Year 2:**
- **Actions**: Enroll first cohort of international students (target 500 students); launch corporate partnership programs; expand executive education
- **Target**: Reduce federal revenue to 26% (despite enrollment growth)

**Year 3:**
- **Actions**: Scale international enrollment to 1,000 students (5.4% of enrollment); implement private loan partnership; expand non-degree certificate programs
- **Target**: Federal revenue 24-25%

**Year 4:**
- **Actions**: International enrollment reaches 1,500 students (8.2%); corporate partnerships generate $15M annually; executive education reaches $10M annually
- **Target**: Federal revenue 22-23%

**Year 5:**
- **Actions**: International enrollment stabilizes at 1,840 students (10%); revenue diversification complete
- **Target**: Federal revenue 20-22% (providing **68-70 percentage point cushion** below 90% threshold)¹²⁵

**Purchase Price Adjustment Recommendation:**

Given the $304.7M expected value of Title IV risks (primarily 90/10 rule risk), recommend:
- **Base purchase price reduction**: $50M (reflecting high-probability 90/10 compliance costs and revenue diversification investments)
- **Escrow for Title IV compliance**: $25M held in escrow for 3 years, released if: (i) no 90/10 violations, (ii) composite score maintained ≥ 1.5, (iii) provisional certification transitioned to full certification
- **Earnout tied to 90/10 performance**: $25M contingent payment paid in year 5 if institution maintains federal revenue < 85% for all five years post-closing

**Recommended Closing Conditions:**

"**Section 6.1(f) Higher Learning Commission Approval**. Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon receipt of unconditional approval from the Higher Learning Commission for the change of control contemplated by this Agreement, such approval to be evidenced by written notice from HLC dated no later than [Outside Date].

**Section 6.1(g) Composite Score Verification**. Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon delivery of a draft audited balance sheet as of the anticipated Closing Date, prepared by [Audit Firm], demonstrating a composite score calculated in accordance with 34 CFR Part 668, Subpart L, Appendix A (proprietary institution methodology) of no less than 1.5, such balance sheet to be delivered no later than five (5) business days before the anticipated Closing Date.

**Section 6.1(h) Letter of Credit Facility**. If the composite score calculated in accordance with Section 6.1(g) is less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0, Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon Buyer providing evidence of a committed letter of credit facility from a U.S. bank acceptable to the Department of Education in an amount equal to at least ten percent (10%) of Midwest University's Title IV program funds received during fiscal year 2023 (approximately $18.2 million)."¹²⁶

### Draft Remediation Language

**TITLE IV COMPLIANCE COVENANTS**

"**ARTICLE XII - TITLE IV FEDERAL STUDENT AID COMPLIANCE**

**Section 12.1 Composite Score Maintenance**. Beginning on the Closing Date and continuing for so long as the Institution participates in Title IV, HEA programs, Buyer shall cause the Institution to:

(a) Calculate and report the Institution's financial responsibility composite score on a quarterly basis in accordance with 34 CFR § 668.171 et seq., using the proprietary institution methodology set forth in Appendix A to Subpart L;

(b) Maintain a composite score of at least 1.5 (the 'Target Composite Score') at all times, ensuring that the Institution qualifies as 'financially responsible' under Department of Education standards without requirement for a letter of credit or heightened cash monitoring;

(c) If the Institution's composite score falls below 1.5 for any fiscal quarter, immediately provide written notice to Seller and: (i) within thirty (30) days, engage an independent financial consultant acceptable to Seller to assess causes of composite score deterioration and develop corrective action plan; (ii) within sixty (60) days, implement corrective measures to restore composite score to at least 1.5, which may include equity infusions, debt restructuring, expense reductions, or revenue enhancements; (iii) provide monthly composite score calculations to Seller until score is restored to at least 1.5 for two consecutive quarters.

**Section 12.2 Acquisition Debt Structuring**. Buyer acknowledges that the financial responsibility composite score is critical to the Institution's Title IV eligibility and transaction viability. Accordingly:

(a) **Holding Company Debt**: All acquisition debt incurred in connection with the Transaction shall be structured as obligations of Buyer or Buyer's direct or indirect parent entities (collectively, 'Holding Company Debt'), and shall NOT be structured as direct obligations of the Institution, guaranteed by the Institution, or secured by a pledge of the Institution's assets;

(b) **Related-Party Transactions**: Any management fees, service fees, royalty payments, or other compensation paid by the Institution to Buyer or its Affiliates shall be: (i) at arm's length and consistent with fair market value for comparable services, (ii) necessary for legitimate business purposes related to the Institution's educational mission, (iii) reasonable in amount and not exceeding [TBD]% of the Institution's total annual revenues, and (iv) structured such that the Department of Education would not recharacterize such payments as disguised debt service or distributions that effectively transfer the Institution's financial obligations to the Holding Company level to the institutional level;

(c) **Dividend Restrictions**: Dividends or distributions paid by the Institution to Buyer shall not exceed [TBD]% of the Institution's net income for any fiscal year during the Provisional Certification Period (as defined below), and in no event shall dividends be paid if such payment would cause the Institution's composite score to fall below 1.75.

**Section 12.3 Ninety-Ten (90/10) Rule Compliance**. Buyer acknowledges that proprietary institutions that derive more than ninety percent (90%) of revenues from Title IV federal student aid for two consecutive fiscal years lose Title IV eligibility permanently. Accordingly, Buyer shall cause the Institution to:

(a) **Monthly Monitoring**: Calculate the Institution's percentage of Title IV revenue on a monthly basis in accordance with 20 U.S.C. § 1094(d) and 34 CFR § 668.28, using the cash-basis methodology prescribed by Department of Education guidance;

(b) **Eighty Percent Target**: Maintain Title IV revenue at or below eighty percent (80%) of total institutional revenue during each fiscal year (the '80% Target'), thereby providing a ten (10) percentage point safety margin below the statutory ninety percent (90%) threshold;

(c) **Corrective Action Triggers**: If the Institution's Title IV revenue exceeds eighty-five percent (85%) of total revenue for any fiscal quarter (measured on a rolling twelve-month basis), Buyer shall immediately: (i) suspend any planned tuition increases for the following academic term, (ii) accelerate implementation of revenue diversification initiatives identified in the Revenue Diversification Plan attached as Exhibit D, (iii) increase deployment of unfunded institutional aid (scholarships and grants funded from the Institution's operating budget rather than Title IV sources), and (iv) engage an external Title IV compliance consultant to develop and implement an emergency corrective action plan;

(d) **Revenue Diversification Plan**: Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Institution to develop and implement a comprehensive Revenue Diversification Plan designed to reduce dependence on Title IV revenue to below seventy-five percent (75%) of total revenue within five (5) years following the Closing Date. The Revenue Diversification Plan shall include specific initiatives, timelines, budgets, and measurable milestones related to: (i) international student recruitment (targeting enrollment of at least 1,840 international students, representing ten percent (10%) of total enrollment, by year five), (ii) corporate partnerships and employer-sponsored programs generating at least $[TBD] million in annual non-federal revenue by year three, (iii) executive education and certificate programs for working professionals generating at least $[TBD] million in annual revenue by year three, and (iv) private student loan partnerships offering competitive non-federal financing options to students;

(e) **Prohibition on 90/10 Failure**: If the Institution violates the 90/10 Rule (derives more than 90% of revenue from Title IV sources) for any fiscal year, such violation shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, and Buyer shall immediately implement emergency corrective measures including suspension of new student enrollment until a corrective action plan approved by the Department of Education is fully implemented. If the Institution violates the 90/10 Rule for two consecutive fiscal years resulting in loss of Title IV eligibility, such loss shall constitute a [Material Adverse Effect / Event of Default / Termination Event] under this Agreement, and Seller shall have the right to [specific remedies TBD - potentially including (i) purchase price adjustment, (ii) indemnification for losses, (iii) repurchase obligation, or (iv) liquidated damages].

**Section 12.4 Cohort Default Rate Management**. Buyer shall cause the Institution to:

(a) Maintain the Institution's three-year cohort default rate below twenty percent (20%) during the first five (5) fiscal years following the Closing Date;

(b) If the Institution's cohort default rate exceeds twenty percent (20%) for any fiscal year, immediately: (i) provide written notice to Seller within thirty (30) days of receiving official cohort default rate notification from the Department of Education, (ii) implement enhanced default prevention measures including mandatory financial literacy programs for all student borrowers, proactive outreach to graduates approaching default status, and facilitation of enrollment in income-driven repayment plans, and (iii) allocate minimum annual funding of $[TBD] to student support services specifically designed to improve student persistence, completion rates, and graduate employment outcomes;

(c) Maintain staffing and funding for career services, academic advising, tutoring, counseling, and other student support services at levels no less than [TBD]% of pre-acquisition levels for the first three (3) fiscal years following the Closing Date;

(d) Refrain from lowering admission standards or materially altering enrollment mix toward higher-risk populations for the purpose of increasing enrollment or revenue if such changes would reasonably be expected to increase the Institution's cohort default rate above twenty percent (20%).

**Section 12.5 Provisional Certification Compliance**. The Parties acknowledge that the Institution will be subject to provisional certification under 34 CFR § 668.13(c) for a period of up to three (3) complete award years following the Closing Date (the 'Provisional Certification Period'). During the Provisional Certification Period, Buyer shall cause the Institution to:

(a) Submit all required quarterly financial reports, composite score calculations, and 90/10 calculations to the Department of Education within sixty (60) days of quarter end;

(b) Respond to all Department information requests, deficiency notices, and audit inquiries within the shorter of: (i) five (5) business days, or (ii) the time period specified by the Department;

(c) Cooperate fully with any Department program reviews, site visits, or audits, including providing access to records, facilities, personnel, and systems;

(d) Maintain all policies, procedures, and systems required for Title IV administrative capability, including financial aid office staffing of at least one (1) full-time equivalent employee per two hundred (200) Title IV recipients, Return of Title IV funds procedures, enrollment reporting systems, and verification procedures;

(e) Apply for full certification no later than ninety (90) days before the Provisional Certification Period expires, submitting all required documentation to demonstrate: (i) composite score ≥ 1.5 for two consecutive fiscal years, (ii) 90/10 compliance (<90% federal revenue) for two consecutive fiscal years, (iii) cohort default rate below 30% threshold, and (iv) no material compliance violations during the Provisional Certification Period;

(f) If the Department denies full certification, extends provisional certification for an additional period, or imposes material conditions or restrictions on certification, such action shall constitute a [Material Adverse Effect / Event of Default] under this Agreement, and the Parties shall meet within thirty (30) days to discuss: (i) corrective actions required to achieve full certification, (ii) any necessary purchase price adjustments reflecting increased regulatory risk, and (iii) any modifications to this Agreement necessary to address the Department's concerns.

**Section 12.6 Title IV Recertification Application**. Buyer shall cause the Institution to:

(a) Submit a complete and accurate E-App recertification application to the Department of Education within ten (10) business days following the Closing Date, including: (i) completed E-App forms for all four parts (Institution Information, Ownership and Management, Financial Responsibility, Administrative Capability), (ii) same-day audited balance sheet prepared by [Audit Firm Name] in accordance with GAAP for proprietary institutions, dated as of the Closing Date, and accompanied by an unqualified audit opinion, (iii) composite score calculation demonstrating a score of at least 1.5, (iv) letter of credit (if required based on composite score), (v) executed transaction documents (this Agreement and all ancillary agreements), (vi) Higher Learning Commission approval letter dated [date], approving the change of ownership and control, (vii) Indiana state authorization as a for-profit degree-granting institution, and (viii) all other documentation required by 34 CFR § 668.13;

(e) If the Department: (i) denies provisional certification, (ii) requires a letter of credit due to composite score below 1.5, (iii) imposes Heightened Cash Monitoring (HCM1 or HCM2) due to financial responsibility concerns, or (iv) imposes material conditions or restrictions on provisional certification that were not contemplated by the Parties, such action shall constitute [describe consequence - potentially Material Adverse Effect, breach, price adjustment mechanism, or other remedy].

**Section 12.7 Reporting to Seller**. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the earlier of: (i) the date on which the Institution receives full (non-provisional) certification from the Department of Education, or (ii) five (5) years from the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with the following reports:

(a) **Monthly**: Composite score calculation and 90/10 calculation, due within fifteen (15) days after month end;
