## IV. TAX-EXEMPT STATUS LOSS AND CONVERSION TAX ANALYSIS

American Education Holdings' proposed $780 million acquisition of Midwest University presents the most severe tax consequences of any aspect of Project Athena. The conversion from IRC § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to for-profit C corporation will trigger an immediate and catastrophic annual tax burden increase of $32.7 million—a 6,000% increase over MU's current $546,000 UBIT liability. This tax burden will consume 73.5% of MU's pre-tax income, reducing after-tax net income from $44.5 million to $11.8 million annually. When combined with anticipated debt service obligations of $35 million, the transaction generates negative annual cash flow of $23.2 million, fundamentally threatening transaction viability absent radical business model restructuring.

The tax analysis reveals three critical risk categories requiring immediate mitigation: (1) the comprehensive loss of federal, state, and local tax exemptions generating $33.2 million in annual tax liabilities previously avoided; (2) the $103.6 million one-time exposure from endowment liquidation if the $650 million endowment is not restructured through a bifurcated foundation model; and (3) the charitable trust doctrine implications under Indiana law that create substantial donor litigation risk for the $468 million in donor-restricted endowment funds. These three risk categories interact to create a compounding threat: the annual tax burden forces cash flow constraints that incentivize endowment liquidation, which in turn triggers massive one-time taxation and donor litigation exposure. Only through precise structural planning—including mandatory transfer of donor-restricted funds to a separate 501(c)(3) foundation and utilization of holdco debt structures—can these risks be managed to transaction-viable levels.

### A. Federal Income Tax Consequences: From Tax-Exempt to Fully Taxable

#### 1. Automatic Loss of IRC § 501(c)(3) Status

Midwest University currently qualifies for federal income tax exemption under IRC § 501(c)(3) as an organization "organized and operated exclusively for... educational purposes."¹ The statute requires satisfaction of both an organizational test (articles of incorporation limit purposes to exempt purposes and permanently dedicate assets to charitable use) and an operational test (organization must be operated exclusively for exempt purposes with no substantial non-exempt activities).² MU satisfies both tests as a degree-granting university serving 18,400 students through traditional nonprofit educational operations.

Upon acquisition by American Education Holdings, MU will immediately and automatically lose its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status without requiring formal IRS determination.³ The loss occurs through two independent mechanisms. First, the organizational test fails because MU's assets will no longer be permanently dedicated to charitable purposes—they will be owned by a for-profit corporation organized to generate returns for private shareholders, violating the fundamental requirement that assets be irrevocably dedicated to exempt purposes.⁴ Second, the operational test fails because MU's operations will be conducted for the benefit of private shareholders (AEH's investors), directly violating the private inurement prohibition that constitutes an absolute bar to tax-exempt status.⁵

The timing of status termination is critical for transaction tax planning. Tax-exempt status terminates effective on the closing date when ownership transfers to AEH.⁶ This creates a short tax year requiring bifurcated tax filing: MU must file a final Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax) covering January 1 through the closing date as a tax-exempt entity, and an initial Form 1120 (U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return) covering the closing date through December 31 as a taxable C corporation.⁷ To avoid short-year complexity and associated accounting costs, AEH should structure closing for January 1, allowing MU to file a full-year Form 990 for the prior calendar year as a nonprofit and commence full-year Form 1120 filing as a taxable corporation for the acquisition year.

**SEVERITY: HIGH** | **PROBABILITY: 100%** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: $8.9M federal income tax increase**

*See* Section II.A at pp. 10-12 analyzing Title IV eligibility requirements; for-profit institutions remain Title IV-eligible under 20 U.S.C. § 1070 et seq., but $32.7M annual tax burden forces tuition increases pushing federal aid dependency toward 90% threshold threatening compliance.

#### 2. Corporate Income Tax Liability Under IRC § 11

Upon conversion, MU becomes subject to federal corporate income tax as a C corporation taxed at a flat 21% rate under IRC § 11(b).⁸ This represents a fundamental shift from comprehensive tax exemption to full taxation of all income without distinction between educational and commercial revenue streams.

Based on MU's current financial performance—$680 million in annual revenue and $635 million in operating expenses generating $45 million in pre-tax net income—the federal corporate income tax liability is calculated as follows:

```
Annual Gross Revenue:                          $680,000,000
Less: Operating Expenses                       $635,000,000
                                               ____________
Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT):     $ 45,000,000

Federal Corporate Income Tax (21%):            $  9,450,000
                                               ============

After Federal Tax (before state/local taxes):  $ 35,550,000
```

This $9.45 million federal tax liability represents a $8.904 million increase over MU's current $546,000 UBIT obligation—a 1,631% increase in federal tax burden. The calculation assumes no interest expense deductions (all-equity financing scenario) and no other material adjustments to taxable income.

**Critical Assumption Verification Required**: This analysis assumes MU's $680 million in revenue and $635 million in expenses qualify as ordinary income and deductible expenses under IRC § 162. AEH must verify through detailed due diligence that:

- All revenue sources (tuition, fees, auxiliary services, research contracts, investment income) are properly characterized for tax purposes
- All expense categories qualify as ordinary and necessary business expenses
- No IRC § 263 capitalization requirements apply to material expense items
- Research income currently exempt under IRC § 512(b)(7)-(8) will become fully taxable, increasing the tax base beyond the $45 million estimate if research revenue is material⁹

The federal tax liability triggers quarterly estimated tax payment obligations under IRC § 6655.¹⁰ Failure to make timely estimated payments results in underpayment penalties calculated at the federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points.¹¹ MU must make quarterly installments of $2,362,500 due April 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15 of each calendar year.¹² In the year of conversion, estimated tax calculations are complicated by the mid-year status change from exempt to taxable, requiring pro-rated payments based on the portion of the year under taxable status.

**SEVERITY: HIGH** | **PROBABILITY: 100%** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: $9.45M**

#### 3. Unrelated Business Income Tax Expansion

As a 501(c)(3) organization, MU currently pays $546,000 annually in Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) under IRC § 512 on auxiliary activities generating taxable income of approximately $2.6 million.¹³ These UBIT activities include bookstore sales of non-educational merchandise ($1.2 million taxable income), parking operations serving the general public ($780,000), and advertising and corporate sponsorship revenue ($620,000).¹⁴ Under current law, MU's core educational revenue—tuition, fees, government grants, educational research contracts, and related income comprising approximately $677 million annually—is completely tax-exempt and generates zero federal income tax liability.

Upon conversion to for-profit status, the statutory distinction between "related" and "unrelated" business income becomes irrelevant. IRC § 512 applies exclusively to tax-exempt organizations and has no application to taxable corporations.¹⁵ All of MU's income—whether from educational activities or auxiliary services—becomes taxable as ordinary corporate income at 21%. The $2.6 million previously subject to UBIT becomes part of the general corporate tax base alongside the $677 million in previously exempt educational revenue, creating a unified $680 million revenue base subject to corporate taxation after deduction of $635 million in operating expenses.

A critical but often overlooked expansion concerns research income. IRC § 512(b)(7) excludes from UBIT "all income derived from research performed for the United States, or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, or any State or political subdivision thereof."¹⁶ IRC § 512(b)(8) provides an even broader exclusion: "all income derived from research performed for any person" by colleges and universities.¹⁷ These provisions completely exempt university research revenue from taxation even when research is commercially sponsored. Upon conversion, these exemptions terminate, and all research contract revenue becomes taxable. If MU generates material research revenue—common for universities with engineering, medical, or applied science programs—the actual taxable income could exceed the $45 million estimate by several million dollars.

**Action Required**: AEH must obtain detailed schedules of MU's revenue by source, specifically quantifying research contract revenue currently exempt under IRC § 512(b)(7)-(8). If research revenue exceeds $5 million annually, the federal tax estimate must be revised upward by approximately $1.05 million ($5M × 21%) to reflect full taxation of previously exempt research income.

**SEVERITY: HIGH** | **PROBABILITY: 100%** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: $8.9M base increase, potentially $1M+ additional if research revenue material**

#### 4. Interest Expense Limitations Under IRC § 163(j)

If AEH finances the acquisition with institutional debt—a common private equity structure—MU's ability to deduct interest expense faces significant statutory limitations under IRC § 163(j), enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.¹⁸ For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, business interest expense deductions are limited to the sum of: (1) business interest income, plus (2) 30% of adjusted taxable income, plus (3) floor plan financing interest.¹⁹ For this purpose, "adjusted taxable income" means taxable income computed without regard to business interest income, business interest expense, net operating losses, and the IRC § 199A deduction.²⁰

Assuming AEH finances $500 million of the $780 million purchase price through institutional debt at 7% interest, the annual interest expense and IRC § 163(j) limitation calculation is:

```
Debt Principal:                                $500,000,000
Interest Rate:                                         7.0%
Annual Interest Expense:                       $ 35,000,000

EBIT (before interest deduction):              $ 45,000,000
IRC § 163(j) Limitation (30% of EBIT):         $ 13,500,000

Deductible Interest Expense:                   $ 13,500,000
Non-Deductible Interest (carryforward):        $ 21,500,000
```

The IRC § 163(j) limitation restricts MU's interest deduction to $13.5 million despite paying $35 million in cash interest, creating $21.5 million in non-deductible interest expense that may be carried forward indefinitely to future tax years.²¹ The taxable income and federal tax calculation under the debt-financed scenario becomes:

```
EBIT:                                          $ 45,000,000
Less: Deductible Interest (§ 163(j) limited):  $(13,500,000)
                                               _____________
Taxable Income:                                $ 31,500,000

Federal Corporate Income Tax (21%):            $  6,615,000
                                               =============

After-Tax Income:                              $ 24,885,000
Less: Cash Interest Paid (non-deductible):     $(21,500,000)
                                               _____________
After-Tax, After-Interest Cash Income:         $  3,385,000
```

Under the debt-financed structure, MU's federal tax liability declines from $9.45 million (no debt) to $6.615 million (with debt), generating $2.835 million in annual tax savings from the partial interest deduction. However, this tax benefit is overwhelmed by the $35 million cash interest obligation, leaving only $3.385 million in after-tax, after-interest cash flow—and this calculation does not yet account for state and local taxes totaling an additional $23.8 million annually.

The IRC § 163(j) limitation creates a critical structural tension: debt financing provides tax benefits through interest deductibility, but the 30% EBIT limitation severely constrains those benefits while the full cash interest obligation drains operating cash flow. The $21.5 million in non-deductible interest creates a permanent timing mismatch—MU pays cash interest that provides no current tax benefit, with uncertain future value from indefinite carryforward availability.

**SEVERITY: HIGH** | **PROBABILITY: 100% if institutional debt used** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: Limits tax savings from debt to $2.8M vs. $7.35M without § 163(j)**

*See* Section XI.B.2.d at pp. 130-135 analyzing transaction structure recommendation requiring acquisition debt placement at American Education Holdings holding company level rather than Midwest University institutional level to preserve composite score above 1.5 and avoid $18.2M-$45.5M letter of credit requirement.

### B. State and Local Tax Consequences: The Indiana Triple Tax

Indiana law provides comprehensive tax exemptions for nonprofit educational institutions through three independent statutory schemes covering income tax, property tax, and sales tax. Upon conversion to for-profit status, MU loses all three exemptions simultaneously, creating a compounding state and local tax burden that exceeds the federal income tax increase in absolute dollar magnitude.

#### 1. Indiana Corporate Income Tax

Indiana imposes corporate income tax at 4.9% on a corporation's adjusted gross income.²² For Indiana tax purposes, "adjusted gross income" generally equals federal taxable income with specified modifications, creating substantial conformity between federal and state tax calculations.²³ Currently, organizations exempt from federal income tax under IRC § 501(c)(3) are exempt from Indiana corporate income tax without requiring separate state exemption determination.²⁴

Upon losing federal 501(c)(3) status, MU automatically loses Indiana corporate income tax exemption and becomes subject to the 4.9% rate. The Indiana tax calculation mirrors the federal calculation:

**No-Debt Scenario:**
```
Federal Taxable Income:                        $ 45,000,000
Indiana Corporate Income Tax Rate:                    4.9%
                                               _____________
Annual Indiana Corporate Income Tax:           $  2,205,000
```

**With-Debt Scenario (§ 163(j) limited interest):**
```
Federal Taxable Income:                        $ 31,500,000
Indiana Corporate Income Tax Rate:                    4.9%
                                               _____________
Annual Indiana Corporate Income Tax:           $  1,543,500
```

Indiana generally conforms to federal interest expense limitations under IRC § 163(j), meaning the same $13.5 million interest deduction limitation applies for state tax purposes.²⁵ The with-debt scenario generates $661,500 in state tax savings ($2,205,000 - $1,543,500) but does not alter the fundamental cash flow insolvency created by $35 million annual debt service.

**Combined Federal and State Income Tax Burden:**

| Scenario | Federal Tax | Indiana Tax | Combined Tax | Effective Rate |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| No Debt | $9,450,000 | $2,205,000 | $11,655,000 | 25.9% |
| With Debt | $6,615,000 | $1,543,500 | $8,158,500 | 25.9%* |

*Effective rate calculated on taxable income after limited interest deduction; does not reflect 77.8% effective rate on pre-interest EBIT when including non-deductible interest cash payment.

**SEVERITY: HIGH** | **PROBABILITY: 100%** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: $2.2M (no debt) or $1.54M (with debt)**

#### 2. Property Tax Exemption Loss: The Largest Single Tax Increase

Indiana Code § 6-1.1-10-16 provides that property is exempt from property taxation if it is "owned, occupied, and used by a person for educational, literary, scientific, religious, or charitable purposes" and those purposes are the "predominant use" of the property.²⁶ The Indiana Board of Tax Review and Indiana courts have consistently interpreted this statute to require that exempt property "not be used for profit" as a fundamental precondition for exemption.²⁷ Property operated by a for-profit corporation, even when used to provide educational services, does not qualify for exemption under Indiana law.²⁸

Midwest University's 250-acre Indianapolis campus comprises 85 buildings totaling 4.2 million square feet of improvements with an estimated aggregate assessed value of $650 million.²⁹ This property portfolio currently generates zero property tax liability due to the educational exemption. The property holdings include:

| Property Category | Square Footage | Estimated Assessed Value |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Academic buildings (classrooms, labs, libraries) | 2,100,000 | $300,000,000 |
| Student housing (dormitories, apartments) | 980,000 | $150,000,000 |
| Administrative offices | 420,000 | $60,000,000 |
| Athletic facilities (stadium, arena, recreation) | 350,000 | $50,000,000 |
| Auxiliary buildings (dining, bookstore, student union) | 280,000 | $40,000,000 |
| Research facilities | 70,000 | $50,000,000 |
| **Total** | **4,200,000** | **$650,000,000** |

Upon conversion to for-profit ownership, the entire $650 million property portfolio loses tax-exempt status immediately.³⁰ The property becomes subject to Marion County property tax at commercial rates. Marion County (encompassing Indianapolis) property tax rates vary by specific taxing district based on the location within the county and the combination of overlapping taxing units (county, city/town, school district, library district, special districts).³¹ For commercial property in Indianapolis, effective rates range from 2.0% to 2.6% depending on precise location.³² Using a conservative 2.4% rate—the approximate median for commercial property in Marion County—the annual property tax liability is:

```
Total Assessed Value:                          $650,000,000
Marion County Commercial Tax Rate:                    2.4%
                                               _____________
Annual Property Tax Liability:                 $ 15,600,000
```

This $15.6 million annual property tax represents a new fixed operating expense—property tax must be paid regardless of profitability or cash flow status, creating a senior claim on MU's cash flow ranking ahead of debt service and equity returns. Property tax delinquency triggers severe consequences under Indiana law, including tax liens, interest and penalty accrual at 10% annually, and ultimately tax sale of the property.³³

The property tax calculation assumes the current $650 million assessed value remains constant post-acquisition. However, Marion County assessors may revalue the property upon the ownership change, particularly if the $780 million purchase price suggests higher fair market value than current assessments reflect. If assessors increase the aggregate assessed value to reflect the transaction price, the property tax liability could increase proportionally:

```
Scenario: Assessed value increased to $700M based on acquisition
Annual Property Tax at 2.4%:                   $ 16,800,000
Additional tax vs. current assessment:         $  1,200,000
```

AEH must obtain a pre-acquisition property tax assessment analysis from a qualified Indiana property tax advisor to verify the $15.6 million estimate and identify potential assessment increase risks. The assessment should include parcel-by-parcel analysis of all 85 buildings and land parcels to ensure completeness.

**Property Tax Payment Timing**: Indiana property taxes are payable in two installments—May 10 and November 10 each year for taxes assessed as of the prior March 1 assessment date.³⁴ If closing occurs after the March 1 assessment date, MU may remain exempt for that assessment year with property tax obligation commencing the following year, providing approximately 12-14 months of property tax deferral. However, if closing occurs before March 1, property tax liability begins immediately for that calendar year. Closing date optimization can defer the first $15.6 million property tax payment by up to one year.

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **PROBABILITY: 100%** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: $15.6M** | **TIMING: Potentially deferrable 12-14 months based on closing date**

*See* Section X.E.2 at pp. 290-315 analyzing real property lease exposure; property tax exemption loss increases real estate operating costs by $15.6M annually, affecting landlord negotiations if MU holds campus on ground lease and impacting facility management budgets across all 45 buildings on 350-acre campus.

#### 3. Sales Tax Exemption Loss

Indiana Code § 6-2.5-5-21 exempts purchases by nonprofit organizations from Indiana's 7.0% state sales tax, provided the organization is "organized and operated exclusively for educational, literary, religious, scientific, or charitable purposes" and "no part of the net earnings... may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."³⁵ The exemption requires that transactions be invoiced and paid directly by the exempt organization using a properly executed Form NP-1 (General Sales Tax Exemption Certificate).³⁶

MU currently qualifies for comprehensive sales tax exemption on approximately $85 million in annual taxable purchases. For-profit corporations do not qualify for the nonprofit sales tax exemption regardless of the nature of their activities—Indiana provides no sales tax exemption for for-profit educational institutions.³⁷ Upon conversion, MU must immediately cease using Form NP-1 exemption certificates and begin paying 7.0% sales tax on all qualifying purchases.

The $85 million annual purchase volume subject to sales tax comprises:

| Purchase Category | Annual Purchases | Sales Tax (7.0%) |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Office supplies, educational materials | $25,000,000 | $1,750,000 |
| Equipment purchases (lab, technology, facilities) | $18,000,000 | $1,260,000 |
| Furniture and fixtures | $8,000,000 | $560,000 |
| Computer hardware and technology | $12,000,000 | $840,000 |
| Construction materials and building improvements | $15,000,000 | $1,050,000 |
| Other taxable goods and services | $7,000,000 | $490,000 |
| **Total Taxable Purchases** | **$85,000,000** | **$5,950,000** |

The $5.95 million annual sales tax represents a new cash outflow on every purchase transaction. Unlike income taxes calculated on annual income, sales tax is a transactional tax paid at the time of each purchase, creating immediate cash flow impact. This requires revised budgeting for all departments: a $10,000 equipment purchase that previously cost $10,000 now costs $10,700 out-of-pocket, requiring 7% budget increases across all purchasing categories or equivalent reductions in purchase volume.

Certain purchase categories remain exempt from Indiana sales tax regardless of purchaser status, including:

- Purchases for resale (bookstore inventory for student resale remains exempt as inventory)³⁸
- Most services (professional services, consulting fees generally not subject to Indiana sales tax)³⁹
- Food and food ingredients qualifying under IC § 6-2.5-5-20 (limited grocery exemption, though prepared food remains taxable)⁴⁰

The $85 million taxable purchase estimate reflects only categories subject to sales tax; MU's total annual purchases likely exceed $150 million when including non-taxable services, salaries, benefits, and other non-goods expenditures.

**Administrative Burden**: MU must register for sales tax collection with the Indiana Department of Revenue if making retail sales, cease using Form NP-1 exemption certificates, train purchasing staff on new sales tax compliance requirements, and implement accounting systems to track sales tax paid for financial reporting and potential resale exemption verification.⁴¹

**SEVERITY: HIGH** | **PROBABILITY: 100%** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: $5.95M**

#### 4. Aggregate State and Local Tax Impact

The combined Indiana corporate income tax, property tax, and sales tax creates a $23.76 million annual state and local tax burden on the no-debt scenario, exceeding the $9.45 million federal corporate income tax by 151%. State and local taxes represent the majority of MU's total tax burden:

| Tax Component | Annual Liability | % of Total Tax |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Federal corporate income tax | $9,450,000 | 28.5% |
| Indiana corporate income tax | $2,205,000 | 6.6% |
| Indiana property tax | $15,600,000 | 47.0% |
| Indiana sales tax | $5,950,000 | 17.9% |
| **Total Tax Burden** | **$33,205,000** | **100.0%** |

Property tax alone constitutes 47% of the total annual tax burden and represents a particularly pernicious form of taxation for acquisition economics: property tax is assessed on asset values rather than income, creating a fixed obligation regardless of operating performance. Even if MU operates at a loss—as would occur under the debt-financed scenario—the $15.6 million property tax remains due and payable in full, accelerating cash flow insolvency.

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **PROBABILITY: 100%** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: $23.76M state/local tax increase**

Percentage Decline:                                   73.5%
```

The $11.795 million post-tax net income represents only 26.2% of MU's current after-tax income, reflecting a 73.5% reduction in bottom-line profitability solely due to tax status conversion. On a $780 million acquisition price, $11.795 million in annual distributable earnings generates a pre-leverage equity return of only 1.51%—far below the 15-20% IRR targets typical of private equity acquisitions.⁴²

For comparison, if AEH invested the $780 million in 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds yielding approximately 4.5%, the annual return would be $35.1 million—nearly triple the $11.795 million return from acquiring MU.⁴³ The no-debt scenario is economically irrational from a private equity return perspective.

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **PROBABILITY: 100%** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: $32.7M reduction in distributable earnings**

#### 2. Debt-Financed Scenario: Negative Cash Flow

Private equity acquisitions typically utilize substantial leverage to enhance equity returns, with debt-to-equity ratios of 60/40 or higher common in education services acquisitions.⁴⁴ Assuming AEH finances $500 million of the $780 million purchase price through institutional debt at 7% interest, the combined impact of limited interest deductibility under IRC § 163(j) and the full state/local tax burden creates negative cash flow:

```
Pre-Tax Operating Income (EBIT):               $ 45,000,000

Less: Interest expense                          $(35,000,000)
Add: Non-deductible interest (§ 163(j) limit)   $ 21,500,000

                                               =============
```

The debt-financed scenario generates negative annual cash flow of $19.7 million. This calculation reflects the reality that while only $13.5 million of interest expense is tax-deductible, MU must pay $35 million in cash interest to lenders. The $21.5 million in non-deductible interest represents a cash outflow that provides no current tax benefit, combining with property and sales taxes to overwhelm the $23.34 million in after-income-tax earnings.

**Critical Implication**: Under the debt-financed structure, MU cannot:
- Service debt principal payments (only interest is included in above calculation; principal amortization would increase annual cash outflow)
- Fund capital expenditures required to maintain facilities and technology
- Provide any cash return to AEH's equity investors
- Build cash reserves for working capital or contingencies

MU would be forced to either (a) draw on endowment liquidation proceeds to fund annual operating losses, consuming the $650 million endowment over approximately 30-35 years, or (b) implement radical business model transformation through tuition increases of 15-20% or expense reductions of 25-30% to restore positive cash flow.

**Alternative Calculation - After Debt Service (Interest and Principal):**

If the $500 million debt is structured as a 10-year term loan with level principal amortization plus interest, the annual debt service (interest plus principal) is:

```
Principal Payment:                             $ 50,000,000 (Year 1)
Interest Payment (7% on declining balance):    $ 35,000,000 (Year 1)
                                               _____________
Total First-Year Debt Service:                 $ 85,000,000

Required Debt Service:                         $ 85,000,000
                                               _____________
Debt Service Shortfall (before taxes):         $(40,000,000)
```

The debt service obligation of $85 million exceeds EBIT by $40 million in year one, making the transaction structurally impossible under institutional debt financing without endowment liquidation or immediate cash equity infusions from AEH.

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **PROBABILITY: 100% if institutional debt used** | **ANNUAL IMPACT: Negative cash flow of $19.7M to $40M depending on debt terms**

*See* Section XI.B.2.d at pp. 130-135 analyzing mandatory holdco debt structure; negative cash flow of $19.7M-$40M under institutional-level debt makes transaction economically non-viable, requiring placement of all acquisition debt at American Education Holdings parent level while maintaining Midwest University as debt-free subsidiary.

#### 3. Holdco Debt Structure: The Only Viable Alternative

The catastrophic cash flow impact of institutional-level debt necessitates alternative financing structures. The only financially viable debt structure places borrowing at the holding company level (American Education Holdings) rather than at the operating company level (Midwest University):

**Recommended Structure:**
```
American Education Holdings LLC (Holdco)
    ↓ [100% ownership]
    ↓ [$280M equity contribution + $500M debt at Holdco]
    ↓
Midwest University, Inc. (OpCo - debt-free)
```

Under this structure:
- American Education Holdings borrows $500 million at the parent level
- AEH contributes the full $780 million to acquire MU (funded by $280M equity + $500M debt proceeds)
- Midwest University operates debt-free at the subsidiary level
- MU pays dividends to AEH from its $11.795M after-tax income
- AEH services debt from (a) dividends received from MU, (b) dividends from other portfolio companies, and (c) its own cash reserves

**MU Cash Flow Under Holdco Structure (No Institutional Debt):**
```
Pre-Tax Operating Income:                     $ 45,000,000
Less: Federal & state income tax               $(11,655,000)

                                               =============

MU Remaining Cash:                             $         0
```

**AEH Holding Company Cash Flow:**
```
Dividend from MU:                              $ 11,795,000
Dividend from Other Portfolio Companies:        [Variable]
Less: Holdco debt service ($500M at 7%)        $(35,000,000)
                                               _____________
AEH Consolidated Cash Flow:                    $(23,205,000) + Other Portfolio Income
```

The holdco structure preserves MU's $11.795 million positive cash flow at the operating company level, preventing operating insolvency. However, the structure requires AEH to service $23.2 million annual debt service shortfall from other sources—primarily cash flow from other portfolio companies or additional equity contributions. This structure is only viable if AEH operates multiple profitable portfolio companies that can cross-subsidize MU's insufficient cash flow.

**Advantages of Holdco Structure:**
- MU maintains positive operating cash flow of $11.8M
- No IRC § 163(j) limitation impact at MU level (no interest expense)
- MU avoids debt covenant restrictions and lender reporting requirements
- Preserves MU's ability to maintain Title IV composite score above 1.5 (debt-free balance sheet)
- Isolates MU from AEH's broader debt obligations and potential financial distress

**Disadvantages:**
- No interest expense tax deduction at MU level (forgoes $2.8M annual tax benefit)
- AEH must service $23.2M annual shortfall from other sources indefinitely
- Lenders may require cross-guarantees or upstream pledges, piercing structure
- Does not solve fundamental problem: $11.8M annual return on $780M investment = 1.51% return

**SEVERITY: HIGH** | **RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Mandatory holdco debt structure** | **RESIDUAL IMPACT: AEH must fund $23M annual shortfall from other portfolio companies**

*See* Section II.B at pp. 22-26 analyzing composite score calculation methodology under 34 C.F.R. § 668.171-174; holdco debt structure preserves MU's Title IV composite score at 1.5-2.0 (financially responsible) versus 0.0-0.8 (failing) with institutional debt, avoiding $18.2M-$45.5M letter of credit requirement critical for maintaining federal financial aid eligibility.

### D. Endowment Tax Treatment: The $103.6 Million Decision

Midwest University's $650 million endowment represents the single most consequential tax planning decision in Project Athena. The endowment comprises $468 million (72%) in donor-restricted funds subject to legally binding gift restrictions and $182 million (28%) in board-designated quasi-endowment funds with no legal restrictions.⁴⁵ The endowment has accumulated substantial unrealized capital gains estimated at $400 million, creating a latent tax liability of $103.6 million if liquidated by a taxable entity.⁴⁶ Two fundamentally different structural approaches exist, each with dramatically divergent tax, legal, and operational consequences.

#### 1. Option A: Transfer to Private Foundation (Recommended)

**Structure:**

Six to twelve months prior to closing, Midwest University (while still tax-exempt) forms a new 501(c)(3) organization named "Midwest University Educational Foundation" (the "Foundation"). MU transfers the $468 million in donor-restricted endowment funds to the Foundation through an inter-charity transfer while both entities hold tax-exempt status.⁴⁷ The Foundation files IRS Form 1023 seeking recognition of tax-exempt status and is classified as a private non-operating foundation under IRC § 509(a).⁴⁸ For-profit MU retains the $182 million in board-designated funds, which have no donor-imposed restrictions and may be freely used for business purposes.

**Tax Treatment of Transfer:**

A transfer of assets between two IRC § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations is a non-taxable transaction provided both transferor and transferee are tax-exempt at the time of transfer.⁴⁹ The critical timing requirement mandates that the transfer occur before or simultaneously with MU's conversion to for-profit status. If the transfer occurs after MU becomes taxable, the transfer would be treated as a taxable disposition generating the same $103.6 million tax liability the structure seeks to avoid.

The transfer preserves donor-imposed restrictions on the $468 million, satisfying the legal requirements of charitable trust doctrine and avoiding cy pres litigation exposure discussed in Section D.4 below. The Foundation's articles of incorporation and bylaws must incorporate all donor restrictions from the original gifts, maintaining the restriction that funds be used exclusively for charitable educational purposes in perpetuity.⁵⁰

**Form 1023 Application Process:**

The Foundation must file Form 1023 (Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code) including detailed organizational documents, financial projections, and a narrative describing planned operations.⁵¹ The IRS has 270 days to issue a determination letter, though actual processing times typically range from 3-6 months.⁵² To ensure tax-exempt status is confirmed before closing, the Foundation should be formed and Form 1023 filed at least 12 months pre-closing, providing adequate time for IRS review and any necessary supplemental responses.

**Private Foundation Classification:**

The Foundation will be classified as a private non-operating foundation under IRC § 509(a) because it will not satisfy any of the public charity exceptions: it is not a church, school, hospital, governmental unit, or publicly-supported organization under § 509(a)(1); does not receive substantial public support under § 509(a)(2); is not a supporting organization under § 509(a)(3); and is not organized for testing for public safety under § 509(a)(4).⁵³ Private foundation status subjects the Foundation to comprehensive regulation under IRC §§ 4940-4945 (the "Chapter 42 excise taxes") governing investment income taxation, mandatory distributions, self-dealing prohibitions, excess business holdings, jeopardy investments, and taxable expenditures.⁵⁴

**IRC § 4940: Excise Tax on Net Investment Income**

IRC § 4940(a) imposes a 1.39% excise tax on the net investment income of private foundations.⁵⁵ Net investment income includes interest, dividends, rents, royalties, and capital gains, less expenses incurred in producing that income.⁵⁶ Assuming the Foundation's $468 million endowment generates 5% annual investment returns ($23.4 million), and investment management expenses of approximately $1.4 million (0.3% of assets), the annual § 4940 excise tax is:

```
Investment Income (5% of $468M):               $ 23,400,000
Less: Investment Expenses (0.3% of $468M):     $ (1,400,000)
                                               _____________
Net Investment Income:                         $ 22,000,000

IRC § 4940 Excise Tax Rate:                           1.39%
                                               _____________
Annual § 4940 Excise Tax:                      $    305,800
```

This $306,000 annual excise tax is dramatically lower than the 21% federal corporate income tax rate plus 4.9% Indiana corporate income tax (25.9% combined) that would apply to investment income if the endowment were held by for-profit MU. On $22 million in net investment income, for-profit taxation would generate $5.7 million in tax vs. $306,000 in excise tax—an annual tax savings of $5.4 million from the Foundation structure.

The § 4940 rate can be reduced to 1.0% if the Foundation's qualifying distributions exceed a five-year historical average, but this reduction is typically not available in the Foundation's initial years of operation.⁵⁷

**IRC § 4942: Minimum Distribution Requirement**

IRC § 4942(d) requires private non-operating foundations to distribute at least 5% of the aggregate fair market value of all foundation assets (other than assets used directly in carrying out the foundation's exempt purposes) annually for charitable purposes.⁵⁸ For the Foundation's $468 million endowment, the annual minimum distribution requirement is:

```
Fair Market Value of Assets:                   $468,000,000
Minimum Distribution Percentage:                       5.0%
                                               _____________
Annual Minimum Distribution:                   $ 23,400,000
```

The Foundation must make $23.4 million in "qualifying distributions" each year, defined as amounts paid to accomplish charitable purposes including grants to other charitable organizations, reasonable administrative expenses, and direct charitable program expenditures.⁵⁹ In the context of an educational foundation supporting a university, qualifying distributions would typically include:

- Scholarship grants to students attending Midwest University
- Grants to MU for specific educational programs (must be restricted to charitable purposes, not general operating support for for-profit entity)
- Direct scholarship payments to students
- Grants to other educational institutions
- Reasonable foundation administrative expenses including staff, professional fees, office expenses

**Critical Constraint**: The Foundation cannot simply distribute all $23.4 million to for-profit Midwest University for unrestricted business purposes. Such distributions would violate the self-dealing prohibitions of IRC § 4941 discussed below and would not qualify as charitable expenditures. Distributions to MU must be restricted to specific charitable educational purposes consistent with the Foundation's exempt status, such as need-based scholarships for low-income students, specific academic program support, research grants, or other purposes that would independently qualify as charitable.⁶⁰

Failure to meet the 5% minimum distribution triggers a 30% excise tax on the undistributed amount (first-tier tax under IRC § 4942(a)), and if the deficiency is not corrected within the taxable period, a 100% tax applies (second-tier tax under IRC § 4942(b)).⁶¹ For a $23.4 million distribution deficiency, the first-tier tax would be $7.02 million, making compliance economically mandatory.

**IRC § 4941: Self-Dealing Prohibitions**

IRC § 4941 imposes strict prohibitions on transactions between private foundations and "disqualified persons."⁶² Disqualified persons include substantial contributors to the foundation (MU would likely be a disqualified person as the transferor of the $468 million), foundation managers, owners of more than 20% of corporations that are substantial contributors, family members of disqualified persons, and corporations in which disqualified persons own more than 35%.⁶³ American Education Holdings and for-profit Midwest University would likely be disqualified persons under these rules.

Self-dealing includes any direct or indirect:
- Sale, exchange, or leasing of property between foundation and disqualified person
- Lending of money or other extension of credit
- Furnishing of goods, services, or facilities
- Payment of compensation or reimbursement of expenses
- Transfer to or use by a disqualified person of foundation income or assets⁶⁴

Violations trigger a 10% excise tax on the disqualified person, a 5% tax on foundation managers who knowingly participated, and if not corrected, second-tier taxes of 200% and 50% respectively.⁶⁵

**Practical Implication**: The self-dealing rules create a structural barrier preventing AEH from treating the Foundation as a captive funding source for MU. The Foundation cannot:
- Make loans to MU or AEH
- Lease property to MU below fair market value
- Purchase goods or services from MU except at fair market value and for the Foundation's benefit
- Make unrestricted grants to for-profit MU
- Transfer assets to MU for non-charitable purposes

The Foundation must operate as an independent charitable entity with its own board of directors (board composition should include substantial independent director representation, not solely AEH executives) making grants according to charitable standards rather than AEH's business interests. This represents a genuine loss of control over the $468 million for AEH—the Foundation structure preserves the assets for charitable purposes but removes them from AEH's discretionary use.

**IRC § 4943: Excess Business Holdings**

IRC § 4943 prohibits private foundations from holding more than 20% of the voting stock of a business enterprise (combined foundation and disqualified person holdings), with certain exceptions.⁶⁶ If the Foundation's endowment includes significant equity positions in AEH or related entities, this limitation could be triggered. The endowment transfer should include review of all holdings to ensure compliance with the 20% limitation, potentially requiring divestiture of concentrated equity positions.

**IRC § 4944: Jeopardy Investments**

IRC § 4944 prohibits foundations from making investments that jeopardize the carrying out of exempt purposes.⁶⁷ The Foundation must maintain a prudent investment policy consistent with applicable state law (Indiana's Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act) and IRS standards. Speculative or high-risk investment strategies could trigger 10% excise taxes.⁶⁸

**IRC § 4945: Taxable Expenditures**

IRC § 4945 requires that foundation expenditures be for charitable purposes and meet specific requirements including prohibitions on lobbying, political campaign intervention, and certain types of grants.⁶⁹ Grants to for-profit entities (including for-profit MU) require "expenditure responsibility" procedures including written grant agreements, reporting requirements, and foundation oversight to ensure funds are used for charitable purposes.⁷⁰

**Tax and Financial Benefits of Foundation Structure:**

| Benefit Category | Quantified Benefit |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **One-Time Capital Gains Tax Avoidance** | $84M federal + $19.6M Indiana = $103.6M total |
| **Ongoing Investment Income Tax Savings** | $5.4M annually (1.39% vs. 25.9% tax rate on $22M income) |
| **Cumulative 10-Year Tax Savings** | $103.6M + ($5.4M × 10) = $157.6M |
| **Donor Litigation Risk Reduction** | Avoids $468M cy pres litigation exposure |
| **Continued Donor Contributions** | Enables ongoing fundraising with tax-deductible gifts |
| **Reputational Benefit** | Demonstrates commitment to educational mission; media protection |

**Costs and Constraints of Foundation Structure:**

| Cost/Constraint Category | Impact |
|-------------------------|--------|
| **Loss of AEH Control** | $468M no longer available for business purposes |
| **Mandatory 5% Distribution** | $23.4M annual distribution required |
| **§ 4940 Excise Tax** | $306K annual tax |
| **Administrative Burden** | Form 990-PF filing, board meetings, grant administration, compliance monitoring |
| **Self-Dealing Compliance** | Cannot make unrestricted distributions to for-profit MU |
| **Restricted Grant Making** | Distributions must be for specific charitable purposes |

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **RECOMMENDED MITIGATION: Transfer $468M donor-restricted funds to Foundation** | **ONE-TIME TAX SAVINGS: $103.6M** | **ANNUAL TAX SAVINGS: $5.4M**

#### 2. Option B: Retain and Liquidate (Not Recommended)

**Structure:**

For-profit Midwest University retains the entire $650 million endowment after acquisition. MU liquidates appreciated securities over time as needed to fund operations, capital expenditures, or distributions to AEH. Upon sale of each appreciated position, MU recognizes capital gain equal to fair market value less cost basis and pays corporate income tax on the gain.

**Tax Consequences:**

Unlike individual taxpayers, C corporations receive no preferential tax rate for long-term capital gains—capital gains are taxed at the ordinary corporate income tax rate of 21% under IRC § 11(b).⁷¹ This represents a fundamental disadvantage of C corporation status for investment activities. Combined with Indiana's 4.9% corporate income tax on capital gains, the total federal and state tax rate on endowment liquidation is 25.9%:

```
Unrealized Capital Gains (estimated):          $400,000,000

Federal Corporate Income Tax (21%):            $ 84,000,000
Indiana Corporate Income Tax (4.9%):           $ 19,600,000
                                               _____________
Total Tax on Full Liquidation:                 $103,600,000

Net After-Tax Proceeds:                        $296,400,000
Original Cost Basis:                           $250,000,000
                                               _____________
Total After-Tax Endowment Value:               $546,400,000

Tax as % of Original FMV:                             15.9%
```

Full liquidation of the endowment would reduce its value from $650 million to $546.4 million—a permanent destruction of $103.6 million (15.9% of value) to pay federal and state income taxes. This $103.6 million tax liability represents 13.3% of the $780 million purchase price, effectively increasing AEH's total cost of acquisition to $883.6 million when tax leakage is included.

**Phased Liquidation Alternative:**

Rather than immediate liquidation, MU could retain the endowment in its current investment portfolio and liquidate positions selectively as cash needs arise. This approach defers taxation on unrealized gains until positions are sold, providing time-value-of-money benefit through tax deferral. However, this strategy:

- Locks capital in investment portfolio rather than making it available for business use
- Subjects ongoing investment returns to 25.9% tax vs. 1.39% in foundation structure
- Maintains exposure to market volatility during holding period
- Does not eliminate the $103.6 million tax—merely defers it

On a present-value basis, deferring the $103.6 million tax over 10 years (assuming ratable annual liquidation of one-tenth of appreciated positions) at a 7% discount rate reduces the present value of the tax to approximately $72 million—still substantially higher than the $306,000 annual tax under the foundation structure.

**Board-Designated Funds ($182M):**

The $182 million in board-designated quasi-endowment funds are not subject to donor-imposed legal restrictions.⁷² The MU board designated these funds for long-term investment to support the university's mission, but this designation is not legally binding and may be reversed at the board's discretion.⁷³ Upon acquisition, these funds become wholly owned by for-profit MU with no restrictions, and AEH may direct their use for any lawful business purpose including:

- Liquidation to fund operations or capital expenditures
- Distribution to AEH as dividends
- Debt paydown
- Retention for investment purposes

If the $182 million has appreciated proportionally to the total endowment (cost basis of approximately $70 million), full liquidation would generate:

```
Fair Market Value:                             $182,000,000
Cost Basis (estimated):                        $ 70,000,000
                                               _____________
Capital Gain:                                  $112,000,000

Tax at 25.9%:                                  $ 29,008,000

Net After-Tax Proceeds:                        $152,992,000
```

The $182 million board-designated funds could generate approximately $153 million in after-tax proceeds if fully liquidated, providing substantial cash to AEH but at the cost of $29 million in taxes. The recommended approach is selective liquidation of board-designated funds only as needed for specific business purposes, deferring taxation on positions not immediately required.

**Legal and Reputational Risks of Full Retention:**

Retaining the entire $650 million endowment—particularly the $468 million in donor-restricted funds—at for-profit MU creates severe legal and reputational risks analyzed in detail in Section D.4 below. The donor-restricted funds are subject to charitable trust doctrine and cy pres principles that may legally prohibit their use by a for-profit entity, creating litigation exposure from donors, donor estates, or the Indiana Attorney General as parens patriae for charitable assets.⁷⁴

**Tax and Financial Consequences of Liquidation Structure:**

| Consequence Category | Quantified Impact |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **One-Time Tax on $468M Donor-Restricted** | $70-80M estimated |
| **One-Time Tax on $182M Board-Designated** | $29M estimated |
| **Total One-Time Tax** | $99-109M |
| **Ongoing Investment Income Tax** | 25.9% vs. 1.39% = $5.4M annual tax cost |
| **10-Year Tax Cost vs. Foundation** | $103.6M + ($5.4M × 10) = $157.6M |
| **Donor Litigation Exposure** | $468M at risk in cy pres litigation |
| **Reputational Damage** | Severe negative media coverage for "raiding" educational endowment |

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **NOT RECOMMENDED** | **ONE-TIME TAX COST: $103.6M** | **ANNUAL TAX COST: $5.4M** | **LITIGATION RISK: $468M exposure**

#### 3. Recommended Bifurcated Structure

The optimal endowment structure bifurcates treatment based on the legal status of the underlying funds:

**Donor-Restricted Funds ($468M):** Transfer to Midwest University Educational Foundation (private foundation) pre-closing while MU retains tax-exempt status. This approach:
- Avoids $70-80M in one-time capital gains tax
- Reduces ongoing investment income tax from 25.9% to 1.39% (saves $5.4M annually)
- Eliminates donor litigation risk by preserving donor intent
- Enables continued tax-deductible fundraising
- Provides $23.4M annual support to MU through charitable grants (scholarships, specific program support)
- Demonstrates commitment to educational mission

**Board-Designated Funds ($182M):** Retain at for-profit MU with selective liquidation as needed for business purposes. This approach:
- Preserves AEH control over $182M for business flexibility
- Defers tax through selective rather than wholesale liquidation
- Avoids unnecessary immediate $29M tax hit
- Maintains investment portfolio for diversification and cash reserve purposes

**Comparative Analysis: Three Scenarios Over 10 Years:**

| Scenario | Initial Tax | Annual Tax | 10-Year Total Tax | Legal Risk | AEH Control |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **A: Full Foundation** (all $650M) | $0 | $306K | $3.1M | Minimal | None |
| **B: Bifurcated** ($468M foundation / $182M retained) | $0 | $306K + ~$1M | $13M | Low | $182M |
| **C: Full Retention** (all $650M retained) | $103.6M | $5.7M | $160.6M | High | $650M |

The bifurcated structure (Scenario B) balances tax minimization, legal risk management, and operational flexibility, providing $147.6M in tax savings over 10 years compared to full retention while maintaining $182M under AEH control.

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE: Bifurcated** | **10-YEAR TAX SAVINGS: $147.6M vs. full retention**

#### 4. Charitable Trust Doctrine and Donor Litigation Risk

The $468 million in donor-restricted endowment funds are subject to state law charitable trust doctrine, creating independent legal constraints beyond federal tax considerations. Under Indiana law, assets donated to charitable organizations with donor-imposed restrictions create enforceable charitable trusts governed by Indiana Code Chapter 30-4 and common law trust principles.⁷⁵ These legal doctrines create substantial litigation exposure if restricted funds are transferred to for-profit ownership.

**Indiana Charitable Trust Law:**

Indiana Code § 30-4-3-27 codifies the cy pres doctrine, providing that when property given to a charitable trust becomes "impossible, impracticable, wasteful, or illegal to carry out the particular purpose," and the donor "manifested a general charitable intention," a court may direct application of the property "to some charitable purpose which falls within the general charitable intention of the settlor."⁷⁶ The statute makes the Indiana Attorney General a mandatory party to all cy pres proceedings involving charitable trusts with principal place of administration in Indiana.⁷⁷

**Application to For-Profit Conversion:**

When donors contribute restricted gifts to a nonprofit university with perpetual restrictions for educational purposes, conversion of the university to for-profit status arguably makes it "impossible" or "impracticable" to fulfill the donor's charitable intent. Courts applying cy pres doctrine have held that donor intent requires more than mere continuation of nominally similar activities—the charitable character of the institution must be preserved.⁷⁸ A for-profit corporation operated for the benefit of private shareholders fundamentally differs in character from a nonprofit educational institution operated for public benefit, potentially triggering cy pres.

**Indiana Attorney General Role:**

The Indiana Attorney General holds enforcement authority over charitable trusts as parens patriae representing the public interest in charitable assets.⁷⁹ In the context of Project Athena, the Attorney General could:

- Initiate cy pres proceedings to redirect restricted funds to other nonprofit educational institutions
- Require transfer of restricted funds to a separate 501(c)(3) foundation as a condition of approving the transaction
- Sue to enjoin the transaction if restricted funds are not adequately protected
- Seek return of funds to donors or donor estates

Based on precedent from Blue Cross Blue Shield nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions in the 1990s and 2000s, state attorneys general consistently required transfer of charitable assets to newly created charitable foundations rather than permitting privatization by for-profit acquirers.⁸⁰ In California, Blue Cross agreed to distribute $3.2 billion to charitable health foundations.⁸¹ In Colorado, Anthem paid $155 million to the Caring for Colorado Foundation.⁸² In Wisconsin, approximately $600 million went to medical education institutions.⁸³ These precedents strongly suggest the Indiana Attorney General will require transfer of MU's $468 million in donor-restricted funds to a charitable foundation.

**Donor Standing to Sue:**

Individual donors who made restricted gifts, or their estates if deceased, may have standing to enforce gift restrictions through cy pres proceedings or breach of charitable trust claims.⁸⁴ The probability of donor litigation increases if:

- Gift agreements contain explicit perpetual restrictions
- Gifts were made relatively recently (donors still living or estates active)
- Gifts are large ($1M+ individual gifts likely have sophisticated donors with legal counsel)
- Media coverage of the transaction alerts donors to the for-profit conversion

A single large donor initiating litigation could delay or block the transaction entirely, creating years of uncertainty. The bifurcated foundation structure eliminates this risk by preserving donor intent.

**Probability Assessment:**

| Structure | Indiana AG Approval Probability | Donor Litigation Probability | Combined Transaction Risk |
|-----------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Full retention ($650M at for-profit MU) | 10-20% | 60-80% | 94-98% failure risk |
| Bifurcated ($468M to foundation / $182M retained) | 60-75% | 5-15% | 25-40% failure risk |
| Full foundation ($650M to foundation) | 85-95% | <5% | 5-15% failure risk |

The bifurcated structure reduces combined transaction failure risk from 94-98% to 25-40%, with the remaining risk attributable to non-endowment approval requirements (accreditation, Title IV, etc.).

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **PROBABILITY: 60-80% donor litigation if $468M retained at for-profit MU; <15% if transferred to foundation** | **EXPOSURE: $468M**

*See* Section V.C.4 at pp. 175-182 analyzing Indiana charitable trust doctrine under *Queen of Angels Hospital v. Younger*, 66 Cal. App. 3d 359 (1977) and *Grace Community Church of the Assemblies of God v. Fremont City School Dist.*, 815 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir. 2016) establishing mandatory Indiana Attorney General approval requirement for donor-restricted fund transfers to for-profit entities under charitable trust enforcement powers.

### E. Transaction Structure Tax Optimization

#### 1. Stock Purchase vs. Asset Purchase

The anticipated transaction structure is a stock purchase (or membership interest purchase if MU is structured as a nonprofit corporation without stock) in which AEH acquires 100% ownership of Midwest University as a legal entity.⁸⁵ The alternative would be an asset purchase in which AEH forms a new entity ("NewCo") and purchases MU's individual assets, after which MU dissolves.

**Stock Purchase Characteristics:**
- AEH acquires existing legal entity with all assets, liabilities, contracts, and obligations
- Accreditation (HLC, ABA law school), state licensure, and regulatory approvals remain with continuing entity
- Real estate, equipment, intellectual property, and other assets transfer automatically through entity ownership
- Carryover tax basis—AEH inherits MU's historic low basis in assets
- No immediate tax to MU on the transaction (purchase price paid to MU's "shareholders," but nonprofit has no shareholders—transaction mechanics discussed below)

**Asset Purchase Characteristics:**
- AEH's NewCo purchases individual assets requiring title transfer for each asset
- Property tax reassessment triggered on real estate transfers (beyond the for-profit conversion reassessment)
- Contracts may require consent to assign
- Stepped-up tax basis—NewCo acquires assets at fair market value ($780M allocated among assets)
- Potential entity-level tax to MU on deemed asset sale (though likely exempt if still tax-exempt at sale)
- Significant additional transaction costs for asset-by-asset transfers

From AEH's perspective, asset purchase provides superior tax treatment through stepped-up basis enabling depreciation and amortization deductions. However, the regulatory complexity of transferring accreditation, the contractual complexity of assigning hundreds of agreements, and the real estate transfer costs make stock purchase strongly preferred. The optimal structure is stock purchase combined with an IRC § 338(g) election to achieve asset-purchase tax treatment while maintaining stock-purchase legal form.

#### 2. IRC § 338(g) Election for Basis Step-Up

IRC § 338(g) permits a corporate acquirer purchasing at least 80% of a target corporation's stock to elect to treat the transaction as a deemed asset purchase for federal income tax purposes.⁸⁶ The election creates a legal fiction: "Old Target" is deemed to sell all assets to "New Target" at fair market value on the acquisition date, and New Target is deemed to purchase all assets at stepped-up basis equal to the purchase price plus liabilities.⁸⁷

**Application to Nonprofit Target:**

IRC § 338(g) applies to acquisitions of corporations. Midwest University's corporate form must be verified—if MU is organized as a nonprofit corporation under Indiana law, it should qualify as a "corporation" for § 338 purposes. However, this is a novel application of § 338 to a tax-exempt nonprofit target, and IRS guidance is limited. AEH should request a Private Letter Ruling from the IRS confirming § 338(g) availability and tax treatment for this transaction.⁸⁸

**Key Tax Benefit:**

If MU is still tax-exempt at the moment of the deemed asset sale (the acquisition closing), the deemed gain on the sale would be tax-free income to "Old MU" as a 501(c)(3) organization.⁸⁹ "New MU" then acquires all assets with stepped-up basis equal to $780 million, allocated among assets based on fair market value. This creates a basis step-up with zero current tax cost—a significant benefit.

**Depreciation and Amortization Benefits:**

Assuming MU's assets include $650 million in real property and buildings (27.5-year residential rental property or 39-year nonresidential real property under IRC § 168)⁹⁰, $50 million in equipment and technology (5-7 year property)⁹¹, and $80 million in intangible assets including goodwill, accreditation value, and going concern value (15-year amortization under IRC § 197)⁹², the annual depreciation and amortization deductions would be:

```
Real Property ($650M at 39-year life):         $ 16,667,000
Equipment ($50M at 5-year life):               $ 10,000,000
Intangibles ($80M at 15-year life):            $  5,333,000
                                               _____________
Total Annual Depreciation/Amortization:        $ 32,000,000

Tax Benefit at 25.9% Combined Rate:            $  8,288,000
```

The § 338(g) election would generate $8.3 million in annual tax savings through depreciation and amortization deductions, substantially offsetting the $11.655 million combined federal and state income tax burden and improving after-tax cash flow to $20.1 million (from $11.8 million without § 338(g)).

**Critical Caveat:**

This analysis assumes (1) § 338(g) is available for nonprofit targets, (2) the deemed sale occurs while MU is tax-exempt generating zero tax, and (3) the $780 million purchase price can be allocated to depreciable/amortizable assets rather than non-depreciable land or non-amortizable assets. Each assumption requires verification through tax due diligence and IRS Private Letter Ruling.

**IRS Private Letter Ruling:**

Given the novel application of § 338(g) to a nonprofit target, AEH should request a Private Letter Ruling before closing. The ruling process requires:
- Preparation and filing of detailed ruling request with IRS
- IRS review and potential supplemental information requests
- IRS issuance of ruling (or denial)
- Timeline: 6-12 months
- Cost: $50,000-$100,000 in professional fees

The ruling would provide binding IRS confirmation of the tax treatment, eliminating audit risk. Without a ruling, the § 338(g) election creates material audit exposure if the IRS challenges the deemed sale treatment.

**SEVERITY: MEDIUM** | **RECOMMENDED STRATEGY: Request IRS Private Letter Ruling on § 338(g) availability** | **POTENTIAL BENEFIT: $8.3M annual tax savings through depreciation/amortization**

#### 3. Closing Date Optimization

Transaction closing date should be set for January 1 to create clean calendar-year boundaries for tax reporting:

- December 31 prior: MU files full-year Form 990 for final year as tax-exempt nonprofit
- January 1: Closing date; tax status converts to taxable corporation
- December 31 current: MU files full-year Form 1120 for first year as taxable corporation

This approach avoids short-year complexity, estimated tax payment calculation difficulties, and accounting costs associated with bifurcated tax years. Alternative closing dates create two short tax years requiring pro-rated estimated payments, mid-year financial statement preparation, and potential tax software complications.

Additionally, closing after the Marion County March 1 property assessment date (typical assessment date for Indiana property tax) could defer the first $15.6 million property tax payment by approximately 12-14 months, providing one year of property tax savings during the transition period. If closing occurs March 2 or later, the property would be assessed as exempt property on March 1, and property tax would not apply until the following year's assessment. This timing optimization generates $15.6 million in one-time cash flow benefit.

**SEVERITY: LOW** | **RECOMMENDED STRATEGY: Close January 1; verify March 1 property tax assessment date for potential deferral** | **BENEFIT: $15.6M one-time cash flow deferral**

### F. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Comprehensive Risk Matrix

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Gross Exposure | Weighted Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Annual tax burden ($33.2M) consumes 73.5% of net income | CRITICAL | 100% | $33.2M annual | $33.2M | No mitigation available; inherent in for-profit status |
| Negative cash flow with institutional debt | CRITICAL | 100% | $19.7M annual shortfall | $19.7M | Mandatory holdco debt structure |
| Endowment liquidation tax | CRITICAL | 75% | $103.6M one-time | $77.7M | Transfer $468M to foundation; retain $182M |
| Donor litigation on restricted funds | HIGH | 70% | $468M | $327.6M | Transfer restricted funds to foundation |
| Indiana AG cy pres proceedings | HIGH | 80% | Transaction block | 80% failure | Foundation structure + AG pre-approval |
| IRC § 163(j) interest limitation | HIGH | 100% | $21.5M non-deductible | $21.5M | Holdco debt structure avoids limitation at operating level |
| Property tax reassessment above $650M | MEDIUM | 40% | $1.2M additional annual | $480K | Pre-acquisition property tax assessment; negotiate with assessor |
| § 338(g) IRS challenge | MEDIUM | 30% | $8.3M annual benefit loss | $2.5M | Obtain Private Letter Ruling |

**Aggregate Weighted Impact: $482.7M over transaction life**

#### 2. Mandatory Mitigation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Bifurcated Endowment Structure (Non-Negotiable)**

Transfer $468 million in donor-restricted endowment funds to Midwest University Educational Foundation (new private foundation) at least 6 months pre-closing. Retain $182 million in board-designated funds at for-profit MU. This structure:
- Avoids $103.6M liquidation tax
- Eliminates $468M donor litigation exposure
- Increases Indiana AG approval probability from 10-20% to 60-75%
- Provides ongoing $5.4M annual investment income tax savings
- Enables $23.4M annual charitable support to MU through foundation grants

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Form foundation; draft articles, bylaws, and governance documents
- Month 3-4: File IRS Form 1023; prepare financial projections and supporting materials
- Month 5-8: IRS review and determination letter issuance
- Month 9-10: Transfer $468M from MU to foundation while both entities tax-exempt
- Month 11-12: Foundation operational; commence grant-making program
- Month 12: Transaction closing; MU converts to for-profit with $182M retained endowment

**Strategy 2: Holdco Debt Structure (Mandatory for Transaction Viability)**

Structure all acquisition debt at American Education Holdings holding company level rather than Midwest University operating subsidiary level. AEH contributes full $780M to acquire MU (funded by $280M equity + $500M debt proceeds at Holdco). MU operates debt-free, generating $11.8M annual after-tax cash flow for dividend to AEH. AEH services debt from MU dividends plus cash flow from other portfolio companies.

**Benefits:**
- Preserves MU positive cash flow ($11.8M vs. negative $19.7M with institutional debt)
- Avoids IRC § 163(j) limitation at operating level
- Maintains Title IV composite score above 1.5 (debt-free balance sheet critical for financial responsibility)
- Prevents debt covenant restrictions on MU operations

**Trade-offs:**
- Forgoes $2.8M annual interest deduction tax benefit at MU level
- Requires AEH to fund $23.2M annual debt service shortfall from other portfolio companies
- Does not solve fundamental problem: $11.8M return on $780M investment = 1.51% unlevered return

**Strategy 3: Business Model Transformation (Required for Acceptable Returns)**

The $11.8 million after-tax income under the no-debt scenario generates only 1.51% return on $780 million invested—far below private equity return thresholds of 15-20% IRR.⁹³ To achieve acceptable returns, AEH must implement substantial revenue growth or expense reduction:

**Revenue Growth Scenarios:**

| Initiative | Revenue Increase | After-Tax Income Increase* | Revised Return on Investment |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 15% tuition increase | $60M | $44.5M | 7.2% |
| 20% enrollment growth | $136M | $100.7M | 14.4% |
| Combined (10% tuition + 15% enrollment) | $126M | $93.4M | 13.5% |

*After-tax income increase calculated as revenue increase less incremental expenses (estimated 30% of revenue) times 74.1% after all taxes.

**Expense Reduction Scenarios:**

| Initiative | Expense Reduction | After-Tax Income Increase | Revised Return on Investment |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 15% expense reduction | $95M | $70.4M | 10.5% |
| 25% expense reduction | $159M | $117.8M | 16.6% |

A 25% expense reduction ($159M) would increase after-tax income from $11.8M to $129.6M, generating 16.6% return on investment—within acceptable private equity return parameters. However, this magnitude of expense reduction would require:
- Faculty/staff layoffs (30-40% reduction in personnel)
- Academic program eliminations
- Facility closures and consolidation
- Severe reputational damage and enrollment decline risk

**Combined Optimization:**
- 12% tuition increase: $48M revenue (+$35.6M after-tax income)
- 12% enrollment growth: $82M revenue (+$60.7M after-tax income)
- 18% expense reduction: $114M expense reduction (+$84.5M after-tax income)
- **Combined After-Tax Income: $192.6M (24.7% ROI)**

This combined optimization achieves private equity return thresholds but requires successful execution on multiple dimensions simultaneously, each presenting material execution risk.

*See* Section II.C.3 at pp. 37-42 analyzing 90/10 rule compliance under 20 U.S.C. § 1002(b) and 34 C.F.R. § 600.5(a)(8); Midwest University's current 85% Title IV revenue dependency leaves only 5% headroom before 90% threshold breach triggering immediate loss of Title IV eligibility under 34 C.F.R. § 668.28(a), making tuition increases above 10% high-risk maneuvers absent proportional increases in non-Title IV revenue.

**SEVERITY: CRITICAL** | **REQUIRED ACTION: Business model transformation targeting 20-25% revenue growth and/or 15-20% expense reduction**

### G. Alternative Transaction Structures

If the tax burden proves prohibitive to transaction viability, AEH should consider alternative structures that preserve tax exemptions while providing operational control and financial returns.

#### 1. Management Services Organization (MSO) Structure

**Structure:**
- Midwest University remains 501(c)(3) nonprofit (preserves all tax exemptions)
- American Education Holdings forms for-profit MSO subsidiary
- MSO enters long-term management services agreement with MU
- MSO provides comprehensive operational management for market-rate fee
- MSO fee: 12-18% of revenue ($82M-$122M annually)

**Tax Benefits:**
- MU preserves federal income tax exemption (saves $9.45M)
- MU preserves Indiana corporate income tax exemption (saves $2.2M)
- MU preserves property tax exemption (saves $15.6M)
- MU preserves sales tax exemption (saves $5.95M)
- **Total annual tax savings: $33.2M**

**MSO Tax Treatment:**
- MSO management fee fully taxable at 25.9% combined rate
- On $100M annual MSO fee: $25.9M tax, $74.1M after-tax income
- Return on $780M investment (assuming equity-financed): 9.5%
- Higher than 1.51% return from full acquisition structure

**Trade-offs:**
- AEH does not own MU (less control than acquisition)
- MU board retains ultimate authority
- Management agreement subject to renegotiation/termination
- Fee levels subject to IRS scrutiny for reasonableness
- Intermediate sanctions rules (IRC § 4958) apply to excess compensation

**Precedent:** Management services organizations are widely used in nonprofit hospital systems (Norton Healthcare, Catholic Health Initiatives, others) where for-profit management companies operate nonprofit hospitals under long-term contracts.⁹⁴

**SEVERITY: MEDIUM** | **ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE VIABILITY: HIGH** | **ESTIMATED RETURN: 9.5% (vs. 1.51% acquisition)**

#### 2. Hybrid Structure: Nonprofit Parent with For-Profit Subsidiaries

**Structure:**
- Midwest University remains 501(c)(3) nonprofit parent
- MU forms for-profit subsidiaries for ancillary services:
  - Housing (dormitories, apartments): $45M revenue
  - Dining services: $32M revenue
  - Bookstore: $18M revenue
  - Online education programs: $25M revenue
- Core academic operations remain at nonprofit parent
- For-profit subsidiaries pay tax but generate higher margins

**Tax Benefits:**
- Partial preservation of tax exemptions (core academics remain exempt)
- Estimated tax savings: $18-22M annually vs. full for-profit conversion

**Complexity:**
- Related-party transfer pricing between parent and subsidiaries
- IRS scrutiny of subsidiary structures for tax avoidance
- UBIT exposure if subsidiaries provide services back to parent

**SEVERITY: MEDIUM** | **VIABILITY: MEDIUM** | **TAX SAVINGS: $18-22M annually**

### H. Five-Year Financial Projection

**Base Case Assumptions:**
- No debt at MU operating company level (holdco debt structure)
- $468M endowment transferred to foundation
- $182M endowment retained at MU
- No business model changes (flat revenue, expenses)
- All tax exemptions lost at closing

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | EBIT | Income Tax | Property Tax | Sales Tax | Net Income | Cumulative Tax |
|------|---------|----------|------|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | $680M | $635M | $45M | $11.66M | $15.6M | $5.95M | $11.79M | $33.2M |
| 2 | $680M | $635M | $45M | $11.66M | $15.6M | $5.95M | $11.79M | $66.4M |
| 3 | $680M | $635M | $45M | $11.66M | $15.6M | $5.95M | $11.79M | $99.6M |
| 4 | $680M | $635M | $45M | $11.66M | $15.6M | $5.95M | $11.79M | $132.8M |
| 5 | $680M | $635M | $45M | $11.66M | $15.6M | $5.95M | $11.79M | $166.0M |

**Five-Year Cumulative Tax Burden: $166 million (21.3% of purchase price)**

**Downside Case (15% Enrollment Decline):**

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | EBIT | Income Tax | Property Tax | Sales Tax | Net Income | Cumulative Tax |
|------|---------|----------|------|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | $578M | $635M | $(57M) | $0 | $15.6M | $5.95M | $(78.55M) | $21.55M |
| 2 | $578M | $620M | $(42M) | $0 | $15.6M | $5.95M | $(63.55M) | $43.1M |
| 3 | $592M | $615M | $(23M) | $0 | $15.6M | $5.95M | $(44.55M) | $64.65M |

Enrollment decline scenarios generate negative EBIT, eliminating income tax but maintaining property and sales tax obligations, accelerating cash burn. A 15% enrollment decline would consume the entire $182M retained endowment within 3-4 years.

*See* Section IV.F.2 at pp. 278-285 and Section XI.B.1 at pp. 118-125 analyzing transaction financial viability; five-year cumulative tax burden of $166M ($33.2M annual × 5 years) combined with $175M debt service (assuming $500M debt at 7% interest) reduces after-tax return on $780M investment to 1.51% annually under no-growth scenario, requiring 20-25% revenue growth or 15-20% expense reduction to achieve private equity return thresholds.

---

**CROSS-SECTION IMPACTS:**

> **TITLE IV FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID:** The $33.2M annual tax burden forces tuition increases to maintain margins, but tuition increases push federal revenue above 90% threshold, risking Title IV suspension and enrollment collapse. Tax burden and 90/10 rule create mutually reinforcing downward spiral.

> **DEBT STRUCTURE:** IRC § 163(j) interest limitation combined with state/local taxes makes institutional-level debt non-viable, mandating holdco debt structure. Even with holdco structure, $11.8M annual return on $780M investment is economically insufficient, requiring business model transformation.

> **ACCREDITATION:** For-profit status conversion may trigger HLC substantive change review and ABA law school change of ownership proceedings. Tax burden forces expense reductions that could compromise faculty qualifications and educational quality, threatening accreditation maintenance.

> **ENDOWMENT LITIGATION:** Donor-restricted endowment funds subject to charitable trust doctrine create $468M litigation exposure if retained by for-profit entity. Indiana Attorney General cy pres enforcement probable unless funds transferred to 501(c)(3) foundation.

> **COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS:** Property tax exemption loss increases facilities operating costs by $15.6M annually, affecting pricing for commercial leases, conference space rentals, and auxiliary services.

### I. Draft Remediation Language

#### Purchase Agreement - Endowment Transfer Provision

**Section 6.12 - Endowment Restructuring**

(a) **Foundation Formation and Transfer.** No later than six (6) months prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall form a new Indiana nonprofit corporation named "Midwest University Educational Foundation" (the "Foundation"), which shall apply for recognition of tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Seller shall cause the Foundation to file Form 1023 with the Internal Revenue Service no later than thirty (30) days following formation of the Foundation.

(b) **Donor-Restricted Funds Transfer.** No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, and conditioned upon the Foundation having received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service recognizing tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3), Seller shall transfer to the Foundation all endowment funds subject to donor-imposed restrictions, estimated to total Four Hundred Sixty-Eight Million Dollars ($468,000,000) (the "Restricted Endowment").

No director shall be an employee or officer of Buyer. The Foundation's articles of incorporation and bylaws shall prohibit amendment of board composition requirements without unanimous board approval.

(e) **Foundation Distribution Requirements.** The Foundation's articles of incorporation shall require that the Foundation make annual distributions of not less than five percent (5%) of the Foundation's net asset value for charitable educational purposes, with priority given to scholarships for students attending Seller and support for Seller's educational programs, provided such distributions comply with all requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 4941-4945 and do not constitute prohibited self-dealing or taxable expenditures.

(f) **Closing Condition.** The obligation of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is conditioned upon (i) successful formation of the Foundation and receipt of IRS determination letter recognizing Section 501(c)(3) status, and (ii) completion of the transfer of the Restricted Endowment to the Foundation no less than ten (10) business days prior to Closing. If such conditions are not satisfied by the Outside Date, Buyer may, at its option, either (A) terminate this Agreement and receive return of the Deposit, or (B) waive such conditions and proceed to Closing with the Restricted Endowment remaining at Seller, in which case Buyer acknowledges and assumes all risks of donor litigation and Indiana Attorney General cy pres proceedings.

**Section 8.15 - Tax Structure Elections**

(a) **Section 338(g) Election.** Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Buyer intends to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Internal Revenue Code to treat the purchase of Seller's stock (or membership interests) as a deemed asset purchase for federal income tax purposes. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in making such election, including execution of Form 8023 (Elections Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases) and any other documents required by the Internal Revenue Service. Seller acknowledges that the deemed asset sale resulting from the Section 338(g) election is intended to occur while Seller maintains tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3), and Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such exempt status through the Closing Date.

(b) **Private Letter Ruling.** Within thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall, at Buyer's expense, file a request for a Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue Service seeking confirmation that: (i) the Section 338(g) election is available for the acquisition of a Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt target; (ii) the deemed asset sale resulting from the Section 338(g) election, if occurring while Seller maintains Section 501(c)(3) status, does not result in taxable gain to Seller; and (iii) Buyer succeeds to Seller's stepped-up tax basis in assets equal to the purchase price plus assumed liabilities. If the Internal Revenue Service issues a Private Letter Ruling adverse to Buyer's requested positions, Buyer may, at its option, terminate this Agreement within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the adverse ruling and receive return of the Deposit.

(c) **Closing Date.** The Closing Date shall be January 1, 20[__], or such other date as the parties may agree in writing. The parties acknowledge that a January 1 Closing Date is intended to create clean calendar-year tax reporting periods and avoid short-year tax complications.

#### Debt Financing - Holdco Structure Term Sheet Provisions

**TERM SHEET FOR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES**

**Borrower:** American Education Holdings LLC (the "Borrower" or "AEH")
**Target:** Midwest University, Inc. (the "Target")

**Structure:** All indebtedness shall be incurred at the Borrower level. Target shall not incur any indebtedness, guarantee any obligations of Borrower, or pledge any assets as security for Borrower's obligations. Borrower shall contribute the full purchase price of $780,000,000 to acquire 100% of the equity of Target, funded by (i) $280,000,000 in equity contributions from Borrower's members and (ii) $500,000,000 in proceeds from the Credit Facilities described herein.

**Target Debt-Free Covenant:** Target shall maintain zero funded debt indebtedness at all times during the term of this Credit Facility. Target may not incur, assume, or guarantee any indebtedness without prior written consent of Required Lenders, which consent may be withheld in Required Lenders' sole discretion. The Target's debt-free status is a material consideration for Lenders' agreement to provide the Credit Facilities, as Target's status as a proprietary educational institution subject to U.S. Department of Education financial responsibility requirements under 34 C.F.R. § 668.171 requires maintenance of a composite score of not less than 1.5, which would be jeopardized by institutional-level debt.

**Rationale:** The debt-free structure at Target level preserves Target's financial responsibility composite score, which would decline from 2.3 (debt-free) to 0.8 or lower if institutional debt were incurred, potentially triggering heightened cash monitoring requirements or loss of Title IV federal financial aid eligibility.

**Upstream Dividends:** Target may pay dividends to Borrower without restriction, provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) Target maintains minimum liquidity of $25,000,000, and (iii) Target's most recent annual audited financial statements reflect positive net income and positive operating cash flow. All dividend payments shall be applied by Borrower first to required debt service under this Credit Facility.

**SECTION SUMMARY**

**Word Count:** 11,847 words
**Footnote Count:** 94 footnotes
**HIGH Severity Findings:** 8

**Key Findings:**
1. Annual tax burden of $33.2M (6,000% increase) consumes 73.5% of pre-tax income
2. Institutional debt creates negative cash flow of $19.7M annually; holdco structure mandatory
3. Endowment liquidation triggers $103.6M one-time tax; bifurcated foundation structure saves $147.6M over 10 years
4. Donor litigation risk on $468M restricted funds; 60-80% probability if retained by for-profit entity
5. Transaction generates 1.51% unlevered return on $780M investment—economically insufficient for private equity
6. Business model transformation targeting 20-25% revenue growth or 15-20% expense reduction required for acceptable returns
7. Indiana Attorney General approval probability only 10-20% without endowment restructuring; 60-75% with foundation transfer
8. Property tax ($15.6M annually) represents single largest tax increase, creating fixed obligation regardless of profitability

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- Mandatory bifurcated endowment structure ($468M to foundation, $182M retained)
- Mandatory holdco debt structure (zero debt at operating company level)
- IRC § 338(g) election with Private Letter Ruling for $8.3M annual depreciation benefit
- January 1 closing date for clean tax year; consider post-March 1 closing for property tax deferral
- MSO alternative structure if acquisition economics prove non-viable
