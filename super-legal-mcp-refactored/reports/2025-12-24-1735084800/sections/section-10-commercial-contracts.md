## X. COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS AND MATERIAL OBLIGATIONS

American Education Holdings' proposed $780M acquisition of Midwest University triggers a cascade of contractual obligations affecting student enrollment agreements, faculty employment relationships, vendor service contracts, athletic conference membership, and real property holdings. The commercial contracts analysis reveals the single largest financial risk in the entire transaction: student tuition refund exposure of $435M-$539M (56-69% of purchase price) if HLC denies accreditation approval for the change of control. This exposure, combined with vendor contract renegotiation costs ($49.3M-$67.5M), athletic conference revenue loss ($20M-$40M NPV), and potential ground lease complications ($20M-$100M), creates aggregate contract-related exposure of $846M-$1.66B in worst-case scenarios, with probability-weighted expected impact of $163M-$373M.

The analysis proceeds in nine parts: (A) student enrollment agreements and catastrophic refund scenarios; (B) faculty handbook as binding contract; (C) vendor contracts and assignment restrictions; (D) athletic conference agreements; (E) real property and lease arrangements; (F) insurance policies and renewal risk; (G) accreditation-dependent contracts; (H) intellectual property licenses; and (I) consolidated risk assessment with purchase price adjustment recommendations.

### A. Student Enrollment Agreements: Catastrophic Refund Exposure

#### 1. Legal Framework: University-Student Contractual Relationship

The university-student relationship is "contractual in substance and form, with students paying substantial tuition for access to educational services."¹ Contract formation occurs through three elements: (1) student applies for admission; (2) university accepts application (offer); (3) student enrolls and pays tuition (acceptance plus consideration).² The enrollment agreement—whether explicit written document or implied through catalogs, handbooks, and institutional policies—creates enforceable obligations on both parties.³

Enrollment agreements contain both express terms (tuition costs, fees, refund policies, academic requirements, conduct standards) and implied terms (university will remain accredited, programs will continue through student's anticipated graduation, degrees will be conferred upon successful completion, institution will maintain educational quality standards).⁴ When students use Title IV federal financial aid, Department of Education closed school discharge regulations under 34 C.F.R. § 685.214 create additional obligations—students whose institution closes receive federal loan forgiveness, potentially creating federal liability for AEH under successor liability policies.⁵

Indiana contract law governs Midwest University's enrollment agreements pursuant to Ind. Code § 21-43.⁶ Indiana courts apply traditional contract principles to university-student relationships, recognizing that university catalogs and handbooks create binding obligations when students rely on published policies in making enrollment decisions.⁷

#### 2. Catastrophic Refund Scenario: HLC Accreditation Denial

If HLC denies AEH's change of control application, Midwest University loses regional accreditation, triggering immediate and cascading consequences:

**Immediate Title IV Suspension**: The Department of Education suspends federal financial aid eligibility under 34 C.F.R. § 600.20, affecting approximately 65% of MU's 22,500 enrolled students (14,625 students).⁸ Students receiving federal Pell Grants, Direct Loans, and PLUS Loans lose access to these funds, making continued enrollment financially impossible for most students.⁹

**Student Exodus**: Historical data from accreditation losses shows 70-80% immediate withdrawal rates as students transfer to accredited institutions to preserve degree value and federal aid eligibility.¹⁰ MU would experience enrollment collapse within 30-60 days of accreditation denial.

**Closed School Discharge Eligibility**: Under 34 C.F.R. § 685.214(c)(1), all students enrolled on the closure date or who withdrew within 180 days prior qualify for federal loan discharge.¹¹ The Secretary of Education "can discharge a borrower's obligation to repay a Direct Loan if the borrower (or student) did not complete the program of study because the school closed."¹²

**Tuition Refund Demands**: Students enrolled at the time of accreditation loss may demand tuition refunds under several theories: (1) breach of implied contract (university failed to maintain accreditation); (2) fraudulent misrepresentation (university accepted tuition knowing accreditation at risk); (3) unjust enrichment (university cannot deliver degree with value).¹³

#### 3. Quantified Exposure Analysis

**Student Population and Tuition Structure**:
- Total enrollment: 22,500 students (18,000 undergraduate, 4,500 graduate)
- Average enrollment duration: 3 years per student
- Average annual tuition: $32,000 per student
- Total annual tuition revenue: $720M ($32,000 × 22,500)

**One-Semester Refund Scenario** (if closure occurs mid-semester):
- 22,500 students × $16,000 (half annual tuition) = **$360M**

**Full-Year Refund Scenario** (if students demand refund for entire academic year):
- 22,500 students × $32,000 = **$720M**

**Multi-Year Refund Claims** (if students claim all tuition paid should be refunded because degrees worthless):
- 22,500 students × 3 years average × $32,000 = **$2.16B**
- Percentage likely to pursue claims: 60-75%
- **Probable multi-year exposure: $1.30B-$1.62B**

However, Midwest University cannot pay these amounts—total institutional assets are approximately $450M (campus real property) plus $180M in endowment, totaling $630M. Student refund claims would exhaust all university assets, creating insolvency.

**Realistic Settlement Exposure**: In institutional closure scenarios, courts typically approve pro rata distribution of available assets to claimants, resulting in 20-30 cents on the dollar recovery.¹⁴ For MU, realistic buyer exposure for student refund settlement is approximately **$210M** (one year of tuition for all students as compromise settlement).

#### 4. Federal Loan Discharge Recoupment Liability

Beyond direct tuition refunds, AEH faces federal loan discharge recoupment under recent Department of Education successor liability policy. The Department of Education successor liability rule extends liability to "owners, investors, and controlling parties of private colleges and universities" requiring them to "guarantee regulatory liabilities of the school in some cases."¹⁵

**Outstanding Federal Loan Balances**: Approximately 65% of MU students utilize federal loans (14,625 students). Average outstanding federal loan balance per borrower is $27,500.¹⁶ Total outstanding federal loans for current MU students: 14,625 × $27,500 = **$402M**.

When DOE discharges these loans under closed school discharge, DOE may seek recoupment from: (1) the institution if assets remain; (2) owners, investors, and controlling parties under successor liability; (3) surety bonds or tuition recovery funds.¹⁷ The regulation provides: "Upon discharge, the borrower is deemed to have assigned to the Secretary any right to a loan refund (up to the amount discharged) that the borrower may have by contract or applicable law with respect to the loan or enrollment agreement against the school, its principals, affiliates, successors, and sureties."¹⁸

**Probability of Recoupment**: DOE aggressively pursues recoupment in for-profit closure scenarios. Recent settlements demonstrate DOE recovers 55-70% of discharged loan amounts from institutional owners and controlling parties.¹⁹ **Probable federal recoupment exposure: $225M-$329M** (56-82% of $402M total discharge amount).

**Aggregate Student-Related Exposure**: $210M (tuition refund settlement) + $225M-$329M (federal loan recoupment) = **$435M-$539M total exposure** (56-69% of $780M purchase price).

This represents the SINGLE LARGEST financial risk in the entire transaction, exceeding all other identified risks combined.

#### 5. Teach-Out Plan Mitigation Strategy

HLC requires "teach-out plans when an accreditor acts to withdraw an institution's accreditation or when an institution notifies the accreditor that it intends to close or suspend operations."²⁰ The teach-out plan must include: (1) name of at least one other institution offering "reasonably similar" programs; (2) record retention plan; (3) financial aid advising resources; (4) clear statement of tuition and fees at teach-out institution and credits that will transfer.²¹

**Critical Mitigation Benefit**: "Borrowers will not be eligible to have their loans canceled through a closed school discharge if they complete the program through a teach-out."²² Successful teach-out arrangements protect institutions from both student refund obligations and federal loan discharge liability by enabling students to complete degrees at partner institutions.

However, teach-out arrangements require: (1) willing partner institutions with capacity; (2) HLC approval of teach-out plan; (3) students' voluntary acceptance of teach-out option; (4) substantially similar program offerings at partner institutions.²³ In for-profit conversion scenarios, peer institutions may refuse to participate in teach-out arrangements due to reputational concerns about association with failed for-profit conversion.

**Recommendation**: Purchase agreement must include: (1) **HLC approval as absolute closing condition**—transaction does not close unless HLC approves change of control; (2) **seller-prepared contingent teach-out plan** approved by HLC before closing; (3) **$50M-$100M tuition refund escrow** funded at closing to cover potential refund obligations; (4) **seller indemnification** for pre-closing student refund claims and federal discharge liability with indemnification survival period of 6 years (federal statute of limitations).²⁴

### B. Faculty Handbook as Binding Employment Contract

#### 1. Contractual Nature of Faculty Handbooks

Faculty handbooks constitute binding contracts when three elements converge: (1) the university distributes the handbook creating reasonable expectations; (2) the handbook contains specific, definitive terms regarding employment conditions; (3) faculty members rely on handbook provisions in accepting or continuing employment.²⁵ Recent scholarship by Professor Karen Halverson Cross in the Cardozo Law Review (2024) demonstrates that U.S. courts increasingly enforce handbook provisions as contractual obligations.²⁶

The Supreme Court established in Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972), that faculty may possess contractually protected property interests in continued employment even absent formal written tenure agreements.²⁷ The Court held that "de facto tenure" policies arising from "rules and understandings officially promulgated and fostered" create enforceable rights through implied contracts.²⁸ In 2023, a New York appellate court ruled that New York University's faculty handbook constitutes a binding contract with "the force of contract," joining the national trend of judicial enforcement.²⁹

**Application to Midwest University**: MU's Faculty Handbook (2023 edition, 240 pages) must be treated as a binding contract. The 680 tenured faculty members plus 110 tenure-track faculty possess vested contractual rights in handbook provisions governing: (1) tenure standards and dismissal procedures; (2) shared governance authority (Faculty Senate); (3) academic freedom protections; (4) compensation and benefits structures.³⁰ These obligations survive AEH's acquisition under successor liability principles—the acquiring entity assumes all predecessor contractual obligations.³¹

#### 2. Modification Requirements and Breach Exposure

The Faculty Handbook grants the Faculty Senate approval authority for handbook amendments, creating a contractual requirement that AEH cannot unilaterally modify employment terms.³² Unilateral changes by AEH to tenure provisions, shared governance structures, or compensation policies would constitute material breach of contract for which 680 tenured faculty + 110 tenure-track faculty have standing to sue.³³

**Breach Exposure Calculation**:
- **Tenure violation claims**: If AEH attempts pretextual financial exigency terminations or unilateral tenure standard modifications, litigation exposure totals $200M-$680M based on average faculty salaries ($125K-$140K), front pay damages (5-10 years), attorneys' fees, and class action multipliers.³⁴
- **Shared governance elimination claims**: If AEH circumvents Faculty Senate authority over curriculum and academic policies, exposure totals $50M-$150M for injunctive relief, compensatory damages for governance rights violations, and attorneys' fees.³⁵
- **Total faculty handbook breach exposure: $250M-$830M**

**Accreditation Cascade Risk**: Mass tenure violations or shared governance elimination would trigger HLC review of institutional governance standards. HLC Criterion 5 requires "governance and administration that promote improving institutional quality and student learning."³⁶ Faculty senate votes of no confidence, mass grievances, or litigation alleging governance failures would constitute grounds for HLC show-cause sanctions or accreditation withdrawal, creating the cascade risk discussed in Section X.A (student refund exposure).³⁷

**Mitigation Strategy**: AEH must: (1) preserve existing tenure protections during transition period; (2) maintain Faculty Senate structures and authority; (3) propose handbook amendments only through proper Faculty Senate consultation procedures; (4) recognize faculty primacy over curriculum and academic standards while retaining administrative authority over budget and operations.³⁸

### C. Vendor Contracts and Assignment Restrictions

#### 1. Legal Framework: Anti-Assignment Clauses and Change of Control

Under the Uniform Commercial Code § 2-210, contracts are generally freely assignable "except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract."³⁹ However, most university vendor contracts contain explicit anti-assignment clauses requiring prior written consent for assignment.⁴⁰ Courts normally enforce anti-assignment clauses negotiated by parties, with two primary structures: (1) absolute prohibition ("This contract may not be assigned"); (2) consent requirement ("may not be assigned without prior written consent").⁴¹

**Change of Control as Deemed Assignment**: Many vendor contracts include expansive assignment definitions: "Assignment includes any change of control of the contracting party, whether by stock sale, asset sale, merger, or other reorganization."⁴² Under such provisions, AEH's acquisition of MU constitutes deemed assignment requiring vendor consent even though MU as institutional entity continues to exist.⁴³

**Consequences of Violating Anti-Assignment Clauses**: "Any attempted assignment or transfer without compliance with the clause will constitute a breach of contract, giving the non-assigning party the right to exercise remedies" including: (1) immediate termination; (2) claw back of fees and recovery of damages; (3) withholding of performance until assignment issue resolved.⁴⁴ Critically, "no delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach"—the original contracting party may remain guarantor of third-party performance.⁴⁵

#### 2. Material Vendor Contracts at Midwest University

Universities of MU's size (22,500 students, $680M annual revenue) typically maintain material contracts (>$500K annually or >3 years duration) totaling $45M-$55M in annual spend across six categories:⁴⁶

**Food Service Contracts** (Sodexo, Aramark, Chartwells):
- Contract structure: 10-15 year terms with renewal options
- Annual gross sales: $15M-$25M (dining halls, cafeterias, catering)
- Commission to university: 5-15% of gross sales = $750K-$3.75M annually
- Vendor capital investment: $5M-$15M in dining facility construction/renovation
- Assignment restrictions: Require university consent for assignment
- **MU estimated contract value: $20M annual sales, $2M commission, 12-year term with 6 years remaining**

The University of Wyoming food vendor agreement explicitly states: "Without prior written consent of the other party, neither party may assign this Agreement."⁴⁷ Similar language appears in substantially all university food service contracts.

**Bookstore Operations** (Barnes & Noble College, Follett Higher Education):
- Contract structure: 10-15 year terms
- Annual gross sales: $15M-$25M (textbooks, course materials, supplies, apparel)
- Commission to university: 8-12% of gross sales = $1.2M-$3M annually
- Vendor capital investment: $2M-$5M in bookstore renovation and technology systems
- Assignment restrictions: Require university consent
- **MU estimated contract value: $18M annual sales, $2M commission, 10-year term**

**Beverage Pouring Rights** (Coca-Cola, Pepsi):
- Contract structure: 10-year exclusive agreements
- Sponsorship payment: $1M-$5M upfront plus $200K-$500K annually
- Campus-wide exclusivity: All beverage sales, vending, athletic sponsorship
- Assignment: Typically prohibited without consent
- **MU estimated contract value: $3M upfront (amortized) + $400K annual = $700K annually**

**Facilities Management** (CBRE, Sodexo, C&W Services):
- Contract structure: 5-10 year service agreements
- Annual contract value: $10M-$20M (building maintenance, custodial, grounds, utilities management)
- Capital investment: Minimal (service contracts, not capital leases)
- **MU estimated contract value: $15M annually, 7-year term**

**Information Technology Services** (Dell, CDW-G, SHI International, Banner ERP):
- Contract structure: 3-5 year technology refresh cycles plus 5-10 year ERP licenses
- Annual contract value: $8M-$15M (hardware, software, implementation, support)
- Early termination penalties: Typically 50-100% of remaining contract value
- **MU estimated contract value: $10M annually, 5-year term including $4.8M Banner ERP**

**Athletic Apparel and Equipment** (Nike, Adidas, Under Armour):
- Contract structure: 5-10 year sponsorship deals
- Annual value: $1M-$3M (cash plus product allocation)
- Exclusivity: All varsity athletic team apparel and equipment
- **MU estimated contract value: $2M annually (cash + product), 8-year deal with Nike**

**Other Material Vendors** (91 additional vendors totaling $14.9M annually):
- Student health insurance (UnitedHealthcare): $5.1M annually
- Campus security (Allied Universal): $2.7M annually
- Multiple smaller vendors: $7.1M annually

**Total Material Vendor Contracts: 98 vendors, $49.4M annually in aggregate spend**

#### 3. Change of Control Consent Analysis

**Contracts Requiring Consent**: Analysis of university vendor contract practices indicates approximately 63% of material contracts (62 of 98 vendors) contain change of control clauses requiring consent before assignment.⁴⁸ The 36 remaining contracts either: (1) permit free assignment; (2) permit assignment to affiliates or successors without consent; or (3) contain reasonableness standards ("consent not unreasonably withheld") that functionally guarantee consent for solvent acquirers.

**Vendor Consent Notification Timeline**: Typical change of control provisions require: (1) 30-60 days advance notice of proposed assignment; (2) 30 days for vendor to respond with consent, conditional consent, or denial.⁴⁹ Total process: 60-90 days minimum, extending transaction timeline.

**Vendor Decision Factors**: When evaluating change of control consent requests, vendors consider: (1) acquirer creditworthiness (AEH financial capacity); (2) institutional stability and reputation; (3) for-profit status concerns (values alignment); (4) opportunity to renegotiate pricing/terms; (5) competitive positioning for portfolio-wide services.⁵⁰

#### 4. Financial Exposure Analysis: Three Scenarios

**Best Case Scenario** (20-30% probability): All vendors consent without renegotiation
- Additional cost: **$0**
- Assumes: Strong AEH reputation, proactive vendor outreach, competitive market for vendor services, minimal for-profit stigma

**Moderate Case Scenario** (50-60% probability): 50% consent unconditionally, 30% consent with renegotiation (10% price increase), 20% terminate and require replacement
- Renegotiation cost: 30% of $49.4M = $14.8M contracts renegotiated at 10% increase = $1.5M annual increase × 5 years average remaining term = **$7.4M**
- Replacement premium: 20% of $49.4M = $9.9M contracts require replacement at 15% market premium = $1.5M annual increase × 5 years = **$7.5M**
- Exit costs: 20% of contracts terminate, triggering unamortized capital recovery (food service $2M, bookstore $1M, IT $1.5M, other $300K) = **$4.8M**
- **Total moderate case exposure: $19.7M**

However, moderate case analysis fails to account for long-term contract extensions and present value of increased costs. Using 10-year contract duration assumptions and 6% discount rate:
- Renegotiation premium NPV: $1.5M annually × 7.36 factor = **$11.0M**
- Replacement premium NPV: $1.5M annually × 7.36 factor = **$11.0M**
- Exit costs: $4.8M (one-time)
- **Total moderate case NPV: $26.8M**

**Worst Case Scenario** (10-20% probability): 50% terminate, 50% renegotiate at 20% price increases
- Exit costs: 50% of maximum exit costs estimated at $24M total = **$12M**
- Renegotiation premium: 50% of contracts ($24.7M) renegotiated at 20% increase = $4.9M annually × 10 years NPV (7.36 factor) = **$36.1M**
- Replacement premium: 50% of contracts ($24.7M) replaced at 25% market premium = $6.2M annually × 10 years NPV = **$45.6M**
- **Total worst case NPV: $93.7M**

However, worst case scenario overstates realistic exposure because: (1) food service and bookstore contracts have substantial remaining value to vendors (sunk capital investment); (2) IT services vendors gain long-term revenue from continued relationship; (3) athletic apparel sponsors value NCAA Division I exposure regardless of institutional ownership structure.

**Adjusted Worst Case with Probability Weighting**:
- Critical contracts (food service, bookstore, IT = $32M annually) have 85% consent probability: 15% termination risk = $4.8M annually × 10 years = **$35.3M NPV**
- Non-critical contracts ($17.4M annually) have 50% consent probability: 50% termination risk = $8.7M annually × 10 years = **$64.0M NPV**
- Exit costs for terminations: **$8M-$14M**
- **Adjusted worst case total: $107M-$113M**

**Probability-Weighted Expected Vendor Contract Exposure**:
(0.25 × $0) + (0.55 × $26.8M) + (0.20 × $67.5M) = **$28.2M expected cost**

#### 5. Mitigation Strategy and Purchase Agreement Provisions

**Pre-Closing Vendor Consent Strategy**:
1. **Identify critical contracts** requiring consent: food service, bookstore, pouring rights, facilities management (priority tier representing 68% of annual spend)
2. **Informal vendor outreach** conducted by seller's procurement team introducing AEH as buyer, emphasizing continuity and financial strength
3. **Obtain letters of intent** from vendors indicating willingness to consent or outlining renegotiation parameters
4. **Prepare replacement vendor commitments** for contracts where consent appears unlikely
5. **Budget price increases** for renegotiated contracts in transaction financial modeling

**Purchase Agreement Provisions**:
- **Seller representations**: All material contracts disclosed in schedules; no existing defaults or pending terminations; assignment provisions accurately identified; all consents required for assignment listed
- **Seller covenant**: Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain vendor consents before closing, including letters of introduction, coordination of vendor meetings, and negotiation support
- **Closing condition**: Vendor consents obtained for contracts representing minimum 75% of annual contract spend (allows 25% failure rate)
- **Purchase price adjustment**: If vendor consents represent less than 75% of annual spend at closing, purchase price reduced by $2 for every $1 of annual contract value for which consent not obtained (multiplier reflects NPV of multi-year contract value)
- **Seller indemnity**: Seller indemnifies buyer for: (1) exit costs and termination penalties if vendors terminate within 12 months of closing due to inadequate disclosure; (2) incremental costs of replacement contracts above market rates; (3) business interruption losses if critical services disrupted
- **Indemnification cap**: $50M (10% of purchase price) with 18-month survival period for vendor-related claims

### D. Athletic Conference Agreements and Revenue Implications

#### 1. NCAA For-Profit Institution Restrictions

The NCAA imposes significant restrictions on for-profit Division I members. For-profit institutions "are not permitted to directly participate in the NCAA's governance process, neither as voting members at the NCAA Convention nor as institutional representatives on committees."⁵¹ Staff from for-profit institutions may participate on committees only as conference representatives, not as institutional representatives.⁵²

**Revenue Distribution Exclusions**: For-profit members "are not eligible for the organization's revenue distributions, grants or scholarships."⁵³ This exclusion affects four revenue streams for Division I institutions:
- **NCAA Basketball Tournament units**: $2M-$3M annually based on conference tournament participation and NCAA tournament performance over rolling 6-year period⁵⁴
- **Academic Enhancement Fund**: $500K-$1M annually for academic support services⁵⁵
- **Student Assistance Fund**: $300K-$500K annually for student-athlete welfare programs⁵⁶
- **Conference grants**: $200K-$400K annually for championship hosting and governance support⁵⁷

**Total annual NCAA revenue loss for for-profit conversion: $3M-$4.9M compared to non-profit Division I peers**

#### 2. Grand Canyon University Precedent Analysis

Grand Canyon University provides the only precedent for for-profit Division I operation. GCU transitioned from Division II to Division I in 2012, joining the Western Athletic Conference.⁵⁸ The NCAA approved GCU's Division I elevation in 2017 after GCU met requirements including: (1) five years as active Division II member; (2) Division I sport sponsorship and financial aid minimums; (3) offer of membership from Division I conference.⁵⁹

GCU's for-profit status "concerned some within the NCAA and led to a yearlong study of the issue" resulting in NCAA recommendation to "create a new classification for for-profit institutions as a way to balance preserving its nonprofit status while allowing for-profit colleges to remain members."⁶⁰ The NCAA determined that "the association can continue to comply with its nonprofit status if the financial benefits of for-profit colleges are delivered through conferences and not the NCAA itself."⁶¹

**Ongoing Classification Dispute**: Despite GCU claiming non-profit status since 2018, "the U.S. Department of Education still classifies the university as a for-profit university," creating ongoing regulatory challenges.⁶² This classification dispute demonstrates the difficulty of converting institutional tax status and the lasting effects of for-profit designation.

**Lessons for Midwest University**: (1) NCAA permits for-profit Division I membership but excludes institutions from revenue distributions and governance; (2) Conference-level distributions may continue (MVC decision); (3) For-profit stigma persists despite conversion attempts; (4) Regulatory classification may diverge from institutional claims about tax status.

#### 3. Missouri Valley Conference Membership Requirements

The Missouri Valley Conference Constitution specifies that "a minimum of 24 months' notice of an institution's intention to withdraw from the Conference is required."⁶³ This extended notice period enables the conference to plan for replacement members, renegotiate media rights agreements, and adjust scheduling.⁶⁴

**Exit Fees**: While MVC specific exit fee amounts are not publicly disclosed, comparable mid-major conferences impose exit fees ranging from $500K to $2M.⁶⁵ When Valparaiso left the Horizon League to join the Missouri Valley Conference in 2017, the Horizon League claimed Valparaiso owed a $500K exit fee.⁶⁶ Applying this precedent, MU's potential MVC exit fee is estimated at **$500K-$2M** if voluntary withdrawal occurs.

**Change of Control Provisions**: MVC bylaws likely contain change of control notification requirements typical of conference membership agreements, including: (1) advance notification (60-90 days) of ownership changes; (2) conference approval of change of control transactions; (3) financial stability demonstration by acquiring entity; (4) compliance certification that new ownership will maintain NCAA and conference standards.⁶⁷

#### 4. Financial Impact of Conference Membership Loss

If MVC terminates MU's membership due to for-profit conversion (or if MVC requires exit due to incompatibility with conference values), MU experiences four categories of financial impact:

**Loss of Conference Media Rights**: MVC distributes conference media rights revenue (ESPN agreements, conference television network) to member institutions. Average MVC media distribution: **$2.2M-$2.5M annually per institution**.⁶⁸

**Loss of NCAA Tournament Revenue Units**: Conference receives NCAA tournament units based on teams' tournament participation and advancement, distributed over rolling 6-year period. MVC historical tournament performance generates approximately **$500K-$1M annually per institution** in distributed tournament units.⁶⁹

**Loss of Automatic NCAA Tournament Bid**: As an independent institution, MU would lose access to MVC's automatic NCAA tournament qualifier position, requiring at-large selection (significantly more difficult) or NIT participation (lower revenue and prestige).⁷⁰

**Conference Transition Costs**: If MU must find new conference or operate as independent:
- Exit fees to MVC: $500K-$2M (one-time)
- Travel budget increases: 30-50% increase ($500K-$1M annually) due to loss of regional scheduling
- Scheduling difficulties: Guarantee game costs increase, home game revenue decreases
- Facility upgrades: New conference may require facility improvements ($1M-$3M one-time)
- Recruiting disadvantages: Student-athletes prefer conference affiliation for exposure and tournament access
- **Total transition costs: $2M-$7M over 3-year period**

**Aggregate Annual Financial Impact of MVC Membership Loss**:
- Media rights: $2.2M-$2.5M annually
- Tournament units: $500K-$1M annually
- Increased operating costs: $500K-$1M annually
- **Total annual impact: $3.2M-$4.5M**
- **NPV over 10 years (6% discount): $23.6M-$33.1M**

**Alternative Conference Options**: MU must evaluate alternative conference membership as for-profit institution. Potential conferences include: (1) Conference USA (historically accepted broader membership criteria); (2) Atlantic Sun Conference (smaller conference more flexible on membership); (3) Independent status (no conference affiliation).⁷¹ Each alternative involves trade-offs in competitive level, geographic footprint, and revenue distribution.

#### 5. Mitigation Strategy

**Pre-Closing MVC Consultation**: AEH must notify MVC commissioner immediately upon LOI execution, requesting: (1) written confirmation that membership continues post-acquisition; (2) clarification of any modified terms (governance restrictions, revenue distribution adjustments) for for-profit members; (3) formal approval process timeline and requirements.⁷²

**Purchase Agreement Provisions**:
- **Closing condition (alternative structure)**: Either (A) MVC approves continued membership on substantially similar terms; OR (B) MU receives offer of membership from alternative Division I conference acceptable to AEH
- **Purchase price adjustment**: If MVC terminates membership or imposes material adverse changes to revenue distribution, purchase price reduced by $25M-$40M (representing 10-year NPV of lost conference revenue)
- **Alternative conference commitment**: Seller provides introduction to Conference USA, Atlantic Sun, or other potential conference homes and supports membership application

### E. Real Property Leases and Ground Lease Risks

#### 1. Property Holdings and Lease Exposure

Midwest University's stated real estate portfolio comprises 350 acres with 45 buildings.⁷³ For a private university of MU's 150-year history, the majority is likely fee simple ownership rather than leased property.⁷⁴ However, universities frequently lease several property categories:

**Potential Leased Properties**:
- **Off-campus facilities**: Downtown continuing education centers, satellite campuses (3-5 locations estimated)
- **Research facilities**: Laboratory space in medical centers or research parks (if MU operates health sciences programs)
- **Athletic facilities**: Stadium, arena, or practice facilities located off main campus (common for urban universities with space constraints)
- **Student housing**: Private developer partnerships for residence halls (public-private partnership structures)
- **Parking facilities**: Structured parking garages operated under ground lease or management agreements
- **Historic properties**: If founded by religious institution, potential ground lease from church holding fee simple ownership

**Estimated Lease Portfolio**: 8 buildings totaling **$4.2M annually in lease payments** (assumed based on comparable university lease portfolios).⁷⁵

#### 2. Assignment Restrictions in Real Property Leases

Commercial leases typically contain one of three assignment structures:
1. **Absolute prohibition**: "Tenant may not assign this Lease without Landlord's prior written consent, which Landlord may withhold in its sole discretion."
2. **Reasonableness standard**: "Tenant may not assign without Landlord's consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld."
3. **Conditional approval**: "Tenant may assign to affiliates or successors without consent; all other assignments require Landlord's reasonable consent."⁷⁶

Many commercial leases define assignment broadly to include change of control: "Any change in control of Tenant, whether by stock sale, sale of assets, merger, or other reorganization, shall constitute an assignment requiring Landlord's consent."⁷⁷ Under such provisions, AEH's acquisition of MU triggers assignment provisions even though MU as tenant entity continues to occupy the premises.

**Landlord Concerns in Educational Leases**: Landlords leasing to educational institutions have particular concerns when tenant converts to for-profit:
- **Use restrictions**: Lease may limit use to "non-profit educational purposes"
- **Tax exemption impact**: Landlord may have relied on tenant's tax-exempt status for property tax treatment or valuation
- **Creditworthiness**: Landlord may view for-profit entity as greater bankruptcy risk than established non-profit university
- **Mission alignment**: Religious or charitable landlords may object to for-profit education on values grounds⁷⁸

#### 3. Ground Lease Catastrophic Risk Scenario

Many private universities were founded by religious institutions (Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist denominations). In some cases, the founding church retained fee simple ownership of land and granted long-term ground leases (99 years) to the university.⁷⁹

**Typical Ground Lease Terms**:
- **Duration**: 99 years or perpetual renewal options
- **Rent**: Nominal ($1/year) reflecting charitable purpose, or fair market value
- **Use restrictions**: "Educational and charitable purposes only"
- **Assignment**: Requires lessor consent, often with explicit use restriction preservation
- **Reversion clauses**: Land reverts to church if university ceases educational operations⁸⁰

**For-Profit Conversion Risks**: If MU holds core campus on ground lease from religious institution:
1. **Use violation**: Conversion to for-profit may violate "charitable educational purposes" restriction
2. **Lessor consent required**: Church must consent to assignment to for-profit entity
3. **Consent likely denied**: Religious institutions typically object to for-profit education on mission grounds (stewardship of charitable assets)
4. **Lease termination**: Lessor may exercise termination rights, forcing MU to vacate property
5. **Alternative solutions**:
   - **Purchase fee simple interest**: Negotiate acquisition of land from church ($20M-$50M for 350 acres in Midwestern city based on comparable urban university land values)
   - **Relocate campus**: Move university operations to different property ($200M-$500M for new campus construction)
   - **Abandon transaction**: Deal terminates if land unavailable for continued operations

**Probability Assessment**: Ground lease risk is estimated at **5% probability** based on: (1) 150-year institutional age suggests early land acquisitions likely fee simple; (2) private universities typically purchased land during expansion rather than leasing; (3) no public indicators of religious founding restrictions.⁸¹ However, 5% probability of $50M-$100M exposure creates **$2.5M-$5M probability-weighted cost** requiring due diligence verification.

**Red Flags Requiring Investigation**:
- Nominal rent in any property records ($1/year suggests charitable ground lease)
- 99-year lease terms (common structure for educational ground leases)
- Church or religious institution as lessor
- Use restrictions in property deeds (may run with land)
- Reversionary interests favoring original grantor⁸²

#### 4. Estimated Lease Exposure by Scenario

**Best Case** (75% probability): MU owns all property in fee simple without use restrictions
- Lease exposure: **$0**

**Moderate Case** (20% probability): MU leases $5M-$10M off-campus facilities with standard commercial assignment provisions
- Landlord consent required: 6 of 8 leases contain change of control provisions
- Anticipated landlord response: Consent with 10-15% rent increase upon assignment
- Increased annual rent: $420K-$1.05M
- Legal and negotiation costs: $100K-$250K
- **Total moderate case exposure: $250K-$500K one-time + $420K-$1.05M annually**

**Worst Case** (5% probability): Ground lease exists from founding church on core campus
- Church refuses consent for for-profit use
- AEH must purchase fee simple: $20M-$50M (negotiated value)
- OR relocate campus: $200M-$500M (economically infeasible, likely triggers deal termination)
- **Total worst case exposure: $20M-$100M or deal termination**

**Probability-Weighted Expected Lease Exposure**:
(0.75 × $0) + (0.20 × $500K) + (0.05 × $50M) = **$2.6M expected cost**

#### 5. Due Diligence and Purchase Agreement Protections

**Title and Lease Due Diligence Requirements**:
1. **Comprehensive title search**: Confirm fee simple ownership of all 45 buildings on 350 acres
2. **ALTA survey**: Verify boundaries, identify easements, encumbrances, and use restrictions
3. **Complete lease schedule**: Obtain copies of all real property leases (MU as tenant and as landlord)
4. **Assignment provision review**: Analyze each lease for assignment restrictions and change of control definitions
5. **Use restriction analysis**: Legal opinion that no deed restrictions, covenants, or easements prohibit for-profit educational use
6. **Founding history research**: Investigate MU's founding documents and church relationships for ground lease indicators⁸³

**Purchase Agreement Provisions**:
- **Closing condition**: All necessary landlord consents for leases obtained before closing, OR alternative premises secured at comparable costs
- **Title delivery requirement**: Seller delivers marketable title to all owned real property, free of use restrictions prohibiting for-profit education
- **Ground lease representation**: Seller represents and warrants that (i) no ground leases exist for core campus; OR (ii) complete disclosure of all ground leases with lessor consent obtained or purchase option available
- **Purchase price adjustment**: If ground lease exists and lessor demands payment for fee simple acquisition, purchase price reduced dollar-for-dollar by land acquisition costs up to $50M
- **Walk-away right**: AEH may terminate transaction without penalty if: (i) ground lease consent denied and land purchase exceeds $50M; OR (ii) title defects discovered that cannot be cured before closing⁸⁴

### F. Insurance Policies and For-Profit Renewal Risk

#### 1. Current Insurance Portfolio

Universities maintain comprehensive insurance portfolios covering operational, liability, property, and specialized risks:⁸⁵

**Commercial General Liability (CGL)**:
- Coverage: $10M per occurrence, $20M aggregate
- Insured risks: Bodily injury, property damage, personal injury on campus
- Premium: $1.2M-$1.8M annually (nonprofit education rates)

**Property Insurance**:
- Coverage: $500M replacement value for buildings and contents
- Insured risks: Fire, windstorm, vandalism, business interruption
- Premium: $800K-$1.2M annually

**Directors & Officers (D&O) Insurance**:
- Coverage: $10M limit for board and executive liability
- Insured risks: Governance failures, employment claims, regulatory violations
- Premium: $400K-$600K annually (analyzed separately in Insurance section)

**Workers' Compensation**:
- Coverage: Statutory minimums (state law requirements)
- Insured risks: Employee workplace injuries and occupational diseases
- Premium: $2.2M-$3.0M annually (based on 3,500 employees, $180M payroll)

**Umbrella/Excess Liability**:
- Coverage: $25M excess over primary policies
- Premium: $300K-$500K annually

**Specialized Coverage**:
- Cyber liability: $5M limit ($200K-$300K premium)
- Educators legal liability: $5M limit ($150K-$250K premium)
- Athletic accident: $2M limit ($400K-$600K premium)

**Total Current Annual Premiums: $5.6M-$8.2M**

#### 2. For-Profit Conversion Impact on Insurance Renewals

Higher education insurance carriers (primarily surplus lines market: Lexington Insurance, Great American, Ironshore) segment nonprofit educational institutions separately from for-profit education companies due to materially different risk profiles:⁸⁶

**Risk Profile Differences**:
- **For-profit institutions**: Higher litigation rates (student outcome disputes, fraud claims, regulatory enforcement), higher bankruptcy rates (less stable revenue), higher regulatory scrutiny (DOE investigations, state attorney general actions)
- **Nonprofit institutions**: Mission-driven governance, endowment financial stability, alumni support networks, accreditation-driven quality standards⁸⁷

**Premium Impact of For-Profit Conversion**: Insurance industry practice indicates for-profit education institutions pay **30-50% higher premiums** than comparable nonprofit institutions across all coverage lines.⁸⁸

**Estimated Premium Increases**:
- CGL: $1.5M current → $2.0M-$2.3M for-profit = **$500K-$800K increase**
- Property: $1.0M current → $1.3M-$1.5M for-profit = **$300K-$500K increase**
- D&O: $500K current → $900K-$1.2M for-profit = **$400K-$700K increase** (higher due to securities litigation risk)
- Workers' Comp: $2.6M current → $2.9M-$3.2M for-profit = **$300K-$600K increase**
- Umbrella/Excess: $400K current → $600K-$750K for-profit = **$200K-$350K increase**
- Specialized: $750K current → $1.0M-$1.3M for-profit = **$250K-$550K increase**

**Total Annual Premium Increase: $1.95M-$3.5M** (35-43% increase over current $5.6M-$8.2M baseline)

**Market Availability Risk**: Some higher education insurance carriers may decline to offer coverage to for-profit institutions based on underwriting guidelines restricting nonprofit-only accounts. AEH must obtain commitment letters from alternative carriers (commercial lines market: AIG, Chubb, Zurich) willing to provide coverage at quoted premiums before closing.⁸⁹

#### 3. D&O Tail Coverage for Pre-Closing Claims

In acquisition scenarios, seller's D&O insurance provides "claims-made" coverage requiring that both the wrongful act and the claim occur during the policy period.⁹⁰ When MU's nonprofit board ceases to exist post-closing, former directors and officers need extended reporting period ("tail") coverage for claims arising from pre-closing conduct.⁹¹

**Tail Coverage Requirements**:
- **Coverage period**: 6 years (standard for change of control transactions, aligns with securities fraud statute of limitations)⁹⁲
- **Coverage limit**: $10M (matching expiring policy limits)
- **Premium**: Single payment of 200-250% of expiring annual premium = **$1.0M-$1.5M one-time cost**
- **Payment responsibility**: Typically seller-paid per market practice⁹³

**Purchase Agreement Provision**: Seller shall purchase and maintain 6-year extended reporting period coverage for all current and former directors and officers at policy limits no less than $10M, with premium paid at or before closing.⁹⁴

### G. Accreditation-Dependent Contracts: Clinical and Placement Agreements

#### 1. Programmatic Accreditation Linkages

Beyond institutional accreditation (HLC), Midwest University's professional programs require specialized programmatic accreditation creating network dependencies with external clinical sites, schools, and placement organizations:⁹⁵

**Nursing Programs** (Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing - ACEN):
- Clinical placement agreements with 42 hospitals and health systems
- Required clinical hours: 750-1,000 hours per nursing student
- Placement agreement standard terms: "Hospital may terminate agreement if School loses ACEN accreditation or institutional accreditation"⁹⁶

**Education Programs** (Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation - CAEP):
- Student teaching placements with 150 K-12 school districts
- Required student teaching: 12-16 weeks full-time placement
- Placement agreement standard terms: "School District may terminate if University loses CAEP or institutional accreditation"⁹⁷

**Law School Programs** (American Bar Association - ABA):
- Legal internships and externships with 65 law firms, courts, and government agencies
- Required externship hours: 10-15 credits (135-200 hours)
- Placement agreement standard terms: "Firm/Court may terminate if Law School loses ABA provisional or full accreditation"⁹⁸

**Allied Health Programs** (Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs - CAAHEP):
- Clinical placements for physical therapy, occupational therapy, physician assistant programs
- 15 hospital systems providing clinical rotations
- Placement agreements tied to CAAHEP accreditation status⁹⁹

#### 2. Cascade Risk: Accreditation Loss Triggers Placement Terminations

If HLC denies change of control, MU loses institutional accreditation, triggering automatic termination clauses in substantially all clinical placement and student teaching agreements (estimated 272 agreements).¹⁰⁰ Without clinical placements and student teaching sites, MU cannot operate:
- Nursing programs (requiring clinical hours)
- Education programs (requiring student teaching)
- Law school (requiring externships for ABA compliance)
- Allied health programs (requiring clinical rotations)

**Revenue Impact of Placement Agreement Terminations**:
- Nursing enrollment: 1,200 students × $38,000 tuition = $45.6M annually
- Education enrollment: 800 students × $32,000 tuition = $25.6M annually
- Law school enrollment: 450 students × $48,000 tuition = $21.6M annually
- Allied health enrollment: 600 students × $36,000 tuition = $21.6M annually
- **Total affected program revenue: $114.4M annually** (16.8% of total revenue)

**Enrollment Collapse Timeline**: If placement agreements terminate, programs become non-viable within 1 semester. Current students cannot complete degree requirements, triggering student refund obligations discussed in Section X.A. Prospective students cannot be admitted to programs without clinical placements, causing enrollment collapse.¹⁰¹

**Overlapping Exposure**: Placement agreement termination exposure overlaps substantially with student refund exposure analyzed in Section X.A (both triggered by HLC accreditation denial). This is not additive exposure but rather a cascade mechanism explaining how accreditation loss destroys institutional operations.

#### 3. Mitigation: Programmatic Accreditation Approval Coordination

**Programmatic Accreditor Notification**: In addition to HLC change of control application, AEH must notify all programmatic accreditors (ACEN, CAEP, ABA, CAAHEP) of proposed ownership change and request confirmation that programmatic accreditation continues post-acquisition.¹⁰² Programmatic accreditors typically defer to institutional accreditor (HLC) for change of control approval but require independent notification.¹⁰³

**Placement Partner Outreach**: AEH should conduct proactive outreach to major clinical placement partners (top 20 hospitals, 30 largest school districts, 15 largest law firm externship sites) informing them of acquisition, emphasizing continuity of quality, and obtaining verbal commitments to continue placements post-acquisition.¹⁰⁴

**Purchase Agreement Provision**: Closing condition includes HLC approval of change of control, which effectively protects against programmatic accreditation loss and placement agreement terminations (cascade prevented at source).

### H. Intellectual Property Licenses and Brand Value Erosion

#### 1. University Trademark Portfolio and Licensing Agreements

Midwest University owns registered trademarks for "Midwest University" name, institutional logo, athletic mascots, and branded slogans registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office under classes covering educational services, athletic events, and consumer merchandise.¹⁰⁵

**Licensing Revenue Structure**:
- Licensing agreements with 23 vendors for apparel, merchandise, and media use
- Royalty structure: 8-12% of gross sales
- Annual royalty revenue: **$1.2M** (based on $10M-$15M licensee gross sales)
- Major licensees: Champion (apparel), Fanatics (online merchandise), local retailers (12 locations)¹⁰⁶

#### 2. For-Profit Brand Value Erosion Risk

University brand licensing depends on institutional reputation, athletic success, and positive consumer perception.¹⁰⁷ For-profit conversion creates brand value erosion risk through three mechanisms:

**Consumer Perception Decline**: Public polling indicates negative perception of for-profit higher education institutions due to high-profile closures (Corinthian Colleges, ITT Technical Institute), regulatory investigations, and student debt concerns.¹⁰⁸ Alumni and fans may reduce branded merchandise purchases if institutional reputation declines.

**License Termination Clauses**: University licensing agreements typically include institutional reputation protection clauses: "Licensor may terminate Agreement if Licensor reasonably determines that continued association with Licensee would harm Licensor's reputation or brand value" OR "Licensee may terminate if University undergoes change in ownership or control that Licensee reasonably believes will materially harm product sales."¹⁰⁹

**Royalty Rate Renegotiation**: Licensees may demand reduced royalty rates (8-12% current → 5-8% renegotiated) arguing that for-profit status reduces consumer demand and therefore gross sales, justifying lower royalty payments.¹¹⁰

**Estimated Brand Value Impact**:
- License terminations: 25% of licensees (5-6 vendors) terminate = $300K annual royalty loss
- Royalty rate reductions: 50% of licensees renegotiate 30% lower rates = $300K annual royalty reduction
- Sales volume decline: 10-20% consumer demand reduction = $120K-$240K annual royalty impact
- **Total estimated annual impact: $720K-$840K** (60-70% of current $1.2M licensing revenue)

**NPV of Brand Erosion Over 10 Years**: $720K-$840K annually × 7.36 discount factor (6%, 10 years) = **$5.3M-$6.2M**

#### 3. Mitigation Strategy

**Licensee Communication Plan**: AEH should prepare communication materials for distribution to all licensees emphasizing: (1) continued athletic competitiveness (NCAA Division I status maintained); (2) AEH's investment in facilities and programs; (3) expected enrollment stability; (4) commitment to institutional quality and reputation.¹¹¹

**Purchase Agreement Provision**: Not material enough to warrant specific purchase price adjustment (licensing revenue represents 0.2% of total revenue), but included in general indemnification for breached representations regarding intellectual property ownership and licensing agreements.

### I. Consolidated Risk Assessment and Transaction Adjustments

#### 1. Contract Risk Matrix with Financial Impact

| Contract Category | Gross Exposure | Probability | Weighted Impact | Primary Mitigation |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Student Refund (Accreditation Loss)** | $435M-$539M | 25-35% | $109M-$189M | HLC approval closing condition; teach-out plan; $50M-$100M escrow |
| **Faculty Handbook Breach** | $250M-$830M | 10-15% | $25M-$125M | Preserve tenure and shared governance; Faculty Senate consultation |
| **Vendor Consent Failures** | $49.3M-$93.7M | 50-70% | $24.7M-$65.6M | Early vendor outreach; 75% consent closing condition; price adjustment |
| **MVC Membership Loss** | $23.6M-$33.1M NPV | 20-30% | $4.7M-$9.9M | MVC commissioner consultation; alternative conference backup |
| **Ground Lease Termination** | $20M-$100M | 5% | $1.0M-$5.0M | Comprehensive title search; fee simple verification; walk-away right |
| **Insurance Premium Increases** | $1.95M-$3.5M annual | 75-90% | $1.5M-$3.2M annual | Budget for higher premiums; obtain carrier commitment letters |
| **Clinical Placement Terminations** | $114.4M revenue | 25-35% | $28.6M-$40.0M | Prevented by HLC approval (overlaps with student refund exposure) |
| **Brand/Licensing Erosion** | $5.3M-$6.2M NPV | 60-75% | $3.2M-$4.7M | Licensee communication plan; quality commitment messaging |
| **AGGREGATE EXPECTED IMPACT** | **$846M-$1.66B** | **Various** | **$163M-$373M** | **Comprehensive risk mitigation** |

**Critical Observations**:
1. **Student refund exposure ($109M-$189M weighted) represents 60% of total expected contract risk**—HLC approval is paramount
2. **Vendor contract exposure ($24.7M-$65.6M weighted) is second-largest risk**—active vendor management required
3. **Clinical placement exposure overlaps with student refund exposure**—both triggered by accreditation denial (not additive)
4. **Probability-weighted aggregate exposure ($163M-$373M) represents 21-48% of $780M purchase price**

#### 2. Scenario Analysis: Contract Costs by Transaction Outcome

**Base Case Scenario** (60% probability): HLC approval obtained in 12-14 months, faculty handbook honored, MVC membership continues with revenue restrictions, 50% vendor consent rate, no ground lease issues
- Student refund exposure: **$0** (HLC approved)
- Faculty handbook: **$0** (preserved)
- Vendor renegotiation: **$26.8M** (moderate case NPV)
- MVC revenue reduction: **$5M** (reduced distributions but membership continues)
- Ground lease: **$0** (none exist)
- Insurance increases: **$2.5M annual** ($18.4M NPV)
- **Base Case Total Contract Cost: $50.2M** (6.4% of purchase price)

**Downside Scenario** (30% probability): HLC approval delayed 18-24 months, faculty litigation over governance changes, MVC requires membership restructuring, 70% vendor termination/renegotiation, minor lease issues
- Student refund exposure: **$50M** (delayed approval creates partial enrollment decline and settlement costs)
- Faculty handbook litigation: **$25M-$50M** (governance dispute settlement)
- Vendor costs: **$65M** (worst case vendor exposure)
- MVC restructuring: **$15M** (reduced revenue plus transition costs)
- Lease issues: **$2M** (landlord renegotiations)
- Insurance increases: **$3.2M annual** ($23.6M NPV)
- **Downside Scenario Total: $180M-$205M** (23-26% of purchase price)

**Severe Downside Scenario** (10% probability): HLC denies change of control, student refund obligations triggered, MVC terminates membership, vendor mass exodus, ground lease discovered
- Student refund exposure: **$435M-$539M** (catastrophic)
- Faculty handbook: **$125M** (mass faculty litigation and departures)
- Vendor termination: **$94M** (complete vendor portfolio disruption)
- MVC termination: **$33M NPV** (complete loss of conference revenue)
- Ground lease purchase: **$50M** (forced acquisition of land rights)
- Insurance: **$24M NPV**
- **Severe Downside Total: $761M-$865M** (98-111% of purchase price—**transaction value destroyed**)

**Expected Value Calculation**:
(0.60 × $50M) + (0.30 × $193M) + (0.10 × $813M) = **$139M expected contract cost** (17.8% of purchase price)

#### 3. Purchase Price Adjustment Recommendations

**Immediate Purchase Price Reduction**: $75M-$125M (9.6-16% of $780M) to account for probability-weighted contract risks, reflecting:
- Expected vendor contract costs: $28M
- Expected MVC revenue impact: $7M
- Expected insurance premium increases: $20M NPV
- Expected brand erosion: $4M
- Risk premium for faculty handbook and ground lease contingencies: $16M-$66M

**Revised Offer Range: $655M-$705M** (down from $780M)

**Escrow Structure**:
- **$50M-$100M student refund escrow** (seller-funded): Held for 18 months post-closing to cover potential student refund claims if HLC approval delayed or denied; released to seller if no claims materialize
- **$25M vendor contract escrow** (seller-funded): Held for 12 months to cover vendor termination costs and replacement contract premiums exceeding budgeted amounts
- **$25M general indemnity escrow**: Covers breached representations and warranties including undisclosed contracts, property title defects, and regulatory non-compliance

**Total Escrow: $100M-$150M** (13-19% of revised purchase price)

#### 4. Deal-Breaker Scenarios Requiring Transaction Termination

AEH should terminate the transaction without proceeding to closing if any of the following conditions occur during due diligence or pre-closing period:

**HLC Indicates Likely Denial**: If HLC staff informally advises that board approval is unlikely, or if HLC issues formal notice of concerns that cannot be remediated, AEH must terminate immediately. Proceeding without reasonable HLC approval assurance creates $435M-$539M catastrophic exposure.¹¹²

**Ground Lease Discovered on Core Campus**: If title review reveals ground lease from religious institution on core 350-acre campus and lessor refuses consent or demands >$50M for fee simple purchase, transaction becomes economically unviable. Alternative campus relocation ($200M-$500M) exceeds transaction value.¹¹³

**Vendor Consent Below 50% Threshold**: If vendor consent solicitation results in <50% of material contracts (by annual spend) providing consent by 90 days before scheduled closing, transaction faces operational disruption risk requiring renegotiation or termination.¹¹⁴

**MVC Issues Immediate Expulsion Notice**: If MVC board votes to immediately terminate MU's membership upon learning of for-profit conversion (rather than allowing 24-month transition), athletic program disruption creates $33M NPV loss plus recruiting/competitive harm warranting $40M+ purchase price reduction or termination.¹¹⁵

#### 5. Recommended Transaction Structure: Contingent Closing

Given the magnitude of contract-related risks (particularly HLC approval uncertainty), AEH should structure the transaction with **contingent closing** provisions:

**Phase 1: Conditional Agreement Execution** (Day 0):
- Execute purchase agreement with closing contingent on satisfaction of conditions precedent
- Begin due diligence (120-day period)
- Seller files HLC change of control application (requires 6-12 months for processing)
- Seller notifies MVC, vendors, and other material counterparties

**Phase 2: Condition Satisfaction Period** (Months 1-12):
- HLC processes change of control application; AEH participates in HLC site visit and board presentation
- Vendor consent solicitation (target: 75% of spend)
- Title review and ground lease verification
- Faculty handbook and shared governance consultation
- Programmatic accreditor notifications

**Phase 3: Contingent Closing** (Month 12-18):
- **Closing occurs only if**:
  - HLC approves change of control (absolute condition)
  - Vendor consents obtained for ≥75% of material contract spend (or replacement contracts secured)
  - Title review confirms no ground lease issues or lessor consents obtained
  - No material adverse change in enrollment, faculty composition, or financial condition
- **If conditions not satisfied**: AEH may terminate without penalty and no breakup fee

This structure protects AEH from $435M-$539M student refund catastrophe while giving HLC adequate time to evaluate change of control application (12-18 months typical processing time).¹¹⁶

### J. Cross-Reference Integration

This Commercial Contracts analysis directly intersects with multiple other legal domains addressed in companion sections of this memorandum:

*See* Section I.D at pp. 38-45 analyzing HLC substantive change approval requirements and denial probability (15-20%); student refund exposure of $435M-$539M (based on 18,400 students × average $23,650-$29,295 annual tuition under enrollment agreement terms) and clinical placement terminations affecting $114M annual nursing/health sciences revenue are both triggered by HLC accreditation denial, requiring absolute closing condition for HLC board approval.

*See* Section IX.C at pp. 235-245 analyzing tenure contract obligations under faculty handbook provisions; 850 tenured faculty with contractual protections create $250M-$830M wrongful termination exposure ($300K-$980K per faculty member for 1-3 years salary plus benefits) if terminated without cause, and shared governance requirements under faculty handbook Section 4.2 affect operational decision-making authority post-acquisition requiring faculty senate consultation on academic programs, budgets, and strategic planning.

*See* Section VII.B at pp. 195-210 analyzing Missouri Valley Conference membership risk; MVC membership loss creates $3.7M-$6.2M annual revenue loss ($2.2M media rights + $500K-$1M NCAA tournament units + $1M-$3M operational costs) with 5-year NPV of $23.6M-$33.1M, compounded by NCAA for-profit revenue distribution exclusion of $3M-$4.9M annually (basketball tournament units, Student Assistance Fund, conference grants) under NCAA governance restrictions on for-profit members.

*See* Section X.F at pp. 298-310 analyzing insurance transition requirements; D&O tail coverage (6-year extended reporting period) costs $1.0M-$1.5M one-time premium to maintain coverage for pre-closing wrongful acts, and for-profit status conversion increases annual insurance premiums by $1.95M-$3.5M across general liability (30-50% increase), professional liability (40-60% increase), and cyber liability (25-40% increase) due to heightened risk perception and loss of nonprofit pricing advantages.

*See* Section II.D at pp. 48-55 analyzing federal loan discharge recoupment successor liability; Department of Education closed school discharge policy under 34 C.F.R. § 685.214 holds successor institutions liable for federal loan discharge recoupment if students withdraw within 180 days before closure, creating $225M-$329M exposure (3,680-5,520 students at 20-30% of enrollment × average $30,680 federal loans per student) in catastrophic HLC denial scenario requiring teach-out or closure.

*See* Section XI.B.1 at pp. 118-125 analyzing purchase price adjustment and Material Adverse Change clause definition; student refund obligations of $435M-$539M (if HLC denies accreditation) and enrollment decline of 15-25% (2,760-4,600 students) constitute "Material Adverse Effect" under standard purchase agreement definitions, potentially triggering buyer termination rights, purchase price reduction, or escrow holdback requirements to secure seller indemnification obligations for pre-closing enrollment agreement breaches.

*See* Section X.E at pp. 285-295 analyzing real property due diligence requirements; comprehensive title review of 350-acre campus (85 buildings, 4.2M square feet, $650M assessed value) required to verify fee simple ownership versus ground lease arrangements, identify encumbrances, easements, and restrictions on use, and confirm property tax exemption status will terminate upon for-profit conversion generating $15.6M annual property tax liability at Marion County 2.4% commercial rate.

*See* Section XI.B.1 at pp. 118-125 analyzing transaction valuation and purchase price adjustment methodology; aggregate probability-weighted commercial contract exposure of $163M-$373M (combining student refunds, vendor contract renegotiation, clinical placement loss, and faculty tenure obligations weighted by probability of occurrence) represents 21-48% of $780M purchase price, supporting recommended purchase price reduction of $156M-$267M (20-34% discount) to reflect legal and regulatory risk inherent in nonprofit-to-for-profit university conversion.

### K. Summary of Findings and Strategic Recommendations

The commercial contracts analysis reveals that American Education Holdings' $780M acquisition of Midwest University carries aggregate contract-related exposure of $846M-$1.66B in worst-case scenarios, with probability-weighted expected impact of $163M-$373M (21-48% of purchase price). The analysis identifies three critical priorities:

**Priority 1: HLC Accreditation Approval** (CRITICAL—$435M-$539M exposure)
- HLC approval must be **absolute closing condition**—transaction does not close without HLC board approval
- Student refund exposure ($435M-$539M) is single largest risk, representing 56-69% of purchase price
- Seller must prepare contingent teach-out plan approved by HLC before closing
- $50M-$100M tuition refund escrow required to protect against accreditation denial scenario

**Priority 2: Vendor Contract Management** (HIGH—$24.7M-$65.6M weighted exposure)
- 98 material vendors totaling $49.4M annual spend require change of control consent
- Proactive vendor outreach during due diligence phase (seller-led with AEH participation)
- Target: 75% vendor consent rate as minimum closing condition
- Purchase price adjustment mechanism: $2 reduction for every $1 annual contract value without consent
- Budget for 35% premium increase on renegotiated contracts in post-acquisition financial projections

**Priority 3: Faculty Handbook Preservation** (MEDIUM—$25M-$125M weighted exposure)
- 680 tenured + 110 tenure-track faculty have vested contractual rights in handbook provisions
- AEH must commit to preserving tenure protections and shared governance structures
- Faculty Senate consultation required for any handbook amendments post-acquisition
- Breach of tenure or shared governance creates both direct litigation exposure ($250M-$830M gross) and indirect accreditation cascade risk (HLC may view as governance failure)

**Additional Risk Mitigation Priorities**:
- **MVC Membership** ($4.7M-$9.9M weighted): Consult MVC commissioner early; prepare alternative conference backup
- **Ground Lease Verification** ($1.0M-$5.0M weighted): Comprehensive title search priority item; secure walk-away right if ground lease exceeds $50M purchase cost
- **Insurance Renewals** ($1.5M-$3.2M annual weighted): Obtain carrier commitment letters; budget 35% premium increase in financial projections

**Recommended Purchase Price Adjustment**: $100M-$150M reduction from $780M to $630M-$680M to reflect:
- Probability-weighted contract costs: $139M expected value
- Risk premium for catastrophic accreditation scenario: $25M-$50M
- Vendor contract renegotiation costs (present value): $26.8M
- Insurance premium increases (present value): $20M NPV
- Additional $10M-$25M buffer for transaction complexity and contingent liabilities

**Transaction Viability Conclusion**: The Midwest University acquisition is **conditionally viable** subject to three absolute requirements: (1) HLC approval obtained before closing; (2) no ground lease issues discovered on core campus; (3) minimum 75% vendor consent rate achieved. Expected contract costs of $50M-$139M (6.4-17.8% of purchase price) fall within acceptable M&A risk tolerance for higher education transactions if properly structured with closing conditions, representations and warranties, indemnifications, escrows, and purchase price adjustments detailed above.¹¹⁷
