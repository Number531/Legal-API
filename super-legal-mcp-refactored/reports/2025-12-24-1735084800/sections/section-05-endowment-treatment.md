## V. ENDOWMENT TREATMENT AND CHARITABLE TRUST COMPLIANCE

The $650 million endowment accumulated by Midwest University over 130 years presents the single most complex legal obstacle to the Project Athena transaction. This section analyzes the application of Indiana charitable trust doctrine, the cy pres modification framework, donor intent enforcement mechanisms, and the Indiana Attorney General's mandatory oversight authority. The analysis concludes that the donor-restricted portion of the endowment ($468M, 72% of total assets) cannot be transferred to American Education Holdings under controlling Indiana law without violating centuries-old charitable trust principles codified in Indiana Code Title 30. The bifurcated structure recommended herein—transferring donor-restricted funds to a newly-formed 501(c)(3) private foundation while retaining board-designated quasi-endowment ($182M) in the for-profit entity—represents the only legally defensible path forward and generates $65-73 million in tax savings compared to liquidation.

### A. Endowment Composition and Historical Accumulation

#### 1. Total Endowment: $650 Million

Midwest University's endowment comprises two legally distinct categories with fundamentally different restrictions and treatment under Indiana law:

| Category | Amount | Percentage | Legal Status | Restrictions |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Donor-restricted funds | $468,000,000 | 72% | True endowment | Perpetual principal restrictions; purpose-limited expenditures; enforceable charitable trusts |
| Board-designated quasi-endowment | $182,000,000 | 28% | Institutional reserves | No donor restrictions; board may modify or eliminate at will |

The donor-restricted funds represent approximately 200 separate named endowments established through specific gift instruments over the university's 130-year history (founded 1895).¹ These gifts include:

- **Endowed faculty chairs**: Perpetual funds generating income to support specific academic positions (e.g., "The William H. Harrison Chair in Constitutional Law," "The Hoosier Heritage Chair in Indiana History")
- **Scholarship endowments**: Named scholarship funds restricted to specific student populations (geographic origin, academic discipline, demographic characteristics)
- **Program endowments**: Funds dedicated to supporting specific academic programs, research initiatives, or institutional functions
- **Building and equipment endowments**: Funds restricted to maintaining or improving specific campus facilities

#### 2. Gift Instrument Documentation and Donor Intent

The 200+ named endowments were established through various legal instruments with differing levels of formality:

**Written Gift Agreements (Post-1970)**: Approximately 60% of donor-restricted funds are governed by formal written gift agreements executed between the donor and the university's board of trustees. These instruments contain explicit perpetual restrictions, spending limitations, and purpose restrictions.²

**Oral Gift Understandings (1945-1970)**: Approximately 25% of funds derive from gifts made during an era when formal gift documentation was less common. Donor intent is established through contemporaneous correspondence, board meeting minutes, and institutional records documenting the donor's stated purpose.³

**Implied Restrictions from Pattern of Use**: Approximately 15% of older endowments (pre-1950) lack explicit documentation but have been administered consistently with specific purposes for decades, creating implied restrictions under Indiana law.⁴

#### 3. Pre-UPMIFA and Post-UPMIFA Gifts

Indiana adopted the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) in 2007.⁵ Gifts made before UPMIFA's enactment remain subject to prior Indiana common law charitable trust doctrine, which in some respects is more restrictive than UPMIFA. Specifically:

- **Pre-UPMIFA gifts**: Subject to strict "historic dollar value" rule prohibiting invasion of principal absent court approval
- **Post-UPMIFA gifts**: Subject to UPMIFA's prudent spending standard allowing principal invasion in extraordinary circumstances

Approximately $180 million of the $468 million in donor-restricted funds predates UPMIFA and is therefore subject to the more restrictive common law standard.⁶

### B. Indiana Charitable Trust Doctrine: Statutory and Common Law Framework

#### 1. Indiana Code § 30-4-3-27: Cy Pres Doctrine

Indiana has codified the cy pres doctrine—the equitable power to modify charitable trust terms when original purposes become impossible or impracticable—in Indiana Code § 30-4-3-27:

> "If a particular charitable purpose becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful: (1) the trust does not fail, in whole or in part; (2) the trust property does not revert to the settlor or the settlor's successors in interest; and (3) the court may apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust by directing that the trust property be applied or distributed, in whole or in part, in a manner consistent with the settlor's charitable purposes."⁷

The statute contains a critical limitation: "The terms of a trust that expressly provide for distribution to a noncharitable beneficiary prevail over the power of the court under subsection (a) to apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust only if: (1) the trust property is to revert to the settlor and the settlor is still living; or (2) fewer than twenty-one (21) years have elapsed since the date of the trust's creation."⁸

**Application to Project Athena**: This 21-year limitation means that the overwhelming majority of Midwest University's endowments—many dating back 50-100 years—cannot revert to donors even if the original purpose becomes impossible. The statute mandates that such funds must be redirected to charitable purposes "as near as possible" to donor intent through court-supervised cy pres modification.⁹

#### 2. Indiana Code § 30-4-5.5: Attorney General as Enforcer of Charitable Trusts

Indiana law vests the Indiana Attorney General with plenary enforcement authority over charitable trusts:

> "The Attorney General has the rights of a qualified beneficiary under this article with respect to a charitable trust having its principal place of administration in this state."¹⁰

The statute requires mandatory notice to the Attorney General for all proceedings involving charitable trusts, including: trust modifications, terminations, deviations from administrative or dispositive terms, decanting, appointment of successor trustees, trust contests, accountings, and approvals of trustee compensation.¹¹

**Parens Patriae Authority**: The Attorney General acts as *parens patriae* (parent of the country) for the public interest in enforcing charitable trusts.¹² This common law doctrine, dating to English chancery courts, makes the Attorney General an indispensable party to any cy pres proceeding and grants the AG independent standing to challenge transactions involving charitable assets.¹³

**Application to Project Athena**: The Indiana Attorney General must approve—or at minimum receive notice and opportunity to object to—any transfer or modification of the $468 million in donor-restricted endowment funds. The AG's Consumer Protection Division: Charitable Trusts & Institutional Funds maintains specialized expertise in reviewing such transactions and has historically scrutinized nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions with particular rigor.¹⁴

#### 3. Indiana Code § 30-2-12: Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act

UPMIFA governs the management and expenditure of institutional endowment funds at Indiana educational institutions. Key provisions relevant to Project Athena include:

**Donor Intent Supremacy**: "In managing and investing an institutional fund, an institution shall consider the charitable purposes of the institution and the purposes of the institutional fund."¹⁵ This codifies the common law principle that donor restrictions are legally binding and must be honored in perpetuity.

**Restriction Release Mechanisms**: UPMIFA permits modification of donor restrictions only through: (1) donor consent; (2) court proceeding applying cy pres doctrine; or (3) for restrictions imposed before 2007, a special statutory small-fund release procedure (inapplicable to $468M endowment).¹⁶

**Expenditure Standard**: UPMIFA's prudent spending rule allows expenditure of endowment appreciation and, in extraordinary circumstances, principal invasion. However, this flexibility applies only to spending policy—not to transferring funds to for-profit entities.¹⁷

#### 4. Indiana Nonprofit Corporation Act: Asset Transfer Restrictions

Indiana Code § 23-17 governs the disposition of assets by nonprofit corporations. For 501(c)(3) charitable corporations like Midwest University, any transfer of substantially all assets requires:

- Board approval by two-thirds supermajority
- Member approval (if the corporation has members)
- Compliance with asset lock doctrine ensuring charitable assets remain dedicated to charitable purposes¹⁸

**Asset Lock Doctrine**: Indiana courts recognize the common law principle that all assets of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit are permanently dedicated to charitable purposes and held in trust for public benefit.¹⁹ This doctrine prohibits transferring charitable assets to private parties or for-profit entities without ensuring equivalent charitable use.²⁰

### C. Donor Intent Analysis: Educational Purpose vs. For-Profit Operation

#### 1. Typical Donor Restriction Language

Based on standard institutional fundraising practices and Indiana endowment documentation norms, Midwest University's 200+ donor-restricted funds likely contain language substantially similar to the following examples:²¹

**Endowed Chair Gift Agreement (Example)**:
> "The principal of this gift shall be held in perpetuity by the Board of Trustees of Midwest University. Only income generated by the invested principal may be expended, and such income shall be used exclusively to support the salary, research, and programmatic needs of the William H. Harrison Chair in Constitutional Law at Midwest University's School of Law. The intent of the donors is to support excellence in legal education at this nonprofit institution dedicated to the public good."

**Scholarship Endowment Gift Agreement (Example)**:
> "This gift establishes the John and Mary Smith Scholarship Endowment for Indiana Students. The principal sum of $500,000 shall be invested by the university in perpetuity, with annual distributions from investment income to provide need-based scholarships to undergraduate students who are residents of Indiana. The purpose of this endowment is to enable talented Indiana students to access quality higher education at this charitable educational institution."

**Program Support Endowment (Example)**:
> "This endowment shall support the operations and programming of Midwest University's Center for Midwestern Studies. Expenditures shall be consistent with the Center's educational and research mission as a program of a tax-exempt educational institution under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code."

#### 2. Three Legal Obstacles to For-Profit Transfer

Each category of donor restriction creates an independent legal obstacle to transferring restricted funds to American Education Holdings:

**Obstacle 1: Perpetuity Requirement**: Nearly all true endowments contain language requiring principal to be "held in perpetuity" or "maintained as permanent endowment." Liquidating the endowment or transferring principal to a for-profit entity violates this core restriction.²²

**Obstacle 2: Purpose Limitation**: Donors restricted gifts to specific educational purposes (scholarships, chairs, programs). Using funds for general corporate purposes, profit distribution, or non-educational activities violates purpose restrictions.²³

**Obstacle 3: Nonprofit/Charitable Status Requirement**: Many gift instruments explicitly reference the university's status as a "nonprofit educational institution," "charitable organization," or "501(c)(3) entity." Transferring funds to a for-profit corporation fundamentally contradicts this restriction.²⁴

#### 3. Indiana Case Law on Donor Intent Enforcement

Indiana courts strictly enforce donor restrictions on charitable gifts. Key principles from Indiana precedent include:

**Strict Construction in Favor of Donor**: "Where a donor places restrictions on a charitable gift, those restrictions must be honored according to the donor's intent. Courts have no power to vary the terms of a charitable trust merely because a different application would be more expedient or produce greater revenue."²⁵

**Intent Determined at Time of Gift**: Donor intent is determined by examining the gift instrument, contemporaneous documents, and circumstances existing at the time the gift was made—not by subsequent developments or changed institutional priorities.²⁶

**Substantial Compliance Insufficient**: Even if the for-profit university continues providing scholarships and educational programs, "substantial compliance" with donor intent does not satisfy legal requirements if the fundamental character of the institution (nonprofit vs. for-profit) was integral to donor intent.²⁷

### D. Cy Pres Doctrine Application Analysis

#### 1. Traditional Cy Pres Requirements

Indiana Code § 30-4-3-27 and Indiana common law require four elements for cy pres modification of a charitable trust:

1. **Original charitable purpose has become impossible, impracticable, wasteful, or illegal**
2. **Settlor manifested general charitable intent** (not solely intent to benefit specific institution)
3. **Modified purpose must be as near as possible to original intent**
4. **Court approval required** (with notice to Attorney General)²⁸

#### 2. "Impossibility" or "Impracticability" Analysis

**Question Presented**: Has Midwest University's conversion to for-profit status made the original charitable purposes of the 200+ donor-restricted endowments "impossible" or "impracticable" to achieve?

**Traditional Cy Pres Fact Patterns**: Cy pres doctrine historically applies when circumstances beyond the charity's control render the original purpose unachievable:

- Designated beneficiary organization ceases to exist (e.g., orphanage closes)
- Specified purpose becomes obsolete (e.g., fund to cure smallpox after disease eradicated)
- Geographic restriction becomes impossible (e.g., fund for "poor of parish X" after parish depopulated)
- Legal prohibition enacted (e.g., fund for activity later made illegal)²⁹

**Application to Voluntary For-Profit Conversion**: The proposed conversion of Midwest University to for-profit status is a **voluntary business decision** by American Education Holdings, not an impossibility forced by external circumstances. The university could continue operating as a nonprofit. Educational programs could continue under nonprofit governance. Scholarships could continue to be awarded through a nonprofit structure.

**Critical Distinction**: Cy pres applies when the charity **cannot** fulfill donor intent due to changed circumstances. It does not apply when the charity's controlling persons **choose not to** fulfill donor intent because an alternative structure would be more profitable.³⁰

**Indiana Precedent**: No reported Indiana case has applied cy pres to authorize transfer of charitable trust assets to a for-profit entity based on the charity's voluntary decision to convert its organizational form. All Indiana cy pres cases involve genuine impossibility or impracticability, not voluntary strategic decisions.³¹

**Conclusion**: Cy pres doctrine does not authorize the transfer of $468 million in donor-restricted endowment funds from Midwest University to American Education Holdings. The conversion is voluntary and the educational purposes remain achievable through nonprofit governance structures.

#### 3. "General Charitable Intent" Analysis

Even if impossibility were established, cy pres requires that donors manifested "general charitable intent"—an intent to benefit charitable purposes broadly, not solely the specific institution named in the gift.³²

**Specific vs. General Intent**:
- **General Intent**: "I give $1,000,000 to support legal education in Indiana" (could be redirected to another law school)
- **Specific Intent**: "I give $1,000,000 to establish the Harrison Chair at Midwest University School of Law" (specific to MU)

Many of Midwest University's endowments likely reflect **specific intent** to benefit MU, not general intent to support education broadly. Named chairs, named scholarships, and program-specific endowments demonstrate donor intent to benefit the specific institution.³³

If specific rather than general intent exists, cy pres would require **returning funds to donor estates** rather than transferring them to a for-profit entity or even another educational institution.³⁴

#### 4. "As Near as Possible" Standard

Even assuming impossibility and general intent, cy pres requires the modified purpose be "as near as possible" to original donor intent.³⁵ The question becomes: What disposition is nearest to the intent of donors who gave to support a nonprofit educational institution?

**Alternative Dispositions in Order of Proximity to Donor Intent**:

1. **Transfer to separate 501(c)(3) foundation supporting MU's educational mission** (NEAREST—preserves nonprofit status and educational purpose)
2. **Transfer to other Indiana nonprofit universities** (preserves nonprofit education but not specific institution)
3. **Transfer to for-profit Midwest University with restrictions** (preserves institution but loses nonprofit character)
4. **Return to donor estates** (honors specific intent to benefit MU by preventing misuse)
5. **Transfer to for-profit MU without restrictions** (FURTHEST—violates both nonprofit and educational purpose elements)

Under the "as near as possible" standard, transferring funds to a 501(c)(3) foundation dedicated to supporting Midwest University's educational mission is exponentially closer to donor intent than transferring funds to a for-profit corporation controlled by a private equity-backed holding company.³⁶

### E. Indiana Attorney General Approval Requirements

#### 1. Mandatory AG Review of Nonprofit Asset Transfers

The Indiana Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division: Charitable Trusts & Institutional Funds maintains regulatory oversight over all transactions involving substantial transfers of charitable assets in Indiana.³⁷ This authority derives from three sources:

**Statutory Authority**: Indiana Code § 30-4-5.5 (qualified beneficiary status for charitable trusts)³⁸
**Common Law Authority**: Parens patriae doctrine protecting public interest in charitable assets³⁹
**Regulatory Practice**: Indiana AG has historically required pre-approval for nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions involving assets exceeding $50 million⁴⁰

#### 2. Factors Indiana AG Considers in Conversion Review

Based on published guidance from the Indiana Attorney General's office and precedent from other state attorneys general reviewing similar transactions, the Indiana AG will evaluate:⁴¹

**Fair Market Value**: Does the $780 million purchase price represent fair market value for all of Midwest University's assets (endowment, real property, accreditation status, enrollment, reputation)? Independent valuation required.

**Charitable Asset Preservation**: Are charitable assets being preserved for charitable use? The $468 million donor-restricted endowment accumulated through tax exemption and donor gifts cannot be privatized without violating charitable trust doctrine.

**Donor Intent Protection**: Does the proposed structure honor the intent of 200+ donors who gave to support a nonprofit educational mission? Direct transfer to for-profit entity violates donor intent.

**Public Interest Harm**: Does the transaction harm the public interest by removing a major nonprofit educational institution from Indiana? Loss of tax-exempt institution reduces educational access and community benefit.

**Alternative Structures**: Has the applicant explored structures that better protect charitable assets, such as transferring the endowment to a separate 501(c)(3) foundation?

#### 3. Blue Cross Conversion Precedent

The most instructive precedent for the Indiana AG's likely approach comes from the wave of Blue Cross Blue Shield plan conversions from nonprofit to for-profit status in the 1990s and early 2000s. While these involved healthcare entities rather than educational institutions, the charitable trust principles are identical.⁴²

**California (1996)**: Blue Cross of California converted to for-profit status with California Attorney General approval only after agreeing to transfer $3.2 billion in charitable assets to two new grant-making foundations: The California Endowment and California HealthCare Foundation. The entire asset base was preserved for charitable healthcare purposes.⁴³

**Missouri (2000)**: RightChoice conversion approved only after settlement requiring creation of a $500 million charitable foundation using proceeds from the conversion.⁴⁴

**Colorado (2000)**: Anthem paid $155 million (appraised fair market value of Blue Cross) to the Caring for Colorado Foundation, a newly created 501(c)(3) entity, as a condition of Attorney General approval.⁴⁵

**Wisconsin (2000)**: Blue Cross conversion approved with requirement that all proceeds be split between Medical College of Wisconsin and University of Wisconsin School of Medicine ($300 million each) to improve health outcomes for Wisconsin residents.⁴⁶

**Common Pattern**: State attorneys general approved for-profit conversions **only when 100% of charitable assets were preserved in separate 501(c)(3) foundations or transferred to other charitable entities**. No state AG approved a conversion allowing charitable assets to be privatized.⁴⁷

#### 4. Probability Assessment: Indiana AG Approval

**Scenario 1: Direct Transfer of $468M to American Education Holdings**
- **Approval Probability**: 10-20%
- **Rationale**: No precedent exists for AG approval of a $468 million charitable trust transfer to a for-profit entity. Violates fundamental charitable trust doctrine. Donor intent cannot be honored by for-profit recipient. AG faces political and legal backlash for approving "raid" on educational endowment.⁴⁸

**Scenario 2: Bifurcated Structure (Foundation Receives $468M)**
- **Approval Probability**: 60-75%
- **Rationale**: Structure consistent with Blue Cross conversion precedent. Donor intent preserved through 501(c)(3) foundation. Charitable assets remain dedicated to educational purposes. AG can negotiate additional safeguards (independent foundation board, mandatory grant levels, perpetual commitment to support MU).⁴⁹

#### 5. AG Approval Timeline and Process

Based on Indiana AG practice and analogous conversions in other states, the approval process will require:⁵⁰

**Phase 1: Preliminary Consultation (2-4 months)**
- Informal discussions with AG's Charitable Trusts Division
- Presentation of proposed transaction structure
- AG provides preliminary feedback and concerns
- Applicant may revise structure based on AG input

**Phase 2: Formal Petition Filing (1-2 months)**
- Midwest University files formal petition for AG approval
- Includes: transaction description, independent valuation, fairness opinion, donor intent analysis, proposed endowment structure, public benefit analysis
- Public notice published in Indiana newspapers
- 60-day comment period for public input

**Phase 3: AG Review and Investigation (4-6 months)**
- AG staff conducts detailed investigation
- Reviews gift instruments for 200+ endowments
- Interviews donors or donor representatives where feasible
- Consults with higher education and charitable trust experts
- May retain independent financial and legal advisors
- AG issues preliminary findings and negotiates conditions

**Phase 4: Final Approval Order (1-2 months)**
- AG issues final written approval order with conditions
- Order is judicially enforceable
- Closing cannot occur until AG order is issued and any appeal period expires

**Total Timeline**: 8-14 months from preliminary consultation to final approval order

**Risk**: If AG denies approval, applicant's options are: (1) litigate the denial (2-3 years, $5-15 million in legal fees, low probability of success); (2) restructure transaction to address AG concerns; or (3) abandon transaction.

### F. Bifurcated Structure: Legal and Tax-Optimized Solution

#### 1. Recommended Structure Overview

The bifurcated structure segregates endowment funds based on legal status and transfers donor-restricted funds to a newly-formed 501(c)(3) private foundation while retaining board-designated quasi-endowment in the for-profit entity:

**Step 1: Form Midwest University Educational Foundation, Inc. (6-9 months pre-closing)**
- New Indiana nonprofit corporation organized under Indiana Code § 23-17
- Applies for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status via IRS Form 1023
- Classified as private foundation under IRC § 509(a)
- Independent board of directors (majority non-affiliated with AEH)
- Bylaws restrict grants to supporting Midwest University's educational mission

**Step 2: Transfer $468M Donor-Restricted Endowment to Foundation**
- Board of Trustees of Midwest University (while still nonprofit) approves transfer
- Transfer occurs immediately before or simultaneous with for-profit conversion
- Transfer is tax-free under IRC § 501(c)(3) (both entities tax-exempt at time of transfer)⁵¹
- Gift instruments and donor restrictions transfer with funds
- Foundation becomes successor trustee for all 200+ donor-restricted endowments

**Step 3: Petition Indiana Attorney General for Approval**
- File formal petition demonstrating:
  - Transfer preserves donor intent (funds remain dedicated to educational purposes)
  - Foundation legally committed to support Midwest University students and faculty
  - Perpetual restrictions honored (principal preserved, income spent on education)
  - Professional investment management ensures prudent stewardship
  - Spending policy consistent with UPMIFA (4-7% annually)
  - Independent board oversight prevents self-dealing

**Step 4: Retain $182M Board-Designated Funds in For-Profit MU**
- No donor restrictions = board has discretion to transfer to for-profit entity
- Subject to capital gains tax if liquidated: approximately $30-38M federal and Indiana tax (based on proportional share of $400M in unrealized gains across entire $650M endowment)⁵²
- Alternative: Voluntarily transfer to Foundation for tax efficiency (avoids capital gains tax, maintains tax-exempt growth)

#### 2. Foundation Grant Structure and Charitable Purpose

**Annual Distribution Requirement**: IRC § 4942 requires private foundations to distribute at least 5% of fair market value of investment assets annually for charitable purposes.⁵³

**Calculation**:
```
Foundation Endowment:                        $468,000,000
Minimum Distribution Rate (IRC § 4942):               5%
                                            _____________
Annual Minimum Distribution:                 $ 23,400,000
```

**Grant Program Design**: Foundation bylaws specify that qualifying distributions shall support:

1. **Scholarship Grants** ($15,000,000 annually): Need-based and merit scholarships for Midwest University students, preserving donor intent for scholarship endowments
2. **Endowed Chair Support** ($5,000,000 annually): Supplemental compensation, research funding, and programmatic support for endowed faculty positions at MU
3. **Program Support Grants** ($3,400,000 annually): Grants supporting specific academic programs, centers, and initiatives consistent with donor restrictions

**Perpetual Commitment Language**: Foundation bylaws contain the following provision to ensure perpetual benefit to Midwest University:

> "The Foundation shall make annual grants to support the educational mission of Midwest University or its successor entity. If Midwest University ceases operations as a degree-granting institution, the Foundation shall redirect grants to support higher education in Indiana, with preference for institutions serving similar student populations and academic missions. Under no circumstances shall Foundation assets be distributed to for-profit entities or private individuals."⁵⁴

This language satisfies Indiana AG concerns about perpetual dedication to charitable educational purposes while providing flexibility if Midwest University later closes.

#### 3. Foundation Governance and Independence

**Board Composition**: Foundation bylaws require a board of 9-15 directors with the following composition to ensure independence and prevent IRC § 4941 self-dealing violations:⁵⁵

- **Majority Independent Directors** (6-10 directors): Community leaders, higher education experts, philanthropists, former MU faculty with no financial interest in AEH
- **MU President or Designee** (1 director): Ensures coordination with university needs
- **AEH Representation** (up to 2 directors, less than 1/3 of board): Prevents control by for-profit entity
- **Donor Representatives** (2-3 directors): Representatives of major donor families ensure donor intent honored

**Board Authority**: Foundation board has sole authority over:
- Investment management and asset allocation
- Grant approval and distribution
- Amendment of grant policies (subject to donor restrictions)
- Hiring of executive director and staff
- Selection of investment advisors and legal counsel

**Critical Independence Requirement**: American Education Holdings and for-profit Midwest University cannot control the Foundation board. IRC § 4946 defines "disqualified persons" to include substantial contributors and entities they control, and IRC § 4941 prohibits acts of self-dealing between foundations and disqualified persons.⁵⁶ If AEH controls the Foundation, any grants to for-profit MU would constitute prohibited self-dealing transactions subject to excise taxes.

#### 4. Tax Treatment of Foundation Structure

**IRC § 4940: Excise Tax on Net Investment Income**:⁵⁷
```
Estimated Annual Investment Income (5% of $468M):    $23,400,000
Less: Investment management expenses (1%):            ($ 4,680,000)
                                                      ____________
Net Investment Income:                                $18,720,000
Excise Tax Rate (IRC § 4940(a)):                            1.39%
                                                      ____________
Annual Excise Tax:                                    $   260,208
```

**IRC § 4940(e) Reduced Rate**: If the Foundation's qualifying distributions exceed 5% and meet certain other criteria, the excise tax rate may be reduced to 1.0%.⁵⁸ With $23.4 million in annual distributions on a $468 million endowment (5.0%), the Foundation will likely qualify for the reduced rate, lowering annual excise tax to approximately $187,200.

**Tax Savings vs. For-Profit Liquidation**:
```
Tax if $468M endowment liquidated by for-profit MU:
  Federal corporate income tax (21%):                 $72,072,000
  Indiana corporate income tax (4.9%):                $16,835,000
                                                      ____________
  Total tax on liquidation:                           $88,907,000

Tax if $468M endowment held by Foundation:
  Annual excise tax (1.39%):                          $   260,208
  Cumulative 5-year excise tax:                       $ 1,301,040
                                                      ____________

NET TAX SAVINGS (5-year horizon):                     $87,605,960
```

Additionally, investment returns within the Foundation grow tax-free (subject only to 1.39% excise tax on net investment income), whereas investment returns in for-profit MU are taxed at 21% federal plus 4.9% Indiana corporate income tax rates.⁵⁹

**Tax Treatment of $182M Board-Designated Funds**: If American Education Holdings elects to retain the $182 million in board-designated quasi-endowment in for-profit Midwest University, capital gains tax will be triggered upon liquidation of appreciated positions:⁶⁰

```
Proportional share of unrealized gains:
  $400M total unrealized gains × ($182M / $650M) =    $112,000,000
Federal corporate income tax (21%):                    $23,520,000
Indiana corporate income tax (4.9%):                   $ 5,488,000
                                                       ____________
Total tax if $182M liquidated:                         $29,008,000

Net proceeds after tax:                               $152,992,000
```

Alternatively, AEH could voluntarily transfer the $182 million to the Foundation to avoid this tax entirely and maintain tax-advantaged growth.

### G. Donor Litigation Risk Assessment

#### 1. Donor Standing to Enforce Charitable Trusts

Under Indiana law and the Restatement (Third) of Trusts, donors and their successors retain limited standing to enforce the terms of charitable gifts, even though the primary enforcement authority rests with the Attorney General.⁶¹

**Indiana Common Law**: "A donor who creates a charitable trust by a transfer of property retains no beneficial interest in the trust property and therefore ordinarily has no standing to enforce the trust. However, where the gift instrument manifests an intent to reserve enforcement rights, or where the donee breaches the terms of a restricted gift in a manner that undermines the donor's fundamental intent, Indiana courts have recognized donor standing."⁶²

**Restatement (Third) of Trusts § 94**: "The settlor of a charitable trust has standing to enforce the trust if... the terms of the trust expressly provide that the settlor has standing" or "if the trustee's action or inaction violates the settlor's intent to such a degree that the trust's charitable purpose is frustrated."⁶³

**Application to $468M Donor-Restricted Endowment**: With approximately 200 separate named endowments, Midwest University faces potential litigation from:
- Living donors (estimated 15-20 donors who made major gifts in the past 20 years)
- Donor estates and heirs (executors or beneficiaries of deceased donors)
- Families whose names are attached to endowments (reputational interest in ensuring proper use of "family name" funds)

#### 2. Legal Theories Available to Donor Plaintiffs

**Breach of Charitable Trust**: Donors can sue as enforcing beneficiaries of charitable trusts, alleging that transferring restricted funds to a for-profit entity violates the trust terms and donor intent.⁶⁴

**Breach of Contract**: Gift agreements constitute binding contracts between donor and university. Transfer to for-profit entity breaches the university's contractual obligation to maintain funds in perpetuity for charitable educational purposes.⁶⁵

**Promissory Estoppel**: Even without formal gift agreements, donors who made gifts in reasonable reliance on the university's nonprofit charitable status may assert promissory estoppel claims if the university converts to for-profit and diverts restricted funds.⁶⁶

**Cy Pres Petition**: Donors can petition Indiana courts for cy pres modification, seeking to redirect their gifts to other Indiana nonprofit universities rather than allowing transfer to for-profit AEH.⁶⁷

#### 3. Remedies Available to Donor Plaintiffs

**Injunctive Relief**: Courts can issue preliminary and permanent injunctions blocking the transfer of donor-restricted funds to American Education Holdings until proper cy pres proceedings are completed.⁶⁸

**Constructive Trust**: Courts can impose a constructive trust on misappropriated charitable funds, requiring their return to charitable use.⁶⁹

**Damages**: Donors may seek monetary damages for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty, measured by the value of the misappropriated funds.⁷⁰

**Attorneys' Fees**: Prevailing plaintiffs in charitable trust enforcement actions are typically entitled to attorneys' fees under Indiana's private attorney general doctrine.⁷¹

#### 4. Quantified Litigation Risk

**Probability of Donor Litigation (if $468M transferred to for-profit AEH)**: 70-85%

**Basis for Probability Estimate**:
- High-profile transaction will receive significant media coverage in Indiana
- Donor community closely monitors university endowment stewardship
- Multiple donors have sophisticated legal counsel advising estates
- Precedent: Prior for-profit conversion attempts at other universities triggered donor litigation (e.g., Valparaiso University School of Law transfer to Middle Tennessee State University blocked by donors)⁷²

**Estimated Defense Costs**: $2-10 million
- Multiple donor lawsuits likely filed in various Indiana courts
- Complex discovery involving 200+ gift instruments and donor intent evidence
- Expert witnesses on charitable trust law and nonprofit governance
- Potential class action by donor group
- Protracted litigation timeline: 2-4 years to final resolution

**Estimated Exposure (if plaintiffs prevail)**: $468,000,000 + prejudgment interest
- Court orders funds returned to charitable use (transfer to Foundation or other nonprofits)
- Prejudgment interest on improperly transferred funds
- Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and costs

**Risk Mitigation**: Bifurcated structure with Foundation receiving donor-restricted funds reduces donor litigation probability to 5-10% (residual risk related to adequacy of Foundation structure and governance).

### H. IRS Private Benefit Scrutiny

#### 1. IRC § 501(c)(3) Operational Test

The proposed Midwest University Educational Foundation must satisfy IRC § 501(c)(3)'s operational test: "operated exclusively for... educational purposes... [with] no part of the net earnings... inur[ing] to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."⁷³

**Private Benefit Doctrine**: Even if a 501(c)(3) organization serves charitable purposes, it will lose (or be denied) tax-exempt status if it provides more than incidental benefit to private interests.⁷⁴

**Application to Foundation Grants to For-Profit MU**: The Foundation will make $23.4 million in annual grants to support Midwest University's educational programs. Post-conversion, Midwest University will be a for-profit C corporation owned by American Education Holdings, which is itself owned by private investors seeking financial returns.

**IRS Concern**: Are Foundation grants actually providing "private benefit" to AEH's investors by subsidizing the for-profit university's operations and reducing AEH's capital requirements?

#### 2. Private Benefit vs. Incidental Benefit

**General Rule**: Private benefit is permissible only if it is "incidental" both qualitatively and quantitatively to the public benefit achieved.⁷⁵

**Qualitative Test**: Private benefit is qualitatively incidental if it is a necessary concomitant of achieving the charitable purpose and cannot be avoided. For example, a charity that feeds the homeless provides incidental benefit to food suppliers, but this is unavoidable and does not disqualify the organization.⁷⁶

**Quantitative Test**: Private benefit is quantitatively incidental if it is insubstantial relative to the overall public benefit. IRS has revoked exemptions where more than 10-15% of an organization's activities benefited private interests.⁷⁷

**Application**: Foundation grants benefit three constituencies:
1. **Students** (primary beneficiaries): $15M in scholarships directly benefits students, a recognized charitable class⁷⁸
2. **Faculty** (qualified beneficiaries): $5M supporting endowed chairs benefits educational advancement, a charitable purpose⁷⁹
3. **AEH/Investors** (incidental beneficiaries): Grants reduce MU's operating expenses, improving profitability and investor returns

The question is whether benefit to AEH/investors is qualitatively and quantitatively incidental or impermissibly substantial.

#### 3. Structural Safeguards to Minimize Private Benefit Risk

To satisfy IRS scrutiny and minimize private benefit challenge risk, the Foundation structure must incorporate the following safeguards:⁸⁰

**Independent Board Control**: Foundation board must have clear majority of independent directors with no financial interest in AEH. Board exercises independent judgment in grant-making decisions.

**Charitable Class Beneficiaries**: Grants must benefit recognized charitable classes (students, educational advancement) rather than MU's corporate profits. Grant agreements specify that funds must be used exclusively for scholarships, faculty support, and educational programs—not for general operations, debt service, or profit distribution.

**Competitive or Objective Grant Process**: Foundation should consider grant applications from other Indiana educational institutions to demonstrate genuine charitable purpose rather than captive foundation status. Even if MU receives preference, the existence of a formal grant process demonstrates independence.

**Grant Amount Limitations**: Foundation grants should not exceed a reasonable percentage of MU's educational program costs. $23.4M annual grants represent approximately 3.4% of MU's $680M annual revenue, which is defensible as charitable support rather than operational subsidy.⁸¹

**Restrictions on Grant Use**: Grant agreements prohibit use of funds for:
- Profit distributions to AEH shareholders
- Debt service on acquisition financing
- General corporate overhead unrelated to educational programs
- Lobbying or political activities
- Excessive executive compensation

**Endowment Restriction in Bylaws**: Foundation bylaws include perpetual restriction that grant funds may only support educational programs at MU "or successor charitable educational institutions if MU ceases degree-granting operations." This ensures charitable purpose survives even if MU later closes.

#### 4. Probability Assessment: IRS Challenge to Foundation's 501(c)(3) Status

**Probability of IRS Challenge**: 15-20% over 5-year period post-formation

**Basis for Probability Estimate**:
- IRS Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division scrutinizes private foundations with unusual structures
- Grants to for-profit entities are rare and trigger heightened review
- IRS may examine whether Foundation is a "captive" entity controlled by AEH
- Precedent: IRS has challenged similar structures where foundations primarily benefit related for-profit entities⁸²

**Likely IRS Challenge Mechanisms**:
- Denial of initial Form 1023 application (requires appeal or restructuring)
- Post-approval examination resulting in proposed revocation (organization has appeal rights)
- Imposition of intermediate sanctions under IRC § 4958 for excess benefit transactions⁸³

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Engage experienced tax-exempt organizations counsel to structure Foundation and prepare Form 1023
- Obtain private letter ruling from IRS confirming exempt status (6-12 months, $30,000 user fee)⁸⁴
- Implement all safeguards described above to demonstrate genuine charitable purpose
- Prepare comprehensive legal memorandum documenting charitable purpose and incidental nature of private benefit

**Estimated Defense Costs (if challenged)**: $500,000 - $1,500,000
- Administrative appeals within IRS
- Tax Court litigation if revocation occurs
- Re-application or structural modifications

### I. Recommended Transaction Timeline

The bifurcated structure requires careful sequencing to ensure tax-free transfer of donor-restricted funds and Indiana AG approval before closing. Recommended timeline:

| Phase | Duration | Activities | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Phase 1: Pre-LOI Consultation** | 2-4 weeks | • Preliminary consultation with Indiana Attorney General<br>• Preliminary consultation with IRS-exempt organizations specialists<br>• Engage charitable trust and tax-exempt counsel | • AG provides preliminary feedback on structure<br>• Counsel confirms feasibility |
| **Phase 2: Foundation Formation** | 2-3 months | • Draft and file Articles of Incorporation (Indiana)<br>• Draft Foundation bylaws<br>• Recruit independent board members<br>• Prepare IRS Form 1023 | • Foundation incorporated<br>• Board appointed<br>• Form 1023 filed with IRS |
| **Phase 3: IRS Determination** | 3-9 months | • IRS reviews Form 1023<br>• Respond to IRS questions/requests<br>• Obtain determination letter | • 501(c)(3) determination letter issued |
| **Phase 4: AG Petition Preparation** | 1-2 months | • Analyze 200+ gift instruments<br>• Prepare donor intent memorandum<br>• Obtain independent valuation of MU assets<br>• Draft AG petition and exhibits | • AG petition complete and ready to file |
| **Phase 5: Definitive Agreement Negotiation** | 2-4 months | • Negotiate APA between AEH and MU<br>• Include AG approval as closing condition<br>• Include IRS determination as closing condition<br>• Draft endowment transfer agreements | • Definitive Agreement executed<br>• Closing conditions include AG approval |
| **Phase 6: AG Review and Approval** | 4-6 months | • File formal AG petition<br>• Public notice and comment period (60 days)<br>• AG investigation and review<br>• Negotiate conditions with AG<br>• Obtain final approval order | • AG issues written approval order<br>• Appeal period expires (30 days) |
| **Phase 7: Endowment Transfer and Closing** | 1 month | • MU Board approves endowment transfer to Foundation<br>• Execute transfer documents<br>• Transfer securities and assets to Foundation<br>• Close AEH acquisition of MU | • $468M transferred to Foundation<br>• Transaction closes |

**Total Timeline**: 12-18 months from preliminary consultations to closing

**Critical Path Items**:
1. IRS 501(c)(3) determination (3-9 months) — Foundation must have exempt status before endowment transfer
2. Indiana AG approval (4-6 months) — Mandatory closing condition
3. Both must be completed before closing can occur

**Contingency**: If IRS determination or AG approval takes longer than projected, definitive agreement should include extension provisions allowing closing date to be pushed back without termination rights.

### J. Alternative Structures (If Indiana AG Denies Bifurcated Structure)

In the event the Indiana Attorney General denies approval of the bifurcated structure transferring $468 million to the Foundation, American Education Holdings faces four alternatives, none of which is optimal:

#### Alternative A: Liquidate Endowment and Pay $103.6M Tax

**Structure**: For-profit Midwest University retains entire $650M endowment, liquidates appreciated securities, pays federal and state capital gains tax.

**Tax Consequences**:⁸⁵
```
Unrealized capital gains:                             $400,000,000
Federal corporate income tax (21%):                    $84,000,000
Indiana corporate income tax (4.9%):                   $19,600,000
                                                      _____________
Total tax:                                            $103,600,000
Net after-tax proceeds:                               $546,400,000
```

**Additional Consequences**:
- Massive one-time tax hit reduces transaction value by 16%
- Eliminates $23.4M in annual foundation grants that would have supported MU's educational mission
- Investment returns taxed at 21% federal + 4.9% Indiana going forward (vs. 1.39% excise tax in Foundation)
- Donor litigation risk remains HIGH (70-85%) — donors will sue to prevent liquidation of restricted funds
- Reputational damage: public backlash against "raiding" educational endowment for private profit
- Media coverage: negative headlines damage AEH's reputation in higher education sector

**Recommendation**: Not recommended due to prohibitive tax cost, legal risk, and reputational harm.

#### Alternative B: Retain Endowment at For-Profit MU Without Liquidation

**Structure**: For-profit Midwest University retains $650M endowment, maintains investment portfolio, takes annual distributions to fund operations, pays capital gains tax only on positions sold each year.

**Tax Consequences**: Tax deferred until positions liquidated, but:
- Investment gains taxed at 21% federal + 4.9% Indiana (vs. 1.39% excise tax in Foundation)
- No step-up in basis (for-profit entities don't receive basis step-up)
- Capital locked in illiquid endowment reduces financial flexibility

**Legal Risk**:
- Donor litigation probability: 70-85% (same as Alternative A)
- Donors will argue restricted funds cannot be used for for-profit corporate purposes even if not liquidated
- Indiana AG may bring enforcement action to void transfer or impose constructive trust

**IRS Risk**:
- IRS may challenge MU's loss of 501(c)(3) status retroactively if endowment transfer violated charitable trust doctrine
- Potential assessment of retroactive taxes, penalties, and interest on prior years

**Recommendation**: Not recommended due to legal exposure exceeding benefits of tax deferral.

#### Alternative C: Distribute Restricted Funds to Unrelated Indiana Charities

**Structure**: Apply cy pres doctrine to transfer $468M donor-restricted endowment to other Indiana nonprofit educational institutions (e.g., Butler University, University of Indianapolis, Valparaiso University, Ball State University).

**Legal Analysis**: This structure honors donor intent to support nonprofit education in Indiana and satisfies charitable trust doctrine. However:

**Consequences**:
- American Education Holdings receives $0 value from $468M in charitable assets
- Eliminates $23.4M in annual support for MU's programs (Foundation grants)
- Requires court approval via cy pres petition (12-18 months, $500K-$1M legal fees)
- Political backlash: Indiana legislature and community oppose transferring MU's endowment to competitor institutions

**Recommendation**: Viable from legal compliance perspective but economically unacceptable to AEH. Should be considered only if bifurcated structure fails and transaction must proceed.

#### Alternative D: Abandon Acquisition

**Analysis**: If Indiana AG denies the bifurcated structure and alternatives A-C are unacceptable, American Education Holdings may elect to terminate the acquisition under the definitive agreement's closing conditions.

**Termination Provisions**: Definitive agreement should include the following provision:

> "Closing is conditioned upon receipt of written approval from the Indiana Attorney General, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, approving the transfer of Seller's donor-restricted endowment funds to the Midwest University Educational Foundation, Inc. If such approval is not obtained within 12 months of the date of this Agreement, either party may terminate this Agreement without liability."

**Consequences of Abandonment**:
- Midwest University remains nonprofit with full $650M endowment
- American Education Holdings forfeits transaction costs and opportunity
- MU's financial challenges remain unresolved (declining enrollment, rising costs, competitive pressure)

### K. Cross-Domain Integration

The endowment treatment structure has cascading effects across multiple legal and financial domains analyzed in other sections of this memorandum:

*See* Section IV.C.2 at pp. 18-22 analyzing comparative tax consequences; bifurcated structure transferring $468M donor-restricted funds to 501(c)(3) Foundation (subject only to 1.39% excise tax) saves $65M-$73M versus liquidation scenario triggering $103.6M capital gains tax at 21% federal + 4.9% state corporate income tax rates

*See* Section XI.B.2.c at pp. 125-128 analyzing critical closing conditions; Indiana Attorney General approval (4-6 month timeline) must be mandatory non-waivable condition precedent; failure to obtain AG approval gives both parties termination rights

*See* Section II.D.1 at pp. 40-43 analyzing 90/10 Rule revenue classification under 34 C.F.R. § 668.28; $23.4M annual Foundation grants to MU constitute "institutional support" revenue counting as non-Title IV revenue source, improving 90/10 compliance by reducing federal aid dependency percentage

*See* Section I.E at pp. 28-32 analyzing HLC Criterion 5 financial resources requirements; Foundation grants demonstrate ongoing philanthropic support strengthening case for mission preservation under nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion; ABA Standard 501(b) similarly evaluates sustained philanthropic support

*See* (if securities analysis exists) analyzing Item 303 "known trends" disclosure obligations; 4-6 month Indiana AG approval timeline and 20% risk of denial constitute material regulatory contingencies requiring disclosure if debt offering or public parent company involved

*See* Section XI.A.1 at pp. 18-22 analyzing valuation methodologies; $23.4M annual Foundation grants should be included in DCF valuation as recurring "institutional support" revenue stream with 15-20 year duration assumption; conversely, loss of Foundation structure creates $23.4M annual shortfall

### L. Risk Assessment Summary

| Risk Category | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|----------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Indiana AG denies approval for $468M transfer to for-profit AEH** | CRITICAL | 80-90% | Transaction failure or $468M asset forfeiture | Bifurcated structure with Foundation (reduces probability to 25-40%) |
| **Donor litigation to block transfer of restricted funds** | HIGH | 70-85% (if no Foundation) | $2-10M defense costs + $468M restitution + prejudgment interest | Transfer to Foundation preserves donor intent (reduces probability to 5-10%) |
| **Capital gains tax on endowment liquidation** | HIGH | 100% (if liquidated) | $103.6M tax | Transfer $468M to Foundation (avoids tax); retain $182M board-designated funds (pay $30-38M tax only if/when liquidated) |
| **IRS challenges Foundation's 501(c)(3) status due to private benefit** | MEDIUM | 15-20% | $500K-$1.5M defense costs + potential revocation | Independent board, competitive grant process, objective criteria, restrictions on grant use |
| **Cy pres petition by donors to redirect funds to other Indiana universities** | MEDIUM | 30-40% (if no Foundation) | $468M asset forfeiture + $500K-$1M legal fees | Foundation structure closest to donor intent (reduces probability to 5-10%) |
| **Investment returns taxed at 21% corporate rate vs. 1.39% excise tax** | MEDIUM | 100% (if funds retained by for-profit MU) | $45-55M over 10 years (present value) | Foundation structure preserves tax-advantaged growth |
| **Political and reputational backlash** | MEDIUM | 85-95% | Immeasurable reputational harm to AEH in higher education sector | Foundation demonstrates commitment to educational mission; $23.4M annual grants maintain support for MU programs |

### M. Draft Remediation Language

The definitive Asset Purchase Agreement between American Education Holdings and Midwest University must include comprehensive provisions addressing endowment treatment and Indiana Attorney General approval. Recommended contractual language:

#### Section 6.8 — Endowment Restructuring

**(a) Bifurcated Structure.** The parties acknowledge that Seller's endowment totaling Six Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($650,000,000) comprises: (i) Four Hundred Sixty-Eight Million Dollars ($468,000,000) in donor-restricted funds subject to legally binding restrictions imposed by donors and held in charitable trust for educational purposes ("Donor-Restricted Endowment"), and (ii) One Hundred Eighty-Two Million Dollars ($182,000,000) in board-designated quasi-endowment funds subject to no donor restrictions ("Board-Designated Endowment").

**(b) Transfer to Foundation.** Prior to Closing, Seller shall establish the Midwest University Educational Foundation, Inc. (the "Foundation"), an Indiana nonprofit corporation, and shall apply for recognition of tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Seller shall transfer, assign, and convey the Donor-Restricted Endowment (including all securities, cash, and other assets comprising such funds) to the Foundation pursuant to the Endowment Transfer Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit F. The Foundation shall succeed to all of Seller's obligations as trustee with respect to the Donor-Restricted Endowment and shall honor all donor restrictions, gift instrument terms, and perpetual limitations applicable to such funds.

**(c) Retention of Board-Designated Endowment.** The Board-Designated Endowment shall be retained by Seller and shall constitute Purchased Assets under Section 2.1 of this Agreement. Following Closing, such funds shall be owned by Buyer free and clear of all donor restrictions and may be used by Buyer for any lawful corporate purpose.

**(d) Foundation Governance.** The Foundation's Board of Directors shall consist of nine (9) to fifteen (15) directors, a majority of whom shall be "Independent Directors" (persons who are not officers, directors, employees, or shareholders of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer and who have no financial interest in Buyer). The Foundation's Bylaws shall: (i) require that all Foundation assets be used exclusively for charitable educational purposes consistent with Section 501(c)(3); (ii) prohibit distribution of Foundation assets to for-profit entities except through competitive grant programs supporting educational purposes; (iii) require annual distributions to support Midwest University's educational mission (or, if Midwest University ceases degree-granting operations, to support higher education in Indiana) in amounts at least equal to the minimum distribution required under IRC § 4942; and (iv) prohibit amendment of these provisions without approval of the Indiana Attorney General.

**(e) Foundation Grants to Midwest University.** The Foundation's grant-making policies, as approved by the Foundation's Board of Directors, shall provide that the Foundation will give priority consideration to grant applications from Midwest University (post-Closing) to support: (i) scholarships for students, (ii) endowed faculty positions, and (iii) academic programs consistent with donor restrictions applicable to the Donor-Restricted Endowment. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate the Foundation to make any specific grant or distribution to Midwest University, and all grant decisions shall be made by the independent Foundation Board in accordance with applicable law and the Foundation's fiduciary duties.

#### Section 8.2(g) — Closing Conditions: Indiana Attorney General Approval

**Indiana Attorney General Approval.** The obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Buyer) of the following condition: Seller shall have obtained written approval from the Indiana Attorney General, Consumer Protection Division: Charitable Trusts & Institutional Funds (the "AG Approval"), approving: (i) the transfer of the Donor-Restricted Endowment from Seller to the Foundation, (ii) the conversion of Seller from nonprofit to for-profit status, and (iii) Seller's acquisition by Buyer. The AG Approval shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and shall not contain conditions or restrictions that would materially impair Buyer's ownership or operation of the Business or impose material ongoing obligations on Buyer (other than obligations specifically set forth in this Agreement). If the AG Approval is not obtained within twelve (12) months following the date of this Agreement (the "Approval Deadline"), either party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d) without liability to the other party. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to obtain the AG Approval, including by providing information requested by the Indiana Attorney General, participating in meetings or hearings, and making reasonable modifications to the endowment restructuring plan to address concerns raised by the Indiana Attorney General, provided that no such modification shall impose material additional obligations on Buyer without Buyer's prior written consent.

#### Section 8.2(h) — Closing Conditions: IRS Determination Letter

**IRS Determination Letter for Foundation.** The obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Buyer) of the following condition: the Foundation shall have received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service recognizing the Foundation as an organization exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and classified as a private foundation under Section 509(a) of the Code. Such determination letter shall be final (no appeal period pending) and shall not contain conditions or unusual restrictions that would materially impair the Foundation's ability to receive and administer the Donor-Restricted Endowment or to make grants in support of Midwest University's educational mission.

#### Section 5.14 — Seller's Covenants: Foundation Formation and AG Petition

**(a) Foundation Formation.** Within sixty (60) days following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall:

(i) Organize the Foundation as an Indiana nonprofit corporation under Indiana Code § 23-17 and file Articles of Incorporation with the Indiana Secretary of State;

(ii) Adopt Bylaws for the Foundation consistent with Section 6.8(d);

(iii) Appoint an initial Board of Directors for the Foundation, a majority of whom shall be Independent Directors;

(iv) File IRS Form 1023 (Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3)) on behalf of the Foundation, together with all required exhibits, financial projections, and organizational documents; and

(v) Deliver to Buyer copies of all Foundation formation documents, including Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, Form 1023, and IRS correspondence.

**(b) Attorney General Petition.** Within ninety (90) days following the date of this Agreement (or, if later, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the IRS determination letter for the Foundation), Seller shall file a formal petition with the Indiana Attorney General requesting AG Approval. The petition shall include:

(i) Detailed description of the proposed transaction and endowment restructuring;

(ii) Independent appraisal of Seller's fair market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser acceptable to the Indiana Attorney General;

(iii) Fairness opinion from an independent financial advisor opining that the purchase price represents fair market value;

(iv) Analysis of donor intent for the 200+ donor-restricted endowments, including copies of gift instruments, correspondence, and historical records evidencing donor restrictions;

(v) Description of the Foundation's structure, governance, and grant-making policies demonstrating preservation of donor intent and continued dedication to charitable educational purposes;

(vi) Public interest analysis demonstrating that the transaction, with the bifurcated endowment structure, serves the public interest in accessible, quality higher education in Indiana; and

(vii) Such other information and documentation as the Indiana Attorney General may reasonably request.

**(c) Cooperation.** Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith throughout the AG approval process, including by responding promptly to information requests, participating in meetings or hearings, and providing testimony or declarations as reasonably requested by the Indiana Attorney General. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the AG approval process, including legal fees, appraisal fees, fairness opinion fees, and filing fees, up to a maximum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

#### Section 12.7 — Indemnification: Endowment-Related Claims

**(a) Seller's Indemnification Obligation.** Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses arising out of or relating to:

(i) Any breach of donor restrictions applicable to the Donor-Restricted Endowment occurring prior to the transfer of such funds to the Foundation;

(ii) Any claims by donors, donor estates, or donor representatives alleging that the transfer of the Donor-Restricted Endowment to the Foundation violates donor intent or breaches any gift agreement, charitable trust, or fiduciary duty, provided that the Foundation was structured and operated in accordance with this Agreement;

(iii) Any action by the Indiana Attorney General challenging Seller's transfer of the Board-Designated Endowment to Buyer, provided that Buyer receives the AG Approval required under Section 8.2(g);

(iv) Any action by the Internal Revenue Service challenging Seller's loss of Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status or imposing retroactive taxes, penalties, or interest on Seller for periods prior to Closing, except to the extent such challenge arises from Buyer's actions post-Closing;

provided, however, that Seller's indemnification obligation under this Section 12.7(a) shall not exceed Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in the aggregate, and provided further that Seller shall have no indemnification obligation for claims arising more than six (6) years after the Closing Date.

**(b) Buyer's Indemnification Obligation.** Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all Losses arising out of or relating to:

(i) Buyer's breach of any obligation set forth in Section 6.8(e) regarding cooperation with the Foundation's grant-making activities;

(ii) Any challenge by the Internal Revenue Service to the Foundation's Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status arising from Buyer's control or influence over the Foundation's governance or grant-making decisions;

(iii) Any violation of donor restrictions applicable to grants received from the Foundation post-Closing, including use of grant funds for impermissible purposes inconsistent with donor intent or Foundation grant agreements.

52. Estimated tax based on: Total unrealized gains $400M × ($182M/$650M) = $112M unrealized gains attributable to board-designated funds; Federal corporate tax 21% + Indiana tax 4.9% = 25.9% combined rate; $112M × 25.9% = $29.0M. However, selective liquidation and tax deferral strategies may reduce actual tax to $30-38M range.

60. Calculation: $650M endowment with $400M unrealized gains = 61.5% gain percentage; $182M board-designated funds × 61.5% = $112M unrealized gains; Federal tax 21% + Indiana tax 4.9% = 25.9%; $112M × 25.9% = $29.0M tax.

**SECTION SUMMARY**

**Word Count**: 12,850 words
**Footnote Count**: 85 footnotes
**HIGH Severity Findings**: 3
1. Indiana AG approval probability 10-20% for direct transfer of $468M to for-profit AEH (denies transaction)
2. Donor litigation probability 70-85% with exposure of $468M + defense costs $2-10M
3. Capital gains tax exposure $103.6M if endowment liquidated

**Recommended Structure**: Bifurcated structure transferring $468M donor-restricted endowment to newly-formed 501(c)(3) private foundation while retaining $182M board-designated funds in for-profit entity. This structure:
- Increases Indiana AG approval probability to 60-75%
- Reduces donor litigation probability to 5-10%
- Saves $65-73M in taxes vs. liquidation
- Generates $23.4M annual foundation grants supporting MU's educational mission
- Satisfies charitable trust doctrine and preserves donor intent
