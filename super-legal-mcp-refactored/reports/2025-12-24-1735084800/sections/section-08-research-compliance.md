## VIII. RESEARCH COMPLIANCE AND EXPORT CONTROL OBLIGATIONS

The proposed conversion of Midwest University from nonprofit to for-profit status creates substantial federal grant compliance and export control challenges that represent material transaction risks totaling $22.7M-$42.8M in weighted first-year impact, with five-year cumulative impact of $45M-$77M. MU currently maintains $68M in annual research expenditures, of which $52M (76%) derives from federal grants including 42 NIH awards ($28M), 28 NSF awards ($18M), and 2 DOD ITAR-controlled grants ($2M). The nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion triggers four critical risk categories: (1) loss of $10M-$20M in non-transferable federal grants restricted to nonprofit institutions; (2) reduction in federally negotiated indirect cost rate from 56% to 40-50%, representing $8.3M annual loss in worst case; (3) deemed export violations for 28 foreign nationals from China, Iran, and Russia, creating $5M-$15M penalty exposure; and (4) potential loss of fundamental research exemption from ITAR/EAR export controls, requiring $700K-$1.3M annual compliance investment. These risks are outcome-determinative for transaction structure and require comprehensive federal agency consultations, immediate export control audits, and consideration of nonprofit research subsidiary structure to preserve restricted grants and regulatory exemptions.

### A. Federal Research Portfolio and Grant Transferability

#### 1. Research Funding Structure and Federal Dependence

MU operates a substantial federally funded research enterprise comprising 70 active awards totaling $52M annually, representing 76% of total research expenditures ($68M).¹ The federal portfolio composition demonstrates heavy reliance on mission-driven agencies with explicit nonprofit preferences: NIH grants constitute $28M (54% of federal funding) across 42 active awards, NSF awards represent $18M (35% of federal funding) across 28 active awards, DOE funding contributes $4M (8%), and DOD provides $2M (4%) through 2 ITAR-controlled grants.² This funding concentration creates material transition risk, as certain federal grant mechanisms explicitly restrict recipient eligibility to nonprofit or domestic educational institutions, making transfer to a for-profit entity legally impossible regardless of research quality or institutional capacity.³

MU's research infrastructure supporting federal compliance includes an Institutional Review Board with 15 members overseeing 120 active human subjects protocols, an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee with 12 members reviewing 35 active animal research protocols, and a dedicated Export Control Officer (Dr. Patricia Anderson) managing 2 Technology Control Plans and 8 deemed export licenses for foreign nationals on ITAR-controlled projects.⁴ The institution maintains a federally negotiated indirect cost rate of 56% with DHHS Division of Cost Allocation, generating $29M annually in facilities and administrative cost recovery (56% × $52M direct costs).⁵ This comprehensive compliance infrastructure reflects MU's current status as a nonprofit research university operating under regulatory frameworks designed primarily for educational institutions rather than commercial enterprises.

#### 2. NIH Grant Transfer Restrictions: Non-Transferable Mechanisms

NIH grants may be awarded to organizations that are domestic or foreign, public or private, nonprofit or for-profit, unless specifically excluded by the funding opportunity announcement or program policy.⁶ However, comprehensive research into NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 18 reveals that certain grant mechanisms are explicitly restricted to nonprofit or domestic institutions and cannot be transferred to for-profit entities under any circumstances.⁷ The non-transferable grant categories include: (1) T32 Institutional Training Grants, restricted to domestic nonprofit institutions only; (2) K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Awards, limited to domestic institutions only; (3) P40 Animal Resource Grants, available only to domestic institutions; and (4) T35 Short-Term Institutional Research Training Grants, restricted to domestic nonprofit organizations.⁸

*See* Section I.C.2 at pp. 28-35 analyzing HLC Criterion 3.B.1-3 requiring sufficient resources for quality educational programs; loss of $5.6M-$11.2M in NIH T32/K01 training grants directly undermines doctoral program capacity, affecting Carnegie Research Classification (R2: High Research Activity) and HLC assessment of institutional resources to support graduate education under Criterion 3.B.1-2.

The practical implication for MU's $28M NIH portfolio is that any awards in these restricted categories must either be (1) relinquished to NIH with unexpended funds returned, or (2) transferred to a separate nonprofit research subsidiary created to maintain institutional eligibility.⁹ Without a detailed grant mechanism inventory cataloging each of MU's 42 NIH grants by activity code (R01, R21, T32, K01, P40, etc.), the acquisition team cannot quantify the precise funding at risk. If training and career development grants represent 20-40% of NIH funding—typical for research universities with doctoral programs—then $5.6M to $11.2M annually is at immediate risk of loss upon for-profit conversion.¹⁰ This funding loss cascades into additional impacts: graduate student stipend capacity reduces proportionally, faculty research support decreases, and institutional competitiveness for future NIH awards declines as training grant infrastructure disappears.

Research project grants (R01, R21, R03, R15) constitute the majority of NIH funding at most universities and CAN be transferred to for-profit entities.¹¹ However, critical restrictions apply: NIH will not provide profit or fee under grant mechanisms (profit/fee only allowed for SBIR/STTR and contract mechanisms), all costs must satisfy allowability standards under 2 CFR Part 200, and enhanced cost scrutiny applies to allocation between federal awards and commercial activities.¹² For-profit recipients also face heightened financial conflict of interest management requirements, as the institutional interest in commercializing research creates inherent conflicts requiring robust management plans reported to NIH through the eRA Commons FCOI Module.¹³

#### 3. NSF Award Transfer Requirements and Enhanced Scrutiny

NSF awards may be made to for-profit organizations unless specifically excluded by program solicitation, but transfer requires prior NSF approval via formal change of institution process governed by 2 CFR § 200.308 and NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide Chapter VI.¹⁴ The regulatory framework establishes three approval criteria that NSF Program Officers evaluate: (1) the project has been relinquished by original institution before project performance period expiration, (2) facilities and resources at new institution allow successful project performance, and (3) the principal investigator plans no significant change in research objectives and level of expenditures.¹⁵ While these criteria appear facially neutral to tax status, NSF Program Officers retain substantial discretion to scrutinize whether for-profit acquisition compromises the fundamental research nature of projects, the broader impacts mission (education, diversity, outreach), or data sharing and publication commitments that NSF considers core to its mission.¹⁶

The transfer process timeline creates material closing risk: preliminary approval requires PI notification to NSF Program Office 90-120 days before anticipated transfer date, followed by 60-90 days for formal approval processing after submission of relinquishing statement from original institution, transfer application from receiving institution via Research.gov, updated budget for remaining project period, and certification of facilities and administrative capability.¹⁷ Total minimum lead time is 6 months before closing, with no guarantee of approval. NSF's enhanced scrutiny of for-profit transfers reflects policy concerns that commercial entities may prioritize proprietary research over open publication, restrict foreign national participation for competitive reasons rather than security mandates, or redirect broader impacts activities toward profit-generating ventures rather than public education and outreach.¹⁸

*See* Section I.C.2 at pp. 28-35 analyzing HLC Criterion 3.B.3 ("The institution demonstrates that its educational programs engage students in collecting, analyzing, and communicating information; in mastering modes of inquiry or creative work; and in developing skills adaptable to changing environments"); NSF broader impacts mission (education, diversity, outreach) directly aligns with HLC requirements for external engagement, making NSF grant loss evidence of reduced institutional capacity under Criterion 3.B.

Individual NSF awards may contain program-specific restrictions limiting eligibility to nonprofit institutions, particularly in education and outreach-focused programs. Without award-by-award review of Special Terms and Conditions for all 28 NSF awards totaling $18M, the acquisition team cannot definitively determine transfer eligibility for the entire portfolio.¹⁹ Conservative risk assessment suggests 10-30% of NSF funding ($1.8M-$5.4M annually) may face transfer challenges requiring either relinquishment or nonprofit subsidiary structure, compounding the NIH grant loss exposure.

#### 4. Indirect Cost Rate Renegotiation and Revenue Impact

MU's current federally negotiated indirect cost rate of 56% on modified total direct costs generates $29M annually in facilities and administrative cost recovery, representing 43% of total research budget ($68M) and funding critical infrastructure including research administration, compliance offices, library resources, and facilities maintenance.²⁰ For-profit entities negotiate indirect cost rates with the same federal cognizant agencies (DHHS Division of Cost Allocation for MU), but historical data demonstrates that for-profit rates typically range 40-50%, lower than research university rates of 50-60%.²¹ The rate differential reflects multiple factors: (1) commercial activities dilute the research-focused rate base, (2) certain facilities and administrative costs become unallowable or less defensible for for-profit entities, (3) enhanced scrutiny applies to cost allocation between federal awards and commercial operations, and (4) profit-motivated expense categories receive greater skepticism regarding necessity for research performance.²²

Financial impact scenarios for indirect cost rate reduction create substantial revenue risk:

| Rate Scenario | New Rate | Annual IDC Recovery | Annual Loss | 5-Year Impact |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Optimistic** | 56% (maintain) | $29M | $0 | $0 |
| **Likely** | 50% | $26M | $3.1M | $15.5M |
| **Conservative** | 45% | $23.4M | $5.6M | $28M |
| **Worst Case** | 40% | $20.8M | $8.2M | $41M |

The likely case scenario assuming rate reduction to 50% results in $3.1M annual loss, while worst case reduction to 40% produces $8.2M annual loss, representing 12% of total research budget.²³ These losses compound over time as reduced infrastructure investment degrades research capacity, making future grant competitions less competitive. DHHS Division of Cost Allocation is under no obligation to maintain nonprofit-level rates for for-profit entities, and rate negotiations typically require 12-18 months to complete through submission of updated Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement proposal, review by federal cognizant agency, site visit to verify cost allocation methodology, and final rate determination.²⁴

Mitigation strategy requires initiating rate renegotiation before closing the acquisition to lock in the highest defensible rate for a 2-4 year period, providing revenue stability during the post-acquisition transition.²⁵ The acquisition agreement should include purchase price adjustment provisions if the negotiated rate falls below 50%, allocating the financial risk of rate reduction to the parties based on negotiated allocation formulas tied to final DHHS determination.

### B. Export Control Compliance Framework and Deemed Export Requirements

#### 1. ITAR Regulatory Framework and MU's Controlled Research

The International Traffic in Arms Regulations, codified at 22 CFR Parts 120-130 and administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls within the U.S. Department of State, implement the Arms Export Control Act and control the export and import of defense articles designated on the U.S. Munitions List, defense services involving assistance or training with respect to defense articles, and technical data required for design, development, production, manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance, or modification of defense articles.²⁶ As of December 2025, Title 22 CFR is current through November 7, 2025 amendments that removed certain items from the USML that no longer warrant inclusion and added items requiring control.²⁷

MU conducts defense-related research under 2 DOD grants totaling $2M in materials science and propulsion systems, subject to ITAR jurisdiction under USML Categories IV (launch vehicles, guided missiles, rockets) and XIII (materials, coatings, treatments).²⁸ Current compliance infrastructure includes 2 active Technology Control Plans specifying security measures for export-controlled technology from delivery through return/disposal when projects complete, and 8 deemed export licenses authorizing foreign nationals to access ITAR technical data under controlled conditions.²⁹ Dr. Patricia Anderson serves as Export Control Officer with responsibility for TCP oversight, foreign national screening, and DDTC reporting obligations.³⁰

Technology Control Plans require four critical components to satisfy DDTC compliance expectations: (1) personnel restrictions limiting access to U.S. persons (citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylees) with all personnel screened against denied parties lists before access and documented certification of understanding TCP requirements; (2) physical security through controlled access areas with locked laboratories, badge access systems, secure storage for ITAR documents and hardware, visitor logs and escort procedures, and signage identifying controlled areas; (3) information security including encrypted electronic storage, secure transmission protocols, access controls for computers containing ITAR data, and prohibition on cloud storage without DDTC approval; and (4) monitoring and audits with PI review of TCP annually, updates for personnel changes reported to Export Control Officer, internal audits of compliance, and correction of deficiencies within defined timeframes.³¹ MU's current TCPs were enhanced following the 2021 ITAR violation incident and include quarterly audits instead of the standard annual review, demonstrating heightened compliance commitment.³²

#### 2. Prior ITAR Violation and Penalty Exposure for Future Violations

In 2021, MU experienced an ITAR violation when ITAR-controlled technical data was shared with a Chinese postdoctoral researcher without the required deemed export license.³³ MU immediately conducted voluntary self-disclosure to DDTC, which resulted in a warning letter with no monetary penalty due to: (1) immediate voluntary disclosure upon discovery, (2) comprehensive cooperation providing all requested information within the 60-day supplemental period, (3) prompt implementation of corrective actions before DDTC request, and (4) demonstration that this was an isolated incident rather than systemic noncompliance.³⁴ DDTC's voluntary disclosure policy under 22 CFR § 127.12 strongly encourages self-disclosure and considers it a mitigating factor in determining administrative penalties, and MU's compliance with all mitigation criteria resulted in penalty avoidance estimated at $1.2M (the 2021 civil penalty level per violation).³⁵

*See* Section X.F analyzing insurance coverage implications; prior 2021 ITAR violation and potential future export control penalties ranging $5M-$15M constitute "wrongful acts" under D&O policy definitions that may trigger notice obligations under claims-made policies, potentially affecting coverage availability and premium pricing for post-acquisition D&O tail coverage estimated at $1M-$1.5M for 6-year extended reporting period.

Corrective actions implemented following the 2021 violation substantially enhanced MU's export control program: (1) revised TCP procedures with additional access controls, increased physical security through badge access and visitor logs, enhanced information security with encrypted storage and transmission protocols, and quarterly TCP audits replacing annual reviews; (2) mandatory pre-hire export control screening for all foreign national hires against Entity List, Denied Persons List, Unverified List, and OFAC Specially Designated Nationals List; (3) enhanced training programs including mandatory ITAR/EAR training for all researchers with potential controlled technology access, annual refresher training, special training for principal investigators on TCP requirements, and export control awareness for department chairs and deans; and (4) compliance monitoring through quarterly audits of TCP compliance, annual export control program review, incident reporting procedures, and escalation protocols for potential violations.³⁶ Four years of clean compliance record since 2021 demonstrates program effectiveness, but ongoing vigilance remains critical.³⁷

Current ITAR civil penalties as of 2025 are $1,271,078 per violation, or twice the value of the transaction that is the basis for the violation, whichever is greater.³⁸ Criminal penalties for willful unlawful export or disclosure include up to 10 years imprisonment and/or $1,000,000 fine per violation.³⁹ Additional consequences include debarment (prohibition from participating in export of defense articles), loss of export privileges (inability to engage in ITAR-controlled activities), and reputational damage through public disclosure of violations.⁴⁰ Aggravating factors for future violations create enhanced penalty risk: (1) prior 2021 warning letter is on file with DDTC, establishing knowledge of regulatory requirements and prior noncompliance; (2) repeat violations receive reduced mitigation credit for voluntary disclosure, as demonstrated compliance system failures suggest inadequacy; (3) recent enforcement trends show DDTC hardening voluntary disclosure policies, as evidenced by the L3Harris 2024 case where DDTC stated that voluntary disclosures directly related to ongoing investigations may not receive mitigation credit; and (4) for-profit status may trigger stricter enforcement scrutiny based on perception of commercial motivations compromising security compliance.⁴¹

#### 3. Deemed Export Compliance Gap: 28 Foreign Nationals

ITAR regulations define "export" at 22 CFR § 120.17 to include deemed exports: the release of technology or technical data subject to ITAR to a foreign person in the United States is deemed to be an export to that foreign person's most recent country of citizenship or permanent residency.⁴² Similarly, EAR provisions at 15 CFR § 734.13 treat release of technology or source code subject to EAR to a foreign national in the United States as a deemed export to the foreign national's country.⁴³ A "foreign person" under both ITAR and EAR means any person who is not a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident (green card holder), protected individual (refugee, asylee), or granted amnesty.⁴⁴

MU employs 28 foreign national faculty and postdoctoral researchers from countries of export control concern: China (12 researchers), Iran (8 researchers), Russia (5 researchers), and other countries (3 researchers).⁴⁵ Current documentation shows only 8 deemed export licenses issued for foreign nationals on ITAR-controlled projects, creating a critical compliance gap for the remaining 20 foreign nationals without documented licenses.⁴⁶ Four possible explanations exist for this discrepancy: (1) those 20 individuals work exclusively on fundamental research qualifying for exemption under 22 CFR § 120.11(8) and 15 CFR § 734.8, requiring no licenses; (2) those 20 individuals work only with EAR99 items or uncontrolled technology not on the Commerce Control List, requiring no licenses; (3) country/technology combinations for those 20 individuals do not trigger license requirements under applicable exemptions or exclusions; or (4) those 20 individuals require but lack deemed export licenses, representing ongoing violations.⁴⁷

If explanation (4) applies to all 20 unlicensed foreign nationals, penalty exposure could reach $25.4M (20 persons × $1,271,078 per violation).⁴⁸ Even if only 5-10 individuals represent actual violations rather than properly exempted activities, exposure ranges $6.4M-$12.7M. The probability assessment depends critically on immediate comprehensive audit determining: (1) current research activities and technology access for each individual, (2) ECCN classification of all technology accessed, (3) exemption status under fundamental research provisions, (4) screening results against Entity List, Denied Persons List, Unverified List, and OFAC SDN List, and (5) institutional collaborations that may involve Entity List entities triggering license requirements.⁴⁹

Countries of concern breakdown reveals differential risk levels requiring tailored compliance approaches:

**Iran (8 researchers):** Comprehensive embargo with E:1 designation under EAR 15 CFR § 746.7 requires license for virtually all exports/reexports to Iran with very limited exceptions.⁵⁰ Iranian nationals working on any ECCN-controlled technology require deemed export licenses unless fundamental research exemption applies. This represents CRITICAL RISK requiring immediate verification of exemption status or license coverage.

**Russia (5 researchers):** Comprehensive export restrictions with E:1 designation since 2022 Ukraine invasion under EAR 15 CFR § 746.5 subject Russian nationals to heightened scrutiny.⁵¹ Entity List includes numerous Russian institutions, and deemed exports to Russian nationals working on controlled technology face stringent licensing requirements. This represents HIGH RISK requiring careful analysis of technology access and potential Entity List connections.

**China (12 researchers):** While not comprehensively embargoed, extensive controls target specific technology areas. BIS Entity List includes numerous Chinese universities and research institutes, with 2025 additions targeting quantum technology, artificial intelligence, advanced computing, and aerospace research.⁵² China's Military-Civil Fusion Strategy creates presumption of military end-use for technology transfers, and collaboration with Entity List institutions is prohibited without BIS license.⁵³ This represents HIGH RISK particularly for technology research areas matching recent Entity List additions such as quantum computing, AI/machine learning, advanced materials, and aerospace applications.

*See* Section IX.D at pp. 245-260 analyzing international faculty employment and visa sponsorship obligations; restriction or termination of 28 foreign national researchers (12 Chinese, 8 Iranian, 5 Russian, 3 other) from export-controlled research affects faculty composition, tenure obligations under faculty handbook, and institutional capacity to recruit internationally competitive researchers, potentially triggering wrongful termination claims estimated at $2.8M-$8.4M (1-3 years salary × 28 individuals) if implemented without proper cause documentation.

#### 4. Fundamental Research Exemption: Transaction Outcome-Determinative Issue

Both ITAR and EAR provide critical exemptions for university fundamental research that enable institutions to employ foreign nationals without obtaining individual deemed export licenses. ITAR exemption at 22 CFR § 120.11(8) defines "fundamental research" as basic and applied research in science and engineering at accredited U.S. institutions of higher learning where results ordinarily will be published and shared broadly within the scientific community.⁵⁴ EAR exemption at 15 CFR § 734.8 provides that technology or software that arises during or results from fundamental research and is intended to be published is not subject to the EAR.⁵⁵ Both exemptions require: (1) research conducted at accredited university, (2) results ordinarily published and shared broadly, (3) no restrictions on publication or dissemination, (4) no prepublication review by sponsor, and (5) researchers have not accepted restrictions for proprietary or national security reasons.⁵⁶

The fundamental research exemption is the primary mechanism allowing universities to employ foreign nationals on research projects without massive compliance burden, dramatically reducing licensing requirements and enabling open scientific collaboration that is core to academic research mission.⁵⁷ Loss of this exemption creates operational catastrophe: (1) all research involving defense articles under ITAR or controlled dual-use items under EAR requires authorization; (2) all 28 foreign nationals require individual deemed export licenses (current: only 8); (3) export classification required for all research projects before foreign national access; (4) Technology Control Plans required for all controlled research (current: only 2); (5) severe restrictions on international collaboration limiting competitiveness; (6) publication delays for mandatory export control pre-publication reviews; and (7) ITAR registration may become mandatory ($3,000 annual fee plus substantial reporting burden).⁵⁸

For-profit conversion creates multiple challenges to maintaining fundamental research exemption eligibility:

| Factor | Nonprofit University | For-Profit MU | Exemption Impact |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Educational mission** | Primary institutional purpose | Secondary to profit motive | ⚠️ Weakens presumption of research focus |
| **Publication commitment** | Strong presumption of open publication | Commercial interests may restrict | ⚠️ Creates doubt about dissemination |
| **Accreditation status** | Standard for universities | Must maintain accreditation | ⚠️ Uncertain if for-profit affects regulatory view |
| **Proprietary restrictions** | Typically minimal | Profit motive suggests IP protection | ⚠️ Contradicts "no restrictions" requirement |
| **Regulatory interpretation** | Well-established for nonprofit | Ambiguous for for-profit | ⚠️ Risk of adverse DDTC/BIS determination |

Neither ITAR nor EAR explicitly addresses whether for-profit universities qualify for fundamental research exemption, and DDTC and BIS have not issued definitive guidance on this question.⁵⁹ The exemption language focuses on "accredited institutions of higher learning" and "ordinarily published" results, not tax status per se. However, for-profit status creates a rebuttable presumption that research serves commercial purposes with proprietary restrictions, shifting burden to the institution to demonstrate that fundamental research characteristics remain despite profit motive.⁶⁰ Regulatory ambiguity requires proactive consultation with DDTC and BIS before closing to obtain written guidance on exemption availability, conditions for maintaining exemption, and enhanced compliance requirements if exemption status becomes uncertain.

If fundamental research exemption is lost, compliance cost impact totals $700K-$1.3M annually: deemed export licenses ($50K-$100K in legal fees for 20+ additional licenses), export classifications ($100K-$200K for classifying all research projects to determine ECCN status), compliance staffing increase from 1 FTE to 3-5 FTE ($300K-$500K), comprehensive training programs ($50K-$100K), and IT security system upgrades for ITAR/EAR data segregation and protection ($200K-$400K).⁶¹ Operational impacts compound financial costs: 3-6 month delays in hiring foreign nationals pending license approvals reduce recruitment competitiveness, reduced competitiveness for international graduate students harms doctoral program quality, faculty attrition if compliance burden perceived as excessive threatens research capacity, loss of research competitiveness in international collaborations limits funding opportunities, and potential loss of non-ITAR federal funding if universities determine compliance burden makes projects infeasible.⁶²

### C. NIH Grant Compliance Requirements Under For-Profit Status

#### 1. Financial Conflict of Interest Enhanced Scrutiny

Federal regulations at 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F establish standards to ensure that design, conduct, and reporting of NIH-funded research is free from bias resulting from investigator financial conflicts of interest, applying to each institution receiving PHS research funding by means of grant or cooperative agreement.⁶³ The 2011 Final Rule effective August 24, 2012 remains current as of 2025 and requires institutions to maintain written FCOI policies including: designation of institutional official to solicit and review disclosures, mechanisms for researchers to report significant financial interests (SFI threshold $5,000), procedures to identify and manage FCOIs before expenditure of funds, and enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance.⁶⁴ Each investigator must disclose SFIs to the institution at time of application for PHS funding, annually during award period, and within 30 days of discovering or acquiring a new SFI.⁶⁵

Significant financial interests under 42 CFR § 50.603 include: remuneration from any entity exceeding $5,000 in preceding 12 months, equity interest exceeding $5,000 or representing more than 5% ownership, and intellectual property rights and interests.⁶⁶ When an FCOI exists, the institution must develop and implement a management plan before expenditure of funds, which may include public disclosure of FCOIs, monitoring of research by independent reviewers, modification of research plan, disqualification from participation in affected research, divestiture of financial interests, or severance of relationships creating the conflict.⁶⁷ Institutions must report FCOIs to NIH through the eRA Commons FCOI Module prior to expenditure of funds, within 60 days of identification for existing awards, with annual FCOI reports during project period, and public accessibility of FCOI information available via written request within 5 business days.⁶⁸

For-profit acquisition creates heightened FCOI scrutiny due to inherent institutional financial interests in research outcomes. While nonprofit MU's FCOI management focuses primarily on individual investigator conflicts, for-profit MU faces institutional-level conflicts where the parent company's profit motive creates financial interest in commercializing research results, potentially biasing study design, data interpretation, or publication decisions toward commercially favorable outcomes.⁶⁹ NIH may require enhanced monitoring and management plans including: independent data safety monitoring boards for clinical trials, external publication review committees to ensure negative results are published, institutional conflict of interest committees with external members, and enhanced disclosure requirements in publications and presentations acknowledging corporate ownership.⁷⁰ Training requirements mandate FCOI training prior to engaging in PHS-funded research, every 4 years, immediately when institutional policy changes, and within reasonable time after non-compliance.⁷¹

#### 2. Human Subjects Protection and IRB Independence

Federal regulations at 45 CFR Part 46 contain the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, commonly known as the "Common Rule," codified by 15 federal departments and agencies and current as of December 19, 2025.⁷² The 2018 revisions effective January 21, 2019 established updated requirements for IRB composition, informed consent, and single IRB requirements for multi-site research.⁷³ IRB composition requirements at 45 CFR § 46.107 mandate: at least 5 members with varying backgrounds, at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas, at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas, at least one member not affiliated with the institution and not part of immediate family of affiliated persons, and members with competence to review specific research activities.⁷⁴ MU's current IRB with 15 members reviewing 120 active protocols exceeds minimum composition requirements.⁷⁵

Single IRB requirements effective January 25, 2018 for all NIH-funded multi-site research and January 19, 2020 for all federally funded multi-site research require use of a single IRB-of-Record rather than institution-by-institution review.⁷⁶ The 2018 Common Rule revisions also updated informed consent requirements to emphasize that key information must be presented first and organized/presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.⁷⁷ Three levels of IRB review apply: exempt research for certain low-risk categories, expedited review by IRB chair or designated member for minimal risk research, and full board review required for research involving more than minimal risk.⁷⁸

For-profit acquisition creates IRB independence concerns that NIH will scrutinize carefully. IRB members must maintain independence from financial interests that could bias human subjects protection decisions, but for-profit ownership creates institutional pressure to approve research that generates revenue or advances commercial objectives.⁷⁹ Enhanced conflict-of-interest screening for IRB members becomes necessary, potentially requiring: exclusion of IRB members with financial interests in parent company, addition of community representatives without institutional affiliation, external IRB member participation for commercially significant research, and documented procedures ensuring IRB autonomy from corporate management pressure.⁸⁰ NIH may impose special terms and conditions on awards requiring enhanced IRB oversight, external audit of IRB decisions, or NIH prior approval for protocol modifications if concerns arise about commercial pressure compromising human subjects protection.⁸¹

#### 3. Animal Welfare and IACUC Compliance

Two federal mandates govern institutional animal care and use: Animal Welfare Act codified at 9 CFR Subchapter A and enforced by USDA, and Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.⁸² PHS Policy requires institutions with PHS Assurance to base animal care programs on the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and comply with applicable USDA regulations under the Animal Welfare Act, with USDA regulatory compliance being an absolute requirement of PHS Policy.⁸³ IACUC responsibilities under 9 CFR § 2.31 include: review and approve/deny all animal use protocols before work commences, inspect all animal facilities at least once every 6 months using 9 CFR Subchapter A as evaluation basis, review the institution's program for humane care and use of animals every 6 months, make recommendations to institutional official regarding animal care and use, and review concerns involving care and use of animals at the research facility.⁸⁴

MU's current IACUC with 12 members reviewing 35 active protocols provides adequate composition for regulatory compliance.⁸⁵ Post-acquisition compliance requires IACUC oversight to continue unchanged, but PHS Assurance status must be maintained or renegotiated if institutional status changes from nonprofit to for-profit.⁸⁶ The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare within NIH issues PHS Assurances to institutions conducting animal research, and change from nonprofit to for-profit status triggers requirement to file updated Assurance documenting: continued adherence to PHS Policy, IACUC composition and procedures, veterinary care program, occupational health and safety program for personnel, and training programs.⁸⁷ While for-profit status does not preclude IACUC compliance or PHS Assurance eligibility, renegotiation process requires 90-180 days and creates risk of enhanced monitoring or special conditions imposed by OLAW during transition period.⁸⁸

#### 4. NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy

NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy effective January 25, 2023 requires all grant applications generating scientific data to include a Data Management and Sharing Plan with maximum 2 pages addressing: data type (description of scientific data to be generated), related tools/software/code (tools needed to access or manipulate data), standards (applicable data/metadata standards), data preservation/access/timelines (where data will be archived, how long, when sharing occurs), access/distribution/reuse considerations (factors affecting data sharing including privacy, IP, pathogens), and oversight (who will be responsible for compliance).⁸⁹ Scientific data means data commonly accepted in scientific community as sufficient quality to validate and replicate research findings, excluding laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, case report forms, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, and physical objects.⁹⁰

ICO-approved DMSP becomes a Term and Condition of Notice of Award and is a "living document" that can be updated with ICO approval, with researchers documenting compliance in annual Research Performance Progress Reports.⁹¹ Beginning October 1, 2024, RPPRs include standard questions on data sharing status, repositories used, and unique identifiers.⁹² Costs for data management and sharing are allowable and should be requested in budget justification, with NIH no longer requiring single DMS cost line item as of October 5, 2023, allowing DMS costs to be requested across multiple cost categories if incurred during performance period.⁹³

For-profit status creates tension with NIH's data sharing requirements: NIH requires open data sharing through public repositories with specified timelines, but commercial interests favor proprietary control of data to protect competitive advantages and facilitate patent applications.⁹⁴ This conflict requires careful policy development ensuring: institutional commitment to data sharing matching nonprofit standards, documented procedures separating federally funded research data (must be shared) from proprietary commercial research data (can be protected), publication policies requiring timely dissemination of NIH-funded results regardless of commercial implications, and training for investigators on data sharing obligations that supersede institutional commercial interests.⁹⁵ NIH may scrutinize DMSPs from for-profit entities more carefully to ensure data will be truly publicly accessible rather than subject to commercial restrictions, potentially requiring: specification of maximum allowable embargo periods (e.g., 6-12 months post-publication), identification of specific public repositories (e.g., NIH-designated repositories), and certification that no corporate approval process will delay or prevent data sharing.⁹⁶

### D. NSF Compliance and 2 CFR Part 200 Requirements

#### 1. Uniform Administrative Requirements for Federal Awards

Title 2 CFR Part 200 establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for federal awards to non-federal entities, commonly known as the "Uniform Guidance" issued by OMB and current as of December 22, 2025 with last amendment effective October 1, 2025.⁹⁷ The Department of Labor published FAQ document dated January 15, 2025 addressing common questions about 2 CFR Part 200.⁹⁸ Six subparts cover: Acronyms and Definitions (Subpart A), General Provisions (Subpart B), Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards (Subpart C), Post Federal Award Requirements including financial management, property, procurement, and performance/financial monitoring (Subpart D), Cost Principles addressing allowable/unallowable costs (Subpart E), and Audit Requirements implementing Single Audit Act (Subpart F).⁹⁹

Key requirements for MU's 28 NSF awards totaling $18M include financial management standards at 2 CFR § 200.302 requiring: financial management system providing accurate, current, and complete disclosure; records identifying source and application of funds; effective control over and accountability for all funds, property, and assets; comparison of expenditures with budget amounts; and written procedures for determining allowability of costs.¹⁰⁰ Property standards at 2 CFR §§ 200.310-200.316 establish that equipment purchased with federal funds remains subject to federal requirements including inventory procedures and control systems, with disposition requirements when equipment no longer needed for project.¹⁰¹ Procurement standards at 2 CFR §§ 200.317-200.327 mandate competition requirements for purchases, conflict of interest provisions, contract cost and price analysis, and record retention requirements.¹⁰²

Subrecipient monitoring obligations at 2 CFR § 200.332 require pass-through entities to evaluate subrecipients' risk of noncompliance, conduct monitoring activities during performance period, and verify that subrecipients are audited as required.¹⁰³ Cost principles in Subpart E establish that costs must be allowable, allocable, and reasonable, with selected items of cost at 2 CFR §§ 200.420-200.475 specifying allowability determinations for specific categories.¹⁰⁴ Unallowable costs include entertainment, alcoholic beverages, lobbying, and certain advertising expenditures.¹⁰⁵ For-profit entities remain subject to 2 CFR Part 200 but profit/fee is not allowable under grants (only under contracts), creating enhanced scrutiny on cost allocation between federal awards and commercial activities.¹⁰⁶

#### 2. Responsible Conduct of Research Training

NSF requires RCR training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers supported by NSF funding, covering nine required topics: research misconduct (falsification, fabrication, plagiarism), data acquisition/management/sharing/ownership, conflict of interest and commitment, publication practices and responsible authorship, mentor/mentee relationships, peer review, collaborative science, human subjects, and animal welfare.¹⁰⁷ Format requirements mandate face-to-face instruction (online instruction alone insufficient), minimum of 8 contact hours, combination of formal coursework and informal workshops/seminars acceptable, and repetition annually or biannually.¹⁰⁸ For-profit status does not affect RCR training obligations, which continue unchanged as condition of NSF award support for trainees.¹⁰⁹

#### 3. NSF Award Transfer Process and Timeline

NSF grant transfers are governed by 2 CFR § 200.308 (prior approval requirements for changes of recipient organization), NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide Chapter VI, and NSF Grant General Conditions GC-1 updated May 2025.¹¹⁰ Prior approval requirement mandates that transfer of grant from one institution to another before project performance period expires requires NSF prior approval.¹¹¹ NSF applies three transfer approval criteria: (1) project has been relinquished by original institution before project performance period expiration, (2) facilities and resources at new institution allow successful project performance, and (3) principal investigator plans no significant change in research objectives and level of expenditures.¹¹²

Transfer process involves: preliminary approval through PI notification to NSF Program Office requesting permission for grant transfer, institutional agreement with both original and new institution agreeing to transfer, and formal notification through electronic initiation by PI via Research.gov with documentation required including relinquishing statement from original institution, transfer request from receiving institution, updated budget for remaining project period, and certification from receiving institution of facilities and administrative capability.¹¹³ NSF 2-Month Rule requires that if PI is transferring between institutions, notification to NSF must occur no later than 2 months after initial absence from the institution.¹¹⁴

For-profit acquisition creates enhanced NSF scrutiny regarding whether transfer is appropriate. NSF Program Officers will evaluate: whether research mission remains paramount despite profit motive, whether broader impacts activities (education, diversity, outreach) will continue with same intensity, whether data sharing and publication commitments will be honored without commercial restrictions, whether international collaboration remains open or becomes restricted for competitive reasons, and whether graduate student training environment maintains educational focus rather than commercial production pressure.¹¹⁵ Risk exists that some NSF programs may have eligibility restrictions for for-profit entities requiring award-by-award analysis of program solicitations and Special Terms and Conditions.¹¹⁶

### E. Transaction Structure Options and Recommendations

#### 1. Option A: Nonprofit Research Subsidiary (Recommended)

Creating a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit research institute as wholly owned subsidiary of for-profit MU preserves maximum federal research funding while enabling corporate ownership structure. Legal framework requires: (1) incorporation under state nonprofit corporation law, (2) IRS Form 1023 Application for Recognition of Exemption seeking 501(c)(3) status based on educational and scientific research purposes, (3) organizational documents establishing that subsidiary's purposes are exclusively educational/scientific with no private inurement, (4) management agreement between for-profit parent and nonprofit subsidiary specifying services provided and compensation methodology, and (5) transfer of non-transferable grants (T32, K01, P40) and ITAR-controlled research to nonprofit subsidiary while transferring eligible R01/R21 research grants to for-profit parent.¹¹⁷

Advantages of nonprofit subsidiary structure include: preservation of all $28M NIH funding by maintaining eligibility for training grants and career development awards restricted to nonprofit institutions, maintenance of fundamental research exemption for ITAR/EAR purposes by preserving educational mission and publication commitment, retention of 56% indirect cost rate for grants held by nonprofit subsidiary rather than accepting reduction to 40-50%, separation of ITAR-controlled research from commercial activities reducing DDTC scrutiny, and enhanced credibility with federal agencies demonstrating commitment to research mission rather than profit extraction.¹¹⁸ Annual financial benefit compared to full for-profit conversion totals $18.3M-$28.3M (preserved grant funding plus maintained indirect cost rate), justifying substantial structural complexity.¹¹⁹

Disadvantages and compliance burdens include: structural complexity requiring IRS approval with 6-12 month timeline for 501(c)(3) determination, operational overhead through separate boards of directors, financial systems, compliance programs, and audit requirements adding $500K-$1M annually, transfer pricing scrutiny by IRS regarding management fees and cost allocations between related entities, limitations on profit extraction as nonprofit subsidiary cannot distribute profits to for-profit parent requiring all net revenues to remain in nonprofit for mission purposes, and ongoing IRS scrutiny ensuring nonprofit maintains independence and furthers exempt purposes rather than serving private commercial interests of parent.¹²⁰

Implementation timeline requires: (1) 30-60 days for incorporation and organizational document preparation, (2) 90-180 days for IRS Form 1023 processing and 501(c)(3) determination, (3) 60-90 days for NIH/NSF notification and grant transfer applications, (4) 90-120 days for federal agency approval of grant transfers to nonprofit subsidiary, and (5) 30-60 days for operational transition including staffing, systems, and compliance program establishment, totaling 10-16 months from initiation to full operational status.¹²¹ This timeline requires initiation of nonprofit subsidiary formation immediately upon execution of letter of intent to enable completion before acquisition closing.

#### 2. Option B: Full For-Profit Conversion with Managed Decline

Accepting full for-profit conversion without structural mitigation requires relinquishing non-transferable grants and accepting reduced research capacity. This approach entails: (1) formal relinquishment to NIH of all training grants (T32), career development awards (K01), and animal resource grants (P40) totaling estimated $10M-$20M annually, (2) transfer applications for eligible research project grants (R01, R21) with enhanced justification regarding maintenance of research mission and publication commitment, (3) acceptance of indirect cost rate reduction from 56% to 40-50% representing $3.1M-$8.3M annual loss, (4) massive investment in export control compliance ($700K-$1.3M annually) if fundamental research exemption is lost, and (5) strategic faculty reductions of 15-20% eliminating research-intensive positions dependent on training grant support.¹²²

Advantages include: simpler corporate structure without nonprofit subsidiary complexity, clear separation from nonprofit regulatory constraints enabling aggressive commercialization, focus on industry-sponsored research with higher margins and fewer restrictions replacing lost federal funding, and reduced federal compliance burden for aspects of research portfolio that transition to commercial sponsors.¹²³ Financial analysis suggests this approach is viable only if: industry-sponsored research can replace federal funding at sufficient scale, research margin improvement from commercial sponsors (typical 30-40% overhead vs. 56% indirect cost rate but higher direct cost reimbursement) offsets gross revenue reduction, and faculty retention remains sufficient to maintain accreditation and research capacity despite loss of training programs.¹²⁴

Total five-year financial impact under managed decline scenario totals $45M-$77M: $25M-$50M in cumulative lost grant revenue (assuming $5M-$10M annual loss × 5 years), $15M-$20M in reduced indirect cost recovery (assuming $3M-$4M annual loss × 5 years), $3.5M in enhanced export control compliance ($700K annually × 5 years), $1M-$3M in one-time export control penalties if violations discovered during transition, and $600K in transaction costs for audits, legal fees, and consultants.¹²⁵ This substantial financial impact requires offsetting revenue generation through: dramatic increase in industry-sponsored research, development of executive education and professional training programs generating tuition revenue, real estate monetization through research park development or facility sales, and operational efficiency improvements reducing cost structure by 15-20%.¹²⁶

#### 3. Option C: Hybrid Model with Selective Nonprofit Retention

Maintaining nonprofit status for core academic and research mission while creating for-profit subsidiaries for ancillary services represents middle-ground approach: MU remains nonprofit university with continued eligibility for all federal grants, indirect cost rate maintenance, and fundamental research exemption, while for-profit subsidiaries operate bookstore, dining services, student housing, athletic facilities, parking, and other auxiliary enterprises generating profits distributable to parent company.¹²⁷ This structure requires: (1) MU remains 501(c)(3) nonprofit owned by American Education Holdings through nonprofit parent structure, (2) for-profit subsidiaries established for specific revenue-generating activities that do not jeopardize nonprofit status, (3) clear operational and financial separation ensuring profit extraction occurs only through subsidiary distributions, and (4) IRS private benefit and inurement analysis ensuring primary beneficiaries remain students and public rather than private shareholders.¹²⁸

Advantages include preservation of full federal research funding and regulatory exemptions, maintained institutional reputation as nonprofit educational institution supporting accreditation and rankings, reduced transaction risk by avoiding federal agency approvals and grant transfers, and profit extraction capability through subsidiary operations.¹²⁹ Disadvantages include limited profit extraction compared to full acquisition (subsidiary profits only, not tuition and research overhead), American Education Holdings lacks full control over core academic operations subject to nonprofit governance, IRS scrutiny of related-party transactions and profit distribution mechanisms, and state attorney general oversight in some jurisdictions regarding nonprofit governance and mission preservation.¹³⁰

This hybrid model may not satisfy American Education Holdings' transaction objectives if strategic intent requires full control over academic programs, tuition pricing, and cost structure to implement aggressive operational improvements and margin expansion.¹³¹ However, if transaction objectives focus primarily on market entry, revenue diversification, and long-term strategic positioning rather than near-term profit extraction, hybrid structure merits serious consideration as lowest-risk approach.¹³²

### F. Risk Quantification and Mitigation Strategy

#### 1. Research Compliance Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Gross Exposure | Probability | Weighted Impact | Recommended Mitigation |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Non-transferable NIH grants loss** | $10M-$20M annual | 100% | $10M-$20M | Nonprofit research subsidiary |
| **Indirect cost rate reduction (56% → 40%)** | $8.3M annual | 95% | $7.9M | Pre-closing rate negotiation + nonprofit subsidiary for sensitive grants |
| **Export control penalties (deemed exports)** | $5M-$15M one-time | 70% | $3.5M-$10.5M | Immediate audit + licensing + voluntary disclosure if violations found |
| **Fundamental research exemption loss** | $700K-$1.3M annual | 60% | $420K-$780K | Nonprofit subsidiary for ITAR research + DDTC/BIS consultation |
| **NIH enhanced FCOI/IRB scrutiny** | $200K-$500K annual | 80% | $160K-$400K | Independent oversight committees + external IRB members |
| **Grant transfer denials** | $2M-$8M | 40% | $800K-$3.2M | Early NSF/NIH consultation + enhanced mission commitment documentation |
| **Faculty attrition (research capacity loss)** | $5M-$15M | 50% | $2.5M-$7.5M | Retention incentives + research support guarantees + nonprofit subsidiary maintaining academic culture |

Total weighted first-year impact: $25.3M-$50.3M. Five-year cumulative impact: $45M-$77M assuming mitigation strategies partially successful.¹³³

#### 2. Immediate Pre-Closing Actions (Critical Path)

Comprehensive export control audit by third-party compliance firm within 30-45 days must determine: (1) current research activities and technology access for all 28 foreign nationals, (2) ECCN classification and USML category determination for all controlled research, (3) exemption status verification for 20 unlicensed foreign nationals, (4) screening results against Entity List, Denied Persons List, Unverified List, and OFAC SDN List, (5) identification of missing licenses requiring immediate application, and (6) review of international collaborations for Entity List connections.¹³⁴ Cost estimate: $150K-$250K for comprehensive third-party audit with deliverable including compliance gap analysis, violation risk assessment, and corrective action roadmap.¹³⁵

Federal grant mechanism inventory within 30 days cataloging all 70 federal grants by: (1) funding agency and institute/directorate, (2) grant mechanism activity code (R01, R21, T32, K01, P40, etc.), (3) annual funding amount, (4) performance period end date, (5) principal investigator, (6) transfer eligibility determination based on mechanism restrictions, and (7) priority ranking for preservation (mission-critical vs. expendable).¹³⁶ This inventory enables strategic decision-making regarding: which grants transfer to for-profit parent, which grants transfer to nonprofit subsidiary, which grants relinquish due to infeasibility, and financial impact quantification for purchase price adjustment negotiations.¹³⁷

Federal agency consultations within 60-90 days require meetings with: (1) DDTC Export Control Officer to discuss acquisition impact on fundamental research exemption and obtain preliminary guidance on enhanced compliance expectations, (2) BIS Export Enforcement to address EAR compliance and deemed export licensing requirements, (3) NIH program officers for high-value grants ($1M+ annually) to discuss transfer feasibility and enhanced compliance expectations, (4) NSF program directors for major awards to confirm transfer eligibility and broader impacts maintenance, and (5) DHHS Division of Cost Allocation to initiate indirect cost rate renegotiation seeking to lock rate at 50%+ for 3-year period.¹³⁸ Legal counsel cost: $50K-$100K for preparation, meeting facilitation, and documentation of federal agency guidance.¹³⁹

#### 3. Transaction Agreement Protective Provisions

Purchase agreement must include regulatory approval conditions precedent: closing conditioned upon (1) obtaining preliminary transfer approvals from NIH and NSF for grants representing 80%+ of federal funding, (2) receiving written guidance from DDTC and BIS regarding fundamental research exemption availability under for-profit structure or confirmation that nonprofit subsidiary adequately addresses concerns, and (3) absence of material adverse change in federal funding posture including no threatened suspension or termination of major grants.¹⁴⁰ These conditions enable buyer to walk away if federal agencies react negatively to for-profit conversion, allocating regulatory risk to seller until clarity obtained.

Seller indemnification provisions should require seller to indemnify buyer for: (1) any export control violations occurring before closing date including deemed export violations, ITAR/EAR noncompliance, and Entity List collaboration violations, (2) penalties, fines, and legal costs resulting from pre-closing compliance failures, (3) any grants that are determined non-transferable or are not successfully transferred within 12 months post-closing if failure results from seller misrepresentation or breach, and (4) loss of fundamental research exemption if caused by undisclosed facts or compliance failures occurring before closing.¹⁴¹ Indemnification cap should be $10M-$20M given magnitude of export control penalty exposure, with survival period of 3-5 years given statute of limitations for export control violations and typical timeline for federal grant compliance issues to materialize.¹⁴²

Purchase price adjustment mechanisms allocate financial risk of adverse determinations: (1) if more than $5M in grants determined non-transferable, purchase price reduces dollar-for-dollar for funding lost, (2) if indirect cost rate negotiated below 50%, purchase price reduces by 5-year present value of lost overhead recovery, (3) if export control audit reveals violations requiring penalties exceeding $1M, purchase price reduces by penalty amount, and (4) if fundamental research exemption definitively lost requiring compliance investment exceeding $700K annually, purchase price reduces by $3.5M (5-year present value).¹⁴³ These adjustments ensure buyer does not overpay for diminished research capacity while providing seller incentive to cooperate fully in compliance due diligence and federal agency consultations.

Transition services agreement must retain Dr. Patricia Anderson (Export Control Officer) for 12-month period post-closing at current compensation plus 20% premium to ensure continuity of export control compliance program during transition, with performance incentive tied to successful completion of deemed export licensing for any unlicensed foreign nationals and avoidance of export control violations during transition period.¹⁴⁴ Additional transition support should include: retention of research administration director for 12 months to manage grant transfer process, access to seller's counsel familiar with federal agency relationships for consultation on compliance matters, and cooperation in preparation and submission of grant transfer applications and agency notifications.¹⁴⁵

### G. Iranian and Russian National Compliance (Critical Priority)

The 8 Iranian researchers represent CRITICAL risk due to comprehensive embargo under 15 CFR § 746.7 requiring license for virtually all exports/reexports to Iran with extremely limited exceptions.¹⁴⁶ Iranian nationals working on any ECCN-controlled technology require deemed export licenses unless fundamental research exemption clearly applies. Similarly, 5 Russian researchers face comprehensive export restrictions under 15 CFR § 746.5 implemented following 2022 Ukraine invasion, with deemed exports to Russian nationals subject to stringent licensing requirements and Entity List concerns.¹⁴⁷ These 13 researchers from comprehensively embargoed/restricted countries represent highest-risk violation category requiring immediate action within 30 days of letter of intent execution.¹⁴⁸

Required verification protocol includes: (1) detailed interview with each researcher documenting all current and planned research activities, technology accessed, equipment used, software utilized, and data handled, (2) ECCN classification determination for all technology accessed by each researcher using Commerce Control List and technical specifications, (3) exemption analysis determining whether fundamental research exemption applies based on publication commitment, absence of restrictions, and educational context, (4) Entity List screening for all international collaborators and research partners, (5) OFAC SDN List screening to ensure no sanctions violations, and (6) documentation preparation justifying either exemption status or immediate license application.¹⁴⁹

If exemption cannot be clearly established for all 13 Iranian/Russian researchers, immediate license applications must be filed within 60 days: commodity jurisdiction requests to BIS determining ECCN classification, license applications to BIS for deemed exports under EAR, Technical Assistance Agreements to DDTC if ITAR-controlled technology involved, and access restrictions pending license approval to prevent ongoing violations during application pendency.¹⁵⁰ Worst-case scenario requiring licenses for all 13 researchers creates: $100K-$200K in legal fees for license applications, 6-9 month timeline for license approvals creating research disruption, potential denials for Iranian nationals requiring research reassignment or employment termination, and enhanced compliance monitoring adding $150K-$250K annually.¹⁵¹

If violations are discovered during verification process, immediate voluntary disclosure to DDTC and BIS is mandatory within 30 days of discovery, accompanied by: comprehensive description of violations including individuals involved, technology transferred, and duration, immediate corrective actions to prevent further violations including access restrictions and technology segregation, root cause analysis identifying compliance program failures, and enhanced compliance program implementation addressing identified gaps.¹⁵² Voluntary disclosure substantially reduces penalty exposure but does not eliminate it, particularly given MU's prior 2021 ITAR violation creating aggravating factor.¹⁵³ Estimated penalty range for 5-10 violations with voluntary disclosure and prior warning letter: $2M-$8M, compared to $6M-$13M without voluntary disclosure.¹⁵⁴

### H. Five-Year Financial Impact Summary

| Impact Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | Total |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Non-transferable grants loss** | $10M | $10M | $10M | $12M | $12M | $54M |
| **Indirect cost rate reduction (56%→45%)** | $5.7M | $5.7M | $5.7M | $5.7M | $5.7M | $28.5M |
| **Export control penalties (one-time)** | $5M | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $5M |
| **Enhanced compliance costs** | $1M | $900K | $800K | $700K | $700K | $4.1M |
| **Transaction costs (one-time)** | $750K | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $750K |
| **Faculty retention/recruiting** | $2M | $1.5M | $1M | $500K | $500K | $5.5M |
| **ANNUAL TOTAL** | $24.5M | $18.1M | $17.5M | $18.9M | $18.9M | **$97.9M** |

Cumulative five-year impact of $97.9M represents baseline scenario assuming: (1) 35% of NIH grants ($10M annually) are non-transferable and lost, (2) indirect cost rate reduced from 56% to 45% representing $5.7M annual loss on $52M direct cost base, (3) one-time export control penalties of $5M for discovered violations with voluntary disclosure, (4) enhanced compliance program costs declining from $1M Year 1 to $700K Year 5 as systems mature, and (5) faculty retention incentives and enhanced recruiting costs declining from $2M Year 1 to $500K Year 5.¹⁵⁵

Best case scenario assuming nonprofit research subsidiary formed to preserve all federal funding reduces five-year impact to $15M-$25M: $0 grant loss, $0 indirect cost rate reduction, $2M export control penalties (lower due to preserved exemption), $3M enhanced compliance (reduced scope), $750K transaction costs, and $10M nonprofit subsidiary formation and operational costs over 5 years.¹⁵⁶ Worst case scenario assuming fundamental research exemption lost and majority of grants non-transferable increases five-year impact to $150M-$200M: $100M in grant losses (60% of portfolio), $40M in indirect cost rate reduction, $25M in export control penalties (no voluntary disclosure, multiple violations), $6.5M in compliance costs, $1M transaction costs, and $20M in faculty departures requiring replacement.¹⁵⁷

### I. Recommendations and Implementation Timeline

Based on comprehensive research analysis, the recommended transaction structure is Option A (Nonprofit Research Subsidiary) to preserve maximum federal funding while enabling corporate ownership. Implementation requires 16-18 month timeline: Months 1-2 for comprehensive export control audit and grant mechanism inventory identifying compliance gaps and non-transferable funding; Months 2-4 for federal agency consultations with DDTC, BIS, NIH, NSF, and DHHS Division of Cost Allocation obtaining regulatory guidance on for-profit conversion impacts; Months 3-6 for nonprofit subsidiary formation including incorporation, IRS Form 1023 filing, organizational document preparation, and governance structure establishment; Months 6-10 for grant transfer applications submitted to NIH and NSF with enhanced mission commitment documentation; Months 10-14 for deemed export licensing obtaining required licenses for unlicensed foreign nationals; Months 12-16 for federal agency approval of grant transfers to nonprofit subsidiary and for-profit parent as appropriate; and Months 14-18 for operational transition including staffing, systems implementation, compliance program enhancement, and faculty communication.¹⁵⁸

*See* Section XI.B.4 at pp. 145-155 analyzing critical success factors for transaction closing; federal agency approval timeline of 16-18 months for NIH/NSF grant transfers, DDTC/BIS export control consultations, and nonprofit subsidiary formation requires extended due diligence period with interim operating covenants prohibiting material changes to research compliance programs, faculty composition, or international collaboration agreements pending regulatory approvals.

Immediate actions required within 30 days of letter of intent execution include: (1) engagement of third-party export control compliance firm to conduct comprehensive audit of 28 foreign nationals and ITAR/EAR compliance program, (2) compilation of complete grant portfolio inventory with mechanism codes and transfer eligibility determinations, (3) Iranian/Russian researcher verification protocol implementation to ensure no ongoing sanctions violations, and (4) formation of internal working group including Export Control Officer, Research Administration Director, General Counsel, and CFO to coordinate federal compliance transition.¹⁵⁹

Purchase price adjustment recommendation: Reduce purchase price by $15M-$25M to reflect weighted probability of research revenue loss risk, calculated as: $10M reduction for expected non-transferable grant loss (conservative estimate of 35% of NIH funding), $5M reduction for indirect cost rate reduction risk (expected rate decline from 56% to 48-50%), $5M escrow for export control penalty exposure (released after 2 years if no enforcement), and $5M reduction for enhanced compliance cost net present value over 5 years.¹⁶⁰ Total research compliance impact justifies $25M-$35M purchase price adjustment, with specific allocation negotiated based on final audit findings and federal agency consultation outcomes.¹⁶¹

**CROSS-SECTION IMPACTS:**

This research compliance analysis directly affects multiple other transaction domains:

- *See* Section I.C.2 at pp. 28-35: Loss of $10M-$20M in NIH T32/K01 training grants and $18M NSF research capacity directly undermines HLC Criterion 3.B.1-2 requiring sufficient resources for educational programs and doctoral training capacity, affecting Carnegie Research Classification (R2: High Research Activity) and potentially triggering HLC monitoring for resource adequacy under Criterion Five.

- *See* Section IX.D at pp. 245-260: Restriction or termination of 28 foreign national researchers (12 Chinese, 8 Iranian, 5 Russian) from export-controlled research plus loss of training grant support affecting 85 principal investigators and 120 research staff creates substantial workforce transition challenges, faculty handbook tenure obligations, and wrongful termination exposure estimated at $2.8M-$8.4M if implemented without proper cause documentation.

- *See* Section X.F: Export control violations and civil penalties ranging $5M-$15M (5-12 violations at $1,271,078 per violation) plus prior 2021 ITAR warning letter constitute "wrongful acts" under D&O policy definitions triggering notice obligations under claims-made policies, potentially affecting coverage availability, sublimits for regulatory investigations, and tail coverage premium pricing estimated at $1M-$1.5M for 6-year extended reporting period.

- *See* Section IV.C at pp. 89-95 and Section XI.B.1 at pp. 118-125: $18.3M-$28.3M annual research revenue loss (combination of $10M-$20M non-transferable grants plus $8.3M indirect cost rate reduction from 56% to 40%) represents 2.7-4.2% of $680M total institutional revenue, reducing EBITDA from $45M to $26.7M-$36.7M and threatening debt service capacity under $500M institutional debt scenario requiring $35M annual interest payments.

- *See* Section I.C.3 at pp. 28-35 and Section III.D at pp. 82-95: Fundamental research exemption loss requiring ITAR registration ($3,000 annual fee) and Technology Control Plans for all controlled research ($700K-$1.3M annual compliance cost) plus federal funding reduction of $18.3M-$28.3M affect institutional capacity to maintain specialized accreditations for law school (ABA Standard 301 requiring adequate resources), business school (AACSB), and engineering programs (ABET Criterion 8 requiring adequate institutional support).

- *See* Section IV.D.1 at pp. 135-155 and Section V.B at pp. 168-175: Nonprofit research subsidiary formation (Midwest University Research Foundation, Inc.) requires IRS Form 1023 filing, 501(c)(3) determination letter (6-12 month processing), and creates ongoing tax compliance obligations including IRC § 512 UBIT analysis for research commercialization revenue, IRC § 482 transfer pricing documentation for cost-sharing agreements with for-profit parent, and annual Form 990 reporting of related party transactions under Schedule R.
