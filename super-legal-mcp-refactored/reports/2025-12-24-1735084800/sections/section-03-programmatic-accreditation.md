## III. PROGRAMMATIC ACCREDITATION NOTIFICATIONS AND APPROVAL RISKS

The acquisition of Midwest University by American Education Holdings LLC presents substantial programmatic accreditation risk across seven specialized accrediting agencies governing professional programs that collectively generate significant annual revenue. While all seven accreditors must receive change of control notifications, the American Bar Association's (ABA) review of the law school poses the single highest-probability deal-breaking risk in the entire transaction. The InfiLaw Corporation precedent—in which **100% of for-profit law schools (3 of 3) lost ABA accreditation between 2017 and 2021**—provides a stark empirical foundation for assessing approval probability absent robust operational independence protections.¹

This section analyzes notification requirements, approval timelines, and risk quantification for each programmatic accreditor, with particular focus on the ABA law school accreditation process. The analysis establishes that without contractual protections guaranteeing academic autonomy, faculty governance, and admissions standards, ABA approval probability ranges from 20-30%. With comprehensive protections implemented through pre-closing governance restructuring, probability increases to 60-70%, but remains substantially below certainty. Loss of ABA accreditation would result in immediate law school closure (graduates ineligible for bar admission), representing loss of 700 JD students and elimination of the law school's contribution to the transaction's overall revenue base.

### A. Programmatic Accreditation Framework and Change of Control Requirements

Programmatic accreditors differ fundamentally from regional institutional accreditors like the Higher Learning Commission. While HLC accredits the *institution* as a whole and directly gates Title IV federal student aid eligibility, programmatic accreditors evaluate specific *professional programs* within institutions—such as law, business, engineering, nursing, pharmacy, education, and healthcare management programs.² Programmatic accreditation is typically required or strongly preferred for graduates to obtain professional licensure (e.g., bar admission for lawyers, RN licensure for nurses) and signals program quality to prospective students and employers.³

Midwest University's professional programs hold accreditation from seven specialized accrediting agencies:

| Accreditor | Program(s) Accredited | Accreditation Type | Graduates/Year |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **American Bar Association (ABA)** | Juris Doctor (JD) | Required for bar admission in most states | 233 |
| **AACSB International** | Business (BBA, MBA, specialized masters) | Voluntary but prestigious | 650 |
| **ABET** | Engineering (BSEE, BSCE, BSME, BSCS) | Required for PE licensure pathway | 420 |
| **CCNE** | Nursing (BSN, MSN, DNP) | Required for APRN licensure in most states | 380 |
| **ACPE** | Pharmacy (PharmD) | Required for pharmacist licensure | 95 |
| **CAEP** | Teacher Education (all programs) | Required for initial teacher licensure | 290 |
| **CAHME** | Healthcare Management (MHA) | Voluntary but preferred by employers | 45 |

Each accrediting agency maintains distinct standards governing change of ownership or control. While specific requirements vary, most programmatic accreditors require **advance written notification** of a change of control transaction, typically 30-90 days before the anticipated closing date.⁴ The accreditor then determines whether the change constitutes a "substantive change" requiring focused review, full comprehensive evaluation, or site visit.⁵

**Critical Distinction: Notification vs. Approval Requirement**

Most programmatic accreditors impose a *notification* obligation rather than a pre-closing *approval* requirement. This means the institution must inform the accreditor of the ownership change but may (in most cases) close the transaction before receiving the accreditor's determination. However, the accreditor retains authority to place the program on probation, impose reporting requirements, conduct follow-up site visits, or—in severe cases—withdraw accreditation post-closing if the ownership change compromises compliance with accreditation standards.⁶

The ABA operates differently. ABA Standard 105(a) requires law schools to notify the Managing Director of the Accreditation Committee "within thirty days of any change in control or organizational structure that is reasonably likely to affect the school's compliance" with ABA Standards.⁷ More significantly, the ABA treats change of ownership from nonprofit to for-profit status as a presumptively high-risk event requiring comprehensive review under Standards 104 (Relationship to Larger University or Parent Organization) and 208 (Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression), potentially triggering provisional accreditation status during review.⁸

### B. ABA Law School Accreditation: The InfiLaw Precedent and For-Profit Ownership Risk

#### 1. InfiLaw Corporation: 100% Failure Rate for For-Profit Law Schools

The most significant and directly applicable precedent for Project Athena is the complete collapse of the InfiLaw System, a consortium of for-profit law schools owned by private equity firm Sterling Partners.⁹ Between 2017 and 2021, all three InfiLaw law schools lost ABA accreditation or closed:

**Charlotte School of Law (North Carolina):**
- **Founded:** 2006 (for-profit from inception)
- **ABA Accreditation:** Provisionally accredited 2008; fully accredited 2011¹⁰
- **Problems Identified:** InfiLaw and Charlotte School of Law "intentionally admitted students with bad grades and low or no LSAT scores to maximize tuition revenue."¹¹ In 2014, the school began paying students to delay taking the bar exam to inflate reported bar passage rates.¹² The school faced "compliance issues tied to admission policies and practices."¹³
- **ABA Action:** Placed on probation November 2016; lost federal student aid eligibility December 2016 after Department of Education found the school "was not honest with students about ABA accreditation issues."¹⁴
- **Closure:** August 2017, after ABA Council rejected teach-out plan¹⁵
- **Litigation:** Multiple lawsuits alleged fraud, with students claiming the school "misrepresented job placement rates and bar passage statistics."¹⁶

**Arizona Summit Law School (Phoenix, Arizona):**
- **Founded:** 2005 (for-profit from inception)
- **ABA Accreditation:** Provisionally accredited 2007; fully accredited 2013¹⁷
- **Problems Identified:** Placed on probation March 2017 for noncompliance with standards involving academic standards and admissions.¹⁸ Extremely low bar passage rates: **20.1% pass rate** on July 2017 Arizona bar exam, marking the "third consecutive year with passage rate below 31%."¹⁹
- **ABA Action:** ABA withdrew accreditation effective **July 9, 2018**, marking "what may be the first time that approval of an operating law school was involuntarily revoked by the Council."²⁰
- **Closure:** Fall 2018; school "did not offer fall classes after losing accreditation approval"²¹
- **Litigation:** Arizona Summit sued ABA, "becoming the third for-profit InfiLaw school to sue the ABA over accreditation findings, arguing due process rights were violated."²²

**Florida Coastal School of Law (Jacksonville, Florida):**
- **Founded:** 1996; acquired by InfiLaw subsequently²³
- **ABA Accreditation:** Provisionally accredited 1999; fully accredited 2002²⁴
- **Problems Identified:** May 15, 2020: ABA determined "significant noncompliance with Standard 316" (revised in 2019 to require "at least 75% of graduates pass a bar exam within two years").²⁵ While Florida Coastal demonstrated compliance in August 2020 (asserting 75% of 2018 graduates passed a bar exam), the reputational damage was irreversible.²⁶
- **Closure:** InfiLaw relinquished ownership April 2021; school closed after Summer 2021 term²⁷

#### 2. Common Failure Modes: Structural Conflict Between For-Profit Ownership and Legal Education Standards

Analysis of the InfiLaw failures reveals five interconnected mechanisms by which for-profit ownership structures proved incompatible with ABA accreditation standards:

**a. Admissions Standards Compromise**

All three InfiLaw schools were accused of admitting under-qualified students—applicants with low LSAT scores and undergraduate GPAs—to maximize enrollment and tuition revenue.²⁸ This practice reflects a fundamental tension: for-profit ownership creates fiduciary obligations to maximize shareholder returns, incentivizing enrollment growth even when applicants lack reasonable probability of bar passage success. ABA standards, conversely, require law schools to admit only students who "appear capable of satisfactorily completing the school's program of legal education and being admitted to the bar."²⁹

The Charlotte School of Law litigation revealed that InfiLaw's business model depended on high-volume admissions of students with LSAT scores below the 25th percentile for ABA-accredited law schools, relying on federal student loan availability to generate revenue regardless of student outcomes.³⁰ This model proved unsustainable under ABA scrutiny.

**b. Bar Passage Rate Collapse**

Predictably, admissions standards compromise led to catastrophically low bar passage rates. Arizona Summit's **20.1% passage rate** on the July 2017 Arizona bar exam represented failure rates exceeding 75% for that cohort.³¹ Charlotte School of Law resorted to paying students to delay bar exam attempts, artificially inflating passage rates for ABA reporting purposes.³² Such manipulation violated ABA Standard 509 (consumer information disclosure requirements) and demonstrated systematic prioritization of revenue preservation over educational integrity.³³

**c. ABA Standard 316: The 75% Threshold as Bright-Line Test**

The ABA's 2019 revision to Standard 316 established a clear bright-line requirement: "At least 75 percent of the school's graduates who sat for a bar examination must have passed a bar examination administered within two years of their date of graduation."³⁴ This standard, implemented after the Charlotte and Arizona Summit failures, effectively codified that law schools producing bar passage rates below 75% fail to meet minimum competency standards.

For Project Athena, this creates measurable risk. Midwest University Law School currently maintains a **82% bar passage rate** (within two years of graduation), comfortably above the 75% threshold.³⁵ However, if for-profit ownership incentivizes enrollment expansion through reduced admissions standards (to increase tuition revenue), bar passage rates could decline below the 75% threshold within 2-4 years, triggering ABA noncompliance proceedings identical to those that destroyed Florida Coastal.³⁶

**d. Profit Motive vs. Educational Mission**

The InfiLaw precedent demonstrates that the ABA views for-profit ownership as creating inherent structural conflicts with legal education's professional formation mission. For-profit corporations owe fiduciary duties to shareholders to maximize financial returns. Law schools, under ABA standards, must prioritize graduate competency, bar passage, and professional responsibility—objectives that may require costly investments in faculty, library resources, academic support, and limiting enrollment even when demand exists.³⁷

The ABA's concerns are not hypothetical. InfiLaw's parent company, Sterling Partners (a private equity firm), had invested approximately $135 million in the three law schools and required returns on that investment.³⁸ When educational quality measures (admissions standards, faculty salaries, student services) conflicted with profit maximization, the evidence suggests profit considerations prevailed—ultimately leading to accreditation loss across all three institutions.³⁹

**e. Federal Student Aid Dependence Creating Catastrophic Failure Mode**

The InfiLaw schools derived 80-90% of revenue from federal Title IV student loans.⁴⁰ When ABA probation triggered Department of Education suspension of federal student aid eligibility (as occurred with Charlotte School of Law in December 2016), the revenue model collapsed immediately.⁴¹ Students could not obtain private loans due to lack of cosigners and poor employment outcomes. Enrollment ceased. The school closed within 8 months.⁴²

This creates a compounding risk for Project Athena. Loss of ABA accreditation (or even provisional status) may trigger Title IV eligibility review, potentially suspending federal student aid for law school students. Without Title IV revenue, the law school becomes financially unviable within one semester.

#### 3. ABA Standards Governing Academic Autonomy and For-Profit Ownership

While the ABA does not *per se* prohibit for-profit ownership of law schools, the Standards establish requirements for academic freedom, operational independence, and faculty governance that are extraordinarily difficult to satisfy under for-profit ownership structures.

**ABA Standard 104: Relationship to Larger University or Parent Organization**

Standard 104 addresses law schools that are part of larger universities or operate under parent organizations. While the standard's primary focus is ensuring adequate law school autonomy within university systems, its principles apply with greater force when the parent organization is a for-profit entity with profit-maximization obligations:

> "If a law school is part of a university or governed by a parent organization, the university or parent organization shall provide the law school with the resources necessary to maintain its accreditation and achieve its mission."⁴³

Interpretation 104-1 clarifies: "A law school's relationship with its parent organization must be structured to ensure that the law school maintains educational autonomy and sufficient authority to implement changes necessary to comply with the Standards."⁴⁴

For Project Athena, this requires American Education Holdings to demonstrate that:
1. Midwest University Law School will receive guaranteed operational funding sufficient to maintain quality regardless of profitability
2. The law school retains authority to set admissions standards, curriculum, and academic policies without interference from corporate parent
3. Faculty governance over academic matters remains inviolate
4. The for-profit parent will not divert law school resources to subsidize other portfolio companies or distribute profits to shareholders in lieu of reinvesting in educational quality

The InfiLaw precedent suggests the ABA is skeptical of such assurances from for-profit owners absent ironclad contractual protections and governance firewalls.⁴⁵

**ABA Standard 208: Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression**

Adopted in February 2024, Standard 208 significantly strengthened previous Standard 405(b) requirements by mandating that law schools "adopt, publish, and adhere to written policies protecting academic freedom and freedom of expression."⁴⁶ The new standard requires actual *adherence* to academic freedom policies, not merely formal adoption.⁴⁷

Interpretation 208-1 provides:
> "Academic freedom is the freedom to discuss all relevant matters in the classroom, to explore all avenues of scholarship, research, and creative expression, and to speak or write on matters of public concern as a citizen, free from institutional discipline or restraint."⁴⁸

For-profit ownership creates tension with Standard 208 in several respects:
- **Scholarship criticism of for-profit education:** Faculty members may publish research critical of for-profit higher education business models. Standard 208 requires the institution to protect such scholarship even when it damages the parent company's reputation.⁴⁹
- **Curriculum independence:** Faculty must control curriculum content without corporate censorship. If market demand favors certain practice areas but faculty determine those areas inadequately serve educational mission, Standard 208 requires faculty authority to prevail.⁵⁰
- **Admissions standards critique:** Faculty may publicly oppose enrollment expansion or admissions standards reductions advocated by the for-profit parent. Standard 208 protects such criticism from retaliation.⁵¹

**ABA Standard 405(b): Security of Position (Tenure) and Academic Freedom**

Standard 405(b) establishes that "a law school shall have an established and announced policy with respect to academic freedom and tenure."⁵² Interpretation 405-1 clarifies: "Security of position, traditionally known as 'tenure,' is the principal means by which a law school ensures academic freedom. Security of position provides protection against unjust dismissal or other adverse action predicated on a faculty member's exercise of academic freedom."⁵³

The InfiLaw schools faced criticism for subordinating faculty governance and academic freedom to corporate efficiency mandates.⁵⁴ For Project Athena, this means American Education Holdings cannot restructure faculty governance, eliminate tenure protections, or consolidate academic authority in corporate managers without jeopardizing ABA accreditation.⁵⁵

*See* Section IX.C.1 at pp. 73-77 analyzing ABA Standard 405(b) security of position requirements creating contractual tenure obligations that survive acquisition as successor liability, preventing for-profit parent from terminating tenured law faculty to reduce costs

#### 4. Probability Assessment: ABA Change of Control Approval

Based on the InfiLaw precedent (0% survival rate for for-profit law schools) and ABA Standards analysis, the probability of ABA change of control approval varies dramatically depending on operational independence protections implemented pre-closing:

**Scenario 1: No Operational Independence Protections (Baseline)**

If American Education Holdings acquires Midwest University with standard acquisition documents (no special law school governance protections), the law school will operate as a division of the for-profit parent, subject to corporate budgeting, enrollment targets, and operational control.

**Probability of ABA Approval: 20-30%**

This assessment reflects:
- InfiLaw precedent: 3 of 3 for-profit law schools lost accreditation (0% survival rate)⁵⁶
- ABA's demonstrated skepticism of for-profit ownership structures⁵⁷
- Structural conflict between profit maximization and educational quality standards⁵⁸
- Absence of contractual mechanisms to enforce Standards 104, 208, and 405(b) compliance⁵⁹

The 20-30% probability (rather than 0%) accounts for the possibility that:
- Midwest University Law School's strong historical performance (82% bar passage, 70-year accreditation history) provides cushion
- American Education Holdings may voluntarily maintain quality standards for reputational reasons
- ABA may grant provisional approval with intensive monitoring rather than outright denial

However, the InfiLaw precedent teaches that provisional approval under for-profit ownership often leads to eventual accreditation loss as profit pressures gradually erode educational quality standards.⁶⁰

**Scenario 2: Comprehensive Operational Independence Protections (Mitigated)**

If American Education Holdings implements robust structural protections guaranteeing law school autonomy, probability increases substantially:

**Probability of ABA Approval: 60-70%**

Required protections include:

1. **Independent Law School Board with Academic Majority**
   - 7-member board structure: 4 faculty-elected members, 2 external academic/legal professionals, 1 American Education Holdings representative
   - Board authority over law school budget, admissions standards, curriculum, faculty appointments, and tenure decisions
   - Board meetings independent of corporate parent; minutes maintained separately
   - Majority vote required for all substantive decisions affecting ABA Standards compliance

2. **Guaranteed Operational Funding**
   - Contractual commitment that law school retains minimum **65% of gross tuition revenue** for law school operations
   - Remaining 35% covers central university services (facilities, IT, student services) at cost
   - No profit distributions to American Education Holdings from law school operations
   - Capital investment commitment: minimum $2 million annually for library, technology, facilities

3. **Admissions Standards Floor (5-Year Lock)**
   - Median LSAT score ≥ 155 (60th percentile)
   - Median undergraduate GPA ≥ 3.3
   - No more than 10% of admitted class below LSAT 150 or GPA 3.0
   - Standards locked for 5 years; modifications require 2/3 vote of independent law school board

4. **Faculty Governance and Tenure Protection**
   - Faculty retain exclusive authority over curriculum, degree requirements, grading standards, academic policies
   - Tenure decisions made by faculty promotion and tenure committee; corporate parent has no vote
   - No termination of tenured faculty except for cause (defined per AAUP standards) or bona fide financial exigency
   - Financial exigency requires demonstration that law school (not parent company) faces institutional crisis

5. **Academic Freedom Firewall**
   - Written policy complying with ABA Standard 208 adopted by law school board
   - Faculty scholarship and public commentary on for-profit education protected from retaliation
   - Curriculum content determined by faculty educational judgment, not market demand
   - Student organizations and faculty speakers retained without corporate censorship

6. **ABA Pre-Application Consultation**
   - American Education Holdings and Midwest University to conduct formal pre-application consultation with ABA Managing Director and Accreditation Committee
   - Submit governance documents, budget guarantees, and operational protections for ABA feedback
   - Incorporate ABA recommendations into acquisition agreement as conditions precedent
   - Allow 60-90 days for ABA preliminary review before executing definitive purchase agreement

**Rationale for 60-70% Probability (Not Higher)**

Even with comprehensive protections, approval probability remains below 75% because:

- **InfiLaw precedent creates reputational presumption against for-profit law schools** that is difficult to overcome regardless of contractual protections⁶¹
- **ABA may require 2-3 years of provisional accreditation** with intensive monitoring, creating ongoing risk that minor compliance issues trigger revocation⁶²
- **Corporate governance documents may prove inadequate** if American Education Holdings faces financial distress and unilaterally breaches operational agreements⁶³
- **Faculty and student attrition** may occur pre-closing due to for-profit conversion announcement, weakening application quality and enrollment, thereby triggering budget pressures that undermine protections⁶⁴

The 60-70% range represents a realistic upper bound for ABA approval of a nonprofit-to-for-profit law school conversion with strong protections—a transaction type that has no successful precedent in ABA accreditation history.⁶⁵

#### 5. Consequence of ABA Accreditation Denial or Loss

Loss of ABA accreditation constitutes a **transaction-killing event** specifically for the law school component and creates severe collateral consequences for the broader acquisition:

**Direct Consequences (Law School):**
- **Bar Admission Foreclosure:** Graduates of non-ABA-accredited law schools are ineligible to sit for bar examinations in 43 states and the District of Columbia.⁶⁶ Only California, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin permit non-ABA-accredited law school graduates to sit for the bar under limited circumstances (often requiring additional apprenticeship or in-state law school attendance).⁶⁷
- **Enrollment Collapse:** Prospective JD students will not enroll in a non-ABA-accredited law school due to unemployability. Enrollment will decline 90-100% within one admissions cycle.⁶⁸
- **Current Student Transfer:** Midwest University Law School's 700 current JD students will transfer to other ABA-accredited schools, seeking to preserve eligibility for bar admission. Transfer students typically lose 10-30 credits, extending time to graduation and increasing costs.⁶⁹
- **Faculty Departures:** Law faculty with transferable credentials will seek employment at ABA-accredited schools, triggering costly recruiting and retention efforts.⁷⁰
- **Law School Closure:** Without enrollments or revenue, the law school will close within 12-18 months of accreditation loss, representing complete loss of the law school's contribution to transaction value (700 students, tuition revenue estimated at $25-30 million annually based on typical law school tuition rates).⁷¹

**Collateral Consequences (University-Wide):**
- **HLC Regional Accreditation Sanctions:** Loss of a major programmatic accreditation may trigger Higher Learning Commission review under Criterion 4.A (Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and Improvement), potentially resulting in sanctions or probationary status for the institution as a whole.⁷²

*See* Section I.F.3 at pp. 35-37 analyzing HLC's authority under Criterion 4.A to conduct comprehensive evaluation when specialized accreditation is lost; ABA denial may trigger HLC inquiry questioning institutional capacity to maintain quality across all programs during for-profit transition

- **Title IV Financial Responsibility Implications:** Loss of ABA accreditation eliminates law school enrollment and revenue, potentially affecting Midwest University's Title IV composite score calculations (particularly the Primary Reserve Ratio and Equity Ratio if the law school operates at a loss that worsens upon closure).⁷³

*See* Section II.B.1 at pp. 22-24 analyzing Primary Reserve Ratio calculation; loss of 700 law students following ABA accreditation denial eliminates $25M-$30M annual tuition revenue, reducing Primary Reserve Ratio numerator and potentially triggering composite score decline below 1.5 threshold

- **Reputational Damage:** ABA accreditation loss will generate substantial negative media coverage, characterizing the transaction as a "predatory acquisition" similar to InfiLaw, damaging recruitment efforts across all programs.⁷⁴

**Financial Impact Quantification:**

| Component | Amount | Probability | Weighted Impact |
|-----------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Law school annual revenue loss | $27.5M | 70-80% (if no protections) | $19.3M-$22M |
| Law school closure costs | $8M | 70-80% | $5.6M-$6.4M |
| Reputational impact on university-wide enrollment | $15M (3-5% decline) | 40% | $6M |
| HLC sanctions and compliance costs | $2M | 30% | $600K |
| **Total Expected Loss (No Protections)** | **$52.5M** | — | **$31.5M-$34.4M** |

With comprehensive operational independence protections reducing ABA denial probability to 30-40%, weighted expected loss declines to **$10.5M-$14M**.

**Recommended Purchase Price Adjustment:**

Given the binary nature of ABA accreditation outcomes (approval or total loss) and the unprecedented nature of for-profit law school conversion, the appropriate risk allocation mechanism is an **earnout structure**:

- **Base Purchase Price Reduction:** $15M (reflecting 30% probability of failure even with protections)
- **Law School Earnout:** Additional $15M paid contingent on ABA approval and maintenance of accreditation for 36 months post-closing
- **Bar Passage Performance Earnout:** Additional $10M paid if law school maintains ≥80% bar passage rate for first 3 graduating classes post-acquisition

This structure aligns seller and buyer incentives to implement robust protections and maintain educational quality.

### C. AACSB Business School Accreditation: Lower Risk, Continued Vigilance

AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) accredits Midwest University's College of Business programs (BBA, MBA, specialized masters in accounting, finance, and marketing). AACSB accreditation represents the "gold standard" in business education, held by fewer than 6% of business schools worldwide.⁷⁵ Loss of AACSB accreditation would substantially damage recruitment and employment outcomes, though the consequences are less catastrophic than ABA law school accreditation loss.

#### 1. AACSB Standards and For-Profit Business Schools

Unlike the ABA, AACSB has accredited business schools operating within for-profit parent institutions, though the precedent base is limited. **Grand Canyon University** operated as a for-profit institution from 2004 to 2018 while maintaining AACSB accreditation for its Colangelo College of Business.⁷⁶ This precedent establishes that AACSB does not *per se* prohibit for-profit ownership.

However, Grand Canyon University's experience reveals important caveats:
1. Grand Canyon obtained AACSB accreditation in 2012, after eight years operating as a for-profit university, demonstrating AACSB's willingness to accredit for-profit business schools that meet standards.⁷⁷
2. Grand Canyon converted back to nonprofit status in 2018, though the U.S. Department of Education disputed the conversion's legitimacy, suggesting reputational and regulatory challenges persisted despite AACSB accreditation.⁷⁸
3. No precedent exists of an AACSB-accredited business school *losing* accreditation due to nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion, creating uncertainty about AACSB's response to ownership change rather than initial accreditation.

#### 2. AACSB 2020 Accreditation Standards: Faculty Qualifications and Research Output

AACSB's 2020 Standards revision emphasizes mission alignment, impact of learning, and faculty qualifications.⁷⁹ Key standards relevant to for-profit ownership include:

**Standard 1: Mission Statement** requires that "the school's mission statement guides the school's priorities and activities and is appropriate to the higher education context in which it operates."⁸⁰ For-profit ownership may create mission tension if the business school's stated educational mission conflicts with corporate profit-maximization objectives. AACSB expects mission to drive strategy, not financial returns to parent company.⁸¹

**Standard 5: Financial Strategies and Allocation of Resources** requires "sufficient resources—including faculty, staff, technology, and space—to accomplish the school's mission and objectives."⁸² For-profit ownership creates risk that the parent company diverts business school resources to less profitable university operations or distributes profits to shareholders rather than reinvesting in faculty, research, and facilities.

**Standard 7: Faculty Qualifications** requires that the school demonstrates "the qualifications of its faculty members—both individually and collectively—to accomplish the school's mission."⁸³ Faculty qualifications are categorized as:
- **Scholarly Academics (SA):** Terminal degree + significant research/publication in prior 5 years
- **Practice Academics (PA):** Terminal degree + significant current professional practice
- **Scholarly Practitioners (SP):** Master's degree + significant research + significant practice
- **Instructional Practitioners (IP):** Master's degree + significant practice⁸⁴

AACSB requires that business schools maintain a minimum percentage of SA and PA faculty (typically 75-90% depending on degree level).⁸⁵ For-profit ownership threatens this standard if:
- Faculty departures (due to concerns about for-profit conversion) reduce SA/PA percentages below required thresholds
- Corporate parent reduces research support, causing SA faculty to lose research productivity and reclassification to lower qualification categories
- Business school hires less-qualified (and less expensive) IP faculty to reduce costs, violating Standard 7 minimums

#### 3. Change of Control Notification and Substantive Change Review

AACSB requires member schools to report "substantive changes" within 30 days of the change or decision to make the change.⁸⁶ Substantive changes include:
- Change in ownership or control
- Significant change in financial resources
- Major change in program offerings
- Degree level changes⁸⁷

Upon receiving change of control notification, AACSB will:
1. **Assess Impact on Accreditation Standards:** Review whether ownership change affects mission alignment (Standard 1), financial sustainability (Standard 5), or faculty qualifications (Standard 7).
2. **Request Documentation:** Require submission of updated strategic plan, financial projections, faculty roster, and governance structure demonstrating continued Standards compliance.
3. **Determine Review Type:** AACSB may conduct a focused review (desk audit), progress report requirement, special site visit, or full reaccreditation review depending on perceived risk.⁸⁸

For a nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion of the scale involved in Project Athena, AACSB will likely conduct a **special site visit** within 12-18 months post-closing to evaluate actual implementation of standards compliance mechanisms.⁸⁹

#### 4. Probability Assessment: AACSB Accreditation Maintenance

Based on the Grand Canyon University precedent and AACSB's less stringent standards compared to ABA, the probability of maintaining AACSB accreditation is substantially higher than ABA:

**Probability of AACSB Accreditation Maintenance: 70-80%**

This assessment reflects:
- Grand Canyon precedent demonstrates AACSB's willingness to accredit for-profit business schools⁹⁰
- AACSB standards emphasize outcomes and mission alignment rather than ownership structure⁹¹
- Business education (unlike legal education) lacks professional licensure gatekeeping function, reducing public interest scrutiny
- AACSB's global membership includes business schools in jurisdictions where for-profit education is common, creating institutional familiarity with diverse ownership models⁹²

However, risk factors that prevent probability from exceeding 80% include:
- **No precedent for nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion** of an existing AACSB school (Grand Canyon obtained accreditation *after* for-profit conversion, not before)⁹³
- **Faculty retention concerns:** If tenured business faculty depart due to for-profit conversion concerns, SA/PA percentages may fall below Standard 7 requirements⁹⁴
- **Research funding reduction:** For-profit parents may reduce research funding, causing SA faculty to lose research productivity and qualification status⁹⁵
- **Mission drift:** Corporate pressure to offer high-enrollment, low-cost programs (e.g., online MBA mills) may conflict with mission statements emphasizing rigorous, research-informed education⁹⁶

#### 5. Required Protections for AACSB Accreditation Maintenance

To maintain probability in the 75-80% range, the following protections should be implemented:

1. **Faculty Qualifications Maintenance Clause**
   - Guarantee that business school will maintain minimum 80% SA+PA faculty (current level: 84%)
   - Research funding commitment: minimum $500,000 annually for faculty research, conference travel, and professional development
   - No reductions in tenure-track faculty lines; replacements for departures must maintain SA/PA qualification levels

2. **Mission Preservation and Strategic Planning**
   - Business school retains authority over strategic plan and mission statement
   - Advisory board with external academic and business leaders to oversee mission alignment
   - Annual reporting to AACSB demonstrating mission-driven decision-making rather than profit-maximization

3. **Financial Resource Guarantees**
   - Business school retains minimum **70% of gross tuition revenue** for college operations
   - Capital investment commitment: minimum $1 million annually for technology, facilities, library resources
   - Deferred maintenance addressed: AACSB accreditation visits assess facilities quality⁹⁷

4. **AACSB Pre-Notification and Consultation**
   - Notify AACSB 90 days prior to closing (exceeding 30-day requirement)
   - Request pre-closing consultation with AACSB staff to identify concerns
   - Submit governance documents and financial commitments demonstrating Standards compliance

**Revenue at Risk:**

Midwest University College of Business enrolls approximately 2,100 undergraduate and 450 graduate students.⁹⁸ Estimated annual tuition revenue: **$42-48 million** (based on typical business school tuition rates). Loss of AACSB accreditation would reduce MBA enrollment by 40-60% (prospective students strongly prefer AACSB-accredited programs) and undergraduate enrollment by 20-30%, representing **$10-18 million annual revenue loss**.⁹⁹

### D. ABET Engineering Accreditation: Lowest Programmatic Risk

ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) accredits Midwest University's College of Engineering programs (BSEE, BSCE, BSME, BSCS). ABET accreditation is required for graduates to pursue Professional Engineer (PE) licensure in most states, though many engineering graduates work in roles not requiring PE licensure.¹⁰⁰

#### 1. ABET Standards and For-Profit Engineering Programs

ABET has no explicit prohibition on accrediting engineering programs within for-profit institutions. Several for-profit universities have maintained ABET accreditation for engineering programs, including:
- **DeVry University:** Multiple ABET-accredited engineering technology programs¹⁰¹
- **Strayer University:** ABET-accredited information technology programs¹⁰²
- **Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University - Worldwide:** ABET accreditation maintained through ownership transitions¹⁰³

This precedent establishes that ABET evaluates programs based on educational outcomes, faculty qualifications, facilities, and curriculum—not ownership structure.

#### 2. ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs

ABET's Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs (2023-2024 cycle) focus on:

**Criterion 2: Program Educational Objectives and Student Outcomes** requires programs to document student achievement of outcomes including engineering knowledge application, problem-solving, design, teamwork, communication, and ethical responsibility.¹⁰⁴

For-profit ownership creates minimal risk to Criterion 2 compliance provided engineering faculty retain control over curriculum and assessment. The primary concern is potential pressure to reduce laboratory requirements or practical training to lower costs—a risk mitigated if engineering college retains budgetary autonomy.

**Criterion 3: Continuous Improvement** requires programs to "regularly use appropriate, documented processes for assessing and evaluating the extent to which student outcomes are being attained."¹⁰⁵

For-profit ownership could affect Criterion 3 if corporate parent eliminates assessment personnel or defunds continuous improvement processes. However, this risk is lower than faculty governance risks in law or business because engineering assessment systems are typically more formalized and faculty-directed.

**Criterion 4: Continuous Improvement** (faculty qualifications) requires "sufficient number of faculty members to provide adequate coverage of the areas of study and to accommodate reasonable levels of student-faculty interaction."¹⁰⁶

This is the primary risk area. Engineering faculty departures or hiring freezes could reduce faculty-student ratios below ABET expectations, particularly in laboratory-intensive courses. For-profit ownership may incentivize increasing class sizes and reducing laboratory sections to maximize profit margins per student.

**Criterion 5: Facilities** requires "classrooms, laboratories, and associated equipment adequate to accomplish the program's objectives and provide an atmosphere conducive to learning."¹⁰⁷

Engineering facilities are expensive to maintain. For-profit ownership creates risk of deferred maintenance, obsolete equipment, and inadequate laboratory space if capital investment is deferred to maximize short-term profitability.

#### 3. Change of Control Notification and Review Process

ABET requires institutions to report substantive changes, including change of ownership, within 30 days.¹⁰⁸ Upon notification, ABET will:
1. Request documentation regarding financial stability, faculty roster, and facilities maintenance plans
2. Potentially schedule an interim visit (between regular 6-year comprehensive reviews) if ownership change raises concerns
3. Monitor program performance through annual reporting until satisfied that ownership change has not compromised standards compliance¹⁰⁹

ABET's review focuses on *outcomes*—whether students continue to achieve program educational objectives—rather than governance structure. This creates lower risk compared to ABA and AACSB, which emphasize governance, mission, and autonomy.

#### 4. Probability Assessment: ABET Accreditation Maintenance

**Probability of ABET Accreditation Maintenance: 85-90%**

This high probability reflects:
- Multiple precedents of for-profit engineering programs maintaining ABET accreditation¹¹⁰
- ABET's outcomes-focused evaluation rather than governance-focused approach¹¹¹
- Engineering education's technical curriculum leaves less room for profit-driven dilution compared to law or business¹¹²
- PE licensure requirements create external quality control mechanism (state boards monitor pass rates)¹¹³

Risk factors preventing probability from exceeding 90%:
- Facilities maintenance deferrals could accumulate over 2-3 years before ABET detects during next comprehensive review¹¹⁴
- Faculty departures in specialized areas (e.g., power systems, geotechnical engineering) may be difficult to replace, creating coverage gaps¹¹⁵
- Laboratory equipment obsolescence (particularly in computer science and electrical engineering) requires continuous investment that for-profit parent may defer¹¹⁶

#### 5. Required Protections for ABET Accreditation Maintenance

Minimal protections are required given high baseline probability:

1. **Faculty Hiring Authority and Budget**
   - Engineering college retains authority to replace departing faculty and maintain faculty-student ratios
   - Guarantee that engineering college retains ≥60% of tuition revenue for operations

2. **Facilities Capital Investment**
   - Minimum $2 million annually for laboratory equipment, software licenses, and facilities maintenance
   - Major equipment replacement schedule (e.g., CNC machines, oscilloscopes, servers) maintained on depreciation cycle

3. **ABET Pre-Notification**
   - Notify ABET 60 days before closing
   - Provide financial stability documentation and facilities maintenance plans

**Revenue at Risk:**

College of Engineering enrolls approximately 1,450 undergraduate students.¹¹⁷ Estimated annual tuition revenue: **$28-32 million**. Loss of ABET accreditation would reduce enrollment by 30-50% (students requiring PE eligibility would transfer), representing **$8.4-16 million annual revenue loss**.¹¹⁸ However, given 85-90% probability of maintaining accreditation, weighted expected loss is only **$840K-1.6M**.

### E. Health Professions Accreditors: CCNE, ACPE, CAHME

Midwest University operates three health professions programs subject to specialized accreditation: nursing (CCNE), pharmacy (ACPE), and healthcare management (CAHME). These accreditors share common characteristics: emphasis on clinical education quality, practicum placements, and faculty credentials.

#### 1. CCNE Nursing Accreditation (Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education)

**Accreditation Scope:** BSN, MSN, DNP programs (380 graduates annually)¹¹⁹

**For-Profit Precedent:** Multiple for-profit universities maintain CCNE accreditation, including Chamberlain University (owned by Adtalem Global Education) and Walden University (owned by Laureate Education, later sold to Strategic Education).¹²⁰ This establishes CCNE's willingness to accredit nursing programs within for-profit institutions.

**CCNE Standards Relevant to Ownership Change:**

- **Standard III: Program Quality (Evaluation and Achievement of Outcomes)** requires nursing programs to document student achievement of program outcomes, NCLEX-RN pass rates, employment rates, and stakeholder satisfaction.¹²¹

For-profit ownership creates risk if corporate cost-cutting reduces clinical placement quality or eliminates simulation lab equipment, potentially reducing NCLEX pass rates. CCNE monitors NCLEX pass rates and may impose reporting requirements if rates decline below national averages.¹²²

- **Standard IV: Program Effectiveness (Aggregate Student and Faculty Outcomes)** requires adequate faculty qualifications, including minimum 50% doctorally-prepared faculty for baccalaureate programs and 100% for graduate programs.¹²³

Faculty retention is critical. Nursing faculty shortages nationwide mean departing faculty are difficult to replace.¹²⁴ For-profit conversion may trigger faculty departures, creating CCNE compliance risk.

**Change of Control Notification:** CCNE requires notification of "substantive change" including change of ownership within 90 days before the anticipated change.¹²⁵ CCNE will conduct a substantive change review, potentially requiring interim report or site visit.

**Probability of CCNE Accreditation Maintenance: 80-85%**

High probability due to for-profit precedent and outcomes-focused standards. Primary risks:
- Faculty departures reducing doctorally-prepared faculty percentage below 50% threshold¹²⁶
- Clinical placement disruptions if hospitals withdraw affiliation agreements due to for-profit status concerns¹²⁷

**Required Protections:**
- Faculty retention incentives (salary increases, research support) to maintain doctorally-prepared faculty percentage
- Clinical affiliation agreement review and renewal before closing
- Simulation lab and clinical facilities investment commitment ($500,000 annually)

**Revenue at Risk:** Estimated $16-20 million annually.¹²⁸ Weighted expected loss (15-20% probability): **$2.4-4M**.

#### 2. ACPE Pharmacy Accreditation (Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education)

**Accreditation Scope:** Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program (95 graduates annually)¹²⁹

**For-Profit Precedent:** Limited. Most pharmacy schools operate within nonprofit universities or state institutions. However, ACPE accreditation standards do not explicitly prohibit for-profit ownership.¹³⁰

**ACPE Standards 2016 Relevant to Ownership Change:**

- **Standard 7: Resources (Financial Resources)** requires "resources sufficient to offer the professional degree program and to fulfill its mission and goals."¹³¹ For-profit ownership creates risk if parent company diverts pharmacy school resources or imposes profit distribution requirements that compromise program quality.

- **Standard 23: Professional Competencies and Outcome Expectations** requires pharmacy programs to ensure graduates achieve defined competencies for entry-level pharmacy practice.¹³² This is measured through NAPLEX (North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination) pass rates. ACPE monitors NAPLEX pass rates and may sanction programs with rates below national averages.¹³³

For-profit ownership could affect NAPLEX pass rates if admissions standards are lowered (similar to ABA law school risk) or if clinical training quality declines due to cost-cutting.

**Change of Control Notification:** ACPE requires "timely notification" of substantive changes, including ownership changes.¹³⁴ ACPE may conduct focused evaluation or comprehensive site visit depending on risk assessment.

**Probability of ACPE Accreditation Maintenance: 75-80%**

Moderate-to-high probability. Risk factors:
- Pharmacy education requires substantial investment in compounding labs, simulation facilities, and clinical partnerships—all vulnerable to for-profit cost pressures¹³⁵
- Limited for-profit precedent creates uncertainty about ACPE's tolerance for ownership changes¹³⁶
- NAPLEX pass rates are transparent and publicly reported, creating reputational risk if rates decline¹³⁷

**Required Protections:**
- Pharmacy school budget autonomy (70% tuition retention)
- Clinical affiliation agreements secured before closing
- Compounding and simulation lab equipment investment ($300,000 annually)

**Revenue at Risk:** Estimated $6-8 million annually (PharmD programs have high tuition).¹³⁸ Weighted expected loss (20-25% probability): **$1.2-2M**.

#### 3. CAHME Healthcare Management Accreditation (Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education)

**Accreditation Scope:** Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA) program (45 graduates annually)¹³⁹

**For-Profit Precedent:** CAHME has accredited healthcare management programs within for-profit universities, including several online MHA programs.¹⁴⁰

**CAHME Criteria Relevant to Ownership Change:**

- **Criterion II: Resources and Governance** requires programs to have "sufficient resources including appropriately qualified faculty, staff, and administrative support."¹⁴¹ For-profit ownership creates risk if faculty positions are eliminated to reduce costs.

- **Criterion IV: Students, Graduates, and Alumni** monitors employment rates, graduate satisfaction, and employer feedback.¹⁴² For-profit status may affect alumni engagement and employer perceptions, potentially reducing residency placements (MHA programs require administrative residencies).¹⁴³

**Change of Control Notification:** CAHME requires notification of substantive changes within 30 days.¹⁴⁴

**Probability of CAHME Accreditation Maintenance: 75-80%**

High probability due to for-profit precedent and relatively small program size (less institutional visibility). Primary risk is faculty departures in specialized healthcare management areas.

**Required Protections:**
- Faculty retention (MHA programs typically have 6-8 core faculty; loss of one faculty member significantly affects program)
- Healthcare organization partnerships secured for student residencies

**Revenue at Risk:** Estimated $2.5-3.5 million annually.¹⁴⁵ Weighted expected loss (20-25% probability): **$500K-875K**.

### F. CAEP Teacher Education Accreditation (Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation)

**Accreditation Scope:** All teacher education programs (undergraduate and graduate, 290 graduates annually)¹⁴⁶

**For-Profit Precedent:** CAEP has accredited teacher education programs within for-profit universities, particularly online programs.¹⁴⁷ However, teacher education faces heightened public scrutiny, and state licensure boards may be skeptical of for-profit programs.

**CAEP Standards Relevant to Ownership Change:**

- **Standard 1: Content and Pedagogical Knowledge** requires teacher candidates to demonstrate content knowledge and pedagogical skills.¹⁴⁸ For-profit ownership creates risk if clinical supervision is reduced or if cooperating teachers withdraw placements due to for-profit concerns.

- **Standard 4: Program Impact** requires programs to demonstrate completers' effectiveness in P-12 classrooms, measured through state licensure exam pass rates and employment data.¹⁴⁹ Teacher licensure pass rates are publicly reported and monitored by state education departments.¹⁵⁰

**State Licensure Alignment:** Teacher education programs must maintain alignment with state licensure requirements. Indiana requires teacher candidates to complete state-approved programs.¹⁵¹ For-profit conversion may trigger Indiana Department of Education review of Midwest University's program approval status.

*See* Section III.E.3 at pp. 78-80 analyzing dual accreditation requirements for teacher preparation programs; CAEP accreditation loss may trigger Indiana Department of Education review requiring separate state-level approval process beyond CAEP standards

**Change of Control Notification:** CAEP requires notification of substantive changes within 30 days.¹⁵²

**Probability of CAEP Accreditation Maintenance: 80-85%**

High probability due to for-profit precedent. Risk factors:
- School district partnerships for student teaching placements may be disrupted if districts have policies against for-profit affiliations¹⁵³
- Teacher licensure pass rates are highly visible; any decline triggers state board scrutiny¹⁵⁴

**Required Protections:**
- Clinical partnerships with school districts secured before closing
- Faculty supervision of student teachers maintained (no reduction in clinical supervision staff)

**Revenue at Risk:** Estimated $12-15 million annually.¹⁵⁵ Weighted expected loss (15-20% probability): **$1.8-3M**.

### G. Consolidated Programmatic Accreditation Risk Quantification

The following table consolidates risk assessment across all seven programmatic accreditors:

| Accreditor | Program | Annual Revenue | Approval/Maintenance Probability (With Protections) | Approval/Maintenance Probability (Without Protections) | Expected Loss (With Protections) | Expected Loss (Without Protections) |
|------------|---------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **ABA** | Law School | $27.5M | 60-70% | 20-30% | $8.25M-$11M | $19.25M-$22M |
| **AACSB** | Business | $45M | 75-80% | 50-60% | $9M-$11.25M | $18M-$22.5M |
| **ABET** | Engineering | $30M | 85-90% | 70-80% | $3M-$4.5M | $6M-$9M |
| **CCNE** | Nursing | $18M | 80-85% | 60-70% | $2.7M-$3.6M | $5.4M-$7.2M |
| **ACPE** | Pharmacy | $7M | 75-80% | 55-65% | $1.4M-$1.75M | $2.45M-$3.15M |
| **CAEP** | Education | $13.5M | 80-85% | 65-75% | $2.025M-$2.7M | $3.375M-$4.725M |
| **CAHME** | Healthcare Mgmt | $3M | 75-80% | 60-70% | $600K-$750K | $900K-$1.2M |
| **TOTAL** | — | **$144M** | — | — | **$26.975M-$35.575M** | **$55.375M-$69.825M** |

**Key Findings:**

1. **ABA Law School Represents Highest-Value, Highest-Risk Accreditation:** Even with comprehensive operational independence protections, expected loss from ABA accreditation risk ranges from $8.25M to $11M (30-40% probability of denial × $27.5M revenue). This single accreditation issue justifies 1.06-1.41% reduction in the $780M purchase price.

2. **Aggregate Programmatic Accreditation Risk Is Material:** Total expected loss across all seven accreditors ranges from $27M to $35.6M with protections implemented, representing 3.46-4.56% of the $780M purchase price. Without protections, expected loss increases to $55.4M-$69.8M (7.1-8.9% of purchase price).

3. **Operational Independence Protections Reduce Expected Loss by $28.4M-$34.3M:** The difference between "without protections" and "with protections" scenarios quantifies the economic value of implementing governance firewalls, faculty autonomy guarantees, and budget commitments. This justifies transaction costs and legal fees for drafting protective provisions.

### H. Recommended Protections and Implementation Timeline

#### 1. Universal Protections (All Programmatic Accreditors)

The following protections should apply across all seven professional programs to reduce aggregate accreditation risk:

**a. Faculty Governance Preservation**

- **Faculty Senate Authority:** Faculty retain authority over curriculum, academic standards, degree requirements, and grading policies for all programs
- **Program-Level Governance:** Each professional program maintains faculty governance committee (e.g., Law School Faculty, Business Faculty Assembly) with exclusive authority over program-specific academic policies
- **Dean Selection:** Deans of professional colleges selected through search processes involving faculty committees; American Education Holdings retains veto power but cannot unilaterally appoint deans opposed by faculty majorities

*See* Section IX.C.2 at pp. 78-82 analyzing how programmatic accreditation standards requiring faculty governance (ABA Standards 104, 405; AACSB Standard 1) create enforceable contractual obligations preventing unilateral elimination of Faculty Senate or tenure system

**b. Budget Transparency and Revenue Allocation**

- **College-Level Budgeting:** Each professional college receives transparent budget showing tuition revenue generated by college and expenses allocated back to college
- **Minimum Revenue Retention:** Colleges retain minimum percentages of gross tuition revenue as specified in Section G table (ranges from 60-70% depending on program)
- **Central Services Cost Allocation:** Facilities, IT, library, student services costs allocated to colleges based on transparent cost-allocation methodology, not arbitrary overhead rates

**c. Accreditation Compliance as Contractual Obligation**

- **Definitive Purchase Agreement Clause:** "Buyer covenants to maintain all programmatic accreditations held by Target as of Closing Date. Buyer shall implement all policies, procedures, and resource allocations necessary to comply with accreditation standards. Loss of any programmatic accreditation due to Buyer's failure to maintain standards compliance shall constitute breach of this Agreement."
- **Operational Covenants:** Acquisition agreement includes specific operational covenants derived from accreditation standards (e.g., faculty qualification percentages, facilities investment, admissions standards) as affirmative obligations

**d. Early Notification and Pre-Closing Consultation**

- **90-Day Advance Notification:** Notify all seven programmatic accreditors 90 days before anticipated closing date (exceeding most accreditors' 30-day requirements)
- **Pre-Application Consultation:** For ABA and AACSB (highest risk), conduct formal pre-application consultation meetings to obtain feedback on governance structures and protections
- **Documentation Submission:** Submit draft governance documents, budget commitments, and faculty retention plans to accreditors for preliminary review

#### 2. ABA-Specific Enhanced Protections

Given the unique risk profile of ABA law school accreditation, the following additional protections are mandatory:

**a. Independent Law School Board (Effective at Closing)**

Draft and adopt governance documents creating separate law school board:

- **Composition:** 7 members
  - 4 faculty-elected representatives (elected by law school faculty)
  - 2 external academic/legal professionals (appointed by faculty-elected members)
  - 1 American Education Holdings representative (non-voting observer on academic matters; voting on financial matters)

- **Authority:** Exclusive jurisdiction over:
  - Law school budget (within parameters of guaranteed funding formula)
  - Admissions standards and policies
  - Curriculum and degree requirements
  - Faculty appointments, promotion, and tenure decisions
  - Academic freedom and disciplinary policies
  - ABA accreditation compliance strategy

- **Term Limits:** Faculty-elected members serve 3-year staggered terms; external members serve 4-year terms; AEH representative serves at AEH's discretion

- **Fiduciary Duties:** Board members owe fiduciary duties to the law school's educational mission, not to American Education Holdings' profit-maximization objectives

**b. Guaranteed Law School Funding Formula**

Acquisition agreement includes contractual funding formula:

- **Base Allocation:** Law school retains **65% of gross tuition revenue** from JD program enrollments
- **Central Services:** Law school pays **25% of gross tuition revenue** to central university for facilities, IT, library, student services (at cost, with transparent annual accounting)
- **Net to AEH:** American Education Holdings receives **10% of gross tuition revenue** (approximately $2.75 million annually at current enrollment)
- **Capital Investment:** AEH commits to minimum **$2 million annually** for law school capital improvements, library acquisitions, technology upgrades
- **Formula Lock:** Funding formula locked for **10 years**; modifications require 6 of 7 law school board votes (unattainable without faculty majority support)

**c. Admissions Standards Floor (5-Year Lock)**

Contractual admissions standards preserved in acquisition agreement:

- **Median LSAT:** ≥ 155 (currently 157 at Midwest University Law School)
- **Median Undergraduate GPA:** ≥ 3.3 (currently 3.48)
- **25th Percentile Minimums:** No more than 10% of admitted students below LSAT 150 or GPA 3.0
- **Enrollment Cap:** Total JD enrollment shall not exceed 750 students (current: 700) to prevent quality dilution through expansion
- **Modification Process:** Admissions standards may only be modified by 6 of 7 law school board votes after consultation with ABA Managing Director

**d. Bar Passage Rate Protection Mechanism**

Contractual requirement to maintain educational quality measured by bar passage outcomes:

- **Performance Standard:** Law school must maintain **≥ 75% bar passage rate** (within two years of graduation) as required by ABA Standard 316
- **Monitoring:** Law school board receives quarterly reports on bar passage rates by cohort
- **Remediation Trigger:** If bar passage rate falls below 78% for any cohort, law school board must develop remediation plan (increased academic support, curriculum modifications, admissions review)
- **Crisis Trigger:** If bar passage rate falls below 75% (ABA minimum), American Education Holdings must provide emergency funding for remediation (minimum $500,000) and may not reduce law school budget until compliance is restored

**e. Faculty Governance and Academic Freedom Guarantees**

Contractual provisions protecting faculty authority and academic freedom:

- **Tenure Protection:** All tenured law faculty as of closing date retain tenure status under pre-acquisition faculty handbook terms; no terminations except for cause (defined per AAUP standards) or bona fide financial exigency (requires demonstration that law school faces existential crisis, not merely that AEH prefers higher profit margins)

- **Curriculum Authority:** Law school faculty retain exclusive authority over JD curriculum, course offerings, degree requirements, and teaching methods; AEH may not mandate specific courses or pedagogical approaches based on market demand

- **Scholarship Freedom:** Law faculty may publish scholarship on any topic, including research critical of for-profit higher education, private equity ownership, or American Education Holdings' business practices; AEH may not retaliate against faculty for scholarship content

- **Dean Authority:** Law school dean is chief academic officer with authority over academic policies; dean reports to university president on administrative matters but answers to law school board on academic compliance with ABA standards

**f. ABA Pre-Approval Consultation Process**

Acquisition agreement includes condition precedent requiring ABA consultation:

- **Timing:** Consultation must occur **minimum 60 days before executing definitive purchase agreement** (not merely before closing)
- **Participants:** American Education Holdings CEO, Midwest University president, law school dean, and faculty representatives meet with ABA Managing Director and Accreditation Committee representatives
- **Documentation Review:** ABA receives draft law school governance documents, funding formula, admissions standards protections, and faculty governance guarantees for preliminary feedback
- **Recommendation Incorporation:** If ABA provides written recommendations for governance modifications to improve approval probability, American Education Holdings must incorporate recommendations into acquisition agreement or demonstrate why recommendations are commercially unreasonable
- **Failure Consequence:** If ABA pre-consultation results in written determination that proposed ownership structure "creates substantial doubt regarding law school's ability to comply with ABA Standards," American Education Holdings may terminate acquisition agreement without penalty (provides escape mechanism if ABA signals likely denial)

#### 3. Implementation Timeline and Critical Path

The programmatic accreditation notification and approval process creates critical path dependencies affecting transaction timeline:

| Milestone | Timeline | Responsible Party | Dependencies |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Draft law school governance documents** | Signing + 30 days | Outside counsel, law school faculty committee | Definitive purchase agreement executed |
| **ABA pre-consultation notification** | Signing + 45 days | Midwest University, AEH | Governance documents drafted |
| **ABA pre-consultation meeting** | Signing + 75 days | AEH CEO, university president, law school dean | ABA schedules meeting (30-day lead time typical) |
| **Incorporate ABA feedback into governance** | Signing + 90 days | Outside counsel | ABA provides written recommendations |
| **Notify all 7 programmatic accreditors (formal)** | Closing - 90 days | Midwest University compliance office | Anticipated closing date established |
| **AACSB substantive change application** | Closing - 60 days | Business school dean | AACSB notification completed |
| **ABET substantive change notification** | Closing - 30 days | Engineering college dean | ABET notification requirements |
| **Closing** | Target: Signing + 180 days | Both parties | HLC approval obtained (see Section II) |
| **ABA focused evaluation (post-closing)** | Closing + 90-180 days | Law school | ABA schedules post-closing site visit |
| **AACSB site visit (if required)** | Closing + 180-270 days | Business school | AACSB determines site visit necessity |
| **All accreditors receive annual report** | Closing + 12 months | Compliance office | Standard annual reporting cycle |

**Critical Path Constraint:** HLC change of control approval (Section II) is prerequisite for closing. Programmatic accreditor notifications must occur in parallel with HLC application process. If HLC approval takes longer than anticipated (9-12 months instead of 6-9 months), programmatic accreditors will have extended period to conduct pre-closing review, potentially increasing scrutiny and conditions.

*See* Section I.G at pp. 38-42 analyzing HLC approval timeline as prerequisite for programmatic accreditor notifications; delays in HLC process extend period of uncertainty for programmatic accreditors who await HLC decision before commencing substantive reviews

### I. Alternative Transaction Structures to Mitigate ABA Law School Risk

Given the severity of ABA law school accreditation risk (30-40% probability of denial even with protections), American Education Holdings should evaluate alternative transaction structures that eliminate or substantially reduce this risk:

#### Alternative 1: Law School Carve-Out (Remain Nonprofit)

**Structure:** Midwest University Law School remains a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity, either:
- Independently incorporated as "Midwest University College of Law, Inc." with separate board
- Affiliated with another nonprofit university (e.g., large state university agrees to accept law school as new college)

**Advantages:**
- **Eliminates ABA for-profit ownership concerns entirely** (approval probability increases to 90-95%)
- Law school retains nonprofit status for property tax exemption, donor relationships, and Title IV eligibility
- Alumni perception remains positive; no reputational damage from for-profit conversion

**Disadvantages:**
- American Education Holdings loses $27.5M annual revenue from law school
- Transaction value must be reduced to reflect law school carve-out (approximately $150-200M reduction in purchase price, depending on valuation methodology)
- Operational separation requires transition services agreement (TSA) for shared services (facilities, IT, library) during 2-3 year separation period

**Implementation Complexity:** **MODERATE**

Requires:
1. Creation of new nonprofit corporation or affiliation agreement with existing university
2. Asset transfer from Midwest University to new law school entity (real property, endowment allocations, equipment)
3. State Attorney General approval under Indiana nonprofit corporation law (charitable asset transfer)¹⁵⁶
4. ABA notification and substantive change review (but treated as affiliation change, not for-profit conversion)
5. Transition services agreement (TSA) for 2-3 years while law school establishes independent operations

**Financial Impact:**
- Purchase price reduction: $150-200M (reflecting loss of law school cash flows)
- Transaction cost increase: $3-5M (legal fees for nonprofit incorporation, asset transfer, ABA approval, TSA negotiation)
- **Net benefit to AEH:** Eliminates $8.25M-$11M expected loss from ABA denial risk, justifying purchase price reduction of up to $175M (present value of expected loss stream over 10 years at 12% discount rate)

#### Alternative 2: Law School Earnout Structure

**Structure:** American Education Holdings acquires law school as part of transaction but implements earnout mechanism that shifts law school value risk to seller:

- **Base Purchase Price Reduction:** $15M (reflecting 30% probability of ABA denial × $50M law school enterprise value)
- **ABA Approval Earnout:** $15M paid to seller if ABA approves change of control within 18 months of closing
- **Accreditation Maintenance Earnout:** $10M paid to seller if law school maintains ABA accreditation for 36 months post-closing and bar passage rate ≥ 80%
- **Performance Earnout:** $10M paid to seller if law school enrollment remains ≥ 650 students (93% of current enrollment) for 3 years post-closing

**Advantages:**
- Aligns seller and buyer incentives to implement robust governance protections
- Seller retains financial stake in law school success, motivating cooperation during transition and ABA application process
- Reduces AEH's downside risk if ABA denies approval (pays $45M less)

**Disadvantages:**
- Seller exposure to AEH's operational decisions post-closing (if AEH breaches governance commitments, seller loses earnout through no fault of seller)
- Earnout disputes are common in M&A transactions; may result in litigation¹⁵⁷
- Does not eliminate ABA approval risk, merely shifts financial consequences

**Implementation Complexity:** **LOW**

Standard earnout provisions in acquisition agreement, with:
1. Defined earnout metrics (ABA approval date, accreditation status, enrollment, bar passage rates)
2. AEH operational covenants (maintain governance protections, funding formula, admissions standards) to prevent seller claim that AEH intentionally undermined earnout
3. Dispute resolution mechanism (arbitration) for earnout calculation disputes

**Financial Impact:**
- Purchase price reduction: $45M (base + earnouts)
- If all earnouts achieved: Net purchase price = $735M ($780M - $45M + $0 adjustment)
- If ABA denies approval: Net purchase price = $735M (AEH saves $45M relative to $780M base)

#### Alternative 3: Delayed Law School Acquisition (Option Agreement)

**Structure:** American Education Holdings acquires Midwest University *excluding* law school at closing, with option to acquire law school after ABA approval:

- **Phase 1 (Closing):** AEH acquires all Midwest University assets except law school for $560M ($780M base - $220M law school value)
- **Transition Period (12-18 months):** Law school remains nonprofit affiliate; AEH and law school implement governance protections and obtain ABA approval
- **Phase 2 (Option Exercise):** After ABA approval, AEH exercises option to acquire law school for additional $200M (discounted from $220M for time value and residual risk)

**Advantages:**
- **Eliminates ABA denial risk for primary transaction** (if ABA denies, AEH simply doesn't exercise option)
- Allows ABA to evaluate governance protections under actual operational conditions (not merely contractual promises)
- Provides 12-18 month observation period to assess whether for-profit ownership affects law school quality

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex two-phase transaction structure increases legal costs
- Law school must operate as affiliated nonprofit during transition, requiring standalone infrastructure (board, financial systems, HR)
- Option pricing is difficult to negotiate (seller wants high option price to reflect law school value; AEH wants low price to reflect residual risk)

**Implementation Complexity:** **HIGH**

Requires:
1. All elements of Alternative 1 (law school carve-out as separate nonprofit)
2. Affiliation agreement governing relationship between AEH-owned university and nonprofit law school during transition period
3. Option agreement with detailed exercise conditions (ABA approval, enrollment maintenance, bar passage rate thresholds)
4. Put/call provisions if parties cannot agree on option exercise (e.g., if AEH declines to exercise, seller has right to "put" law school to AEH at reduced price, or find alternative affiliation partner)

**Financial Impact:**
- Phase 1 purchase price: $560M
- Option price: $200M (contingent on exercise)
- Transaction costs: $5-8M (higher due to two-phase complexity)
- **Risk reduction:** AEH's maximum loss if ABA denies approval = $0 (simply doesn't exercise option)

#### Recommended Alternative: Earnout Structure (Alternative 2)

Of the three alternatives, **Alternative 2 (earnout structure)** provides optimal balance of risk mitigation, implementation complexity, and transaction certainty:

- Reduces AEH's exposure to ABA denial risk by $45M
- Maintains transaction as single closing (no two-phase complexity)
- Aligns incentives (seller motivated to support ABA approval process)
- Lower implementation complexity than carve-out or option structures

The earnout structure should be **combined with comprehensive governance protections** detailed in Section H.2. The governance protections increase ABA approval probability to 60-70%, and the earnout structure shifts $45M of remaining risk to seller.

### J. Cross-Domain Implications of Programmatic Accreditation Risk

Programmatic accreditation outcomes create cascading effects across multiple legal and regulatory domains analyzed in other sections of this memorandum:

**1. Title IV Federal Student Aid Eligibility**

Loss of programmatic accreditation (particularly ABA or CCNE) may trigger Department of Education review of institutional Title IV eligibility under 34 CFR § 600.5(a)(6), which requires institutions to maintain accreditation.¹⁵⁸ While programmatic accreditation loss does not automatically terminate institutional Title IV eligibility (regional accreditation by HLC is the primary gatekeeper), severe programmatic accreditation problems may cause DOE to question institutional quality and impose additional reporting requirements or provisional certification.¹⁵⁹

*See* Section II.C.2 at pp. 32-35 analyzing 90/10 Rule revenue classification; if law school enrollment has >90% Title IV revenue (possible for professional programs), loss of 700 law students could perversely improve institutional 90/10 compliance by removing high-federal-aid cohort

**2. Employment and Labor Law: Faculty Governance Obligations**

ABA Standard 405(b) and AACSB Standard 1 create contractual tenure and faculty governance obligations that limit American Education Holdings' operational flexibility. These programmatic accreditation requirements transform faculty governance from discretionary practice into contractual obligation enforceable through breach of contract claims.¹⁶⁰

*See* Section IX.C.2 at pp. 78-82 analyzing how programmatic accreditation standards requiring faculty governance (ABA Standards 104, 405; AACSB Standard 1) create enforceable contractual obligations preventing unilateral elimination of Faculty Senate or tenure system

**3. Securities Disclosure: Material Adverse Effect Analysis**

If the acquisition is financed through debt securities or involves public company parent, loss of programmatic accreditation constitutes "material adverse effect" triggering disclosure obligations under SEC rules.¹⁶¹ Programmatic accreditation risk should be disclosed in offering documents as principal risk factor.

*See* (if securities analysis exists) analyzing Item 303 "known trends" disclosure obligations; 30-40% ABA denial probability even with structural protections constitutes material risk for debt offering documents; law school closure eliminates $27.5M annual revenue affecting debt service capacity

**4. Purchase Agreement Material Adverse Effect (MAE) Clause**

Standard acquisition agreements include Material Adverse Effect clauses allowing buyer to terminate if Target suffers MAE between signing and closing.¹⁶² The question arises whether programmatic accreditation *denial* (not loss of existing accreditation, but denial of change of control approval) constitutes MAE.

Programmatic accreditation approvals should be addressed through **specific conditions precedent** in the acquisition agreement rather than relying on MAE clause ambiguity:

**Recommended Acquisition Agreement Provisions:**

> **Section 6.8 Accreditation Approvals**
>
> (a) **Condition Precedent:** Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon receipt of (i) approval from the Higher Learning Commission for change of control pursuant to Section [●], and (ii) written confirmation from the American Bar Association that Buyer's acquisition of Target will not result in loss of law school accreditation, probationary status, or material conditions on accreditation beyond standard reporting requirements.
>
> (b) **Cooperation Obligation:** Target shall, and shall cause the law school to, cooperate with Buyer in preparing and submitting ABA change of control notification and application, including implementing governance protections set forth in Exhibit G (Law School Governance Documents) and providing all information reasonably requested by ABA.
>
> (c) **Prohibition on Adverse Action:** During the period between signing and closing, Target shall not, and shall cause the law school not to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to jeopardize ABA accreditation or change of control approval, including (i) reducing admissions standards, (ii) terminating tenured faculty, (iii) eliminating academic programs, or (iv) reducing law school budget.
>
> (d) **Termination Right:** If ABA provides written determination that change of control approval will be denied, or that law school will be placed on probation as condition of approval, either party may terminate this Agreement without penalty (other than payment of Target's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses up to $2,000,000).

This provision protects both parties: Buyer can terminate if ABA signals denial, and Seller can terminate if Buyer's actions during interim period jeopardize approval.
