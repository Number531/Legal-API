## IX. EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR LAW CONSIDERATIONS

The acquisition of Midwest University by American Education Holdings presents critical employment and labor law risks totaling $212M-$765M in potential exposure, with most likely costs of $25M-$75M. The predominant issue is **successor liability for tenure contracts**: AEH will inherit binding contractual obligations to 680 tenured faculty members that cannot be unilaterally modified or terminated. This section analyzes faculty tenure rights, pending EEOC discrimination charges, WARN Act compliance obligations, unionization risk, and the preservation of shared governance structures essential to accreditation.

### A. Faculty Composition and Contractual Framework

#### 1. Current Faculty Structure

Midwest University employs 1,350 total faculty members across three employment categories with distinct legal protections:

| Category | Count | Percentage | Average Salary | Annual Payroll |
|----------|-------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tenured Faculty | 680 | 50.4% | $130,000 | $88.4M |
| Tenure-Track (Untenured) | 110 | 8.1% | $95,000 | $10.5M |
| Non-Tenure-Track | 560 | 41.5% | $55,000 | $30.8M |
| **TOTAL** | **1,350** | **100%** | — | **$129.7M** |

The 680 tenured faculty members represent the University's most significant fixed employment cost and the gravest legal risk in this transaction. Tenure creates contractual rights that survive change of ownership and cannot be eliminated through financial restructuring strategies commonly employed in for-profit acquisitions.¹

#### 2. Legal Status of Faculty Handbooks

Faculty handbooks are **enforceable contracts** in the majority of U.S. jurisdictions, including Indiana.² The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has documented that faculty handbooks with clear language regarding tenure, dismissal procedures, and shared governance constitute binding contractual obligations enforceable in court.³

**Three-Element Test for Contractual Status:**⁴
1. **Offer**: Handbook language contains a promise sufficiently clear that faculty would reasonably believe an offer was made
2. **Communication**: Statement disseminated to faculty member such that they are aware of contents and reasonably believe it to be an offer
3. **Acceptance**: Faculty member accepts by commencing or continuing employment after learning of policy

The Midwest University Faculty Handbook (2023 edition) states that tenure grants "indefinite appointment subject to dismissal only for adequate cause, bona fide financial exigency, or program elimination."⁵ This language satisfies all three elements and creates binding contractual obligations.

#### 3. AAUP Principles as Incorporated Terms

The MU Faculty Handbook incorporates by reference the AAUP's *1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure*.⁶ Courts consistently hold that when handbooks reference AAUP standards, those principles become part of the employment contract.⁷ Key incorporated provisions include:

- **Tenure Definition**: Continuous appointment without term limits, terminable only for cause, financial exigency, or bona fide program discontinuance⁸
- **Dismissal Procedures**: Written charges, hearing before faculty committee, burden of proof on administration, right to counsel⁹
- **Shared Governance**: Faculty authority over curriculum, academic standards, grading policies, and peer review of appointments¹⁰
- **Academic Freedom**: Protection from institutional censorship of research, teaching, or extramural utterances¹¹

These incorporated AAUP principles substantially constrain AEH's post-acquisition operational flexibility and must be honored to avoid breach of contract litigation.

### B. Successor Liability for Tenure Obligations

#### 1. De Facto Merger Doctrine

Under Indiana law and general successor liability principles, asset purchasers ordinarily do not assume seller's liabilities unless expressly agreed.¹² However, courts recognize exceptions when a transaction constitutes a "de facto merger" despite being structured as an asset purchase.¹³

**De Facto Merger Analysis (Project Athena):**¹⁴

| Factor | Application | Conclusion |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Continuity of operations | University continues offering degrees at same campus | ✓ Present |
| Continuity of management | President, deans, department chairs likely retained | ✓ Present |
| Continuity of personnel | 4,090 employees transfer (1,350 faculty + 2,850 staff) | ✓ Present |
| Continuity of location/assets | Indiana campus, facilities, accreditation, all assets transfer | ✓ Present |
| Assumption of necessary liabilities | Accreditation, student enrollments, faculty contracts required for operations | ✓ Present |
| Dissolution of predecessor | Midwest University likely dissolves post-sale | ✓ Present |

All six factors indicating de facto merger are present. Under Indiana precedent, courts will disregard the transaction's form and impose successor liability for employment contracts essential to the enterprise's continuity.¹⁵

#### 2. Tenure Rights Survive Ownership Change

The Illinois Appellate Court's decision in *Jacobs v. Mundelein College*¹⁶ provides the controlling framework for tenure obligations in institutional acquisitions. In *Jacobs*, the court held that when Mundelein College affiliated with Loyola University, tenured faculty contracts survived the transition because:

1. Faculty handbook tenure provisions were contractually binding
2. No formal financial exigency had been declared per handbook procedures
3. Affiliation did not automatically extinguish tenure rights
4. Successor institution (Loyola) was bound by tenure obligations¹⁷

**Application to Project Athena**: The $780 million acquisition price demonstrates that Midwest University is not experiencing the "imminent financial crisis threatening institutional survival" required to invoke financial exigency.¹⁸ Post-acquisition cost-cutting represents business strategy, not the extraordinary circumstances that permit tenure terminations. AEH therefore inherits MU's contractual obligations to all 680 tenured faculty members.¹⁹

#### 3. Scope of Successor's Obligations

By operation of successor liability doctrine, AEH assumes the following non-delegable obligations:²⁰

**Continued Employment**: Tenured faculty have presumptive right to annual reappointment without renewal requirements until retirement, resignation, or valid termination

**Academic Freedom Protections**: AAUP-standard protections for research, teaching, and extramural speech²¹

**Dismissal Procedures**: Termination only for documented cause following faculty handbook procedures (specification of charges, peer review hearing, right to counsel, administration bears burden of proof)²²

**Shared Governance Rights**: Faculty Senate authority over curriculum, degree requirements, grading standards, and peer review of appointments²³

**Compensation and Benefits**: Salary levels and benefit structures comparable to pre-acquisition standards (subject to legitimate cost-of-living adjustments and budget realities)²⁴

**Notice Periods**: 12-month notice for financial exigency terminations, shorter periods for cause dismissals depending on severity²⁵

### C. Financial Exigency Standard and Limitations

#### 1. AAUP Definition of Financial Exigency

The AAUP defines financial exigency as "an imminent financial crisis which threatens the survival of the institution as a whole and which cannot be alleviated by less drastic means" than termination of tenured appointments.²⁶ This is an **extraordinarily high** standard that few institutions can satisfy, particularly those being acquired for hundreds of millions of dollars.

#### 2. Procedural Requirements

The AAUP's *Recommended Institutional Regulations on Academic Freedom and Tenure*—incorporated by reference in the MU Faculty Handbook—establish stringent procedures for invoking financial exigency:²⁷

**Formal Declaration**: The governing board must formally declare that a financial exigency exists, demonstrating through audited financial statements that the institution faces insolvency or closure absent drastic measures

**Faculty Participation**: The Faculty Senate or representative body must have meaningful opportunity to review financial data, question administration, and recommend alternatives to faculty termination

**Demonstration of Less Drastic Measures**: The institution must prove good-faith efforts to avoid terminations, including:
- Hiring freezes across all employee categories
- Salary freezes or reductions (starting with highest-paid administrators)
- Reduction in non-personnel expenses (facilities, travel, consulting)
- Program consolidations short of elimination
- Voluntary early retirement incentives
- Endowment draws within prudent limits

**Order of Termination**: Non-tenure-track faculty terminated first, then untenured tenure-track, then tenured (by reverse seniority within department)

**Notice Period**: 12 months' notice for tenured faculty (AAUP standard), often longer in practice²⁸

**Recall Rights**: Faculty terminated due to financial exigency have right of first refusal if positions are reinstated within three years²⁹

#### 3. Case Law Establishing High Burden

Courts strictly construe financial exigency provisions against employers attempting to invoke them:

**Linn v. Andover-Newton Theological School** (D. Mass. 1986): Institution breached tenure contract by failing to follow its own internal procedures for declaring financial exigency. "Where an institution adopts financial exigency guidelines but fails to adhere to them, the court may not uphold a tenured faculty member's dismissal."³⁰

**Krotkoff v. Goucher College** (4th Cir. 1978): Upheld implied right to terminate for financial exigency even without express handbook language, but emphasized exigency must be "real and declared," not merely asserted post-hoc to justify dismissals.³¹

**Browzin v. Catholic University of America** (D.C. Cir. 1975): Financial exigency requires proof of "extraordinary and urgent" circumstances justifying departure from normal tenure protections. General budget constraints or desire to improve financial performance are insufficient.³²

#### 4. Application to For-Profit Conversion

The $780 million acquisition price and American Education Holdings' business model create insuperable obstacles to invoking financial exigency:

**No Imminent Crisis**: An institution commanding a $780M purchase price cannot credibly claim to face "survival-threatening" financial distress. The transaction valuation itself refutes any exigency claim.

**Business Restructuring ≠ Financial Exigency**: AEH's post-acquisition goals—cost reduction, margin improvement, standardized curriculum, online expansion—constitute business strategy, not emergency response to institutional collapse.³³

**Positive Operating Cash Flow**: MU generated $11.8 million in positive cash flow (after tax, before debt service) in FY2023.³⁴ Operating institutions with positive cash flow cannot satisfy the "imminent crisis" standard.

**Less Drastic Alternatives Available**: AEH has numerous options short of tenured faculty termination:
- Gradual attrition through voluntary retirements (5-7% of tenured faculty retire annually)
- Voluntary separation incentives (buyouts)
- Non-tenure-track hiring freeze
- Administrative cost reductions
- Technology-enabled efficiency gains
- Enrollment growth strategies

**Litigation Risk Assessment**: Probability of successfully invoking financial exigency: **5-10%**. If attempted and challenged, exposure: 680 tenured faculty × $300K-$1M per plaintiff = **$204M-$680M aggregate litigation exposure**, plus loss of accreditation and irreparable reputational harm.³⁵

*See* Section I.D at pp. 20-25 analyzing HLC Criterion 5.B requiring institutional stability; wrongful financial exigency declaration undertaken solely to reduce labor costs would provide grounds for HLC sanctions including loss of accreditation

*See* Section III.B.2 at pp. 42-45 analyzing ABA Standard 205(c) requiring law school financial resources and stability; fraudulent invocation of financial exigency to terminate tenured law faculty threatens ABA accreditation status

### D. Program Elimination as Alternative Mechanism

#### 1. Handbook Authorization

The MU Faculty Handbook permits dismissal of tenured faculty for "bona fide discontinuance of a program or department not mandated by financial exigency."³⁶ This provides a narrower path for workforce reduction than financial exigency, but remains subject to significant procedural requirements and good-faith limitations.

#### 2. Requirements for Valid Program Elimination

**Entire Program Elimination**: The institution must eliminate the complete program, not merely reduce faculty within a continuing program. Courts will scrutinize whether elimination is genuine or pretextual.³⁷

**Transfer Rights**: Faculty in eliminated programs have priority rights to transfer to other departments for which they are qualified. Institutions must make good-faith efforts to accommodate transfers before termination.³⁸

**Faculty Governance Consultation**: Shared governance principles require consultation with Faculty Senate regarding program elimination decisions, particularly when academic rationale is asserted.³⁹

**Notice Period**: One academic year's notice is standard (12 months), plus severance typically equal to one year's salary.⁴⁰

**Recall Rights**: If the program is reinstated within three years, terminated faculty have right of first refusal for reappointment.⁴¹

**No Immediate Replacement**: Institution cannot eliminate program, terminate tenured faculty, then recreate substantially similar program with non-tenure-track replacements. Such conduct constitutes breach of contract and possibly fraud.⁴²

#### 3. Cost Analysis: 10% Program Elimination

If AEH eliminates programs affecting 68 tenured faculty (10% of 680):

| Cost Category | Calculation | Amount |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Notice Period Salary** | 68 × $130K × 1 year | $8,840,000 |
| **Severance** | 68 × $130K × 1 year | $8,840,000 |
| **Benefits Continuation** | 68 × $30K × 2 years | $4,080,000 |
| **TOTAL Direct Cost** | | **$21,760,000** |
| **Litigation Risk** (20-30 faculty challenge) | 25 × $200K average | **$5,000,000** |
| **AGGREGATE COST** | | **$26,760,000** |

Additional indirect costs include curriculum redesign, student transfer accommodations, alumni relations, and potential accreditation complications if core liberal arts programs are eliminated.⁴³

#### 4. Programs Most Vulnerable to Elimination

Based on typical for-profit higher education strategies, the following programs face elevated risk:

**Low-Enrollment Humanities Programs**: Philosophy, classics, foreign languages with <20 majors annually
**Redundant Programs**: Multiple foreign language programs that could be consolidated
**High-Cost/Low-Revenue Programs**: Fine arts programs requiring expensive facilities and equipment
**Non-Vocational Liberal Arts**: Programs without direct career pathways

**Critical Constraint**: Elimination of liberal arts core threatens regional accreditation. Higher Learning Commission requires breadth of general education offerings.⁴⁴ Law school accreditation requires robust liberal arts foundation.⁴⁵ AEH cannot eliminate sufficient programs to achieve meaningful cost savings without jeopardizing accreditation.

*See* Section I.D.2 at pp. 25-28 analyzing HLC Criterion 3.B requiring breadth of general education curriculum; program elimination strategy must not eliminate programs necessary to maintain liberal arts core required for regional accreditation

### E. Pending EEOC Discrimination Charge: Dr. Susan Chen

#### 1. Factual Background and Timeline

**Complainant**: Dr. Susan Chen, Associate Professor (Asian female, 12 years of service)
**Protected Classes**: Race (Asian), Sex (Female)
**Adverse Action**: Tenure denial (May 2024)
**EEOC Charge Filed**: August 2024
**Current Status**: EEOC investigation phase
**Mediation Scheduled**: Q1 2026
**Allegations**: Race discrimination, sex discrimination, retaliation⁴⁶

Dr. Chen's tenure file reportedly includes strong teaching evaluations (4.6/5.0 average), 18 peer-reviewed publications, and active service on university committees. Her tenure denial was based on purported deficiencies in "research impact" and "collegiality"—subjective criteria often identified as pretexts for discrimination in academic settings.⁴⁷

#### 2. Title VII Legal Framework

**Statutory Basis**: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.⁴⁸ Congress expressly removed academia's Title VII exemption in 1972 due to concerns about widespread discrimination against women and minorities in higher education.⁴⁹

**No Academic Freedom Defense**: In *University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC* (1990), the Supreme Court held that universities cannot assert academic freedom as basis to withhold peer review materials from EEOC investigations. Title VII's enforcement "does not infringe academic freedom because it does not prevent the University from using any criteria it may wish to use, except those—including race, sex, and national origin—that are proscribed under Title VII."⁵⁰

#### 3. Prima Facie Case Analysis

**Traditional McDonnell Douglas Framework**:⁵¹
1. Dr. Chen is member of protected classes (Asian, female) ✓
2. She was qualified for tenure (18 publications, strong teaching) ✓
3. She suffered adverse employment action (tenure denial) ✓
4. Similarly situated comparators outside protected classes were treated more favorably [*requires fact development*]

**2025 Evolution**: Recent precedent clarifies that McDonnell Douglas is not the exclusive path to proving discrimination. In *Tynes v. Florida Department of Corrections* (11th Cir. 2023), the court held that "a plaintiff's failure to produce a comparator is not dispositive. McDonnell Douglas was never intended to be the only option for a plaintiff to survive summary judgment."⁵²

The Supreme Court's 2025 decision in *Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services* further liberalized proof standards, holding that plaintiffs can prevail without satisfying McDonnell Douglas's elements if their evidence raises a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.⁵³

**Evidence Supporting Dr. Chen's Claims**:
- **Statistical Disparities**: Tenure grant rates by race and sex over past 10 years may reveal pattern
- **Subjective Criteria**: "Collegiality" and "research impact" are notoriously manipulable standards courts view with skepticism⁵⁴
- **Comparator Analysis**: If white male candidates with similar or weaker credentials received tenure during the same period, this supports disparate treatment claim
- **Shifting Justifications**: If MU's stated reasons for denial evolved over time, courts infer pretext⁵⁵

#### 4. Retaliation Claim Analysis

**Three-Element Test**:⁵⁶
1. **Protected Activity**: Prior complaint about discrimination or participation in EEOC process ✓
2. **Adverse Action**: Tenure denial ✓
3. **Causal Connection**: Temporal proximity and/or other evidence linking complaint to adverse action

**Temporal Proximity Standard**: Very close timing (days or weeks) between protected activity and adverse action is sufficient alone to establish causal connection. Three to four months is generally insufficient standing alone and requires additional corroborating evidence. Twenty or more months is too attenuated absent strong additional evidence.⁵⁷

**Dr. Chen's Timeline** [*requires fact development*]: If Dr. Chen filed a prior complaint about departmental discrimination or hostile work environment within 3-6 months of her tenure denial, and the same decision-makers were involved in both the complaint investigation and tenure decision, her retaliation claim gains substantial strength.

**Additional Indicia of Retaliation**:⁵⁸
- Favorable annual reviews before protected activity, negative reviews after
- Inconsistent explanations for tenure denial
- Comments linking prior complaint to tenure decision
- Pattern of retaliation against other complainants in department

#### 5. Damages Exposure Analysis

**Back Pay** (Uncapped under Title VII):⁵⁹
Salary differential between Associate Professor and tenured Associate Professor position: approximately $10K-$15K annually
Period: May 2024 through trial (assume 3 years) = **$30K-$45K**
Plus benefits differential (retirement contributions, health insurance)

**Front Pay** (Uncapped):⁶⁰
If reinstatement is not feasible due to hostility or impracticality, courts award front pay as substitute remedy. Dr. Chen could claim lost future earnings from tenure denial through retirement.
Present value of 20 years at $15K annual differential = **$200K-$400K** (heavily fact-dependent on mitigation)

**Compensatory Damages** (Subject to Cap):⁶¹
Emotional distress, humiliation, damage to professional reputation, mental anguish
Typical range in academic discrimination cases: **$50K-$300K**

**Punitive Damages** (Subject to Cap):
Available only if MU acted with "malice or reckless indifference" to Dr. Chen's federally protected rights⁶²
Evidence supporting punitive damages: pattern of discrimination, failure to investigate prior complaint, retaliation

**Combined Compensatory and Punitive Damages Cap**: For employers with 500+ employees (MU has 4,090), the combined cap is **$300,000**.⁶³ This cap does NOT apply to back pay or front pay, which are equitable remedies.

**Attorneys' Fees and Costs**: Prevailing Title VII plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees.⁶⁴ In complex employment discrimination litigation extending 3-5 years, fees typically range **$150K-$300K**.

**Total Exposure Calculation**:

| Remedy | Low Estimate | Mid Estimate | High Estimate |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Back Pay | $30,000 | $40,000 | $50,000 |
| Front Pay | $0 | $300,000 | $700,000 |
| Compensatory Damages | $50,000 | $150,000 | $300,000 |
| Punitive Damages | $0 | $100,000 | $0 (within cap) |
| **Combined Cap Applied** | — | — | **$300,000** |
| Attorneys' Fees | $100,000 | $200,000 | $300,000 |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | **$180,000** | **$640,000** | **$1,350,000** |

#### 6. Settlement Strategy and Recommendations

**Pre-Mediation Due Diligence** (Immediate Action Required):

1. **Review Tenure File**: Obtain Dr. Chen's complete file including publications, teaching evaluations, peer review letters, committee recommendations, and dean/provost evaluations

2. **Comparator Analysis**: Identify all tenure decisions in Chen's department and college from 2019-2024; calculate tenure grant rates by race and sex; obtain personnel files for comparable candidates

3. **Prior Complaint Investigation**: Determine nature, timing, and resolution of any prior discrimination complaints filed by Chen; assess whether same decision-makers handled complaint and tenure review

4. **Department Climate**: Interview department chair and tenure committee members (under attorney-client privilege) to assess strength of MU's defense

5. **Statistical Analysis**: Engage labor economist if statistics reveal significant disparities in tenure rates

**Q1 2026 Mediation Approach**:

**Settlement Authority**: $150,000-$400,000 depending on evidence strength

**Opening Position**: No discrimination occurred; tenure denial based on legitimate academic judgment regarding research quality and fit with departmental needs

**Target Settlement Range**:
- **Weak discrimination evidence**: $100K-$150K (nuisance value settlement)
- **Moderate evidence**: $200K-$300K (avoid litigation costs and risk)
- **Strong evidence**: $350K-$400K (near-maximum exposure justified)

**Settlement Terms Must Include**:
- Full release of all claims against Midwest University and American Education Holdings
- Confidentiality provision (settlement amount, terms, and existence)
- Non-disparagement clause (mutual)
- Neutral reference letter from department chair
- No admission of liability or wrongdoing

**Reject Tenure as Remedy**: Granting tenure as settlement would undermine academic standards, create precedent for future claimants, and place Chen in hostile work environment ensuring future conflict. Monetary settlement with neutral reference enabling career transition is superior outcome.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
Settlement at $150K-$400K is superior to litigation for following reasons:
- Avoids $500K-$1M defense costs over 3-5 years
- Eliminates verdict risk ($640K-$1.35M exposure)
- Maintains confidentiality (litigation would publicize MU's tenure practices)
- Enables Chen to pursue opportunities elsewhere without protracted litigation
- Resolves matter before AEH closes acquisition, allowing clean slate

**If Mediation Fails**: Budget for 10-month EEOC investigation, 2-year litigation timeline, $500K+ defense costs, and potential adverse jury verdict. Consider second settlement negotiation after EEOC reasonable cause determination but before formal litigation commences.

#### 7. Successor Liability for Pre-Closing Claims

AEH inherits liability for Dr. Chen's discrimination claim under successor liability doctrine. The charge arose from conduct (tenure denial May 2024) that occurred pre-acquisition but involves an ongoing employment relationship and contractual tenure obligations that transfer to AEH.⁶⁵

**Purchase Agreement Recommendations**:
- **Specific Indemnity**: Seller indemnifies Buyer for all damages, costs, and fees arising from Chen EEOC charge
- **Escrow Holdback**: $500,000 held in escrow for 24 months to secure Chen indemnity
- **Insurance Assignment**: Seller assigns rights under D&O and Employment Practices Liability policies covering Chen claim
- **Settlement Authority**: Seller grants Buyer authority to settle Chen claim in mediation with amounts charged against escrow/indemnity

*See* Section X.D.2 at pp. 88-92 analyzing Employment Practices Liability insurance coverage; Dr. Chen EEOC charge falls within EPL coverage scope subject to verification of policy limits, exclusions, and $250K retention/deductible

### F. WARN Act Compliance Requirements

#### 1. Statutory Framework

The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq., requires covered employers to provide **60 calendar days' advance written notice** before a plant closing or mass layoff.⁶⁶ The statute protects employees from sudden large-scale unemployment by requiring advance notification that permits job search, retraining, and family adjustment.

**Covered Employers**: Business enterprises employing 100 or more full-time employees⁶⁷
**Midwest University**: 4,090 total employees → Covered ✓

**Triggering Events**:⁶⁸
- **Plant Closing**: Permanent or temporary shutdown of single site causing employment loss for 50+ employees during 30-day period
- **Mass Layoff**: Employment loss at single site during 30-day period for:
  - **50-499 employees** if they constitute at least 33% of workforce, OR
  - **500+ employees** (regardless of percentage)

#### 2. No Educational Institution Exemption

**Critical Finding**: The WARN Act contains **no statutory exemption** for educational institutions or university faculty.⁶⁹ While the Act exempts certain government agencies providing public services, private nonprofit and for-profit educational institutions are fully subject to WARN requirements.

The Department of Labor has confirmed that "institutions of higher education considering a workforce reduction may be subject to federal and state WARN laws."⁷⁰ All university employees—including tenured faculty, non-tenure-track faculty, and staff—are "employees" under the WARN Act entitled to notice.⁷¹

#### 3. Application to Midwest University Workforce Reductions

**Triggering Thresholds for MU** (4,090 employees):

| Layoff Size | Percentage of Workforce | WARN Notice Required? | Reason |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| 50 | 1.2% | **NO** | Below 33% threshold |
| 250 | 6.1% | **NO** | Below 33% threshold |
| 500 | 12.2% | **YES** | Absolute 500+ threshold triggered |
| 1,000 | 24.4% | **YES** | Absolute 500+ threshold triggered |
| 1,350 | 33.0% | **YES** | Both 33% and 500+ thresholds triggered |

**Practical Implication**: If AEH plans to terminate 500 or more employees within any 30-day period post-acquisition, WARN notice is mandatory. If terminations between 50-499, notice required only if they constitute 33% or more of workforce (1,350 employees).

#### 4. Limited Statutory Exceptions

Three narrow exceptions permit reduced notice, but **none apply to planned post-acquisition restructuring**:⁷²

**Faltering Company Exception**: Applies ONLY to plant closings (not mass layoffs). Requires employer to prove it was actively seeking capital and had reasonable belief that giving notice would preclude obtaining needed capital. This exception is **inapplicable** because: (a) AEH is acquiring a going concern, not a failing company; (b) cost-cutting is planned, not emergent response to unforeseen crisis.⁷³

**Unforeseeable Business Circumstances**: Requires that closing/layoff was caused by circumstances not reasonably foreseeable 60 days prior (e.g., major client bankruptcy, natural disaster). Post-acquisition restructuring is **planned and foreseeable** months in advance. Courts reject this exception for routine business reorganizations.⁷⁴

**Natural Disaster**: Direct result of earthquake, flood, drought, storm. Obviously **inapplicable** to business acquisition.

**Conclusion**: AEH cannot rely on statutory exceptions. If workforce reductions are planned, full 60-day advance notice is mandatory.

#### 5. Notice Requirements and Procedures

**Notice Recipients**:⁷⁵
1. **Affected Employees**: Each employee subject to layoff (or their union representative if unionized)
2. **State Dislocated Worker Unit**: Indiana Department of Workforce Development (warn-notice@dwd.in.gov)
3. **Chief Elected Official**: Local government unit where employment site is located

**Required Notice Content** (20 C.F.R. § 639.7):⁷⁶
- Whether action is plant closing or mass layoff
- Expected date of first separation and anticipated schedule
- Whether layoffs are expected to be permanent or temporary (and expected duration if temporary)
- Job titles of positions affected and names of workers holding those positions
- Bumping rights (if any) under seniority or collective bargaining agreement
- Name and telephone number of company official to contact for further information

**Timeline for Compliance**:
- **Day 0**: Finalize workforce reduction decision (specific positions, individuals, business rationale)
- **Days 1-5**: Draft WARN notices and obtain legal review
- **Day 5**: Deliver notices to affected employees, Indiana DWD, local government
- **Day 65**: Earliest permissible date for first separation

#### 6. Penalties and Enforcement

**Back Pay Liability**: Each aggrieved employee entitled to back pay for **each day of violation, up to 60 days**.⁷⁷ Calculation: (Employee's daily wage) × (Days of notice violation)

**Benefits Liability**: Employer must compensate for loss of benefits (health insurance, pension contributions) during violation period, up to 60 days.⁷⁸

**Civil Penalties**: Up to $500 per day for failure to notify state/local government, maximum $30,000 (60 days × $500).⁷⁹

**Attorneys' Fees**: Prevailing employees entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees, typically $50K-$150K in WARN class actions.⁸⁰

**Exposure Calculation for Hypothetical 500-Employee Layoff Without Notice**:

| Cost Category | Calculation | Amount |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Back Pay (500 employees) | $137 daily wage × 60 days × 500 | $4,110,000 |
| Benefits (500 employees) | $35/day × 60 days × 500 | $1,050,000 |
| Civil Penalties | $500 × 60 days | $30,000 |
| Attorneys' Fees | Class action estimate | $150,000 |
| **TOTAL WARN VIOLATION** | | **$5,340,000** |

Assumes average employee salary of $50,000 annually ($137/day) and benefits cost of $35/day. Actual exposure varies by employee mix.

#### 7. Indiana State Law

Indiana has **no state-level mini-WARN Act**.⁸¹ Unlike California (60-day notice for 50+ employees), New York (90-day notice for 25+ employees), Illinois, and New Jersey, Indiana imposes no additional notice requirements beyond federal WARN Act. This simplifies compliance—federal WARN is the sole applicable statute.

#### 8. Alternative Compliance Strategies

**Strategy 1: Full 60-Day Notice** (Recommended)
- Provide complete 60-day advance notice if any layoffs exceed thresholds
- Continue salary and benefits during notice period
- Outplacement services and severance enhance employee relations
- **Cost**: 60 days' salary already budgeted for transition; no violation penalties

**Strategy 2: Phased Reductions Below Thresholds**
- Conduct workforce reductions in multiple waves over 90+ day period
- Keep each 30-day period below 50 employees
- Courts may aggregate if reductions are part of single plan (risk of "rolling layoff" challenge)⁸²
- **Cost**: Extended timeline delays cost savings; legal risk if aggregation applied

**Strategy 3: Attrition and Voluntary Separation**
- Hiring freeze allowing natural attrition (5-7% annually)
- Voluntary separation incentive program (buyouts)
- These do NOT trigger WARN if truly voluntary⁸³
- **Cost**: Slower cost reduction; separation incentives expensive but avoid WARN penalties

**Recommended Approach**: If layoffs are necessary, provide full 60-day WARN notice. Cost of compliance (60 days' salary during transition) is marginal compared to $5M+ exposure for violation, plus negative publicity and employee relations damage. Treat 60-day notice period as transition/knowledge transfer phase with productive business purpose.

*See* Section XI.B.2.e at pp. 138-142 analyzing post-closing timeline requirements; if American Education Holdings plans layoffs exceeding 50 employees at any site, WARN Act requires 60-day advance notice affecting post-closing integration timeline

### G. Unionization Risk Assessment

#### 1. Current Union Status

Midwest University's faculty are **not currently unionized**. The Faculty Senate operates under AAUP shared governance principles but is not a labor union under the National Labor Relations Act. No collective bargaining agreement is in place for faculty.⁸⁴

Staff unionization status is unknown and requires immediate due diligence. Facilities maintenance, dining services, and security personnel at universities are frequently unionized, particularly in the Midwest.

#### 2. NLRA Successorship Obligations

If any MU employee groups are unionized, AEH must recognize and bargain with incumbent unions under *NLRB v. Burns International Security Services* (1972).⁸⁵ The Supreme Court held that a successor employer must recognize an incumbent union if:

1. **Substantial continuity** of business operations exists, AND
2. **Majority of successor's workforce** consists of predecessor's employees

Both factors are present in Project Athena. AEH continues university operations, retains same campus, and employs substantially all 4,090 MU employees. If unions represent any employee groups, AEH inherits bargaining obligations.⁸⁶

**Successor's Obligations**:⁸⁷
- Recognize union as exclusive bargaining representative
- Bargain in good faith over wages, hours, and terms/conditions of employment
- NOT required to adopt predecessor's collective bargaining agreement terms
- Must honor CBA until reasonable opportunity to negotiate new agreement (typically 6-12 months)

**Due Diligence Action Required**: Immediately ascertain whether any MU employee groups are unionized and obtain copies of all collective bargaining agreements.

#### 3. Faculty Managerial Exemption: *NLRB v. Yeshiva University*

In *NLRB v. Yeshiva University* (1980), the Supreme Court held that tenured and tenure-track faculty at private universities may be "managerial employees" excluded from NLRA coverage if they exercise substantial control over curriculum, academic standards, admissions, faculty hiring/tenure decisions, and university budget.⁸⁸

**Factors Supporting Managerial Status** (No Union Rights):
- Faculty Senate has authority over curriculum and degree requirements
- Peer review committees make tenure and promotion recommendations
- Substantial shared governance consistent with AAUP model
- Faculty participate in strategic planning and budget review

**Factors Suggesting Employee Status** (Union Rights):
- For-profit ownership with corporate governance structure
- Administration makes final decisions on all matters
- Reduced faculty autonomy post-acquisition
- Standardized curriculum limits faculty control
- Elimination or marginalization of Faculty Senate

**2014 Pacific Lutheran University Update**: The NLRB held that the party asserting managerial status bears burden of proving faculty exercise **actual authority**, not just handbook-described authority.⁸⁹ Given increasing corporatization of higher education, more faculty qualify as NLRA-covered employees.

**MU Faculty Assessment**:
- **680 Tenured Faculty**: Likely qualify as managerial under *Yeshiva* (cannot unionize)
- **110 Tenure-Track Faculty**: Borderline; depends on actual governance participation
- **560 Non-Tenure-Track Faculty**: Likely qualify as employees under NLRA (CAN unionize)

**Post-Acquisition Shift**: If AEH diminishes Faculty Senate authority, eliminates peer review, or imposes top-down curriculum, previously "managerial" faculty may become "employees" eligible for union representation. For-profit conversion itself supports NLRA coverage.⁹⁰

#### 4. Non-Tenure-Track Faculty Unionization Risk

The 560 non-tenure-track faculty at MU represent the highest unionization risk. Contingent faculty unionization is increasing nationwide, driven by:⁹¹

- **Pay Disparities**: Adjuncts earn $3,000-$5,000 per course with no benefits, while tenured faculty earn $130K with full benefits
- **Job Insecurity**: Year-to-year contracts create perpetual employment anxiety
- **Lack of Benefits**: No health insurance, retirement, or paid leave
- **Exploitation Narrative**: Adjuncts teach 50-70% of courses but receive minimal compensation and no voice in governance
- **For-Profit Stigma**: Perception that PE firm will maximize adjunct exploitation to increase profit margins

**Unionization Process Under NLRA**:⁹²
1. Union (e.g., SEIU, AFT, AAUP) obtains authorization cards from 30%+ of non-tenure-track faculty
2. Union files representation petition with NLRB
3. NLRB determines appropriate bargaining unit (usually all non-tenure-track faculty)
4. Election held (secret ballot)
5. If majority votes yes, NLRB certifies union
6. Employer must recognize union and bargain in good faith

**Timeline**: Petition to certification typically 6-9 months absent employer challenges; first contract negotiations take 12-24 months.

**Probability of Non-Tenure-Track Unionization**: **30-40%** within 3 years of for-profit conversion, based on national trends and circumstances.

#### 5. Graduate Student Unionization

In *Columbia University* (2016), the NLRB reversed prior precedent and held that graduate student teaching assistants and research assistants at private universities are "employees" under the NLRA with full unionization rights.⁹³ MU likely employs 200-500 graduate TAs/RAs who are eligible to unionize.

Graduate student unionization is accelerating nationwide, with successful campaigns at Columbia, Harvard, Yale, MIT, and numerous other institutions.⁹⁴ Demands typically include: stipend increases (from $20K-$25K to $35K-$40K), health insurance, childcare subsidies, and sexual harassment protections.

#### 6. Financial Impact of Unionization

**Scenario: 560 Non-Tenure-Track Faculty Unionize**

| Cost Category | Current | Union CBA (Typical First Contract) | Annual Increase |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Average Compensation | $55,000 | $63,250 (15% over 3 years) | $8,250 |
| Health Insurance | None | Full family coverage | $12,000 |
| Retirement Contribution | None | 5% employer match | $3,163 |
| Paid Leave | None | 15 days annually | $3,173 |
| **Total Per Faculty** | **$55,000** | **$81,586** | **$26,586** |
| **Aggregate (560 Faculty)** | **$30.8M** | **$45.7M** | **$14.9M annually** |

**Five-Year Impact**: $14.9M annual increase × 5 years = **$74.5M** increased labor costs

**Additional Costs**:
- **First Contract Bargaining**: $300K-$500K (attorneys, consultants, lost administrative time)
- **Ongoing Administration**: $150K-$250K annually (grievance arbitration, contract compliance)
- **Reduced Flexibility**: Cannot adjust compensation, workload, or benefits unilaterally; must bargain to impasse
- **Strike Risk**: Work stoppages disrupt instruction and harm enrollment

#### 7. Union Avoidance Strategy (Proactive Mitigation)

**Immediate Actions** (Pre-Closing):
1. **Compensation Analysis**: Benchmark non-tenure-track salaries against peer institutions; increase to 75th percentile (cost: $5M-$7M annually)
2. **Multi-Year Contracts**: Offer 3-year renewable contracts to non-tenure-track faculty (increases job security without granting tenure)
3. **Benefits Expansion**: Extend health insurance to faculty working 20+ hours/week (cost: $4M-$6M annually)
4. **Governance Inclusion**: Grant non-tenure-track faculty voting rights in Faculty Senate on matters affecting their employment
5. **Professional Development**: Fund conference travel, research support, and teaching workshops

**Prohibited Conduct** (Unfair Labor Practices Under NLRA):⁹⁵
- **NO TIPS**: No Threats, Interrogation, Promises, or Surveillance
  - Do NOT threaten to eliminate positions if employees unionize
  - Do NOT interrogate employees about union sympathies or organizing
  - Do NOT promise benefits conditioned on rejecting union
  - Do NOT surveil union organizing meetings or activities

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
- **Proactive Investment**: $10M-$15M annually (improved compensation and benefits)
- **Unionization Cost**: $74.5M over 5 years plus $3M-$5M bargaining/administrative costs
- **ROI**: Investing $50M-$75M (5 years) to avoid $77.5M unionization cost, plus preserved flexibility

**Recommendation**: Proactively improve non-tenure-track faculty compensation and job security before union organizing begins. Once organizing starts, employer improvements are legally suspect as unfair labor practices. Prevention is both cheaper and legally safer than union avoidance campaigns after organizing commences.

*See* Section XI.A.3 at pp. 45-48 analyzing post-acquisition operating cost increases; non-tenure-track faculty compensation improvements ($10M-$15M annually) should be budgeted as recurring operating expense to reduce unionization risk and improve teaching quality

### H. Shared Governance Preservation and Accreditation

#### 1. AAUP Shared Governance Principles

The AAUP's *1966 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities* establishes the framework for shared responsibility among governing boards, administration, and faculty:⁹⁶

**Areas of Primary Faculty Responsibility**:⁹⁷
- Curriculum design, degree requirements, and instructional methods
- Grading standards and academic integrity policies
- Faculty appointments, reappointments, tenure, and promotion
- Student academic performance standards
- Research priorities and academic freedom protections

**Areas of Shared Responsibility**:
- Long-range planning and budget priorities
- Presidential selection
- Physical plant and resource allocation
- Auxiliary enterprises and student services

**Areas of Primary Administrative/Board Responsibility**:
- Budget execution and financial management
- Personnel matters for non-faculty employees
- Business operations and legal compliance
- External relations and fundraising

#### 2. Contractual Status of Shared Governance

When the MU Faculty Handbook incorporates AAUP shared governance principles and grants Faculty Senate specific authorities, these provisions become contractually binding.⁸⁹ Courts enforce faculty handbook governance provisions, holding that universities must follow their own stated procedures.⁹⁹

**Typical Faculty Senate Authority** (MU Handbook):
- **Curriculum**: Recommend all new programs, majors, courses, and degree requirements; administration ordinarily follows recommendations absent documented rationale
- **Tenure**: Peer review committees evaluate candidates and recommend to dean/provost; administration follows recommendation in 80-90% of cases
- **Academic Policies**: Grading standards, attendance policies, academic integrity procedures determined by faculty
- **Budget Review**: Faculty Senate reviews proposed budget and provides input before Board approval

**Legal Consequences of Governance Elimination**:

If AEH unilaterally eliminates Faculty Senate, removes faculty from tenure decisions, or imposes curriculum changes without consultation, faculty can sue for:¹⁰⁰
- **Breach of Contract**: Handbook provisions are binding employment terms
- **Declaratory Judgment**: Court declares governance provisions enforceable
- **Injunctive Relief**: Court orders restoration of Faculty Senate and governance procedures
- **Damages**: Nominal damages or attorneys' fees (substantial monetary damages difficult to prove)

More significantly, governance elimination jeopardizes accreditation:

#### 3. Higher Learning Commission Requirements

HLC Criterion 5.A requires institutions to have "governance and administrative structures [that] promote effective leadership and support collaborative processes that enable the institution to fulfill its mission."¹⁰¹

**HLC Guidance on Shared Governance**: "The institution provides for faculty participation, as appropriate, in decisions about student learning and the learning environment."¹⁰² Accreditation evaluators specifically assess whether faculty have meaningful voice in academic policy decisions.

**Risk of Governance Elimination**:
- HLC can place institution on probation requiring focused visit
- Probation status must be publicly disclosed, harming enrollment and reputation
- Continued non-compliance can result in accreditation withdrawal
- Loss of HLC accreditation is **catastrophic**: federal student aid (Title IV) eligibility terminates, enrollment collapses, institution closes¹⁰³

#### 4. ABA Law School Accreditation

If MU operates an ABA-accredited law school, governance requirements are even more stringent:

**ABA Standard 205(c)**: "A law school shall have an established and effective faculty governance structure."¹⁰⁴

**ABA Interpretation 205-3**: "A law school shall afford to a faculty that is diverse and includes full-time clinical faculty, whose primary responsibilities are to the law school, the opportunity to participate in the governance of the law school, including the determination of educational policy."¹⁰⁵

Law school faculty must control curriculum, admissions standards, graduation requirements, and academic policies. Corporate administration cannot override faculty on academic matters without jeopardizing ABA accreditation.

*See* Section III.B.3 at pp. 45-48 analyzing ABA Standard 205(c) requiring law school faculty governance including faculty participation in dean selection, curriculum development, and academic policy; unilateral corporate control violates ABA requirements

#### 5. Practical Balance: Advisory Governance Model

**AEH's Dilemma**: Preserve sufficient faculty governance to satisfy contractual obligations and accreditation standards while retaining operational flexibility to execute business strategy.

**Recommended Model**:

| Decision Area | Faculty Role | Administration Role | Dispute Resolution |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Curriculum** | Recommend | Approve or disapprove with documented rationale | Administration prevails but must justify |
| **Tenure** | Peer review evaluates, recommends | President/Board decides | Follow faculty recommendation unless documented contrary reason |
| **Grading/Academic Integrity** | Determine policy | Enforce policy | Faculty primacy |
| **Budget** | Review, advise | Finalize and implement | Administration decides |
| **Strategic Planning** | Provide input | Make final decisions | Administration decides with consultation |
| **Faculty Hiring** | Search committee recommends | Dean/Provost approves | Administration decides from recommended candidates |

**Key Principles**:
1. **Faculty Senate is Advisory**: Recommendations are not binding, but administration must seriously consider and respond
2. **Meaningful Consultation Required**: Administration must consult Faculty Senate before major academic policy changes
3. **Document Rationale**: When overriding Faculty Senate recommendations, administration must document business/academic reasons
4. **Preserve Appearance**: Maintain robust Faculty Senate meetings, committee structure, and communication channels (essential for accreditation)
5. **Incremental Changes**: Phase in governance adjustments gradually rather than abrupt post-closing restructuring

#### 6. First 100 Days Governance Strategy

**Week 1-2: Relationship Building**
- AEH CEO meets with Faculty Senate Executive Committee
- Town hall with full faculty explaining for-profit transition
- Written commitment to preserving academic freedom and faculty governance
- Emphasize mission continuity, not profit maximization

**Week 3-4: Governance Charter Review**
- Joint AEH-Faculty Senate working group reviews governance procedures
- Clarify decision-making authority in ambiguous areas
- Document agreed-upon governance model in writing
- Faculty Senate votes to approve revised governance framework (demonstrates consent)

**Month 2-3: Proof of Concept**
- Faculty Senate reviews proposed curriculum changes (involve faculty early)
- Administration implements 80%+ of Faculty Senate recommendations (builds trust)
- Monthly meetings with Faculty Senate leadership (ongoing dialogue)

**Month 4-6: Accreditation Preparation**
- Prepare governance documentation for HLC review
- Faculty governance working effectively (evidence for accreditation)
- No major faculty complaints about governance (demonstrates collaborative model works)

**Ongoing: Competitive Compensation**
- Faculty salaries at market 50th-75th percentile reduce governance disputes
- Well-compensated faculty are less likely to challenge governance structure
- Compensation investment ($5M-$10M annually) cheaper than accreditation loss or unionization

### I. Employee Benefits and ERISA Transition

#### 1. Retirement Plan Conversion: 403(b) to 401(k)

**Current Status**: As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Midwest University sponsors a 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plan for employee retirement savings.¹⁰⁶ These plans are available exclusively to tax-exempt organizations and public schools under IRC § 403(b).¹⁰⁷

**Post-Acquisition Requirement**: Upon AEH's acquisition, MU loses its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. IRC § 403(b) plans are **no longer available** to for-profit entities.¹⁰⁸ AEH must convert to an IRC § 401(k) plan.

**Conversion Process**:¹⁰⁹
1. **Plan Amendment**: MU's 403(b) plan must be amended to freeze contributions effective on closing date
2. **New Plan Establishment**: AEH establishes 401(k) plan effective closing date
3. **Asset Rollover**: Participant account balances transfer from 403(b) to 401(k) as tax-free rollover
4. **Participant Communication**: 60-90 day advance notice explaining transition, investment options, and participant rights
5. **Vendor Selection**: RFP process for 401(k) recordkeeper (Fidelity, Vanguard, TIAA)

**SECURE 2.0 Act Requirement** (2022): New 401(k) plans adopted after December 31, 2024 must include **automatic enrollment** at 3-10% contribution rate (employees can opt out).¹¹⁰ This increases plan participation but may surprise employees expecting opt-in model.

**Employee Impact**:
- **Positive**: 401(k) plans often offer wider investment options and lower fees
- **Neutral**: Contribution limits identical ($23,000 in 2024, $7,500 catch-up for age 50+)¹¹¹
- **Negative**: Temporary disruption during transition; employees must re-designate beneficiaries and investment allocations

**Timeline**: 403(b) freezes at closing; 401(k) effective within 30 days; full transition completed within 90 days.

#### 2. Defined Benefit Pension Risk

**Critical Unknown**: Does MU sponsor a traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plan guaranteeing monthly retirement income?

Many older universities maintain DB pension plans that create **massive successor liability** for acquirers. If MU has a DB plan, AEH inherits:¹¹²

**Accrued Benefit Obligations**: Present value of all pension benefits earned by employees through closing date (can be $50M-$200M+ depending on plan size and funded status)

**Ongoing Funding Requirements**: Annual contributions to maintain plan's funded status and satisfy minimum funding requirements under ERISA¹¹³

**Investment Risk**: Employer bears risk of poor investment returns reducing plan assets

**Longevity Risk**: Employer pays benefits for life; increased longevity increases total cost

**PBGC Premiums**: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insurance premiums ($101/participant for flat rate + variable rate premium for underfunded plans in 2024)¹¹⁴

**Multiemployer Plan Withdrawal Liability**: If MU participates in a multiemployer pension plan (union-negotiated plan covering multiple employers), **withdrawal triggers liability** for MU's proportionate share of plan's unfunded vested benefits under ERISA § 4201.¹¹⁵ This can be $20M-$100M+ payable over 20 years.

**Immediate Due Diligence Actions**:
1. Obtain most recent **Form 5500** filings (annual pension disclosure)
2. Review **Schedule B** (actuarial valuation showing funded status, assumptions)
3. Determine whether DB plan exists and calculate funded ratio (assets ÷ liabilities)
4. Identify any multiemployer plan participation
5. Engage pension actuary to value AEH's successor liability

**If Underfunded DB Plan Discovered**:

| Funded Status | MU's Liability | Recommended Strategy |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 95-100% funded | $5M-$10M | Assume plan, continue contributions |
| 70-94% funded | $20M-$50M | Negotiate seller indemnity, escrow 15-20% of purchase price |
| <70% funded | $50M-$150M | Plan freeze or termination pre-closing; purchase annuities for participants |
| Multiemployer | $50M-$200M+ | Due diligence on plan's zone status; negotiate withdrawal pre-closing or price adjustment |

**Recommendation**: Pension due diligence is CRITICAL and must be completed before signing definitive purchase agreement. Underfunded pension liability can exceed $100M and fundamentally alter transaction economics.

*See* Section XI.A.1.f at pp. 28-32 analyzing liabilities requiring actuarial valuation; if Midwest University maintains defined benefit pension plan for any employee group, actuarial valuation of unfunded liability required with purchase price adjustment for underfunded amount

#### 3. Health and Welfare Benefits Continuation

**Current MU Benefits** (typical nonprofit university package):
- Medical insurance (employee + family coverage)
- Dental and vision insurance
- Life insurance (1-2× salary)
- Long-term disability insurance
- Flexible spending accounts (FSA) for medical and dependent care
- Employee assistance program (EAP)

**Post-Acquisition Options**:

**Option 1: Continuation of Existing Plans** (12-18 months)
- AEH continues MU's existing benefit plans during transition
- Minimizes disruption and employee anxiety
- Allows time for careful vendor selection and plan design
- Cost: No incremental cost beyond current premiums

**Option 2: Immediate Transition to AEH Plans** (Day 1)
- All MU employees enroll in AEH's benefit plans at closing
- Achieves immediate standardization across AEH portfolio
- Risk of employee backlash if AEH plans inferior to MU plans
- Requires extensive communication and enrollment support

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)
- Continue MU medical plan for 12 months (least disruptive)
- Transition other benefits (life, disability, FSA) to AEH plans immediately
- Conduct benefits comparison analysis; improve any areas where AEH plans inferior
- Open enrollment Year 2 for full transition to AEH plans

**COBRA Obligations**: Any employees terminated post-closing are entitled to continue health coverage at their own expense for 18-36 months under COBRA.¹¹⁶ Employer must provide COBRA notices within 44 days of termination.¹¹⁷

#### 4. Paid Time Off and Leave Policies

**Accrued Vacation Liability**: MU likely has accrued vacation liability of $5M-$15M (4,090 employees with average 15 days accrued × average salary). AEH inherits this liability and must either:
- Pay out accrued vacation at termination (for terminated employees)
- Transfer accrued vacation balances to AEH's PTO system (for retained employees)

**State Law**: Indiana does not require payout of accrued vacation unless employer policy or contract requires it.¹¹⁸ However, most university policies promise payout, creating contractual obligation.

**Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)**: MU with 4,090 employees is covered employer under FMLA.¹¹⁹ Employees with 12+ months service and 1,250 hours worked are entitled to 12 weeks unpaid leave for qualifying events.¹²⁰ AEH inherits FMLA obligations and must continue coverage without interruption.

### J. Risk Assessment and Quantified Exposure

#### 1. Employment Law Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Severity | Probability | Gross Exposure | Weighted Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Tenure Contract Breach** | CRITICAL | 95% if violated | $200M-$680M | $190M-$646M | Honor all tenure commitments |
| **Dr. Chen EEOC Settlement** | HIGH | 75% | $180K-$1.35M | $135K-$1.01M | Settle in Q1 2026 mediation |
| **WARN Act Violation** | HIGH | 60% if layoffs | $5M-$8M | $3M-$4.8M | Provide 60-day notice |
| **Non-TT Faculty Union** | MODERATE | 35% | $75M over 5 yrs | $26M over 5 yrs | Proactive compensation/benefits |
| **Governance Breach** | MODERATE | 40% if eliminated | $1M-$5M + acced. | $400K-$2M | Advisory Faculty Senate model |
| **DB Pension (if exists)** | HIGH | Unknown | $5M-$150M | TBD | Due diligence required |
| **Grad Student Union** | LOW | 15% | $15M over 5 yrs | $2.25M over 5 yrs | Competitive stipends |

**Total Maximum Exposure**: $212M-$765M (if all risks materialize and worst outcomes occur)

**Most Likely Exposure** (Central Case): $25M-$75M
- Honor tenure commitments: $0 (avoid breach)
- Chen EEOC settlement: $300K
- WARN compliance: $0 (provide notice)
- Non-tenure-track compensation improvements: $50M-$75M over 5 years
- Miscellaneous employment claims: $2M-$5M

#### 2. Purchase Price Impact Recommendations

| Finding | Gross Exposure | Probability | Weighted Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Tenure obligations (fixed cost) | $88.4M annually | 100% | $88.4M/year | Price reflects ongoing cost |
| Chen EEOC charge | $1.35M | 75% | $1.01M | $500K escrow holdback |
| WARN Act (if 500+ layoffs) | $5.34M | 60% | $3.2M | Budget compliance cost |
| Non-TT unionization | $75M (5 years) | 35% | $26M over 5 yrs | $10M-$15M proactive investment |
| DB pension (unknown) | $50M | 50% | $25M | Due diligence escrow $20M |
| **Aggregate Adjustment** | | | **$55M-$60M** | **Total recommended adjustment** |

**Recommended Purchase Price Treatment**:
1. **Escrow**: $5M for employment litigation (Chen charge, wrongful termination claims, WARN violations) held 24 months
2. **Pension Escrow**: $20M if DB plan exists and underfunded (held until valuation complete)
3. **Price Reduction**: $30M-$35M to reflect elevated employment risks and fixed tenure costs
4. **R&W Insurance**: $10M employment practices sublimit

*See* Section XI.A.2 at pp. 35-40 analyzing probability-weighted risk adjustments; aggregate employment law risks (tenure liability, WARN exposure, EEOC claims, unionization) support $55M-$60M purchase price reduction to account for structural constraints and compliance costs

### K. Draft Remediation Language

#### 1. Purchase Agreement - Employment Covenants

**Section 7.8 - Preservation of Faculty Tenure**

```
(a) Buyer Acknowledgment of Tenure Obligations. Buyer acknowledges that Seller
has entered into binding contractual obligations with approximately 680 tenured
faculty members pursuant to the Midwest University Faculty Handbook (2023 Edition).
Buyer agrees that such tenure obligations shall survive the Closing and bind Buyer
as successor employer. Buyer shall honor all tenure contracts in accordance with
their terms, including provisions regarding dismissal only for adequate cause,
financial exigency (as defined in the Faculty Handbook), or bona fide program
discontinuance.

(b) Faculty Governance Preservation. Buyer shall maintain the Faculty Senate
structure and shared governance procedures described in the Faculty Handbook for
a minimum period of three (3) years following Closing. Buyer may modify governance
procedures after such period only with prior written consent of the Faculty Senate
or upon sixty (60) days' advance written notice to Seller.

(c) Financial Exigency Limitation. Buyer shall not invoke financial exigency as
basis for dismissing tenured faculty for a period of three (3) years following
Closing unless Buyer can demonstrate, through audited financial statements certified
by a Big Four accounting firm, that the University faces imminent financial collapse
absent such dismissals. Any invocation of financial exigency must comply with all
procedures set forth in the Faculty Handbook, including formal board declaration,
Faculty Senate consultation, and demonstration of less drastic alternatives.

(d) Non-Retaliation. Buyer shall not terminate, discipline, or otherwise retaliate
against any faculty member for participation in due diligence, objections to the
transaction, or statements to accreditation agencies regarding the acquisition.
```

#### 2. Purchase Agreement - EEOC Charge Indemnification

**Section 9.3 - Dr. Susan Chen EEOC Charge**

```
(a) Assumed Liability. Buyer acknowledges that Seller is respondent to EEOC
Charge No. [NUMBER] filed by Dr. Susan Chen alleging race discrimination, sex
discrimination, and retaliation in connection with tenure denial dated May 2024
(the "Chen Charge"). Buyer assumes all liability for the Chen Charge and agrees
to defend, indemnify, and hold Seller harmless from any and all losses, damages,
costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or relating
to the Chen Charge.

(b) Settlement Authority. Seller grants Buyer exclusive authority to settle,
compromise, or litigate the Chen Charge in Buyer's sole discretion, provided that
Buyer acts in good faith and uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
liability. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of material developments
in the Chen Charge investigation and any settlement negotiations.

(c) Escrow Funding. Notwithstanding subsection (a), the parties agree that amounts
held in the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 2.5(b) may be applied to satisfy
liabilities arising from the Chen Charge, up to a maximum of Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000).

(d) Insurance Assignment. Seller hereby assigns to Buyer all of Seller's rights,
title, and interest in any insurance policies covering employment practices liability
or directors' and officers' liability that may provide coverage for the Chen Charge,
including but not limited to Policy No. [NUMBER] issued by [CARRIER]. Seller shall
cooperate with Buyer in submitting insurance claims and providing any information
required by insurers.
```

#### 3. WARN Act Compliance Procedure

**EXHIBIT G - Workforce Reduction Notice Protocol**

```
If Buyer intends to conduct any workforce reductions within twelve (12) months
following Closing that may trigger obligations under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq. ("WARN Act"), Buyer shall
comply with the following protocol:

1. THRESHOLD DETERMINATION. Buyer shall calculate whether proposed workforce
reductions constitute a "mass layoff" under WARN Act:
   a. Fifty (50) or more employees during any thirty (30) day period constituting
      at least thirty-three percent (33%) of workforce; OR
   b. Five hundred (500) or more employees during any thirty (30) day period
      regardless of percentage

2. NOTICE REQUIREMENT. If thresholds in Section 1 are met, Buyer shall provide
written notice at least sixty (60) calendar days in advance of first separation to:
   a. Each affected employee (or authorized union representative, if applicable)
   b. Indiana Department of Workforce Development (warn-notice@dwd.in.gov)
   c. Chief elected official of local government where campus is located

3. NOTICE CONTENT. Notices shall include all information required by 20 C.F.R.
§ 639.7, including: (a) whether action is plant closing or mass layoff; (b) expected
date of first separation and anticipated schedule; (c) job titles affected; (d)
bumping rights, if any; and (e) contact person for further information.

4. NO EXCEPTIONS. Buyer acknowledges that WARN Act exceptions for "faltering company,"
"unforeseeable business circumstances," and "natural disaster" do NOT apply to planned
post-acquisition workforce reductions.

5. PENALTY ALLOCATION. If Buyer fails to provide required WARN Act notice and incurs
liability for back pay, benefits, or civil penalties, Buyer shall bear sole responsibility
for such liabilities without recourse to Seller or Escrow Fund.
```

#### 4. Employee Handbook Amendment - Revised Governance Structure

**MIDWEST UNIVERSITY FACULTY HANDBOOK
SECTION IV.C - SHARED GOVERNANCE (As Amended Post-Acquisition)**

```
IV.C.1 Faculty Senate Authority

The Faculty Senate shall serve as the representative body for faculty governance.
The Faculty Senate shall have advisory authority in the following areas:

(a) CURRICULUM: The Faculty Senate shall review and recommend approval or
disapproval of all new academic programs, majors, minors, certificates, courses,
and degree requirements. The Provost shall give due consideration to Faculty Senate
recommendations and shall approve such recommendations absent documented academic
or financial reasons for disapproval. If the Provost disapproves a Faculty Senate
recommendation, the Provost shall provide written explanation to the Faculty Senate
within thirty (30) days.

(b) FACULTY APPOINTMENTS: The Faculty Senate, through departmental search committees,
shall evaluate candidates for faculty positions and recommend finalists to the Dean
and Provost. The Dean and Provost shall ordinarily appoint from among recommended
finalists but may decline all finalists and request additional search if documented
reasons support such action.

(c) TENURE AND PROMOTION: Peer review committees established by the Faculty Senate
shall evaluate candidates for tenure and promotion according to published criteria.
Committee recommendations shall be forwarded to the Dean, Provost, and President
for final decision. The President and Board of Trustees retain ultimate authority
over tenure and promotion decisions but shall follow peer review recommendations
except where documented academic, financial, or legal considerations require contrary
decision.

(d) ACADEMIC POLICIES: The Faculty Senate shall establish grading standards, academic
integrity procedures, attendance policies, and student academic performance standards.
The Administration shall enforce such policies as established by the Faculty Senate.

(e) BUDGET REVIEW: The Provost shall present the proposed annual academic budget
to the Faculty Senate for review and comment prior to submission to the President
and Board of Trustees. The Faculty Senate may provide recommendations regarding
budget priorities, which the Administration shall consider but shall not be bound
to adopt.

IV.C.2 Administration Authority

The University Administration, including the President, Provost, Deans, and Board
of Trustees, shall retain final decision-making authority over all University
matters, including but not limited to:

(a) Budget finalization and resource allocation
(b) Personnel matters for non-faculty employees
(c) Facilities, physical plant, and capital projects
(d) Legal compliance and risk management
(e) External relations, advancement, and fundraising
(f) Business operations and auxiliary enterprises
(g) Strategic planning and institutional priorities

IV.C.3 Consultation Requirement

Before implementing any major change in academic policy, degree requirements,
faculty employment terms, or governance structure, the Administration shall consult
with the Faculty Senate and provide opportunity for Faculty Senate to deliberate
and provide recommendations. "Consultation" means written notice at least thirty
(30) days in advance, Faculty Senate deliberation, and written Administration
response to Faculty Senate recommendations.

IV.C.4 Dispute Resolution

If disputes arise regarding interpretation of shared governance provisions, either
party may request mediation by a neutral mediator selected by mutual agreement.
Mediation costs shall be shared equally. If mediation does not resolve dispute
within sixty (60) days, either party may seek declaratory judgment in state court
of competent jurisdiction.
```

### L. Recommended Transaction Strategy

#### 1. Pre-Closing Actions (Immediate Priority)

**Week 1-2: Tenure and Governance Commitment**
- AEH publicly commits to honoring all 680 tenure contracts
- Draft and circulate written tenure preservation agreement
- Meet with Faculty Senate leadership to explain transition and governance model

### M. Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations

The employment and labor law landscape of this acquisition presents $212M-$765M in potential exposure but is manageable through adherence to four non-negotiable principles:

**1. Honor Tenure Obligations**: The 680 tenured faculty contracts are binding, survive ownership change, and cannot be circumvented without catastrophic litigation ($200M-$680M), loss of accreditation, faculty exodus, and reputational destruction. Attempting to invoke financial exigency given the $780M acquisition price has <10% chance of success. Tenure must be preserved.

**2. Settle Dr. Chen EEOC Charge**: The pending discrimination claim presents $180K-$1.35M exposure and significant reputational risk. Settlement in Q1 2026 mediation for $150K-$400K eliminates verdict risk, avoids defense costs ($500K-$1M), maintains confidentiality, and enables Chen's career transition.

**3. Comply with WARN Act**: If workforce reductions exceed 50 employees (and 33% threshold) or 500+ employees, 60-day advance notice is mandatory. Violation costs $5M-$8M. Compliance cost is marginal (60-day salary continuation already budgeted for transition). Always provide notice.

**4. Preserve Shared Governance**: Faculty Senate authority over curriculum, tenure, and academic policies is contractually required and essential to HLC and ABA accreditation. Advisory governance model balances faculty input with administrative control. Elimination of governance risks accreditation loss (catastrophic) and breach of contract litigation.

**Most Likely Employment Cost**: $25M-$75M over 5 years, consisting primarily of proactive investments in non-tenure-track faculty compensation ($50M-$75M) to prevent unionization, Chen settlement ($300K), and miscellaneous employment claims ($2M-$5M). These costs are manageable within the transaction's financial parameters and should be treated as necessary investments in workforce stability and legal compliance.

**The Strategic Choice**: Work collaboratively with tenure system and faculty governance, or face employment law catastrophe. Midwest University's value proposition—accreditation, faculty quality, academic reputation—depends entirely on honoring the employment contracts and governance structures that attracted the $780M acquisition price. Attempting to dismantle these structures post-closing would destroy the acquired asset.

*See* Section XII (Executive Summary) synthesizing all risk domains; employment law compliance requiring preservation of tenure system, faculty governance, and competitive compensation represents $55M-$60M purchase price adjustment plus ongoing $10M-$15M annual investment in faculty relations to prevent unionization
