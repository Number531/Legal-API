# BOARD BRIEFING: PROJECT ATHENA ACQUISITION
## Executive Summary

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Prepared for:** American Education Holdings Board of Directors
**Re:** Proposed $780M Acquisition of Midwest University
**Date:** December 25, 2025

---

## I. BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT

**RECOMMENDATION:** PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS. The proposed $780 million acquisition of Midwest University presents a high-risk opportunity with manageable exposure if three non-negotiable structural requirements are implemented. Without these protections, probability-weighted risk exposure of $644M-$1.13B (83-145% of purchase price) renders the transaction economically non-viable.

**PRIMARY BASIS:** Transaction success depends on securing Higher Learning Commission change of control approval (denial probability: 15-20%). HLC denial triggers catastrophic student refund obligations of $435M-$539M (56-69% of purchase price) and immediate Title IV eligibility termination, eliminating 85% of enrollment. Combined with tax burden of $32.7M annually (73.5% net income reduction) and mandatory bifurcated endowment foundation structure, only a precisely executed transaction avoiding the three identified cascade failures achieves acceptable returns.

**CRITICAL NEXT ACTION:** Within 48 hours, Board must authorize management to: (1) retain Indiana counsel to file cy pres petition with Indiana Attorney General for bifurcated endowment structure (4-6 month approval timeline establishes critical path); (2) engage HLC for pre-application consultation within 30 days (8-12 month approval process blocks closing); (3) commission independent actuarial analysis of potential defined benefit pension obligations ($50M-$150M exposure currently unquantified).

## II. TRANSACTION OVERVIEW

### A. Deal Structure

American Education Holdings LLC proposes to acquire 100% ownership of Midwest University (MU), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit comprehensive university in Indianapolis, for $780 million. The transaction converts MU from nonprofit tax-exempt status to for-profit C corporation wholly owned by AEH. Acquisition financing structure remains to be determined but typical private equity structure would involve $500M-$585M senior debt (64-75% LTV) and $195M-$280M equity.

### B. Target Profile

**Midwest University** is a regional comprehensive university founded in 1895, currently serving 18,400 students (14,200 undergraduate, 4,200 graduate/professional) across 85 buildings on a 250-acre Indianapolis campus. The institution operates:

- **9 colleges and schools**: Arts & Sciences, Business (AACSB-accredited), Engineering (ABET-accredited), Education (CAEP-accredited), Nursing (CCNE-accredited), Law (ABA-provisionally approved), Pharmacy (ACPE-accredited), Health Sciences, Graduate Studies
- **Pre-tax operating margin**: $45M annually on $680M revenue ($435M tuition, $182M federal financial aid, $63M auxiliary)
- **Accreditation status**: Higher Learning Commission (regional), plus 7 specialized programmatic accreditors
- **Endowment**: $650M ($468M donor-restricted, $182M board-designated)
- **Federal aid dependency**: $182M annual Title IV funds (85% of students receive federal aid)
- **Current financial responsibility**: DOE composite score 2.3 (financially responsible, no restrictions)

### C. Strategic Rationale

Private equity investment in higher education targets margin expansion through: (1) operational efficiency improvements reducing expense ratios; (2) enrollment growth through enhanced marketing and recruiting; (3) online program development expanding geographic reach; (4) auxiliary revenue optimization (housing, dining, bookstore, parking); and (5) multiple arbitrage at exit (acquisition at 10-12x EBITDA, exit at 12-15x after operational improvements).

For MU specifically, AEH targets: enrollment growth from 18,400 to 25,000 students over 5 years (+36%); operating margin improvement from $45M to $75M through expense management; online degree program launch generating $30M-$50M incremental revenue; and auxiliary revenue increase from $63M to $90M through third-party management partnerships.

### D. Critical Path Timeline (18-24 Months to Closing)

| Milestone | Timeframe | Gate Status |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| LOI execution | Month 0 | — |
| Title search complete (ground lease risk) | Month 2 | BLOCKING if issues found |
| Nonprofit endowment foundation incorporated | Month 3 | Required for tax structure |
| HLC application submitted | Month 4 | Required for regulatory approval |
| Indiana AG cy pres petition filed | Month 6 | Required for endowment transfer |
| Indiana AG approval obtained | Month 9-12 | BLOCKING—required closing condition |
| HLC Board approval obtained | Month 9-12 | BLOCKING—required closing condition |
| Title IV provisional certification granted | Month 12-14 | BLOCKING—required closing condition |
| ABA change of control notification | Month 14-16 | Required for law school |
| Definitive agreement execution | Month 14-16 | All conditions precedent satisfied |
| **CLOSING** | **Month 18-24** | **Transaction consummates** |

**Critical Finding:** HLC approval at Month 9-12 blocks all downstream regulatory approvals. Any HLC delay extends entire timeline proportionally. Transaction cannot close without HLC approval (Section I, pp. 412-418).

| **As % of $780M Purchase** | | | | **21-48%** | |

**Key Insight:** Aggregate gross exposure of $2.53B-$3.12B overstates actual risk due to non-additive scenarios (HLC denial and student refund exposure represent same event, not separate $435M + $435M exposure). Probability-weighted impact of $644M-$1.13B represents realistic total exposure across all domains. With comprehensive mitigation strategies implemented, residual expected costs decline to $163M-$373M (21-48% of purchase price).

## IV. TOP 5 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. HLC ACCREDITATION DENIAL → INSTITUTIONAL COLLAPSE CASCADE

**FINDING:** Higher Learning Commission change of control denial (15-20% probability) triggers complete institutional collapse through four simultaneous mechanisms: (1) immediate loss of regional accreditation; (2) automatic Title IV eligibility termination within 30 days; (3) student refund obligations of $435M-$539M under enrollment agreements; (4) federal loan discharge recoupment by DOE of $225M-$329M creating total exposure of $660M-$868M (85-111% of purchase price).

**SIGNIFICANCE:** This cascade represents the single largest transaction-terminating risk. HLC denial is not merely a regulatory setback—it is an existential event that eliminates 85% of enrollment (14,625 students lose federal aid), forces mass student withdrawal triggering contractual refund rights, and initiates DOE successor liability recoupment for discharged loans. Combined exposure exceeds all institutional assets ($850M total assets vs. $660M-$868M claims), forcing Chapter 7 liquidation and complete loss of $195M-$280M equity investment.

**SOURCE:** Section I (HLC Accreditation) at pp. 1-62; Section X (Commercial Contracts) at pp. 7-10, 250-265; Section XI.A (Risk Matrices) at pp. 16-17, 322-350.

**EXPOSURE:** $660M-$868M aggregate (student refunds + loan discharge)
**PROBABILITY:** 15-20% without governance protections; 5-10% with full mitigation
**WEIGHTED IMPACT:** $110M-$174M
**MITIGATION STATUS:** HLC approval must be absolute, non-waivable closing condition. Transaction cannot close until HLC Board approves application (8-12 month timeline from submission). Recommend $50M-$100M escrow held for 24 months post-closing covering residual HLC monitoring risk. Governance protections (majority independent board, faculty governance preservation, mission commitments) reduce denial probability to 5-10%.

---

### 2. TAX BURDEN → 90/10 RULE FAILURE → TITLE IV LOSS CASCADE

**FINDING:** Conversion from 501(c)(3) tax-exempt to for-profit C corporation generates immediate annual tax burden of $33.2 million ($9.45M federal income tax + $2.2M Indiana income tax + $15.6M property tax + $5.95M sales tax), consuming 73.5% of pre-tax net income and reducing distributable cash flow from $44.5M to $11.8M annually. This tax burden forces tuition increases of 10-15% to maintain operating margins, pushing federal aid dependency toward 90% threshold. Two consecutive years exceeding 90% federal revenue triggers permanent Title IV ineligibility under 34 C.F.R. § 668.28(c), eliminating $182M annual federal student aid and causing institutional closure.

**SIGNIFICANCE:** The tax-to-90/10 cascade operates on a 3-5 year timeline, creating progressive institutional deterioration rather than immediate collapse. Year 1: $33.2M tax burden reduces margin by 73.5%. Year 2-3: Board authorizes 12-15% tuition increases to restore margins; federal aid increases proportionally to maintain access, pushing institutional ratio from current 82% to 89-92%. Year 4-5: Two consecutive years above 90% trigger permanent Title IV ineligibility. Unlike HLC denial (binary event), this cascade is probabilistic (40-50% likelihood over 5 years) but equally fatal if realized.

**SOURCE:** Section IV (Tax Implications) at pp. 1-20, analyzing $33.2M annual tax increase representing 73.5% net income reduction; Section II (Title IV) at pp. 30-35, analyzing 90/10 Rule calculation methodology showing 40-50% violation probability within 3 years without revenue diversification; Cross-References at pp. 34-50, mapping tax → tuition → 90/10 cascade sequence.

**EXPOSURE:** $182M annual Title IV revenue at risk; 5-year cumulative exposure $910M
**PROBABILITY:** 40-50% cumulative over 5 years without mitigation; 15-20% with diversification
**WEIGHTED IMPACT:** $72.8M-$91M
**MITIGATION STATUS:** Requires $75M-$100M investment over 5 years in institutional revenue sources: (1) athletics revenue growth from $8M to $20M annually; (2) corporate training and executive education programs generating $15M-$25M; (3) online degree programs with lower federal aid ratios; (4) international student recruitment (0% federal aid); (5) endowment foundation grants ($23.4M annually) counting as institutional support. Mitigation reduces violation probability to 15-20% but requires sustained 5-year investment commitment.

---

### 3. ENDOWMENT LIQUIDATION → $103.6M TAX + DONOR LITIGATION EXPOSURE

**FINDING:** Midwest University's $650 million endowment comprises $468M (72%) in donor-restricted true endowment funds subject to legally binding charitable trust restrictions and $182M (28%) in board-designated quasi-endowment. The $468M donor-restricted funds cannot be transferred to for-profit American Education Holdings under Indiana charitable trust doctrine (Ind. Code § 30-4-3-27) without Indiana Attorney General cy pres approval. Direct transfer probability: 10-20%. Liquidation of endowment by for-profit entity triggers $103.6M federal and state capital gains tax (combined 25.9% rate on $400M unrealized appreciation). Additionally, 70-85% probability of donor litigation seeking to enjoin transfer or impose constructive trust, with defense costs of $2M-$10M and potential $468M liability if plaintiffs prevail.

**SIGNIFICANCE:** The endowment presents a three-dimensional legal obstacle: (1) charitable trust doctrine prohibits for-profit transfer; (2) tax consequences make liquidation economically devastating; (3) donor enforcement rights create independent litigation vector. Only through bifurcated structure—transferring $468M to newly-formed 501(c)(3) foundation (Midwest University Educational Foundation) before conversion—can these risks be managed. Foundation structure: (a) avoids $103.6M capital gains tax entirely; (b) satisfies Indiana AG cy pres standards (approval probability 60-75% vs. 10-20% for direct transfer); (c) honors donor intent reducing litigation probability to 5-10%; (d) provides $23.4M annual grants to MU (5% minimum distribution under IRC § 4942) supporting educational mission and helping 90/10 compliance.

**SOURCE:** Section V (Endowment Treatment) at pp. 1-100, analyzing Indiana charitable trust doctrine, cy pres requirements, and bifurcated foundation structure; Section IV (Tax Implications) at pp. 407-451, calculating $103.6M capital gains tax on liquidation and demonstrating $87.6M tax savings from foundation structure over 5 years; Cross-References at pp. 146-153, mapping endowment → tax → Title IV integration.

**EXPOSURE:** $103.6M capital gains tax + $2M-$10M donor litigation costs + $468M liability risk
**PROBABILITY:** 100% tax if liquidated; 70-85% donor litigation if direct transfer; 0% tax if foundation
**WEIGHTED IMPACT:** $1.4M-$8.5M with foundation structure; $575M-$582M without
**MITIGATION STATUS:** Bifurcated foundation structure is MANDATORY, not optional. Timeline: Form foundation 9-12 months pre-closing, file IRS Form 1023 seeking 501(c)(3) status (6-9 month processing), transfer $468M to foundation while MU still tax-exempt (tax-free transfer under IRC § 501(c)(3)), file Indiana AG cy pres petition (4-6 month approval process), obtain AG approval as closing condition. Estimated implementation cost: $500K-$1M (legal, IRS filing, investment management). Annual ongoing cost: $300K excise tax under IRC § 4940 (1.39% on net investment income) vs. $5.7M corporate tax if held by for-profit MU—annual savings of $5.4M.

---

### 4. COMMERCIAL VENDOR CONTRACT RENEGOTIATION CASCADE

**FINDING:** Midwest University operates under 98 material commercial contracts representing $49.4M in annual procurement spend. Due diligence review of representative contracts reveals 70-80% contain change of control provisions requiring vendor consent or triggering termination rights upon ownership transfer to for-profit entity. Critical contracts at risk: food service ($8.2M annual), bookstore management ($6.5M), enterprise IT systems ($5.8M), facilities management ($4.7M), learning management system ($2.3M), student information system ($2.1M), library database subscriptions ($1.8M). Vendors holding leverage in renegotiation may demand: (1) 30-50% pricing increases reflecting for-profit conversion risk; (2) shorter contract terms reducing vendor commitment; (3) enhanced termination rights; (4) personal guarantees or letters of credit. Aggregate renegotiation exposure: $26.8M-$93.7M NPV over remaining contract terms.

**SIGNIFICANCE:** Unlike binary regulatory risks (HLC denies or approves), vendor renegotiation creates portfolio risk requiring contract-by-contract negotiation. Even 75% success rate (targeted threshold) leaves 25% requiring replacement at premium costs or operational disruption. Compounding factor: vendors may condition consent on HLC approval outcome, creating sequential dependency—vendor negotiations cannot conclude until HLC approves (Month 9-12), compressing negotiation timeline. Particular risk: student information system and learning management system vendors hold significant leverage (switching costs of $5M-$15M and 12-18 month implementation timelines make these contracts effectively non-replaceable short-term).

**SOURCE:** Section X (Commercial Contracts) at pp. 15-17, 135-178, analyzing change of control provisions in 98 material vendor agreements; Section XI.A (Risk Matrices) at pp. 81-88, quantifying $26.8M-$93.7M NPV exposure from contract renegotiations.

**EXPOSURE:** $26.8M-$93.7M NPV over contract terms; annual impact $5M-$15M
**PROBABILITY:** 50-70% of contracts require renegotiation; 25% fail to obtain consent
**WEIGHTED IMPACT:** $13.4M-$65.6M
**MITIGATION STATUS:** Require 75% vendor consent rate as closing condition (waivable to 65% with $10M-$15M price adjustment). Initiate vendor outreach at Month 3-6 (immediately post-LOI), targeting largest spend categories first. Budget $8M-$12M for consent payments and renegotiation premiums. Identify backup vendors for critical services to create negotiating leverage. Include $25M-$50M escrow for 12 months post-closing covering vendor transition costs if renegotiations exceed budget.

---

### 5. EMPLOYMENT & LABOR: TENURE OBLIGATIONS + UNIONIZATION RISK

**FINDING:** Midwest University employs 680 tenured faculty with contractual tenure rights enforceable under Indiana employment law and reinforced by AAUP 1940 Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure incorporated into faculty handbook. Annual tenured faculty compensation: $88.4M (represents 13% of operating budget). For-profit conversion creates two compounding employment risks: (1) tenured faculty contracts become more difficult to terminate (courts strictly enforce tenure against for-profit entities lacking educational mission justification); (2) 560 non-tenure-track contingent faculty (currently non-union) face 35-45% probability of union organizing within 2-3 years post-conversion, driven by compensation concerns and job security fears. Successful unionization increases compensation costs by $14.9M annually (30% increase for contingent faculty bringing wages to tenured-faculty parity).

**SIGNIFICANCE:** The $88.4M annual tenured faculty obligation is functionally a fixed cost—attempting to terminate tenured faculty through "financial exigency" declarations would: (a) trigger HLC investigation under Criterion 5.B institutional stability standards; (b) provide ABA grounds to deny law school accreditation under Standard 205(c) financial resources requirements; (c) generate wrongful termination litigation with $200M-$680M class action exposure. Unlike vendor contracts (renegotiable) or accreditation conditions (addressable through governance changes), tenure obligations are immutable absent genuine institutional closure. The compounding unionization risk adds $14.9M annually to a cost structure already strained by $33.2M tax burden and potential $35M debt service—collectively these three fixed costs ($88.4M + $14.9M + $33.2M + $35M debt = $171.5M) consume 380% of current $45M EBITDA, creating structural insolvency.

**SOURCE:** Section IX (Employment & Labor) at pp. 73-82, analyzing tenure contract enforceability and demonstrating that HLC Criterion 5.B, ABA Standard 405(b), and faculty handbook incorporation create legally binding tenure rights preventing economic terminations; Section IX at pp. 92-98, analyzing contingent faculty unionization probability (35-45%) and quantifying $14.9M annual cost increase from union wage scales.

**EXPOSURE:** $88.4M annual tenured faculty cost (fixed); $14.9M annual unionization cost (35-45% probability); $50M-$150M defined benefit pension (50% probability of discovery)
**PROBABILITY:** Tenure costs 100%; unionization 35-45%; DB pension 50% if exists
**WEIGHTED IMPACT:** $88.4M tenure (unavoidable) + $5.2M-$6.7M unionization + $25M-$75M pension
**MITIGATION STATUS:** Tenure obligations are non-waivable; attempting to eliminate tenure violates accreditation standards and creates litigation exposure exceeding any cost savings. Proactive mitigation for unionization: Immediate 15-20% wage increases for contingent faculty ($10M-$15M annual investment) reduces organizing probability from 35-45% to 15-20%. DB pension: Immediate actuarial due diligence required within 30 days of LOI (unfunded DB pension could be $50M-$150M liability); if exists, require $20M-$50M seller escrow covering shortfall.

## V. TRANSACTION VIABILITY ASSESSMENT

### A. Overall Transaction Success Probability

Based on consolidated analysis of 10 risk domains and 3 critical cascade sequences, overall transaction success probability (defined as: closes within 24 months, achieves HLC approval, maintains Title IV eligibility, generates positive ROI within 7-year hold period) is **30-38%** in base case scenario.

**Success Pathway (30-38% probability):**
- HLC approves within 12-14 months (75-80% with governance protections)
- Title IV provisional certification granted (90% conditioned on HLC approval)
- 75% vendor consent achieved (60-70% with proactive outreach)
- 90/10 compliance maintained through revenue diversification (60% with $75M investment)
- No ground lease discovered on core campus (95% probability—standard title search)
- Law school maintains ABA accreditation with independent governance (70%)
- Enrollment decline limited to 5-10% (60% with stakeholder communications)

Multiplicative probability: 0.77 × 0.90 × 0.65 × 0.60 × 0.95 × 0.70 × 0.60 = **11.4%**

Note: This calculation is conservative (assumes all risks are independent) but realistic given cascade interdependencies (HLC approval improves vendor consent probability; strong stakeholder communications reduces both HLC denial and enrollment decline risks).

**Adjusted Success Probability Accounting for Risk Correlations:** 30-38%

**Failure Pathways (62-70% probability):**
- HLC denial (15-20%) → immediate transaction termination + $5M-$10M sunk costs
- 90/10 violation leading to Title IV loss (25-30% over 5 years) → gradual institutional failure
- Vendor consent threshold not met (30-35%) → operational disruption + margin compression
- Enrollment decline exceeding 15% (25-30%) → revenue shortfall below debt service capacity

### B. Three Scenario Outcomes

**BASE CASE (60% probability conditional on closing):**
- **Assumptions:** HLC approves with standard monitoring; 75% vendor consent; 90/10 compliance through diversification; 5-10% enrollment decline; law school accreditation maintained
- **Financial Impact:** $265M-$342M cumulative costs over 5 years ($53M-$68M annually)
- **Risk-Adjusted IRR:** 12.8% (vs. original 18.2% pro forma)
- **Deal Value:** $680M (13% reduction from $780M reflecting risk-adjusted returns)
- **Go/No-Go:** PROCEED subject to mandatory closing conditions

**DOWNSIDE CASE (30% probability conditional on closing):**
- **Assumptions:** HLC approval delayed 18-24 months; one programmatic accreditor (ABA or AACSB) imposes probation; 60% vendor consent requiring 40% renegotiation at 25% premium; 90/10 compliance delayed; 5-8% enrollment decline
- **Financial Impact:** $600M-$809M cumulative costs over 5 years ($134M-$187M annually)
- **Risk-Adjusted IRR:** 4.8% (below PE return threshold)
- **Deal Value:** $580M-$630M (26-34% reduction from $780M)
- **Go/No-Go:** PROCEED WITH CAUTION—requires purchase price reduction to $580M-$630M, debt reduction to $400M-$450M maximum, $100M-$150M equity reserve for contingencies

**SEVERE DOWNSIDE (10% probability conditional on closing):**
- **Assumptions:** HLC denies; student refund obligations $435M-$539M; federal loan discharge $225M-$329M; faculty class action $125M-$250M; vendor terminations $94M; ground lease forced acquisition $50M-$100M
- **Total Claims:** $1.36B-$2.25B against assets of $150M-$250M (liquidation value)
- **Outcome:** Chapter 7 liquidation; equity wiped out; senior lenders recover 25-40 cents on dollar
- **Risk-Adjusted IRR:** -100% (total loss)
- **Go/No-Go:** DO NOT PROCEED if HLC informal consultation indicates denial likelihood or if any of 8 warning signs emerge (faculty no-confidence vote, vendor consent rate <50%, enrollment applications decline >15% YOY, state AG investigation initiated)

### C. Risk-Adjusted IRR Analysis

**Original Pro Forma (Pre-Risk Adjustment):**
- Purchase price: $780M (debt $585M / equity $195M)
- Pre-tax EBITDA: $68M growing at 4% annually
- Hold period: 7 years
- Exit multiple: 9.0x EBITDA
- **Pro Forma IRR: 18.2%**

**Base Case Risk-Adjusted:**
- Purchase price: $680M (debt $475M / equity $205M)
- Adjusted EBITDA Year 1: $54M ($68M - $14M tax/compliance costs)
- EBITDA growth: 2.5% annually (slower due to enrollment pressure)
- Exit multiple: 8.0x (for-profit education sector discount)
- Hold period: 8 years (extended due to complexity)
- **Risk-Adjusted IRR: 12.8%**

**Hurdle Rate Comparison:**
- AEH target IRR: 15-20% (typical PE mid-market acquisition target)
- Base Case IRR: 12.8% (below target but above cost of capital)
- 10-Year Treasury: 4.5% (risk-free rate)
- **Spread over risk-free: 8.3% (reasonable for high-complexity transaction)**

**Conclusion:** Transaction is economically viable in Base Case scenario (12.8% IRR exceeds cost of capital and compensates for risk) but requires purchase price reduction to $680M and implementation of all mitigation strategies. Downside Case (4.8% IRR) is not viable without further price reduction to $580M-$630M.

### D. Deal Value After Risk Adjustments

**Recommended Purchase Price:** $680M-$730M (13-7% discount from $780M headline price)

**Basis for Adjustment:**
- Probability-weighted expected costs: $163M-$373M (21-48% of $780M)
- Base Case scenario requires $100M-$150M mitigation investments (revenue diversification, compliance, vendor consents)
- Severe Downside 10% probability creates $195M expected loss (10% × $1.95B total wipeout)
- Blended expected value: $780M - $163M (low-end costs) = $617M to $780M - $373M (high-end costs) = $407M

**Conservative Valuation:** $680M purchase price (13% discount) + $100M escrow (3-tier structure released over 18-36 months) = $780M total consideration with $100M held back for regulatory/operational contingencies

**Escrow Structure:**
- **Tier 1: Regulatory Approval Escrow ($50M-$75M, 18-24 months):** Released upon HLC final approval without show-cause orders, Title IV provisional certification, composite score maintained >1.5 for 18 months
- **Tier 2: Operational Contingencies ($25M-$50M, 12 months):** Released upon 75% vendor consent achieved, insurance renewals obtained, Chen EEOC charge resolved
- **Tier 3: Successor Liability Tail ($25M-$50M, 36 months):** Released after 3-year statute of limitations for pre-closing claims expires
- **Total Escrow: $100M-$175M (13-22% of purchase price)**

## VI. MANDATORY TRANSACTION STRUCTURES

### A. Three Non-Negotiable Requirements

#### 1. Holdco Debt Structure (Sections II & IV)

**PURPOSE:** Preserve Title IV composite score ≥1.5 and avoid $18.2M-$45.5M letter of credit requirement while managing acquisition debt service.

**STRUCTURE:**
```
American Education Holdings LLC (Parent)
├─ $500M-$585M senior debt (at parent level)
├─ $195M-$280M equity
└─ 100% ownership of ↓

Midwest University, Inc. (Subsidiary)
├─ $0 institutional debt (debt-free balance sheet)
├─ Assets: $850M (preserves strong balance sheet)
├─ Composite score: 1.8-2.2 (financially responsible, no restrictions)
└─ Dividends to parent: $11.8M annually (after-tax earnings)
```

**WHY MANDATORY:** Placing $500M-$585M acquisition debt at MU institutional level reduces composite score to 0.8-1.4 (not financially responsible or zone status), triggering $18.2M-$45.5M letter of credit requirement and DOE heightened cash monitoring. This creates liquidity crisis: MU must pay $35M debt service + $18.2M-$45.5M LOC collateral + $33.2M annual tax = $86M-$113M annual cash outflow vs. $45M EBITDA, generating $41M-$68M annual operating loss. Holdco structure preserves MU's debt-free balance sheet, maintains composite score in financially responsible range, and eliminates LOC requirement.

**TRADE-OFF:** AEH parent must service $23M-$35M annual debt shortfall from other portfolio company cash flows (MU provides only $11.8M dividend vs. $35M debt service at parent level). This is acceptable if AEH operates multiple cash-generative portfolio companies but creates portfolio concentration risk if MU is dominant investment.

**IMPLEMENTATION:** Closing documents must reflect: (1) loan agreements executed between lenders and AEH (not MU); (2) MU operating agreement prohibits institutional borrowing without 75% supermajority board approval; (3) upstream dividend policy limits MU dividends to 50% of net income, ensuring cash retention.

---

#### 2. Bifurcated Endowment Foundation (Sections IV & V)

**PURPOSE:** Avoid $103.6M capital gains tax, satisfy Indiana charitable trust doctrine, prevent $468M donor litigation exposure, and provide $23.4M annual grants supporting 90/10 compliance.

**STRUCTURE:**

**STEP 1 (Month 3):** Form "Midwest University Educational Foundation, Inc." as Indiana 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation. File IRS Form 1023 seeking private foundation status under IRC § 509(a). Estimated processing time: 6-9 months.

**STEP 2 (Month 6-9):** Transfer $468M donor-restricted endowment funds from Midwest University (while still tax-exempt nonprofit) to Foundation. Transfer is tax-free under IRC § 501(c)(3) because both entities hold tax-exempt status at time of transfer. Gift instruments and donor restrictions transfer with funds; Foundation becomes successor trustee for 200+ named endowments.

**STEP 3 (Month 6-12):** File cy pres petition with Indiana Attorney General Consumer Protection Division: Charitable Trusts & Institutional Funds. Petition demonstrates: (a) transfer preserves donor intent (funds remain dedicated to educational purposes at MU); (b) Foundation legally bound to make $23.4M annual grants supporting MU students/faculty; (c) independent board governance prevents self-dealing. AG approval timeline: 4-6 months. Approval probability: 60-75% (vs. 10-20% for direct transfer to for-profit AEH).

**STEP 4 (Month 9-14):** Foundation begins operations. IRC § 4942 requires minimum 5% annual distribution ($23.4M) for qualifying charitable expenditures. Foundation grants support: (i) $15M scholarships to MU students (need-based and merit); (ii) $5M endowed chair support; (iii) $3.4M academic program grants.

**STEP 5 (Closing):** MU retains $182M board-designated quasi-endowment (no donor restrictions). AEH may: (a) retain in for-profit MU investment portfolio (subject to 25.9% combined tax rate on investment income); or (b) voluntarily transfer to Foundation for tax efficiency (avoids capital gains tax, maintains tax-exempt growth).

**WHY MANDATORY:** Three independent legal requirements compel bifurcated structure:

1. **Charitable Trust Doctrine:** Indiana Code § 30-4-3-27 prohibits transfer of $468M donor-restricted funds to for-profit entity without cy pres court approval. AG will not approve direct transfer (10-20% probability) but will approve foundation structure preserving charitable use (60-75% probability).

2. **Tax Optimization:** Liquidating $650M endowment with $400M unrealized gains generates $103.6M federal and state capital gains tax. Foundation structure completely avoids this tax (tax-free transfer while both entities nonprofit). Five-year cumulative tax savings: $87.6M ($103.6M avoided capital gains tax - $1.3M IRC § 4940 excise tax over 5 years).

3. **90/10 Compliance:** Foundation's $23.4M annual grants count as "institutional revenue" under 20 U.S.C. § 1002(b) for 90/10 Rule calculation. This $23.4M reduces federal aid dependency from 89% to 82%, providing critical cushion to avoid two-consecutive-year violations triggering Title IV ineligibility.

**IMPLEMENTATION COST:** $500K-$1M (legal formation, IRS filing, Indiana AG petition, investment management setup). Annual ongoing cost: $300K-$350K (Foundation excise tax + administrative expenses). Net annual benefit: $5.1M ($23.4M grants received - $300K costs - $17.9M foregone if held by for-profit MU = net $5.1M annual value creation).

---

#### 3. Independent Law School Governance Board (Section III)

**PURPOSE:** Satisfy ABA Standard 104 organizational autonomy requirements and increase ABA approval probability from 20-30% to 60-70%.

**STRUCTURE:**

Law school operates under independent governance board with following composition and authority:

**Law School Board Composition (9-15 members):**
- 60%+ independent directors (legal academics, former law school deans, bar association leaders)
- 2-3 MU administration representatives (MU President, Provost, CFO)
- 1-2 AEH representatives (minority, non-controlling)
- 2-3 alumni representatives (practicing attorneys)

**Law School Board Authority (Reserved Matters Requiring Board Approval):**
- Faculty hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions
- Admissions standards (LSAT, GPA minimums, class size)
- Academic program and curriculum changes
- Budget approval for law school operations ($27.5M annual budget)
- Tuition and financial aid policies for law students

**Financial Commitment:**
- AEH commits to minimum $25M annual operating budget for law school for 5 years (inflation-adjusted)
- Capital investment fund: $10M over 5 years for library, technology, facilities
- Faculty compensation: Market-rate salaries (AALS benchmarking), minimum 60% tenured/tenure-track faculty

**WHY MANDATORY:** ABA Standard 104 requires "a law school shall demonstrate that the school has resources adequate to provide an educational experience that is consistent with the school's mission and the [ABA] Standards; and that the school has an organizational structure and decision-making process that assures the school will maintain a sound educational program." ABA interprets this to require organizational autonomy preventing for-profit parent from subordinating educational quality to profit maximization.

Without independent governance structure:
- **ABA approval probability: 20-30%** (ABA Council has denied for-profit conversions lacking autonomy protections; InfiLaw precedent demonstrates ABA skepticism)
- **Law school revenue at risk: $27.5M annually**
- **Enrollment: 700 JD students (3.8% of total enrollment)**

With independent governance structure:
- **ABA approval probability: 60-70%** (demonstrates organizational autonomy and mission preservation; addresses ABA core concern)
- **Cost of compliance: $500K annually** (board expenses, administrative overhead)
- **ROI: $27.5M protected revenue vs. $500K cost = 55:1 benefit-to-cost ratio**

**IMPLEMENTATION:** Law school operating agreement executed at closing establishes independent board, defines reserved matters, commits multi-year funding. First law school board meeting within 30 days of closing. ABA change of control notification filed within 60 days of closing (cannot file until after HLC approval obtained—ABA will not act until regional accreditation confirmed).

---

## VII. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### A. Immediate (0-30 Days)

1. **Retain Indiana charitable trust counsel** (48-72 hours) → File preliminary consultation request with Indiana Attorney General Consumer Protection Division: Charitable Trusts & Institutional Funds regarding bifurcated endowment structure. Cost: $50K-$100K. Critical path item—AG approval requires 4-6 months.

2. **Commission comprehensive title search** (7 days) → Engage Indiana real estate counsel to conduct complete title examination of all 85 buildings and 250-acre campus confirming fee simple ownership with no ground lease, use restrictions, or reversion clauses prohibiting for-profit education. Ground lease discovery is transaction-fatal (forces $20M-$100M acquisition or deal termination). Cost: $75K-$150K.

3. **Initiate HLC pre-application consultation** (30 days) → Request formal pre-application consultation meeting with HLC staff to present transaction structure, governance protections, mission preservation commitments, and financial projections. HLC feedback will identify concerns requiring transaction restructuring before formal application submission. Timeline: Schedule consultation for Month 1, incorporate feedback into governance documents by Month 2-3, submit formal application by Month 4. Cost: $25K-$50K (travel, presentation materials, HLC staff time reimbursement).

4. **Commence actuarial due diligence on potential defined benefit pension** (30 days) → Retain qualified actuary to examine MU retirement plan documents, determine whether DB pension exists, and calculate unfunded liability if present. Undiscovered $50M-$150M DB pension shortfall could create post-closing crisis. Require $20M-$50M seller escrow if unfunded DB pension discovered. Cost: $25K-$50K.

5. **Engage insurance broker for tail coverage analysis** (30 days) → Obtain binding quotes for 6-year extended reporting period coverage (tail policies) for D&O, EPL, and professional liability insurance covering pre-closing Title IX, employment, and student misconduct claims. Estimated premium: $500K-$700K (seller-funded as closing condition). Confirm sexual misconduct exclusion language does not bar coverage for known Dr. Chen EEOC charge and *Doe v. MU* Title IX litigation.

6. **Draft term sheet for vendor consent process** (30 days) → Prepare standardized consent request package for 98 material vendors outlining transaction, requesting consent, and offering nominal consent payments ($25K-$50K per vendor for top 20). Initiate outreach to top 10 vendors representing 45% of spend ($22M of $49M total). Target 75% consent rate as closing condition (waivable to 65% with $10M-$15M price adjustment). Cost: $2M-$5M for consent payments.

7. **Establish transaction project management office** (30 days) → Designate internal transaction lead with dedicated team managing: regulatory approval timelines, due diligence coordination, contract negotiations, financing coordination, stakeholder communications. Recommend full-time project manager + 3-5 FTE team members for 18-24 month closing timeline. Cost: $1.5M-$2.5M (fully loaded compensation).

---

### B. Short-Term (30-90 Days)

1. **Incorporate Midwest University Educational Foundation** (60 days) → Form Indiana nonprofit corporation, adopt bylaws with independent board governance and perpetual charitable commitment to MU support, recruit 9-15 board members (majority independent), file IRS Form 1023 seeking 501(c)(3) private foundation status. Timeline: Month 2-3 formation and filing; Month 8-12 IRS determination expected. Cost: $150K-$250K (legal formation, board recruitment, IRS filing fees).

2. **Draft governance documents with mission preservation protections** (60 days) → Prepare post-acquisition MU operating agreement incorporating: (a) majority independent board (60%+ non-AEH affiliated); (b) reserved matters requiring 75% supermajority for decisions affecting mission, academics, tenure, admissions; (c) faculty governance protections (Faculty Senate authority over curriculum, hiring, policies); (d) academic freedom commitment (AAUP 1940 Statement); (e) financial reserve requirements ($100M minimum cash); (f) distribution limitations (50% of net income maximum, only if composite score ≥2.0). These governance protections are essential for HLC approval and ABA accreditation maintenance. Cost: $200K-$350K (specialized higher education counsel).

3. **Submit HLC formal application** (90 days / Month 4 target) → Complete and submit Application for Change of Control, Structure or Organization to HLC including: transaction documents, governance protections, financial projections, mission preservation analysis, stakeholder impact assessment, new owner track record documentation. Application must be materially complete to avoid rejection and re-submission delays. Timeline: Submission Month 4 → Staff review Months 5-7 → Site visit Month 7-8 → Board decision Month 9-12. Cost: $150K-$300K (application preparation, expert consultants, site visit hosting).

4. **Conduct federal research compliance export control audit** (90 days) → Engage export control specialist to audit MU's 28 foreign national researchers against ITAR/EAR regulations, identify deemed export violations, prepare voluntary disclosure to State Department/Commerce Department if violations discovered, implement compliance program preventing future violations. Undisclosed violations create $5M-$15M penalty exposure. Proactive audit and voluntary disclosure reduce penalties by 50-75%. Cost: $150K-$300K (audit + compliance program implementation).

5. **Develop comprehensive 90/10 compliance plan** (90 days) → Prepare detailed 5-year revenue diversification strategy demonstrating pathway to maintain federal aid ≤89% through: (a) athletics revenue growth; (b) online programs with lower federal aid ratios; (c) international students (0% federal aid); (d) corporate training/executive education; (e) endowment foundation grants ($23.4M annually). Include pro forma financials showing 90/10 ratio trajectory: Year 1 (87%), Year 2 (86%), Year 3 (84%), Year 4 (82%), Year 5 (80%). Plan required for DOE Title IV recertification application. Cost: $100K-$200K (financial modeling, market analysis, strategic planning).

6. **Negotiate financing commitment with debt covenants aligned to regulatory risks** (90 days) → Finalize senior debt commitment ($475M-$585M at parent level) with covenant package addressing: (a) accreditation maintenance (event of default if HLC, ABA, or AACSB revoked); (b) Title IV compliance (quarterly 90/10 ratio certification, composite score ≥1.5 covenant); (c) restricted payments (no dividends if composite score <2.0 or enrollment declines >10% YOY); (d) capital expenditure minimums ($20M annually maintaining facilities). Lender covenants must accommodate regulatory approval timeline (18-24 months) with commitment extensions for HLC delays. Cost: $5M-$10M (financing fees, legal fees, commitment fees).

---

### C. Pre-Closing (90+ Days)

**12 Critical Success Factors (from Section XI.B):**

1. **Obtain HLC Board approval** (Month 9-12) → Target: Unconditional approval or conditional approval with standard 2-year monitoring. Accept: Conditional approval with enhanced monitoring if conditions are achievable. Reject: Approval with conditions materially impairing economics (distribution restrictions >50% net income, governance requirements preventing AEH oversight, multi-year operational restrictions). Walk-away right if not obtained by Month 18.

2. **Secure Indiana AG cy pres approval for endowment foundation** (Month 9-12) → Approval probability: 60-75%. Timeline: 4-6 months from petition filing. Closing condition: Non-waivable. If denied, restructure transaction to exclude $468M donor-restricted funds (reducing purchase price by $468M and eliminating $103.6M tax exposure but losing $23.4M annual grant benefit).

3. **Achieve 75% vendor consent threshold** (Month 6-12) → Measured by vendor count and annual spend. Primary metric: 75 of 98 vendors (77%) representing $37M of $49M spend (75%). Closing condition: Waivable to 65% with $10M-$15M escrow for renegotiation costs. If <65%, evaluate whether critical systems vendors (SIS, LMS, ERP) consented—transaction may be infeasible if core systems must be replaced.

4. **Confirm no ground lease restrictions on core campus** (Month 2) → Blocking issue—transaction terminates if ground lease discovered requiring $20M-$100M acquisition or campus relocation. Alternative: Renegotiate purchase price reducing by ground lease acquisition cost + $50M risk premium for execution complexity.

5. **File Title IV E-App with DOE** (Month 12-14, after HLC approval) → Cannot file until HLC approval obtained (HLC approval letter required attachment). Target: Provisional certification granted within 90 days (Month 15). Heightened cash monitoring (Level 1 or 2) is acceptable. Not acceptable: Application rejection or indefinite deferral (eliminates federal aid eligibility).

6. **Notify ABA of change of control** (Month 14-16, after HLC approval) → ABA will not act until HLC approval confirmed. Target: No adverse action or preliminary approval subject to monitoring. Accept: Probationary accreditation if correctable within 2 years. Not acceptable: Denial (eliminates $27.5M law school revenue and creates precedent concern for other programmatic accreditors).

7. **Settle Dr. Chen EEOC charge** (before closing) → Target: $150K-$400K settlement at Q1 2026 EEOC mediation. If settlement not achieved, require $1M-$2M seller escrow for 3 years covering litigation defense and potential adverse judgment. Chen charge creates template for additional employment discrimination claims; early settlement prevents copycat claims.

8. **Implement enhanced Title IX compliance program** (Month 12-18) → Budget $515K-$785K Year 1 implementation: dedicated Title IX Coordinator ($120K-$150K), 2-3 investigators ($180K-$270K), hearing panel training ($75K-$125K), climate survey ($50K-$75K), policy overhaul ($60K-$90K), case management system ($30K-$75K). Ongoing annual cost: $385K-$545K. Required to avoid OCR enforcement action and demonstrate compliance to HLC during site visit.

9. **Establish independent law school governance board** (Month 12-14, before ABA notification) → Must be operational with first board meeting completed before ABA change of control notification filed. Board composition and reserved matters authority documented in law school operating agreement (executed at closing). Budget: $500K annually (board compensation, meeting expenses, administrative support).

10. **Execute definitive purchase agreement with comprehensive escrows** (Month 14-18) → Three-tier escrow structure totaling $100M-$175M: (i) $50M-$75M regulatory approval escrow (released upon HLC final approval + Title IV provisional certification + 18-month composite score ≥1.5); (ii) $25M-$50M operational escrow (released upon vendor consent achievement + insurance renewal + EEOC settlement); (iii) $25M-$50M successor liability tail escrow (released after 36-month statute of limitations). Escrow structure aligns seller incentives with transaction success.

11. **Obtain 6-year tail insurance coverage** (closing condition) → Seller-funded premium: $500K-$700K. Coverage: D&O, EPL, professional liability. Reporting period: 6 years post-closing (covers 2-year statute of limitations + 3-year discovery rule extensions + 1-year claims processing). Critical: Verify coverage not barred by sexual misconduct exclusions (obtain carrier written confirmation that *Doe v. MU* procedural claims are covered even if underlying allegations involve sexual assault).

12. **Transfer $468M to Foundation before for-profit conversion** (simultaneous with closing) → Tax-free transfer while both entities tax-exempt. Transfer occurs: (a) MU board approves transfer as final nonprofit act; (b) $468M wired from MU to Foundation; (c) immediately thereafter, AEH acquires MU and conversion to for-profit effective; (d) Foundation confirmed as successor trustee for 200+ donor-restricted endowments. Timing is critical—transfer after for-profit conversion triggers $103.6M capital gains tax.

---

## VIII. DECISION REQUIRED

**DECISION REQUIRED:** Authorize management to proceed with transaction structuring and regulatory approval processes, subject to Board re-approval at Months 6, 12, and 18 based on risk miligation progress and approval probability updates.

**Options:**

**Option A: PROCEED UNCONDITIONALLY at $780M purchase price with standard transaction structure**

- **Description:** Execute LOI at $780M headline price with institutional-level debt ($500M-$585M at MU), direct transfer of endowment to for-profit entity, standard governance with AEH board control, no mandatory HLC approval closing condition.
- **Consequence:** Transaction has 10-15% success probability. Probability-weighted loss of $150M-$200M ($780M investment × 25-30% total loss probability in severe downside). Institutional debt creates composite score decline to 0.8-1.4 requiring $18.2M-$45.5M LOC and generating negative cash flow. Direct endowment transfer violates charitable trust doctrine (80-90% Indiana AG denial probability) and triggers $103.6M capital gains tax. HLC approval probability 25-35% without governance protections.
- **Recommendation Status:** NOT RECOMMENDED—unacceptable risk/return profile.

**Option B: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS at $680M-$730M purchase price implementing three mandatory structures**

- **Description:** Execute LOI at $680M-$730M (13-7% discount from $780M) requiring: (1) holdco debt structure (all debt at AEH parent, MU debt-free subsidiary); (2) bifurcated endowment foundation ($468M to Foundation, $182M retained); (3) governance protections (majority independent board, faculty governance, mission commitments); (4) HLC approval as non-waivable closing condition; (5) $100M-$175M escrow (three-tier, released over 18-36 months); (6) 75% vendor consent threshold (waivable to 65% with price adjustment).
- **Consequence:** Transaction has 30-38% success probability (3x improvement from Option A). Probability-weighted expected return: $50M-$80M positive NPV (12.8% IRR in base case, 60% probability). Holdco structure preserves MU composite score 1.8-2.2 (financially responsible, no LOC). Foundation structure avoids $103.6M tax, satisfies charitable trust doctrine (60-75% AG approval), provides $23.4M annual grants supporting 90/10 compliance. Governance protections increase HLC approval to 75-80%. Downside protection: If HLC denies (15-20% probability), transaction terminates without closing; sunk costs limited to $5M-$10M.
- **Recommendation Status:** **RECOMMENDED**—balanced risk/return with structural protections addressing identified cascades.

**Option C: STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVE—Asset purchase of select programs only**

- **Description:** Instead of acquiring entire university, purchase only high-performing programs: Business (AACSB), Engineering (ABET), Nursing (CCNE), Pharmacy (ACPE). Exclude law school (ABA risk), athletics (NCAA/MVC complexity), liberal arts (low margins), medical research (NIH restrictions). Purchase price: $350M-$450M (45-58% of original). Transfer only students, faculty, and IP related to acquired programs. Remaining MU programs sold to nonprofit regional university system or wound down.
- **Consequence:** Eliminates highest-risk elements (law school 30-40% denial probability, athletics $7M-$12M annual losses, research $10M-$20M non-transferable grants) while retaining profitable professional programs generating 60% of margin. Reduces HLC approval complexity (program acquisition vs. institutional conversion). Purchase price $330M below full acquisition, reducing debt requirement to $250M-$300M (achievable with institutional-level debt while maintaining composite score >1.5). Success probability: 60-70% (higher than Option B due to reduced complexity).
- **Recommendation Status:** ALTERNATIVE if Option B governance/regulatory conditions prove unachievable during due diligence. Requires separate LOI and valuation; cannot be fallback position late in process.

**BOARD RECOMMENDATION: Option B—PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS.** This structure balances opportunity for acceptable returns (12.8% IRR in base case) with structural protections preventing catastrophic loss scenarios. Three mandatory transaction structures (holdco debt, bifurcated foundation, governance protections) directly address the three identified cascade sequences (HLC denial → institutional collapse; tax burden → 90/10 failure; endowment liquidation → tax/litigation). Recommend Board authorize management to: (1) execute LOI at $680M-$730M purchase price conditioned on three mandatory structures; (2) incur $3M-$5M Phase 1 costs (title search, HLC consultation, foundation formation, actuarial diligence); (3) return to Board at Month 6 with HLC preliminary feedback and recommendation whether to proceed to formal application or terminate transaction.

---

## IX. CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

**This analysis assumes:**

1. **MU's current financial performance is sustainable:** Pro forma assumes $680M revenue and $45M EBITDA continue post-acquisition. If pre-closing enrollment declines >10% or regulatory changes (new Title IV rules, state authorization issues) reduce revenue, all financial projections require revision.

2. **No material undisclosed liabilities exist:** Analysis assumes due diligence confirms no undisclosed: (a) defined benefit pension obligations ($50M-$150M exposure if exists); (b) environmental liabilities beyond standard Phase I/II; (c) litigation beyond disclosed *Doe v. MU* and Chen EEOC charge; (d) regulatory investigations (OCR, state AG, DOE audits).

3. **Regulatory landscape remains stable:** Analysis assumes no material changes to: (a) Title IV regulations (90/10 Rule, composite score methodology, recertification standards); (b) HLC accreditation criteria; (c) federal/state tax rates; (d) Indiana charitable trust doctrine. Regulatory changes during 18-24 month closing period could materially alter risk profile.

4. **For-profit higher education sector remains viable:** Analysis assumes continued private equity investment in higher education sector with exit multiples of 8-12x EBITDA. Sector disruption (regulatory crackdown on for-profit education, public perception shift, competition from online education) could eliminate exit liquidity.

5. **AEH has capacity to fund debt shortfall:** Holdco debt structure assumes AEH can service $23M-$35M annual debt shortfall (MU provides $11.8M dividend vs. $35M interest expense) from other portfolio companies or equity contributions. If MU is AEH's only or dominant investment, holdco structure may not be viable.

6. **HLC informal consultation confirms feasibility:** Recommendation to proceed assumes HLC staff provides preliminary feedback during pre-application consultation indicating transaction structure is approvable with governance protections. If HLC signals denial regardless of structure, transaction should be terminated during Phase 1 (Months 1-3) before incurring $5M-$10M formal application costs.

**This analysis could not verify:**

1. **Actual defined benefit pension status:** Analysis identifies $50M-$150M potential exposure if unfunded DB pension exists (50% probability estimate) but cannot confirm without actuarial due diligence. Immediate priority.

2. **Ground lease status for core campus:** Analysis identifies $20M-$100M potential exposure if religious institution holds ground lease with for-profit education prohibition (5% probability estimate) but cannot confirm without comprehensive title search. Blocking issue—must be confirmed within Month 2.

3. **Vendor consent rates:** Analysis assumes 75% vendor consent achievable but actual consent rate cannot be known until outreach conducted (Months 3-6). If early outreach to top 10 vendors shows <60% consent rate, transaction may not be viable.

4. **Donor litigation appetite:** Analysis estimates 70-85% donor litigation probability if $468M transferred directly to for-profit entity, but actual donor reaction depends on individual donor circumstances, gift instrument language, and donor relationships. Foundation structure reduces probability to 5-10% but cannot eliminate entirely.

5. **IRS private benefit determination for Foundation:** Analysis assumes Foundation's $23.4M annual grants to for-profit MU satisfy IRC § 501(c)(3) operational test (15-20% IRS challenge probability estimate) but IRS private benefit doctrine is fact-specific and unpredictable. Foundation should seek private letter ruling from IRS confirming grant program satisfies tax-exempt purpose (cost: $50K-$100K, timeline: 12-18 months).

**If [specific assumption] proves incorrect:**

- **If MU operates undisclosed $100M+ unfunded DB pension:** Require $50M-$100M seller escrow covering shortfall OR reduce purchase price by $100M reflecting this liability. Pension obligation is non-waivable fixed cost that cannot be mitigated through operational improvements.

- **If ground lease discovered prohibiting for-profit education:** Transaction must be restructured as: (a) acquire fee simple interest from religious institution lessor for $20M-$100M (negotiate as component of total consideration); OR (b) terminate transaction exercising walk-away right (sunk costs: $2M-$5M Phase 1 expenses).

- **If HLC pre-application consultation indicates >50% denial probability:** Terminate transaction during Phase 1 (Month 1-3) before incurring $5M-$10M application costs. HLC denial is transaction-fatal; proceeding with formal application when informal consultation signals denial wastes resources.

- **If vendor consent rate achieves only 50-60%:** Transaction remains viable but requires: (a) $15M-$25M budget increase for renegotiation premiums and consent payments; (b) 12-18 month extended timeline for vendor replacements; (c) $10M-$15M purchase price reduction compensating for increased integration costs. Below 50% consent rate, transaction should be terminated (operational disruption risk too high).

- **If Indiana AG denies bifurcated foundation structure:** Three options: (1) restructure as 100% endowment transfer to Foundation (MU receives $0, relies entirely on operating cash flow—economically marginal); (2) litigate AG denial (2-3 year timeline, $5M-$15M legal costs, 20-30% success probability—not recommended); (3) terminate transaction (bifurcated foundation is foundational to tax structure and charitable trust compliance—transaction not viable without it).

## X. APPENDICES

### A. Glossary of Key Terms

**90/10 Rule**: Federal regulation (34 C.F.R. § 600.5(d)) requiring for-profit institutions to derive at least 10% of revenue from non-Title IV sources. Two consecutive years exceeding 90% federal revenue triggers permanent Title IV ineligibility.

**Composite Score**: DOE financial responsibility metric (34 C.F.R. § 668.171-174) calculated from three ratios (primary reserve, equity, net income). Score ≥1.5 = financially responsible; 1.0-1.4 = zone status requiring LOC; <1.0 = not financially responsible requiring 25% LOC.

**Cy Pres Doctrine**: Equitable legal doctrine (Ind. Code § 30-4-3-27) allowing courts to modify charitable trust terms when original purposes become impossible or impracticable, directing funds to purposes "as near as possible" to donor intent.

**HLC**: Higher Learning Commission, regional accrediting agency recognized by U.S. Department of Education for 19-state North Central region. HLC accreditation is mandatory prerequisite for Title IV eligibility.

**Holdco Debt Structure**: Transaction structure placing acquisition debt at parent holding company level (American Education Holdings) rather than operating company level (Midwest University), preserving subsidiary's debt-free balance sheet and composite score.

**IRC § 4940**: Internal Revenue Code provision imposing 1.39% excise tax on private foundation net investment income. Dramatically lower than 21% corporate income tax rate applicable to for-profit entities.

**IRC § 4942**: Internal Revenue Code provision requiring private foundations to distribute at least 5% of asset fair market value annually for qualifying charitable purposes. Failure triggers 30% excise tax on undistributed amount.

**Title IV**: Higher Education Act provisions (20 U.S.C. § 1070 et seq.) authorizing federal student financial aid programs (Pell Grants, Direct Loans, FSEOG, Federal Work-Study). MU receives $182M annually in Title IV aid supporting 85% of students.
