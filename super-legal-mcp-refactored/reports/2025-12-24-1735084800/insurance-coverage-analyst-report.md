## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

**Insurance Coverage Status**: Project Athena's three pending claims (**$780K-$3.05M total exposure**) are generally covered under Midwest University's existing insurance programs (D&O, EPL, CGL), subject to **$400K-$450K combined retentions/deductibles**. However, **two critical coverage gaps** require immediate investigation: (1) potential **sexual misconduct exclusion** in the D&O policy that could eliminate all coverage for the $500K-$2M Title IX litigation, and (2) unconfirmed existence of **EPL coverage** for the $200K-$800K EEOC discrimination charge. Without six-year tail coverage (**estimated cost: $500K-$700K**), the buyer will bear uninsured exposure for future claims arising from pre-closing conduct.

**Best Case Scenario** (All coverage applies): **Total buyer exposure: $900K-$1.15M**
- Title IX (Doe v. MU): $250K (D&O SIR)
- EEOC (Chen): $50K-$100K (EPL retention)
- Slip/Fall (Rodriguez): $100K (CGL deductible)
- Tail coverage: $500K-$700K (seller pays, negotiated in purchase agreement)

**Worst Case Scenario** (Sexual misconduct exclusion applies, no EPL policy): **Total buyer exposure: $800K-$3.05M**
- Title IX: $500K-$2M (fully uninsured)
- EEOC: $200K-$800K (if no EPL, covered under D&O but SIR already exhausted)
- Slip/Fall: $100K (CGL deductible)

**Critical Urgent Actions** (Within 48 Hours):
1. **Obtain and review D&O policy** for sexual misconduct exclusion
2. **Confirm EPL policy existence** (standalone or D&O endorsement)
3. **Verify policy renewal dates** for prior knowledge exclusion analysis
4. **Confirm timely notice** to all carriers for pending claims

**Deal Impact**: If sexual misconduct exclusion discovered, negotiate **$1M-$2M purchase price reduction**. Make **six-year tail coverage a condition to closing** (seller pays $500K-$700K). Budget **$900K-$1.15M claims reserves** (best case) to **$800K-$3.05M** (worst case).

### B. Transaction Context and Insurance Programs

Project Athena involves the **$780 million acquisition** of Midwest University, a private liberal arts institution in Indiana. The transaction includes assumption of all liabilities, including three pending claims with material exposure. The university maintains the following insurance programs:

**Directors and Officers (D&O) Liability Insurance**:
- Coverage Limit: **$10 million** per claim / $10 million aggregate
- Self-Insured Retention (SIR): **$250,000** per claim
- Policy Type: Claims-made and reported
- Insured Persons: Board of Trustees (35 members), President, Provost, CFO, General Counsel, Title IX Coordinator, deans, faculty/staff (in insured capacity)

**Employment Practices Liability (EPL) Insurance** [EXISTENCE UNCONFIRMED]:
- Structure: Standalone policy OR D&O endorsement (requires verification)
- Typical Retention: $50,000-$100,000 per claim
- Coverage: Employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination, tenure denial

**Commercial General Liability (CGL) Insurance**:
- Deductible: **$100,000**
- Policy Type: Occurrence-based
- Coverage: Bodily injury, property damage, premises liability

The **critical distinction** between these policies: D&O and EPL are **claims-made** (coverage triggered when claim filed during policy period), while CGL is **occurrence-based** (coverage triggered when incident occurs). This distinction is essential for tail coverage analysis in the M&A context.

### C. Pending Claims Analysis

#### 1. Title IX Litigation: Doe v. Midwest University ($500K-$2M Exposure)

**Background**: Former student John Doe was expelled in December 2023 following a Title IX investigation into sexual misconduct allegations. Doe filed a federal lawsuit in March 2024 (U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana) alleging due process violations (14th Amendment), breach of contract (student handbook), and negligent investigation. Doe claims the university's hearing panel was biased, excluded exculpatory evidence, and denied him meaningful cross-examination rights. The case is in discovery, with depositions scheduled for early 2025.

**D&O Insurance Coverage Analysis**:

**Duty to Defend: COVERED ✓**

Under Indiana law, the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify—insurers must defend when any allegation potentially falls within coverage, even if ultimate indemnity is doubtful. The complaint alleges wrongful acts by insured persons (Title IX Coordinator Dr. Rebecca Martinez, three-member hearing panel, investigators) acting in their administrative capacity. Student discipline claims are expressly covered under Educators Legal Liability (ELL) policies as administrative decisions, distinct from academic judgments. Defense costs alone may exceed the $250K SIR ($280K-$560K projected).

**Duty to Indemnify: LIKELY COVERED**, subject to exclusions

The complaint alleges **negligence, bias, and procedural errors**—not intentional fraud. Intentional acts exclusions require deliberate wrongdoing, which is not alleged. However, **two critical coverage issues** require immediate policy review:

**CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Sexual Misconduct Exclusion**

Following high-profile Title IX abuse cases (Michigan State/Nassar, USC/Tyndall), insurers increasingly add sexual misconduct exclusions to education policies. These exclusions typically bar coverage for "sexual misconduct of any person and related allegations." In a landmark Seventh Circuit case, an insurer successfully argued that a Title IX procedural claim was excluded because it was "related to" sexual misconduct, even though the university was being sued for its investigation process, not for committing misconduct.

**If Midwest University's D&O policy contains this exclusion**: All coverage for the Doe litigation may be barred—**$500K-$2M uninsured exposure**. This is the single greatest coverage risk in the transaction.

**Urgent Action**: Obtain D&O policy immediately and search for sexual misconduct exclusion language. If present, options include: (1) negotiate $1M-$2M purchase price reduction, (2) establish self-insured reserve, (3) attempt to negotiate carveout for procedural claims, or (4) obtain parametric insurance for Title IX exposure.

**CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Prior Knowledge Exclusion**

If the D&O policy renewed between Doe's expulsion (December 2023) and the lawsuit filing (March 2024), the insurer may invoke the prior knowledge exclusion. The university knew Doe disputed the findings and complained of procedural unfairness—a reasonable administrator could have foreseen litigation. If the exclusion applies, coverage would fall to the **prior policy year** (assuming wrongful acts occurred during that period).

**University Exposure**:
- Best case: **$250,000** (SIR only; insurer pays all excess defense costs and indemnity)
- Likely case: **$250,000-$500,000** (SIR plus partial settlement contribution)
- Worst case: **$500,000-$2,000,000** (sexual misconduct exclusion; fully uninsured)

**Settlement Recommendation**: Assess settlement at **$250K-$400K** (within or near SIR) to avoid trial risk, excess defense costs, and potential large judgment. Early settlement eliminates the sexual misconduct exclusion risk.

#### 2. EEOC Discrimination Charge: Dr. Susan Chen ($200K-$800K Exposure)

**Background**: Dr. Susan Chen (Asian female, Associate Professor, Chemistry) was denied tenure in May 2024 after completing the standard six-year probationary period. Chen alleges race discrimination, sex discrimination, and retaliation under Title VII, claiming that similarly qualified white male faculty were granted tenure with comparable or weaker records. Chen filed an internal grievance (June 2024), which was denied (July 2024), then filed an EEOC charge (August 2024). The EEOC is currently investigating; the university's position statement is due January 2025.

**EPL Insurance Coverage Analysis**:

**Coverage: COVERED ✓** (assuming EPL policy exists)

Employment Practices Liability (EPL) insurance **expressly covers tenure denial claims**. Industry policy forms specifically list "denial of tenure" as a covered employment practice, along with discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and wrongful termination. EPL policies trigger coverage when an EEOC charge is filed—not just when litigation commences—meaning Chen's August 2024 EEOC charge activated coverage.

**Key Distinction: Tenure Decisions Are Employment Practices, Not Professional Services**

D&O policies often contain professional services exclusions that could arguably apply to academic judgments. However, courts and insurers distinguish between:
- **Professional services** = Rendering educational/academic services to students (teaching, research)
- **Employment practices** = Personnel decisions affecting employment status (hiring, promotion, tenure, termination)

Tenure decisions are fundamentally **employment decisions** about continued employment, even though they involve peer review of academic work. EPL policies recognize this by specifically listing tenure denials as covered practices. Federal courts have held that "practices common to most businesses requiring no specialized knowledge are not professional services"—tenure decisions fall into this category.

**CRITICAL ISSUE: EPL Policy Existence Unconfirmed**

Transaction documents reference D&O insurance but do not explicitly confirm EPL coverage. EPL may exist as: (1) standalone policy, or (2) endorsement to D&O policy. If **no EPL policy exists**:
- Chen's claim may be covered under D&O (if D&O includes employment practices)
- **BUT**: D&O has $250K retention vs. typical $50K-$100K EPL retention
- University exposure increases by **$150K-$200K** (retention differential)
- If Title IX claim exhausts D&O SIR, Chen claim defense costs exceed retention immediately

**Urgent Action**: Confirm EPL policy existence within 48 hours. If no EPL policy, confirm D&O covers employment practices. Budget accordingly.

**Coverage Trigger at EEOC Stage**:

EPL policies provide coverage at the **EEOC administrative stage**, not just federal court litigation. Defense costs for EEOC response, position statement, document production, and mediation (**$20K-$50K**) are covered subject to retention. If the EEOC finds reasonable cause and issues a "right to sue" letter, Chen can file federal litigation—this would be a **continuation of the same claim** under the same policy.

**If Litigation Ensues**:

Title VII damages include: back pay (salary from tenure denial forward), front pay (future lost earnings), emotional distress, punitive damages (if willful discrimination proven), and attorneys' fees. Exposure range: **$200K-$800K**. EPL policies cover these damages subject to retention and policy limits.

**University Exposure**:
- EEOC stage: **$20K-$50K** (within retention)
- If litigation: **$50K-$100K retention** + potential excess if judgment exceeds retention
- Worst case (no EPL policy): **$200K-$800K** (covered under D&O but higher retention)

**Settlement Recommendation**: Assess EEOC mediation settlement at **$100K-$200K** to avoid federal litigation, discovery costs, and risk of large judgment with attorneys' fees. EEOC settlement preserves university's reputation and avoids protracted Title VII discovery.

#### 3. Slip and Fall: Emily Rodriguez ($80K-$250K Exposure)

**Background**: Undergraduate student Emily Rodriguez slipped on ice outside a residence hall in January 2024, fracturing her ankle and requiring surgery. Rodriguez filed a premises liability lawsuit in June 2024 (Marion County Superior Court, Indiana) alleging the university failed to salt/sand walkways after a winter storm and maintained inadequate winter maintenance protocols. Medical expenses total $40K-$80K; pain and suffering damages estimated at $40K-$170K.

**CGL Insurance Coverage Analysis**:

**Coverage: COVERED ✓**

Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance covers bodily injury caused by an occurrence on insured premises. Rodriguez's fractured ankle constitutes bodily injury, and the slip on ice constitutes an occurrence (accident) on university property. CGL policies expressly cover premises liability—slip and fall claims are among the most common CGL claims.

**Occurrence-Based Coverage—No Tail Coverage Needed**:

Unlike D&O and EPL (claims-made), CGL is **occurrence-based**, meaning coverage is triggered by when the injury occurred (January 2024), not when the claim was filed (June 2024). This critical distinction means:
- Rodriguez's claim is covered under the CGL policy in effect in January 2024
- **No reporting deadline** or tail coverage needed for CGL
- M&A transaction closing does not affect CGL coverage for January 2024 incident

**Deductible Structure ($100,000)**:

Unlike the D&O **self-insured retention** (where university pays all costs until SIR exhausted), the CGL policy likely has a **deductible**, meaning:
- CGL carrier pays defense costs and settlement/judgment from first dollar
- University reimburses carrier up to $100,000
- Carrier manages defense, appoints counsel

**Liability Defenses** (Not Coverage Issues):

Indiana follows modified comparative fault (plaintiff can recover if less than 51% at fault, recovery reduced by fault percentage). The university has potential defenses:
- **Notice**: Did university have reasonable time to salt/sand after storm?
- **Comparative fault**: Was Rodriguez texting, wearing inappropriate footwear, or knowingly walking on obviously icy surface?
- **Assumption of risk**: Indiana winter conditions

These are **merits defenses**, not coverage defenses—the CGL carrier must defend regardless of defense strength.

**Medical Payments Coverage ($5K-$10K)**:

CGL policies include no-fault medical payments coverage ($5,000-$10,000 typical) for injuries on insured premises. The university can offer this immediately as goodwill, potentially facilitating early settlement.

**University Exposure**: **$100,000** (deductible)

Likely settlement range: **$100K-$150K** considering comparative fault and notice defenses. Settlement at or below $100K results in zero net carrier payment (university pays full deductible). Settlement above $100K triggers carrier obligation for excess.

**Settlement Recommendation**: Pursue early settlement at **$80K-$120K** (within/near deductible). Offer medical payments coverage ($5K-$10K) immediately. Document snow removal protocols and timeline to support notice defense if settlement fails.

### D. Tail Coverage: Essential for M&A Transaction

**The Coverage Gap Without Tail Coverage**:

D&O and EPL policies are **claims-made and reported**, meaning:
1. The wrongful act must occur during the policy period
2. The claim must be **made** (filed) during the policy period
3. The claim must be **reported** to the insurer during the policy period

When an M&A transaction closes, D&O and EPL policies contain **"change in control" provisions** that terminate coverage for post-closing conduct. Standard policies provide **"runoff" coverage**—claims arising from pre-closing conduct can be reported through the end of the current policy period (typically 6-12 months post-closing).

**The Problem**: Runoff provides only months of post-closing reporting time, but **statutes of limitations are years**:
- Indiana contract claims: **6 years**
- Indiana tort claims: **2 years**
- Title VII employment claims: **2-3 years**
- Section 1983 civil rights claims: **2 years**

**Without tail coverage**: Claims arising from pre-closing conduct filed more than 6-12 months post-closing would have **no insurance coverage**—the buyer bears full uninsured exposure.

**Why Tail Coverage Is Critical for Project Athena**:

1. **Three pending claims involve pre-closing conduct** (Title IX October-December 2023; EEOC May 2024; slip/fall January 2024)
2. **Additional Title IX claims may arise** years post-closing (statute of limitations permits claims for conduct occurring up to 6 years before filing)
3. **Additional faculty discrimination claims** may arise (tenure decisions within past 6 years)
4. **Higher education litigation environment**: Title IX claims surged post-2018; sexual misconduct settlements reached $121.5M, $52M, $50M in recent years

**Six-Year Tail Recommendation**:

**Duration**: **6 years** (not 3 years)
- Aligns with Indiana's 6-year statute of limitations for contract claims (Ind. Code § 34-11-2-7)
- Covers discovery rule extensions (statutes don't begin running until claim discovered)
- Industry standard for education M&A transactions

**Cost**: **$500,000-$700,000** (combined D&O + EPL tail)
- D&O tail: $375K-$450K (250%-300% of estimated $150K annual premium)
- EPL tail: $125K-$250K (100%-250% of estimated premium)

**Who Pays**: **Seller** (standard M&A practice)
- Rationale: Pre-closing conduct is seller's liability; tail protects seller from post-closing claims
- Included as **condition to closing** in purchase agreement
- Alternative: Purchase price reduction equal to tail coverage cost

**Policy Limits**: Require **full current policy limits** (not reduced aggregates)
- Current D&O: $10M per claim / $10M aggregate **per year**
- Avoid: $10M aggregate **for entire 6-year tail period**
- Risk: Multiple claims ($2M Title IX + $800K Chen + additional claims) could exhaust single aggregate

**Straddle Claims Provision**:

Include purchase agreement language: "Tail policy covers any claim if any alleged wrongful act occurred pre-closing, even if claim also alleges post-closing conduct." This avoids allocation disputes between seller's tail policy and buyer's new policy.

**CGL Tail Not Needed**: CGL is occurrence-based (coverage triggered by incident date), so no tail coverage required. Rodriguez's January 2024 slip triggers January 2024 CGL policy regardless of when claim filed.

### E. Representations and Warranties Insurance (RWI): Optional

**Structure for Project Athena**:
- Policy Limit: **$78 million** (10% of $780M purchase price)
- Retention: **$7.8 million** (1% of purchase price)
- Premium: **$2.73 million** (3.5% of limit)

**What RWI Covers**: Buyer recovers from insurer (not seller) for losses from breaches of seller's reps/warranties—undisclosed liabilities, financial statement inaccuracies, title defects, tax issues, undisclosed litigation.

**What RWI Does NOT Cover**: The three **disclosed** pending claims (Title IX, EEOC, slip/fall) would be specifically excluded from RWI coverage because they're disclosed in the purchase agreement schedules.

**Value Proposition**:
- **Seller benefit**: Receives full purchase price at closing (no escrow/holdback); exits cleanly with no post-closing indemnification exposure
- **Buyer benefit**: Insurance for **unknown** liabilities; no need to chase seller for indemnification

**Cost-Benefit for Project Athena**:

**Pros**:
- $78M coverage for undisclosed liabilities (significant protection)
- Enhances buyer's offer in competitive acquisition (seller exits cleanly)
- Standard for 20-25% of U.S. private M&A deals

**Cons**:
- **$2.73M premium** (material cost)
- **$7.8M retention** (buyer self-insures first $7.8M)
- Three known claims not covered (already disclosed)

**Recommendation**: **Consider if acquisition is competitive** (multiple bidders competing; RWI as differentiator). **May not be cost-effective** if three pending claims represent most material exposure—$2.73M premium for protection beyond $3.05M known exposure requires strong due diligence concerns about unknown liabilities. **Alternative**: Traditional seller indemnification with escrow ($78M-$117M held for 18-24 months).

### F. Summary of Coverage Conclusions and Buyer Exposure

#### Best Case Scenario (All Coverage Applies)

**Assumptions**:
- No sexual misconduct exclusion in D&O policy (or procedural claims carved out)
- EPL policy exists with $50K-$100K retention
- All claims settle within or near retentions
- Six-year tail coverage purchased (seller pays $500K-$700K)

**Buyer Exposure**:
- Title IX (Doe): **$250,000** (D&O SIR; insurer pays all excess)
- EEOC (Chen): **$50,000-$100,000** (EPL retention; insurer pays all excess)
- Slip/Fall (Rodriguez): **$100,000** (CGL deductible)
- **Subtotal Claims**: **$400,000-$450,000**
- Tail coverage: **$500,000-$700,000** (allocated to seller in purchase agreement)
- **Total Buyer Exposure**: **$900,000-$1,150,000**

This exposure level is **manageable and insurable** for a $780M acquisition representing **0.12%-0.15% of purchase price**.

#### Worst Case Scenario (Coverage Gaps)

**Assumptions**:
- Sexual misconduct exclusion bars all Title IX coverage
- No standalone EPL policy (Chen claim under D&O with $250K retention, but SIR already exhausted by Title IX)
- Prior knowledge exclusions apply (claims covered under prior policy years with potential aggregate limit issues)

**Buyer Exposure**:
- Title IX (Doe): **$500,000-$2,000,000** (fully uninsured; no D&O coverage)
- EEOC (Chen): **$200,000-$800,000** (D&O SIR already exhausted; litigation costs uninsured)
- Slip/Fall (Rodriguez): **$100,000** (CGL deductible—no change)
- **Total Buyer Exposure**: **$800,000-$2,900,000**

This exposure level is **material** for the transaction, representing **0.10%-0.37% of purchase price**, and should trigger **purchase price renegotiation** ($1M-$2M reduction) if sexual misconduct exclusion discovered.

### G. Critical Action Items (Immediate)

**WITHIN 48 HOURS** (Deal-Breaker Issues):

1. **Obtain Current D&O Policy**
   - Request from Midwest University immediately
   - Search for: Sexual misconduct exclusion, prior knowledge exclusion, professional services exclusion, employment practices coverage
   - If sexual misconduct exclusion present: **Negotiate $1M-$2M purchase price reduction OR establish $2M self-insured reserve**

2. **Confirm EPL Coverage**
   - Determine: Standalone policy OR D&O endorsement OR no coverage
   - If no EPL: **Confirm D&O covers employment practices; negotiate $100K-$200K purchase price reduction for retention differential**

3. **Verify Policy Renewal Dates**
   - Obtain D&O and EPL renewal dates for prior knowledge exclusion analysis
   - Compare to claim timelines (expulsion December 2023; lawsuit March 2024; tenure denial May 2024; EEOC charge August 2024)
   - Provide notice to all potentially applicable policy years

4. **Confirm Notice to Carriers**
   - Verify Midwest University provided timely notice of all three pending claims
   - If not: **Provide notice immediately** (failure to provide timely notice can void coverage)

**WITHIN 2 WEEKS** (Deal Structure):

5. **Negotiate Tail Coverage Terms in Purchase Agreement**
   - Include as **condition to closing**: Seller purchases 6-year D&O and EPL tail coverage
   - Specify: Full policy limits (no reduced aggregates), straddle claims provision, A.M. Best A- or better carriers
   - Allocate cost: **Seller pays** (standard practice)

6. **Establish Claims Reserves**
   - Best case: $900K-$1.15M
   - Worst case: $800K-$2.9M
   - Incorporate into transaction financial model and purchase price analysis

**PRE-CLOSING** (Risk Mitigation):

7. **Settlement Negotiations**
   - Title IX: Assess $250K-$400K settlement (within/near SIR; eliminates sexual misconduct exclusion risk)
   - EEOC: Assess $100K-$200K EEOC mediation settlement (avoids litigation)
   - Slip/fall: Assess $80K-$120K settlement (within/near deductible)

8. **Due Diligence on Additional Claims**
   - Review Title IX office records (past 6 years) for additional potential complainants
   - Review faculty grievances and EEOC charges (past 6 years)
   - Assess reserve adequacy for unknown claims

### H. Deal Impact and Recommendation

**Purchase Price Impact**:
- If sexual misconduct exclusion eliminates Title IX coverage: **Negotiate $1M-$2M reduction**
- If no EPL policy exists: **Negotiate $100K-$200K reduction**
- Tail coverage: **$500K-$700K** (seller's cost; include as condition to closing)

**Transaction Timeline**: No expected delay if policies obtained/reviewed within 48 hours and no material coverage gaps. Potential 2-4 week delay if sexual misconduct exclusion discovered and purchase price renegotiation required.

**Final Recommendation**:
1. **IMMEDIATE POLICY REVIEW** (sexual misconduct exclusion is deal-critical issue)
2. **SIX-YEAR TAIL COVERAGE MANDATORY** (condition to closing; seller pays)
3. **SETTLE CLAIMS EARLY** (within retentions) to eliminate trial risk and coverage uncertainty
4. **RESERVE $900K-$1.15M** (best case) to **$800K-$2.9M** (worst case) for claims exposure
5. **RWI OPTIONAL** (cost-benefit analysis required; consider if competitive acquisition)

Project Athena's insurance coverage is **generally adequate** for the pending claims, but **two critical unknowns** (sexual misconduct exclusion, EPL policy existence) require immediate investigation before closing. With proper tail coverage and early claims settlement, buyer exposure is **manageable at $900K-$1.15M** (0.12%-0.15% of purchase price). Without tail coverage or if sexual misconduct exclusion applies, exposure increases to **$800K-$2.9M** (up to 0.37% of purchase price), requiring purchase price adjustment.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. D&O Insurance Coverage for Title IX Litigation (Doe v. Midwest University)

#### 1. Coverage Framework and Policy Structure

Directors and Officers (D&O) liability insurance provides coverage for wrongful acts committed by directors, officers, and employees while acting in their insured capacity. For educational institutions, D&O coverage is often structured as Educators Legal Liability (ELL) insurance, which combines traditional D&O and errors and omissions (E&O) coverages.¹

**Policy Terms** (As Understood for Midwest University):
- **Coverage Limit**: $10 million per claim / $10 million aggregate
- **Self-Insured Retention (SIR)**: $250,000 per claim
- **Policy Type**: Claims-made and reported
- **Insured Persons**: Board of Trustees, President, senior officers, Title IX Coordinator, faculty/staff acting in insured capacity

#### 2. Doe v. Midwest University: Factual Background

**Plaintiff**: John Doe (former student, expelled December 2023)

**Underlying Allegations**:
- Due process violation (14th Amendment § 1983 claim)
- Breach of contract (student handbook procedures)
- Negligent investigation and hearing process
- Deprivation of educational opportunity

**Key Facts**:
- Female student filed sexual misconduct complaint (October 2023)
- Title IX investigation conducted by Dr. Rebecca Martinez (Title IX Coordinator)
- Three-member faculty hearing panel found Doe responsible (November 2023)
- University expelled Doe (December 2023)
- Doe alleges: investigator bias, limited cross-examination rights, exclusion of exculpatory evidence, denial of meaningful opportunity to be heard

**Exposure**: $500,000-$2,000,000 (compensatory damages, emotional distress, lost educational opportunity, attorneys' fees)

**Procedural Status**: U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, filed March 2024; discovery phase (depositions scheduled for early 2025)

#### 3. Coverage Analysis: Wrongful Acts by Insured Persons

**Wrongful Act Definition** (Typical D&O Policy Language):
"Any actual or alleged breach of duty, neglect, error, misstatement, misleading statement, omission, or act done or wrongfully attempted by an Insured Person in the discharge of their duties."²

**Insured Persons in Title IX Context**:
The following individuals are typically covered as "Insured Persons" under university D&O policies:
- Board of Trustees members (governance oversight)
- President and senior administrative officers
- **Title IX Coordinator** (Dr. Rebecca Martinez)
- **Investigators** conducting Title IX investigations
- **Hearing panel members** (faculty serving in administrative capacity)
- General Counsel and other officers

**Application to Doe Litigation**:
The complaint alleges wrongful acts by the Title IX Coordinator, investigators, and hearing panel members in conducting the investigation and disciplinary hearing. These individuals were acting in their **administrative/insured capacity**, not in their academic/teaching capacity, which brings their conduct within the scope of D&O coverage.³

Educational liability policies expressly contemplate coverage for student discipline claims. D&O insurance "reimburses the defense costs incurred by Board members, administrators, and employees in defending against claims of alleged wrongdoing—protecting their personal assets" when "a student's parents file a claim against a school, asserting their child was unfairly disciplined and charging wrongful disciplinary action."⁴

#### 4. Duty to Defend Analysis

**Applicable Legal Standard**:
Under Indiana law, **the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify**—the insurer must defend its policyholder if there is any possibility of a covered claim, even if there is evidence that it may not have to indemnify.⁵ The duty to defend is triggered when the complaint alleges facts that might fall within the coverage of the policy.⁶

This principle derives from the landmark California case *Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co.*, 65 Cal.2d 263 (1966), where the California Supreme Court held that "the obligation to defend is broader than the obligation to indemnify" and that coverage is determined by reference to "(1) the terms of the insurance policy, and (2) the language of the complaint in the action brought against the insured."⁷

**Eight Corners Rule**:
Courts apply the "eight corners" rule—comparing the four corners of the complaint to the four corners of the policy. If the claim as described within the four corners of the complaint falls reasonably within the four corners of the insurance policy, the obligation to defend arises.⁸

**Application to Doe v. Midwest University**:

The complaint alleges:
- ✓ Wrongful acts by Title IX administrators (covered persons)
- ✓ Breach of duty to provide fair hearing process
- ✓ Negligent investigation (error/omission in discharge of duties)
- ✓ Deprivation of procedural rights

These allegations **fall squarely within the D&O policy's coverage grant** for wrongful acts by insured persons. Even if the university ultimately prevails on the merits, or if some claims are ultimately determined to be excluded, the insurer owes a duty to defend because the complaint alleges facts that create a **potential for coverage**.⁹

**Conclusion on Duty to Defend**:
The D&O insurer has a **duty to defend** Midwest University and the individual insured persons (Title IX Coordinator, hearing panel members) in the Doe litigation, subject to the $250,000 self-insured retention.

#### 5. Defense Costs and Self-Insured Retention (SIR)

**SIR vs. Deductible—Critical Distinction**:

Under a **self-insured retention (SIR)**, the insured bears complete financial responsibility until satisfying the SIR limit, including **all defense expenses and indemnity costs**.¹⁰ The insured pays defense and indemnity costs associated with a claim until the SIR limit is reached, at which point the insurer's obligation begins.¹¹

In contrast, under a **deductible**, defense costs are usually covered by the insurer from the first dollar (subject to reimbursement), and the insurer manages the defense from the outset.¹²

**Application to Midwest University ($250,000 SIR)**:

The university must pay the **first $250,000** of:
- Defense costs (attorneys' fees, expert fees, discovery costs, deposition expenses, court costs)
- **PLUS** any indemnity payments (settlements or judgments)

**Defense Cost Projections for Title IX Litigation**:
- Pre-trial discovery, depositions, motions: $100,000-$200,000
- Expert witnesses (education policy, Title IX compliance): $30,000-$60,000
- Trial preparation and trial (if case proceeds): $150,000-$300,000
- **Total Potential Defense Costs**: $280,000-$560,000

**SIR Exhaustion Scenario**:
If defense costs reach $250,000 before settlement/judgment, the insurer's coverage obligation is triggered for:
- All additional defense costs above $250,000
- All indemnity payments

**If Settlement Occurs Before SIR Exhaustion**:
If the case settles for $400,000 after incurring $150,000 in defense costs:
- Total loss: $550,000
- University pays: $250,000 (SIR)
- Insurer pays: $300,000 (above SIR, up to $10M limit)

**Control of Defense**:
Because the claim is within the SIR, **Midwest University controls its own defense**, including choice of counsel, litigation strategy, and settlement decisions, until the SIR is exhausted.¹³

#### 6. Duty to Indemnify and Potential Exclusions

While the duty to defend is broad, the **duty to indemnify** depends on whether coverage exclusions bar indemnity for the ultimate judgment or settlement. Key exclusions to analyze:

##### a. Intentional Acts Exclusion

**Typical Policy Language**:
"This policy does not cover any claim arising from any deliberately fraudulent or dishonest act or omission, or any willful violation of any statute, rule or law."¹⁴

**Standard**: Most courts apply a **mixed subjective/objective test**—whether the insured subjectively intended the act AND whether a reasonable person would have expected the resulting injury.¹⁵

**Application to Title IX Hearing**:
- The complaint alleges **negligence**, **bias**, and **procedural errors**—not intentional fraud or deliberate wrongdoing
- Even if the hearing panel was biased or made errors, absent evidence they **deliberately intended** to harm Doe, the intentional acts exclusion likely does not apply
- If discovery reveals **knowing suppression of exculpatory evidence** or **deliberate bias**, the exclusion could be invoked

**Coverage Implication**: Intentional acts exclusion **unlikely to bar indemnity** unless evidence of deliberate fraud/bad faith emerges.

##### b. Employment Acts Exclusion

**Typical Policy Language**:
"This policy does not cover any claim arising from any employment-related wrongful act, including discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, or failure to promote."

**Issue**: Does student discipline constitute an "employment act"?

**Analysis**:
Student disciplinary proceedings are **not employment acts**—they involve the university's relationship with students, not employees. Courts and policies distinguish between:
- **Employment practices** (tenure denials, faculty termination, discrimination against employees) → typically excluded from D&O or covered under separate EPL policy
- **Student discipline** (expulsion, suspension, academic dismissal) → covered under D&O/ELL as administrative decisions

**Coverage Implication**: Employment acts exclusion **does not apply** to student discipline claims.

##### c. Bodily Injury Exclusion

**Typical Policy Language**:
"This policy does not cover any claim for bodily injury, mental anguish, emotional distress, or humiliation."¹⁶

**Application**:
The Doe complaint alleges **emotional distress** and **reputational harm** as damages. However, these damages arise from the **wrongful disciplinary process** (breach of contract, due process violation), not from a separate bodily injury claim.

**Coverage Implication**: Bodily injury exclusion likely **does not bar coverage** because emotional distress is incidental to the breach of contract/due process claims, not the primary basis for liability.

##### d. Sexual Misconduct Exclusion

**Emerging Issue**: Some insurers have added sexual misconduct exclusions to education policies following high-profile abuse cases. These exclusions typically bar coverage for "sexual misconduct of any person and related allegations."¹⁷

**Application**:
In a significant Seventh Circuit case, an insurer argued that a Title IX claim was excluded by a sexual misconduct exclusion. The court held that even if the underlying facts involved sexual misconduct allegations, **the Title IX procedural claim against the university** (challenging the investigation/hearing process) was excluded because it was "related to" sexual misconduct.¹⁸

**If Midwest University's Policy Contains Sexual Misconduct Exclusion**:
The exclusion could potentially bar coverage for the Doe claim, even though Doe is challenging the **process** (not alleging the university committed sexual misconduct). This is a critical policy language issue requiring **immediate review** of the actual D&O policy.

**If No Sexual Misconduct Exclusion**:
Coverage should be available for the procedural due process claims.

#### 7. Prior Knowledge Exclusion Analysis

**Typical Policy Language**:
"This policy does not cover any claim arising from any wrongful act that, prior to the inception date of this policy, any insured person knew or could have reasonably foreseen might give rise to a claim."¹⁹

**Standards for Application**:
Most courts apply a **mixed subjective/objective standard**:
1. **Subjective prong**: Did an insured person have actual knowledge of facts prior to policy inception?
2. **Objective prong**: Would a reasonable person in that position have foreseen that a claim might be made?²⁰

**Application to Doe v. Midwest University**:

**Timeline**:
- October 2023: Sexual misconduct complaint filed
- November 2023: Hearing panel finds Doe responsible
- December 2023: University expels Doe
- **March 2024**: Doe files federal lawsuit
- Policy renewal date: [To be confirmed—typically July 1 for academic institutions]

**Analysis**:
If the D&O policy renewed after the expulsion (December 2023) but before the lawsuit (March 2024):
- The university **knew** Doe had been expelled
- The university **knew** Doe disputed the findings and complained of procedural unfairness
- A reasonable university administrator **could have foreseen** that Doe might file a lawsuit

**If prior knowledge exclusion applies**: The claim may be **excluded** from the current policy and would need to be covered under the **prior policy year** (if the wrongful acts occurred during that period).

**If policy renewed before expulsion**: Prior knowledge exclusion does not apply because the university did not know of the potential claim before policy inception.

**Coverage Implication**: **Critical to confirm policy renewal date**. If the policy renewed between December 2023 (expulsion) and March 2024 (lawsuit filing), the insurer may invoke the prior knowledge exclusion, requiring coverage under the prior policy year.

#### 8. Coverage Conclusion for Title IX Litigation

| Coverage Element | Analysis | Conclusion |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| **Duty to Defend** | Complaint alleges wrongful acts by insured persons (Title IX Coordinator, hearing panel) | **COVERED** ✓ |
| **Defense Costs** | $280K-$560K projected; $250K SIR applies | University pays first $250K; insurer pays excess |
| **Duty to Indemnify** | Depends on exclusions | Likely covered absent sexual misconduct exclusion |
| **Intentional Acts Exclusion** | Complaint alleges negligence/bias, not deliberate fraud | **Does not bar coverage** ✓ |
| **Employment Acts Exclusion** | Student discipline ≠ employment act | **Does not bar coverage** ✓ |
| **Sexual Misconduct Exclusion** | **CRITICAL ISSUE**—if present, may bar all coverage | **Requires policy review** ⚠️ |
| **Prior Knowledge Exclusion** | Depends on policy renewal date relative to expulsion | **Requires confirmation** ⚠️ |
| **Net Exposure After Insurance** | $500K-$2M claim; $250K SIR; up to $10M coverage | University exposure: $250K (SIR) + any excluded amounts |

**Recommendations**:
1. **Immediately obtain and review** the current D&O policy to confirm presence/absence of sexual misconduct exclusion
2. **Confirm policy renewal date** to assess prior knowledge exclusion applicability
3. **Provide notice** to D&O carrier (if not already done) to preserve coverage rights
4. **Assess settlement value** within SIR ($250K) to avoid excess defense costs and trial risk

### B. Employment Practices Liability (EPL) Coverage for EEOC Charge (Dr. Susan Chen)

#### 1. EPL Insurance Framework

Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) helps protect businesses from employment-related claims, including wrongful termination, discrimination, and harassment.²¹ EPLI protects employers against claims made by employees alleging discrimination (based on sex, race, age or disability), harassment, wrongful termination, failure to promote, deprivation of career opportunity, and negligent evaluation.²²

**Coverage Structure**:
- **Policy Type**: Claims-made and reported
- **Typical Retention**: $50,000-$100,000 per claim (lower than D&O retention)
- **Coverage**: Defense costs and indemnity for employment-related wrongful acts
- **Covered Claims**: Discrimination, harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination, **denial of tenure**²³

**Critical Distinction**: EPL insurance may be structured as:
1. **Standalone EPL policy** (separate from D&O), OR
2. **EPL endorsement** to D&O policy

For Midwest University, the **existence and structure of EPL coverage must be confirmed**.

#### 2. Dr. Susan Chen EEOC Charge: Factual Background

**Charging Party**: Dr. Susan Chen (Asian female, Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry)

**Claims Asserted**:
- **Race discrimination** (Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.)
- **Sex discrimination** (Title VII)
- **Retaliation** (Title VII)

**Key Facts**:
- Dr. Chen completed 6-year tenure-track probationary period
- Tenure application submitted (Spring 2024)
- **Tenure denied** by departmental committee and Provost (May 2024)
- Chen alleges: Comparably qualified white male faculty granted tenure with similar or weaker records
- Chen alleges: Retaliation for prior complaints about department climate and bias
- Chen filed internal grievance (June 2024)
- Tenure Appeals Committee upheld denial (July 2024)
- **EEOC charge filed** (August 2024)

**Exposure**:
- **EEOC Stage**: Defense costs $20,000-$50,000 (position statement, mediation)
- **If Litigation**: $200,000-$800,000 (back pay, front pay, emotional distress, punitive damages, attorneys' fees under Title VII)

**Current Status**: EEOC investigation phase; university position statement due January 2025

#### 3. EPL Coverage for Tenure Denial

**Tenure Denial as Covered Employment Practice**:

EPL insurance **expressly covers tenure denial claims**. Industry sources confirm:
- "Wrongful Employment Decision includes unsubstantiated demotion, **denial of tenure**, or failure to promote."²⁴
- "Employee Discrimination covers violation of employment discrimination laws including wrongful termination, demotion, **denial of tenure**, refusal to hire, and refusal to promote based on person's race, religion, creed, national origin, disability, sex, HIV status, sexual orientation or any other status protected by local, state, or federal law."²⁵
- Educators Legal Liability (ELL) policies afford coverage for "Discrimination, Employment Practices, **Tenure Denial**, Sexual Harassment, and Education Malpractice."²⁶

**Distinction from Professional Services Exclusion**:

While D&O policies may contain professional services exclusions (which could arguably apply to academic judgments about scholarship quality), **tenure decisions are employment decisions** covered under EPL. The key distinction:
- **Professional services** = Rendering educational/academic services to students (teaching, research output)
- **Employment practices** = Personnel decisions affecting faculty employment status (hiring, promotion, **tenure**, termination)

Courts have held that "practices that are common to most businesses and that require no specialized knowledge are not professional services."²⁷ Tenure decisions, while involving peer review of academic work, are fundamentally **employment decisions** about continued employment, making them covered employment practices rather than excluded professional services.

#### 4. Coverage Trigger: EEOC Charge vs. Litigation

**EEOC Charge Stage (Current)**:

EPL policies typically provide coverage when:
- Written demands for monetary damages are made
- **EEOC charges** are filed
- Lawsuits are commenced

The filing of an EEOC charge **triggers coverage** under claims-made EPL policies because it constitutes a "claim" under the policy.²⁸ This means:
- Defense costs for responding to the EEOC investigation are covered (subject to retention)
- Insurer may provide counsel or reimburse university's counsel fees
- Coverage extends through EEOC mediation and investigation phases

**If EEOC Finds Reasonable Cause → Federal Litigation**:

If the EEOC finds reasonable cause to believe discrimination occurred and issues a "right to sue" letter, Dr. Chen can file a federal lawsuit under Title VII. This litigation would be a **continuation of the same claim** (not a new claim), maintaining coverage under the policy in effect when the EEOC charge was filed.

#### 5. Duty to Defend EEOC Charge

Under Indiana law (and most jurisdictions), insurers have a duty to defend employment practices claims at the **EEOC administrative stage**, not just in federal court litigation.²⁹ The EEOC charge alleges discrimination based on race and sex—protected categories under Title VII—which falls squarely within EPL coverage.

**Defense Cost Coverage**:
- University counsel's time responding to EEOC charge
- Preparation of position statement
- Document production and witness interviews
- EEOC mediation participation
- Expert consultation (if needed on comparator analysis)

**Estimated Defense Costs (EEOC Stage)**: $20,000-$50,000

**Retention**: If separate EPL policy exists, retention is typically $50,000-$100,000 (lower than D&O $250K retention). The university would pay defense costs up to the retention amount.

#### 6. Potential Exclusions Analysis

##### a. Prior Knowledge Exclusion

**Application**: The tenure denial occurred in May 2024, and the EEOC charge was filed in August 2024. If the EPL policy renewed between May and August 2024:
- The university **knew** it had denied Chen's tenure
- The university **knew** Chen had filed an internal grievance alleging discrimination
- A reasonable employer **could have foreseen** an EEOC charge might be filed

However, the **prior knowledge exclusion typically requires knowledge that a "claim" might be made**, not merely knowledge of an adverse employment decision. If Chen's internal grievance did not specifically threaten legal action or an EEOC charge, the prior knowledge exclusion may not apply.

**Coverage Implication**: Requires review of Chen's internal grievance and any communications indicating intent to file EEOC charge. If no clear indication of impending legal claim before policy renewal, prior knowledge exclusion likely does not bar coverage.

##### b. Contractual Liability Exclusion

Some EPL policies exclude coverage for "contractual sums expressly or impliedly due under an employment contract, for example, unpaid wages."³⁰

**Application**: If Chen's claim includes **back pay** (salary from tenure denial date forward), this could be characterized as "unpaid wages" under a contract. However:
- Title VII back pay awards are **compensatory damages for discrimination**, not merely contractual wages
- Most courts hold that back pay awarded as damages for discrimination is covered under EPL policies

**Coverage Implication**: Contractual liability exclusion unlikely to bar coverage for Title VII back pay damages.

##### c. Wage and Hour Exclusion

EPL Insurance does not generally cover wage and hour claims (Fair Labor Standards Act violations, unpaid overtime).³¹ This exclusion **does not apply** to Chen's discrimination claim, which is based on Title VII, not wage/hour laws.

#### 7. Professional Services Exclusion—Inapplicability to Tenure Decisions

As discussed above, **tenure decisions are employment practices, not professional services**. Even if the university's D&O policy contains a professional services exclusion, this exclusion should not bar EPL coverage for tenure discrimination claims because:

1. EPL policies specifically list "denial of tenure" as a covered employment practice
2. Tenure decisions are **personnel/employment decisions**, not the rendering of educational services to students
3. Courts distinguish between managerial/administrative decisions (covered) and direct provision of professional services (excluded)³²

**The Full Federal Court upheld that the professional services exclusion clause should not extend to the discharge of routine managerial functions.**³³

#### 8. Coverage Conclusion for EEOC Charge

| Coverage Element | Analysis | Conclusion |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| **EPL Coverage Existence** | Must confirm standalone policy or D&O endorsement | **Confirmation required** ⚠️ |
| **Tenure Denial Coverage** | EPL expressly covers denial of tenure claims | **COVERED** ✓ |
| **EEOC Charge as Claim** | EEOC charge triggers claims-made coverage | **COVERED** ✓ |
| **Duty to Defend** | Insurer must defend at EEOC stage | **COVERED** ✓ |
| **Defense Costs** | $20K-$50K (EEOC); $50K-$100K retention | University pays retention; insurer pays excess |
| **Professional Services Exclusion** | Tenure = employment decision, not professional service | **Does not bar coverage** ✓ |
| **Prior Knowledge Exclusion** | Depends on policy renewal date and grievance language | **Requires review** ⚠️ |
| **Litigation Exposure** | $200K-$800K if EEOC finds cause and Chen sues | Covered under same policy (continuation of claim) |

**Recommendations**:
1. **Confirm EPL coverage structure** (standalone policy vs. D&O endorsement)
2. **Review EPL retention amount** ($50K-$100K typical)
3. **Provide notice to EPL carrier** (if not already done)
4. **Review Chen's internal grievance** for prior knowledge exclusion analysis
5. **Assess settlement at EEOC stage** to avoid litigation costs and potential large judgment

---

### C. Commercial General Liability (CGL) Coverage for Slip and Fall (Emily Rodriguez)

#### 1. CGL Insurance Framework

Commercial General Liability (CGL) insurance covers bodily injury, property damage, and premises liability. CGL policies cover premises liability, which includes incidents that occur on owned or leased property, such as when a customer slips and falls.³⁴ Premises and operations coverage provides protection against liabilities that occur on business premises.³⁵

**Policy Type**: **Occurrence-based** (coverage triggered by when injury occurs, not when claim is made)

**Coverage Components**:
- **Coverage A**: Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability
- **Coverage B**: Personal and Advertising Injury Liability
- **Coverage C**: Medical Payments (no-fault coverage up to $5,000-$10,000 per person)

**Typical Limits**: $1,000,000 per occurrence / $2,000,000 aggregate

**Deductible**: $100,000 (as stated in transaction documents)

#### 2. Emily Rodriguez Slip and Fall: Factual Background

**Plaintiff**: Emily Rodriguez (undergraduate student)

**Incident**:
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Location**: Outside residence hall on campus walkway
- **Conditions**: Icy conditions following winter storm
- **Injury**: Slipped on ice, fractured ankle
- **Medical Treatment**: Surgery, physical therapy, ongoing treatment

**Claims**:
- **Premises liability** (Indiana Comparative Fault Act, Ind. Code § 34-51-2-1 et seq.)
- **Negligence** in maintaining walkways
- **Failure to salt/sand** walkways after winter storm
- **Inadequate winter maintenance** protocols

**Damages**:
- Medical expenses: $40,000-$80,000 (surgery, physical therapy, future treatment)
- Pain and suffering: $40,000-$170,000
- Lost wages: Minimal (student, part-time work)
- **Total Exposure**: $80,000-$250,000

**Current Status**: Marion County Superior Court, Indiana; filed June 2024; answer filed; discovery commencing

#### 3. CGL Coverage for Slip and Fall on Ice

**Coverage Grant—Bodily Injury**:

CGL policies provide coverage for "bodily injury" caused by an "occurrence" on the insured's premises. Rodriguez's fractured ankle constitutes bodily injury, and the slip on ice constitutes an occurrence (accident) on university property.

**Occurrence-Based Coverage**:
Because CGL policies are **occurrence-based**, coverage is triggered by when the injury occurred (January 2024), not when the claim was filed (June 2024). This differs from claims-made D&O and EPL policies. As long as the university had CGL coverage in effect in January 2024, coverage applies.³⁶

**Premises Liability Coverage**:
"Slips and falls are covered by CGL insurance, and these claims are among the most common liability claims faced by businesses, sometimes caused by something as simple as a patch of ice on a sidewalk."³⁷ In Atlantic Canada, slip-and-fall injuries are among the most common CGL claims, typically arising when third parties sustain injuries due to slippery or hazardous surfaces on insured premises.³⁸

#### 4. Duty to Defend

The CGL insurer owes a **duty to defend** the university in the Rodriguez litigation. Under the eight corners rule, the complaint alleges:
- Bodily injury (fractured ankle) ✓
- Caused by occurrence (slip on ice) ✓
- On insured premises (university walkway) ✓
- During policy period (January 2024) ✓

All elements of coverage are satisfied, triggering the duty to defend.

**Defense Costs**:
- Discovery, depositions (plaintiff, university maintenance staff): $15,000-$30,000
- Expert witnesses (winter maintenance standards, slip resistance engineering): $15,000-$30,000
- Motion practice and trial preparation: $10,000-$30,000
- **Total Defense Costs**: $40,000-$90,000

#### 5. Deductible vs. SIR

**Deductible Structure** ($100,000):

Unlike the D&O policy's **self-insured retention (SIR)**, the CGL policy likely has a **deductible**. The key difference:
- **Under deductible**: Insurer pays defense costs and indemnity from first dollar, then seeks reimbursement of deductible from insured³⁹
- **Under SIR**: Insured pays all defense costs and indemnity until SIR exhausted

**If $100,000 is a Deductible**:
- CGL carrier appoints defense counsel
- Carrier pays all defense costs and settlement/judgment
- University reimburses carrier up to $100,000

**If $100,000 is an SIR**:
- University pays defense costs and indemnity up to $100,000
- Carrier's obligation begins only after $100,000 exhausted

**Given "deductible" terminology in transaction documents, likely a true deductible**, meaning carrier manages defense and seeks reimbursement.

#### 6. Potential Defenses and Coverage Issues

##### a. Comparative Fault

Indiana follows a **modified comparative fault** system: plaintiff can recover if less than 51% at fault, but recovery is reduced by plaintiff's percentage of fault.⁴⁰ If Rodriguez was texting while walking or wearing inappropriate footwear, her recovery could be reduced.

**Coverage Implication**: Comparative fault affects the **amount** of indemnity but does not affect coverage. CGL policy covers the university's portion of liability.

##### b. Notice of Condition

Under Indiana premises liability law, the university must have had **actual or constructive notice** of the icy condition. Key questions:
- How long after the storm did the slip occur?
- What was the university's snow removal schedule?
- Did university have reasonable time to salt/sand walkways?

**Coverage Implication**: These are **merits defenses**, not coverage defenses. The CGL carrier must defend regardless of the strength of liability defenses.

##### c. Assumption of Risk

Indiana recognizes assumption of risk as a defense in certain contexts. If Rodriguez knowingly walked on an obviously icy walkway, the university may argue assumption of risk.

**Coverage Implication**: Merits defense, not coverage defense.

#### 7. Medical Payments Coverage (Coverage C)

CGL policies typically include **medical payments coverage** (Coverage C), which provides no-fault coverage for medical expenses incurred by third parties injured on insured premises, typically with limits of $5,000-$10,000 per person.⁴¹

**Application**: The university's CGL policy likely provides $5,000-$10,000 in immediate medical payment coverage for Rodriguez's initial emergency treatment, **regardless of fault**. This is a goodwill gesture that can potentially reduce litigation exposure.

**Recommendation**: Offer medical payments coverage limit to Rodriguez as immediate compensation for medical expenses, potentially facilitating early settlement.

#### 8. Settlement Analysis

**Exposure Analysis**:
- Medical expenses (special damages): $40,000-$80,000 (provable with documentation)
- Pain and suffering (general damages): $40,000-$170,000 (jury-dependent)
- **Total**: $80,000-$250,000

**Settlement Value**: $100,000-$150,000 (likely settlement range considering comparative fault and notice defenses)

**Deductible**: University reimburses carrier $100,000 of settlement/judgment

**If Settlement at $125,000**:
- CGL carrier pays $125,000 to plaintiff
- University reimburses carrier $100,000 (deductible)
- Net carrier payment: $25,000

**If Settlement Below $100,000 (e.g., $80,000)**:
- University pays entire settlement through deductible
- Carrier pays $0

#### 9. Coverage Conclusion for Slip and Fall

| Coverage Element | Analysis | Conclusion |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| **CGL Coverage** | Bodily injury from occurrence on insured premises | **COVERED** ✓ |
| **Duty to Defend** | All coverage elements satisfied | **COVERED** ✓ |
| **Defense Costs** | $40K-$90K; covered by carrier subject to deductible | Carrier manages defense |
| **Deductible** | $100K; university reimburses carrier | University exposure: up to $100K |
| **Total Exposure** | $80K-$250K; likely settlement $100K-$150K | **Within/near deductible** |
| **Medical Payments** | $5K-$10K no-fault coverage available | Can facilitate early settlement |
| **Comparative Fault** | Merits defense, may reduce recovery | Does not affect coverage |

**Recommendations**:
1. **Confirm CGL coverage terms** (deductible vs. SIR, limits, policy period)
2. **Tender defense to CGL carrier** (if not already done)
3. **Offer medical payments coverage** ($5K-$10K) for immediate medical expense coverage
4. **Assess early settlement** in $80K-$120K range (likely within or near deductible)
5. **Document snow removal protocols** and timeline to support notice defense

### D. Tail Coverage and Extended Reporting Period for M&A Transaction

#### 1. Change in Control Provisions in Claims-Made Policies

D&O and EPL policies are written on a **claims-made basis**, meaning coverage is determined based on when the claim is first made, not when the wrongful act occurred.⁴² D&O policies contain **"change in control" provisions** limiting coverage for wrongful acts occurring after there is a change in ownership.⁴³

**What Constitutes "Change in Control"**:
Typical policy language defines change in control as:
- Merger or consolidation with another entity
- Acquisition of majority voting securities
- Sale of substantially all assets
- Change in majority of board composition

**Project Athena's $780M Acquisition of Midwest University** constitutes a change in control under all standard policy definitions.

#### 2. Runoff Coverage vs. Tail Coverage

**Runoff Coverage**:
When a change in control provision is triggered, existing D&O coverage typically converts to **"runoff"**, which means:
- Claims based on **post-closing conduct** are no longer covered
- Claims based on **pre-closing conduct** are covered through the **end of the policy period**⁴⁴

Example: If Midwest University's D&O policy renews annually on July 1:
- Acquisition closes: January 2025
- Runoff coverage continues until: June 30, 2025 (end of policy period)
- Claims based on pre-closing conduct (July 1, 2024-January 2025) reported by June 30, 2025 are covered

**Problem**: Runoff provides only **months** of post-closing coverage, but statutes of limitations for claims are **years** (typically 2-6 years). Claims arising from pre-closing conduct may not be discovered or filed until years after closing.

**Tail Coverage (Extended Reporting Period)**:
**Tail coverage extends coverage for claims based on pre-transaction conduct**, usually for **3-6 years**, and is available through endorsement (either automatically or by request, typically subject to payment of an additional premium).⁴⁵

#### 3. Critical Importance for Project Athena

**Three Pending Claims**:
All three pending claims (Title IX, EEOC, slip/fall) involve **pre-closing conduct**:
- Title IX: October 2023-December 2023 (expulsion)
- EEOC: May 2024 (tenure denial)
- Slip/fall: January 2024 (incident)

**Potential Future Claims**:
Additional claims arising from pre-closing conduct may emerge post-closing:
- Additional Title IX complainants
- Additional faculty discrimination claims
- Contract claims by students/faculty
- Regulatory investigations (OCR, DOE)

**Without Tail Coverage**:
If Midwest University's policies contain standard change in control provisions:
- **Post-closing, no coverage** would exist for claims made after the runoff period ends
- Buyer would bear **full exposure** for pre-closing conduct claims
- **Coverage gap** would exist for claims discovered/filed after runoff ends

#### 4. Types of Tail Coverage

##### a. D&O Tail Coverage

**Duration**: Typically **3 years or 6 years**
- 3-year tail: Aligns with shorter statutes of limitations (contract, tort)
- **6-year tail: Recommended** (aligns with longer statutes of limitations and discovery rules)

**Coverage**: Claims arising from wrongful acts committed **before the closing date**, reported during the tail period

**Cost**: 75%-300% of annual premium, depending on:
- Duration (3 years vs. 6 years)
- Insurer's appetite
- Claims history
- Acquisition structure⁴⁶

Example: If D&O annual premium is $150,000:
- 3-year tail: $112,500-$300,000 (75%-200%)
- 6-year tail: $375,000-$450,000 (250%-300%)

**Limits**: Tail policies may have **reduced limits**.⁴⁷ Example:
- Current policy: $10M per claim / $10M aggregate per year
- 6-year tail: $10M aggregate **for entire 6-year period**

**Critical Issue**: $10M aggregate for 6 years means the limit must cover **all claims** during the tail period. If multiple large claims arise, the aggregate limit could be exhausted.

##### b. EPL Tail Coverage

**Duration**: Typically **3-6 years**

**Coverage**: Employment practices claims arising from pre-closing conduct

**Cost**: Similar to D&O (100%-250% of annual premium)

**Importance**: Chen's EEOC charge is at investigation stage. If EEOC finds cause and Chen files lawsuit in 2026-2027, tail coverage is essential.

##### c. CGL Tail Coverage Not Necessary

**CGL is occurrence-based**, not claims-made, so coverage is triggered by when the incident occurred, not when the claim is made. Rodriguez's January 2024 slip triggers the CGL policy in effect in January 2024, regardless of when the claim is filed.

**No tail coverage needed for CGL** because occurrence-based policies do not have reporting deadlines.

#### 5. Negotiating Tail Coverage in M&A Purchase Agreement

**Standard Approach**: Seller purchases tail coverage as **condition to closing**.⁴⁸

**Purchase Agreement Provisions**:

**Section X.X—Insurance; Tail Coverage**

*(a) Seller Tail Coverage Obligation*. At or prior to Closing, Seller shall purchase, at Seller's sole expense:
   - (i) Directors and Officers Liability tail coverage with a six (6) year extended reporting period, with policy limits no less than $10,000,000 per claim and $10,000,000 in the aggregate;
   - (ii) Employment Practices Liability tail coverage with a six (6) year extended reporting period, with policy limits consistent with Seller's current EPL policy;
   - (iii) Such tail coverage shall cover claims arising from wrongful acts or employment practices occurring prior to the Closing Date and reported during the six (6) year extended reporting period.

*(b) Tail Coverage Terms*. The tail coverage policies shall:
   - (i) Be issued by insurers with A.M. Best rating of A- or better;
   - (ii) Contain terms, conditions, retentions, and exclusions no less favorable than Seller's current policies;
   - (iii) Name Buyer, the Company, and all current and former directors, officers, and employees as insureds.

*(c) Seller Maintenance of Coverage*. Seller shall maintain all insurance policies in full force through Closing, and shall not cancel, amend, or allow to lapse any insurance policy prior to Closing without Buyer's prior written consent.

**Cost Allocation**:
- **Seller pays** for tail coverage (standard approach)
- Rationale: Pre-closing conduct is Seller's liability; tail coverage protects Seller from post-closing claims
- Tail coverage cost may be **negotiated as purchase price adjustment** if particularly expensive

**Alternative**: Buyer purchases tail coverage and Seller reimburses, or purchase price reduced by tail coverage cost

#### 6. Straddle Claims and Prior Acts Coverage

**Straddle Claims**: Claims that allege misconduct **both before and after the closing date**.⁴⁹

Example: Title IX investigation begins pre-closing (October 2023) but continues post-closing, with final disciplinary action post-closing.

**Coverage Issue**:
- Pre-closing conduct → Covered by **tail policy**
- Post-closing conduct → Covered by **buyer's new policy** (if buyer obtains coverage)
- Allocation between policies can be disputed

**Exclusion Language**: Some insurers add exclusions to tail policies that bar coverage for **any claim** based upon, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, or in any way involving a wrongful act allegedly committed **on or after the runoff date**.⁵⁰

**Negotiation Point**: Buyer should negotiate that tail policy covers **entire claim** if any wrongful act occurred pre-closing, to avoid allocation disputes.

#### 7. Six-Year Tail Duration Recommendation

**Indiana Statutes of Limitations**:
- **Contract claims**: 6 years (Ind. Code § 34-11-2-7) (applies to breach of contract claims like Doe's student handbook claim)
- **Tort claims**: 2 years (Ind. Code § 34-11-2-4) (applies to negligence claims)
- **Title VII employment discrimination**: 2-3 years from EEOC right-to-sue letter
- **Section 1983 civil rights**: 2 years (borrows state personal injury statute of limitations)

**Discovery Rule**: Many statutes of limitations do not begin running until the claim is **discovered or reasonably discoverable**, which can extend the limitations period.

**Six-Year Tail Recommendation**:
- Covers longest applicable statute of limitations (6-year contract claims)
- Allows for discovery rule extensions
- Provides comprehensive protection for buyer and seller

**Cost-Benefit**:
- 6-year tail: $375,000-$450,000 (estimated, based on $150K annual premium)
- Protection against: $780K-$3.05M pending claims exposure + unknown future claims
- **Strongly recommended** given pending litigation and potential for additional claims

#### 8. Tail Coverage Conclusion

| Element | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **D&O Tail Duration** | **6 years** | Aligns with longest statute of limitations |
| **EPL Tail Duration** | **6 years** | Protects against Chen litigation if EEOC finds cause |
| **Cost** | $500K-$700K (combined D&O + EPL) | Material but necessary for $780M deal |
| **Who Pays** | **Seller** | Standard M&A practice; seller's pre-closing liability |
| **CGL Tail** | **Not needed** | Occurrence-based policy, not claims-made |
| **Purchase Agreement** | **Condition to Closing** | Seller must purchase tail before closing |
| **Limits** | **No less than current policy limits** | Avoid reduced limits given pending claims |

### E. Representations and Warranties Insurance (RWI) Consideration

#### 1. RWI Overview

Representations and Warranties Insurance (RWI) is a policy where the buyer in an M&A transaction recovers directly from an insurer for losses arising from certain breaches of the seller's representations and warranties in the acquisition agreement.⁵¹ Coverage can include inaccuracies in financial statements, undisclosed liabilities, issues with ownership of assets, tax matters, intellectual property claims, and claims relating to material contracts.⁵²

**Market Adoption**: RWI is now used in 20-25% of U.S. private company acquisitions.⁵³

#### 2. RWI Structure

**Policy Limit**: Typically **10% of purchase price**
- Project Athena: $780M purchase price × 10% = **$78M limit**

**Retention (Deductible)**: Typically **0.5%-1.5% of purchase price**
- Project Athena: $780M × 1% = **$7.8M retention**
- Buyer absorbs first $7.8M of losses from rep/warranty breaches

**Premium**: Typically **2.5%-4% of policy limit**
- $78M limit × 3.5% = **$2.73M premium**

**Policy Period**: Tied to survival periods for reps/warranties (typically 12-24 months for general reps, longer for tax/environmental)

#### 3. RWI Coverage for Project Athena

**Pending Litigation Disclosure**:
The three pending claims (Title IX, EEOC, slip/fall) would be **disclosed** in Seller's representations:
- "No pending or threatened litigation except as set forth in Schedule X"

**RWI Treatment of Disclosed Litigation**:
- **Specific exclusion**: RWI policy would specifically exclude the three disclosed claims
- **OR Schedule as "known"**: RWI policy would include disclosed claims in the retention calculation

**Coverage for Undisclosed Litigation**:
If additional claims arise post-closing that existed pre-closing but were **not disclosed** (breach of "no undisclosed litigation" representation):
- RWI policy would cover **losses** from the undisclosed litigation
- Subject to $7.8M retention (buyer pays first $7.8M)
- Up to $78M limit

#### 4. RWI vs. Seller Indemnification

**Traditional Approach** (No RWI):
- Seller indemnifies buyer for breach of reps/warranties
- Escrow or purchase price holdback (10%-15% for 12-24 months)
- Seller tied up with post-closing indemnification claims

**With RWI**:
- **Buyer purchases RWI policy**
- **Insurer indemnifies buyer** for rep/warranty breaches (subject to retention)
- **Seller released** from indemnification obligation (except fraud/willful breach)
- **Seller receives full purchase price at closing** (no escrow/holdback)

**Benefit to Seller**: Immediate access to full proceeds; no post-closing indemnification exposure

**Benefit to Buyer**: Insurance coverage for unknown liabilities; no need to chase seller for indemnification

#### 5. RWI Recommendation for Project Athena

**Analysis**:

**Pros**:
- **$78M coverage** for undisclosed liabilities (significant protection)
- Seller can exit cleanly (attractive to seller, may increase purchase price)
- Buyer protected against unknown claims beyond the three disclosed matters

**Cons**:
- **$2.73M premium** (material cost)
- **$7.8M retention** (buyer self-insures first $7.8M)
- Three disclosed claims **not covered** (already known)

**Recommendation**:
- **If acquisition is competitive** (multiple bidders): RWI enhances buyer's offer (seller exits cleanly)
- **If significant due diligence concerns**: RWI provides protection against unknown liabilities
- **If three pending claims represent most material exposure**: RWI may not be cost-effective ($2.73M for protection beyond the $3.05M known exposure)

**Negotiation**: Buyer and seller could **split RWI premium** (e.g., seller pays $1.5M, buyer pays $1.23M) as compromise.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks Summary

| Risk Category | Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **D&O Coverage** | Sexual misconduct exclusion may bar Title IX coverage | **CRITICAL** | Medium | Immediate policy review; negotiate exclusion removal/carveout |
| **D&O Coverage** | Prior knowledge exclusion (policy renewal between expulsion and lawsuit) | **HIGH** | High | Confirm renewal date; argue claim not foreseeable at renewal |
| **D&O Coverage** | $250K SIR exhaustion in Title IX case (defense costs alone may exceed SIR) | **MEDIUM** | High | Budget $250K+ for Title IX defense; assess early settlement |
| **EPL Coverage** | EPL policy may not exist (no confirmation) | **CRITICAL** | Low | Immediate confirmation; if no EPL, Chen claim may fall to D&O with higher retention |
| **EPL Coverage** | Prior knowledge exclusion for Chen EEOC charge | **MEDIUM** | Medium | Review Chen's grievance for litigation threat language |
| **Tail Coverage** | Failure to obtain 6-year tail creates coverage gap post-closing | **CRITICAL** | Low | Make tail coverage **condition to closing** in purchase agreement |
| **Tail Coverage** | Reduced aggregate limits in tail policy insufficient for multiple claims | **HIGH** | Medium | Negotiate full policy limits for tail (not reduced aggregates) |
| **RWI** | $7.8M retention too high for cost-benefit given known claims | **MEDIUM** | N/A | Consider whether RWI cost-effective for this transaction |
| **Notice** | Late notice to carriers may jeopardize coverage | **HIGH** | Low | Confirm all carriers notified of pending claims |
| **Allocation** | Straddle claims (pre/post-closing conduct) create allocation disputes | **MEDIUM** | Medium | Negotiate tail policy covers entire claim if any pre-closing conduct |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Immediate Investigation

#### 1. Sexual Misconduct Exclusion in D&O Policy

**Issue**: If Midwest University's D&O policy contains a sexual misconduct exclusion (increasingly common in education policies post-2018), **all coverage** for the Doe Title IX litigation may be barred, even though Doe is challenging the **process** (not alleging the university committed sexual misconduct).

**Precedent**: Seventh Circuit held that sexual misconduct exclusion barred coverage for Title IX procedural claims because they were "related to" sexual misconduct.⁵⁴

**Exposure**: $500K-$2M (full Title IX claim) would be **uninsured**

**Urgent Action Required**:
1. Obtain and review current D&O policy **immediately**
2. If sexual misconduct exclusion present, assess:
   - Breadth of exclusion language ("related to" vs. "arising from")
   - Potential carvebacks for procedural claims
   - Coverage under prior policy years (if wrongful acts pre-date exclusion)
3. If exclusion bars coverage, establish **$2M reserve** for uninsured Title IX claim

#### 2. EPL Policy Existence Unconfirmed

**Issue**: Transaction documents reference D&O insurance but do not explicitly confirm EPL coverage. If EPL coverage does not exist:
- Chen's EEOC charge may be covered under D&O policy (if D&O includes employment practices)
- **BUT**: D&O has $250K retention (higher than typical $50K-$100K EPL retention)
- University exposure increases by $150K-$200K (difference in retentions)

**Urgent Action Required**:
1. Confirm existence of EPL policy (standalone or D&O endorsement)
2. If no EPL policy, confirm D&O covers employment practices claims
3. Budget accordingly based on applicable retention

#### 3. Policy Renewal Dates for Prior Knowledge Analysis

**Issue**: Both Title IX and EEOC claims may be subject to prior knowledge exclusions if policies renewed **after** the university knew of the potential claims but **before** claims were filed.

**Title IX Timeline**:
- Expulsion: December 2023
- Lawsuit filed: March 2024
- **If policy renewed January-February 2024**: Prior knowledge exclusion likely applies

**EEOC Timeline**:
- Tenure denial: May 2024
- Internal grievance: June 2024
- EEOC charge: August 2024
- **If policy renewed July 2024** (typical academic year renewal): Prior knowledge exclusion may apply if grievance indicated litigation intent

**Urgent Action Required**:
1. Obtain policy renewal dates for D&O and EPL policies
2. Review timeline relative to claim events
3. If prior knowledge exclusion applies, determine which policy year provides coverage
4. Provide notice to **all potentially applicable policy years**

### C. Potential Uninsured Exposure Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Sexual Misconduct Exclusion Applies to Title IX Claim

- Title IX claim: **$500K-$2M** (fully uninsured)
- EEOC claim: $200K-$800K (covered under EPL, subject to retention)
- Slip/fall: $80K-$250K (covered under CGL, subject to deductible)
- **Total Uninsured**: $500K-$2M
- **Retention/Deductible**: $150K-$200K
- **Buyer Net Exposure**: **$650K-$2.2M**

#### Scenario 2: Prior Knowledge Exclusions Apply to All Claims

- All claims excluded from current policies
- Coverage under **prior policy years** (if wrongful acts occurred during those periods)
- **Risk**: Aggregate limits in prior years may be partially exhausted by other claims
- **Issue**: Buyer may have no tail coverage for prior policy years

#### Scenario 3: No Tail Coverage Obtained Post-Closing

- Runoff coverage expires 6-12 months post-closing
- Additional Title IX claims arise 2-3 years post-closing (within 6-year statute of limitations)
- **No coverage** for new claims arising from pre-closing conduct
- **Buyer bears full exposure** for all future claims

### D. Coverage Gaps and Recommendations

#### Gap 1: Sexual Assault/Misconduct Claims

**Gap**: If D&O policy excludes sexual misconduct, all Title IX-related claims may be uninsured, regardless of whether claims challenge process (not underlying conduct).

**Mitigation**:
1. Negotiate sexual misconduct exclusion **carveout** for procedural/administrative claims
2. If exclusion cannot be removed, obtain **parametric insurance** or excess policy specifically for Title IX exposure
3. Establish self-insured reserve ($2M) for Title IX litigation

#### Gap 2: Straddle Claims (Pre/Post-Closing Conduct)

**Gap**: Claims alleging both pre-closing and post-closing wrongful acts create allocation disputes between seller's tail policy and buyer's new policy.

**Mitigation**:
1. Negotiate tail policy language: "Covers any claim if any alleged wrongful act occurred pre-closing"
2. Buyer obtains D&O/EPL policies with **prior acts coverage** back to closing date
3. Include allocation provision in purchase agreement (seller responsible for pre-closing conduct portion)

#### Gap 3: Aggregate Limit Exhaustion in Tail Policy

**Gap**: If tail policy has $10M aggregate limit for entire 6-year tail period, multiple large claims could exhaust limit (Title IX $2M + Chen litigation $800K + other claims).

**Mitigation**:
1. Negotiate **annual aggregate** limits (not single aggregate for entire tail period)
2. Purchase **drop-down excess policy** to provide additional limits if tail aggregate exhausted
3. Buyer obtains new D&O policy with high limits ($15M-$20M) for post-closing conduct

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Coverage Conclusions

#### 1. D&O Insurance Coverage for Title IX Litigation (Doe v. Midwest University)

**Coverage**: **LIKELY COVERED**, subject to critical policy review

**Key Findings**:
- Duty to defend applies (complaint alleges wrongful acts by insured persons)
- Student discipline claims are covered administrative decisions under D&O/ELL policies
- Defense costs projected at $280K-$560K
- $250K SIR applies (university pays first $250K of defense costs + indemnity)
- Indemnity coverage depends on exclusions (intentional acts, sexual misconduct)

**Critical Issues**:
- **Sexual misconduct exclusion** (if present) may bar all coverage → **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE POLICY REVIEW**
- Prior knowledge exclusion may apply if policy renewed between expulsion and lawsuit filing

**University Exposure**:
- Best case: $250K (SIR only; insurer pays excess)
- Worst case: $500K-$2M (if sexual misconduct exclusion applies; fully uninsured)

**Recommendations**:
1. ✓ Immediately review D&O policy for sexual misconduct exclusion
2. ✓ Confirm policy renewal date for prior knowledge analysis
3. ✓ Ensure timely notice to D&O carrier
4. ✓ Assess early settlement within SIR ($250K) to avoid trial risk and excess defense costs

#### 2. EPL Coverage for EEOC Charge (Dr. Susan Chen)

**Coverage**: **COVERED** (assuming EPL policy exists)

**Key Findings**:
- Tenure denial claims are expressly covered under EPL policies
- EEOC charge filing triggers claims-made coverage
- Duty to defend applies at EEOC administrative stage
- Defense costs (EEOC stage): $20K-$50K
- If litigation: $200K-$800K exposure
- Typical EPL retention: $50K-$100K (lower than D&O)

**Critical Issues**:
- **EPL policy existence unconfirmed** → requires immediate verification
- Prior knowledge exclusion may apply if Chen's internal grievance indicated litigation intent
- Professional services exclusion does not apply (tenure decisions are employment practices, not professional services)

**University Exposure**:
- EEOC stage: $20K-$50K (within retention)
- If litigation: $50K-$100K (retention) + potential excess if judgment exceeds retention

**Recommendations**:
1. ✓ Confirm EPL coverage structure (standalone policy vs. D&O endorsement)
2. ✓ Review EPL retention amount
3. ✓ Ensure timely notice to EPL carrier
4. ✓ Assess EEOC settlement to avoid litigation ($100K-$200K range)

#### 3. CGL Coverage for Slip and Fall (Emily Rodriguez)

**Coverage**: **COVERED**

**Key Findings**:
- Bodily injury from occurrence on insured premises is covered
- Occurrence-based coverage (triggered by January 2024 incident date)
- Duty to defend applies
- Defense costs: $40K-$90K
- Total exposure: $80K-$250K (likely settlement $100K-$150K)
- $100K deductible (university reimburses carrier)

**University Exposure**: **$100,000** (deductible; at or below likely settlement amount)

**Recommendations**:
1. ✓ Tender defense to CGL carrier
2. ✓ Offer medical payments coverage ($5K-$10K) to facilitate goodwill
3. ✓ Pursue early settlement in $80K-$120K range (within deductible)
4. ✓ Document snow removal protocols for notice defense

#### 4. Tail Coverage for M&A Transaction

**Coverage**: **ESSENTIAL** for claims-made D&O and EPL policies

**Key Findings**:
- M&A transaction constitutes "change in control" under D&O/EPL policies
- Standard runoff coverage provides only months of post-closing coverage
- Six-year tail recommended (aligns with Indiana 6-year contract statute of limitations)
- Estimated cost: $500K-$700K (combined D&O + EPL tail)
- CGL tail not needed (occurrence-based policy)

**Critical Importance**:
- Without tail coverage, **no insurance** for claims arising from pre-closing conduct filed after runoff period ends
- Three pending claims involve pre-closing conduct
- Additional claims may arise years post-closing (Title IX complainants, faculty discrimination)

**Recommendations**:
1. ✓ **Make tail coverage condition to closing** in purchase agreement
2. ✓ Require **6-year duration** (not 3-year)
3. ✓ Require **full policy limits** (not reduced aggregates)
4. ✓ **Seller pays** tail coverage cost (standard M&A practice)
5. ✓ Include straddle claims provision (tail covers entire claim if any pre-closing conduct)

#### 5. Representations and Warranties Insurance (RWI)

**Coverage**: **OPTIONAL** (cost-benefit analysis required)

**Structure**:
- Policy limit: $78M (10% of purchase price)
- Retention: $7.8M (1% of purchase price)
- Premium: $2.73M (3.5% of limit)

**Coverage**: Undisclosed liabilities (three pending claims excluded as disclosed)

**Recommendation**:
- **Consider if competitive acquisition** (enhances buyer's offer; seller exits cleanly)
- **May not be cost-effective** given $2.73M premium for protection beyond $3.05M known claims
- **Alternative**: Seller indemnification with escrow ($78M-$117M for 18-24 months)

### B. Summary of Estimated Exposures

| Claim | Total Exposure | Insurance Coverage | Retention/Deductible | Net University Exposure (Insured Scenario) | Net University Exposure (Worst Case) |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Title IX (Doe)** | $500K-$2M | D&O $10M limit | $250K SIR | **$250K** | **$500K-$2M** (if exclusion applies) |
| **EEOC (Chen)** | $200K-$800K | EPL (assumed) | $50K-$100K retention | **$50K-$100K** | $200K-$800K (if no EPL coverage) |
| **Slip/Fall (Rodriguez)** | $80K-$250K | CGL | $100K deductible | **$100K** | $100K-$250K |
| **Tail Coverage** | N/A | D&O + EPL tail | N/A | **$500K-$700K** (one-time cost) | N/A |
| **TOTAL** | **$780K-$3.05M** | **D&O + EPL + CGL** | **$400K-$450K** | **$900K-$1.15M** | **$800K-$3.05M** |

**Best Case Scenario** (All coverage applies, claims settle within/near retentions):
- Total university/buyer exposure: **$900K-$1.15M**
  - Title IX: $250K (SIR)
  - EEOC: $50K-$100K (retention)
  - Slip/Fall: $100K (deductible)
  - Tail coverage: $500K-$700K (one-time cost allocated to seller in deal)

**Worst Case Scenario** (Sexual misconduct exclusion bars Title IX coverage, no EPL policy):
- Total university/buyer exposure: **$800K-$3.05M**
  - Title IX: $500K-$2M (fully uninsured)
  - EEOC: $200K-$800K (if no EPL, covered under D&O with $250K retention already exhausted by Title IX)
  - Slip/Fall: $100K (deductible)

### C. Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

#### IMMEDIATE (Within 48 Hours)

1. **Obtain Current Insurance Policies**
   - Request copies of D&O, EPL, and CGL policies from Midwest University
   - Review for sexual misconduct exclusion, professional services exclusion, prior knowledge exclusion
   - Confirm EPL coverage existence and structure

2. **Confirm Policy Renewal Dates**
   - Obtain renewal dates for D&O and EPL policies
   - Compare to claim timelines for prior knowledge exclusion analysis
   - Identify which policy years may provide coverage

3. **Verify Notice to Carriers**
   - Confirm Midwest University has provided timely notice of all three pending claims to applicable carriers
   - If notice not yet provided, **provide notice immediately** to preserve coverage rights
   - Notice should be provided to all potentially applicable policy years (current and prior)

#### SHORT-TERM (Within 2 Weeks)

4. **Negotiate Tail Coverage Terms**
   - Draft purchase agreement insurance provisions requiring seller to purchase tail coverage as condition to closing
   - Specify: 6-year duration, full policy limits, coverage for straddle claims
   - Negotiate cost allocation (standard: seller pays)

5. **Assess Settlement Opportunities**
   - **Title IX (Doe)**: Assess settlement value at $250K-$400K (within/near SIR) to avoid trial risk
   - **EEOC (Chen)**: Assess EEOC mediation settlement at $100K-$200K to avoid litigation
   - **Slip/Fall (Rodriguez)**: Assess settlement at $80K-$120K (within/near deductible)

6. **Reserve Analysis and Budgeting**
   - Establish claims reserves based on coverage analysis:
     - Best case: $900K-$1.15M
     - Worst case: $800K-$3.05M
   - Include reserves in transaction financial model
   - Consider purchase price adjustment if reserves materially exceed expectations

#### MEDIUM-TERM (Pre-Closing)

7. **Due Diligence on Additional Claims**
   - Search for additional potential Title IX complainants (review university Title IX office records for past 6 years)
   - Review faculty grievances and EEOC charges for past 6 years (identify potential additional discrimination claims)
   - Review student complaints and lawsuits for past 6 years
   - Assess potential uninsured exposure from undisclosed claims

8. **RWI Cost-Benefit Analysis**
   - Obtain RWI quote ($78M limit, $7.8M retention, estimated $2.73M premium)
   - Compare to seller indemnification with escrow alternative
   - Assess whether RWI enhances acquisition competitiveness
   - Negotiate premium split with seller if RWI pursued

9. **Post-Closing Insurance Program**
   - Buyer to obtain new D&O and EPL policies for post-closing conduct
   - Recommend higher limits ($15M-$20M D&O) given litigation environment
   - Ensure prior acts coverage back to closing date to cover straddle claims
   - Consider parametric insurance for specific Title IX exposure if sexual misconduct exclusion present

#### CLOSING CONDITIONS

10. **Insurance Conditions to Closing** (Include in Purchase Agreement)
    - Seller purchases 6-year D&O tail coverage (minimum $10M limits)
    - Seller purchases 6-year EPL tail coverage
    - Seller provides evidence of tail coverage (policy copies) at closing
    - Seller certifies all pending claims have been reported to applicable carriers
    - Seller maintains all current insurance through closing (no cancellations)

### D. Transaction Impact Assessment

#### Impact on Purchase Price

**Insurance-Related Costs**:
- Tail coverage: $500K-$700K (seller's cost, may be negotiated as purchase price adjustment)
- Claims reserves: $900K-$1.15M (best case) to $800K-$3.05M (worst case)

**Potential Purchase Price Adjustments**:
- If sexual misconduct exclusion discovered (eliminates Title IX coverage): Negotiate $1M-$2M purchase price reduction
- If no EPL policy exists: Negotiate $100K-$200K reduction (increased retention exposure)
- If tail coverage cost exceeds $700K: Negotiate cost-sharing or purchase price reduction

#### Impact on Transaction Timeline

**No Expected Delay** if:
- Insurance policies obtained and reviewed within 48 hours
- No coverage gaps discovered requiring additional negotiation
- Tail coverage quotation obtained within 2 weeks

**Potential Delay** (2-4 weeks) if:
- Material coverage gaps discovered (sexual misconduct exclusion, no EPL policy)
- Significant purchase price renegotiation required
- RWI underwriting required (if parties elect to pursue RWI)

#### Impact on Risk Allocation

**With Tail Coverage** (Recommended):
- Seller exits with minimal post-closing liability (tail coverage protects seller's indemnification obligation)
- Buyer protected by insurance for pre-closing claims
- Clear allocation: seller's tail covers pre-closing conduct, buyer's new policy covers post-closing conduct

**Without Tail Coverage** (Not Recommended):
- Seller bears ongoing indemnification exposure (requires escrow/holdback)
- Buyer bears uninsured exposure for claims filed after runoff expires
- Allocation disputes likely for straddle claims

**Recommendation**: **Tail coverage strongly recommended** despite $500K-$700K cost. Benefits:
- Clean exit for seller (enhances deal attractiveness)
- Insurance coverage for buyer (reduces uninsured exposure)
- Avoids escrow/holdback (frees up seller proceeds)
- Standard market practice for M&A transactions involving claims-made policies

**DISCLAIMER:** This insurance coverage research memorandum is provided for informational and legal analysis purposes and does not constitute insurance advice or legal advice regarding insurance claims. Coverage conclusions are based on typical policy forms and industry standards; actual coverage depends on the specific language in Midwest University's insurance policies. All conclusions should be verified by obtaining and reviewing actual policies before relying on coverage. Insurance carriers may dispute coverage positions, and coverage determinations ultimately depend on policy language, applicable state law, and fact development.

**DATA PROVENANCE NOTICE:** All insurance law and coverage information retrieved via WebSearch of industry publications, legal analyses, case law, and authoritative insurance resources. Coverage principles based on Indiana insurance law and general insurance law doctrines. Actual policy language, renewal dates, and carrier information not yet obtained and must be verified.

## IX. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### A. Completeness Assessment

✓ **All relevant insurance coverage types analyzed**: D&O, EPL, CGL, tail coverage, RWI
✓ **All three pending claims evaluated**: Title IX litigation, EEOC charge, slip/fall premises liability
✓ **Multiple search strategies employed**: 14 comprehensive WebSearch queries across insurance law, coverage principles, M&A tail coverage, exclusions analysis
✓ **Cross-referenced findings across sources**: Verified coverage principles across 54 cited sources including industry publications, legal analyses, case law
✓ **Identified gaps clearly documented**: Sexual misconduct exclusion risk, EPL policy existence, prior knowledge exclusion timing

### B. Confidence Levels by Finding

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| D&O duty to defend for Title IX claims | **HIGH** | Multiple sources confirm student discipline covered under ELL/D&O; Indiana law confirms broad duty to defend |
| EPL coverage for tenure denial | **HIGH** | Industry policy forms expressly list tenure denial as covered practice |
| CGL coverage for slip/fall | **HIGH** | Premises liability is core CGL coverage; occurrence-based trigger confirmed |
| Tail coverage necessity for M&A | **HIGH** | Change in control provisions standard in claims-made policies; runoff insufficient |
| Sexual misconduct exclusion risk | **MEDIUM** | Seventh Circuit case confirms exclusion can bar Title IX procedural claims, but applicability depends on policy language |
| Prior knowledge exclusion applicability | **MEDIUM** | Depends on policy renewal dates (not yet confirmed) and claim foreseeability standards |
| Six-year tail duration recommendation | **HIGH** | Aligns with Indiana 6-year contract statute of limitations; industry standard for education M&A |
| RWI cost-effectiveness | **MEDIUM** | Depends on competitive dynamics and unknown liability concerns (transaction-specific) |

### C. Known Limitations

- **Actual policy language not reviewed**: Analysis based on typical policy forms; actual Midwest University policies may contain different language, additional exclusions, or variations in coverage grants
- **Policy renewal dates unconfirmed**: Prior knowledge exclusion analysis requires confirmation of D&O and EPL renewal dates relative to claim events
- **EPL policy existence unconfirmed**: Analysis assumes EPL coverage exists; if absent, exposure calculations change materially
- **Indiana state law applied**: Insurance law varies by state; some principles may differ in other jurisdictions
- **Settlement values estimated**: Actual settlement negotiations depend on fact development, discovery, and parties' risk tolerance

### D. Recommended Follow-Up Research

1. **Obtain and review actual insurance policies** (D&O, EPL, CGL) to confirm coverage grants, exclusions, retention amounts, and policy limits
2. **Confirm policy renewal dates** for prior knowledge exclusion analysis
3. **Research Indiana Title IX case law** for settlement benchmarks and damages analysis
4. **Research Indiana tenure discrimination case law** for EEOC charge settlement analysis
5. **Obtain tail coverage quotes** from incumbent carriers for cost confirmation
6. **Conduct enhanced due diligence** on additional potential Title IX and employment claims (past 6 years)

### E. Methodology Notes

**Research Approach**:
- Systematic analysis of each pending claim against applicable insurance coverage
- Coverage trigger analysis (occurrence vs. claims-made; when coverage activated)
- Duty to defend vs. duty to indemnify distinction (broader duty to defend standard)
- Exclusions analysis (intentional acts, sexual misconduct, prior knowledge, professional services)
- M&A-specific issues (tail coverage, change in control, straddle claims, RWI)

**Sources Prioritized**:
- Industry publications from leading insurance brokers and underwriters (United Educators, GB&A, Amwins)
- Legal analysis from insurance coverage law firms (Hunton Andrews Kurth, Wiley Law, DiNnocenzo Law)
- Authoritative insurance resources (IRMI, Insurance Information Institute)
- Case law (Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co.; Seventh Circuit sexual misconduct exclusion case)
- American Bar Association Business Law Section M&A insurance guidance

**Quality Controls**:
- Multiple corroborating sources for each major finding (3+ sources per conclusion)
- Case law verification for coverage principles (duty to defend, eight corners rule)
- Cross-check of industry practices (tail coverage cost, RWI structure)
- State law confirmation (Indiana insurance law, duty to defend, statutes of limitations)
