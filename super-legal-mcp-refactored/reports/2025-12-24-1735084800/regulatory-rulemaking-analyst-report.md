## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

The proposed $780M acquisition of Midwest University (private nonprofit) by American Education Holdings (for-profit) presents **moderate to high regulatory risk** requiring **8-12 months minimum** from signing to closing due to mandatory regulatory approvals. The transaction triggers three critical regulatory gates: **(1) Higher Learning Commission change of control approval** (condition precedent to closing, 6-9 month process), **(2) Department of Education Title IV recertification** (post-closing, 3-6 month process via provisional certification), and **(3) nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion compliance** (2-year monitoring period). The **most significant risk** is degradation of Midwest University's financial responsibility composite score from 2.3 to potentially below 1.5 due to acquisition debt, which would trigger letter of credit requirements ($18.2M-$45.5M) and heightened cash monitoring. Strategic debt structuring at the holding company level rather than institutional level can substantially mitigate this risk.

**Regulatory Approval Probability Assessment**:
- HLC Change of Control Approval: **75%** (with robust application and stakeholder engagement)
- DOE Title IV Recertification: **95%** (assuming composite score maintained ≥1.0)
- 90/10 Rule Compliance: **95%** (substantial 63.2 percentage point cushion)
- Cohort Default Rate Compliance: **98%** (current 6.4% CDR well below 30% threshold)

**Critical Path Timeline**: HLC approval is the **longest pole**, requiring **6-9 months** from application to Board decision, and must be obtained **prior to closing**. DOE recertification proceeds post-closing via Temporary Provisional Program Participation Agreement (TPPPA), adding **3-6 months** to achieve provisional certification. Total timeline from signing to full Title IV approval: **3.5-5 years** (including up to 3 complete award years of provisional certification).

**Transaction-Fatal Risks**: (1) HLC Board denial of change of control (10% probability); (2) Composite score below 1.0 triggering $45.5M letter of credit that cannot be secured (5% probability if debt at institutional level); (3) Department determination that nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion violates "public benefit" standard (low probability <5% but catastrophic if occurs).

### B. Regulatory Framework Overview

#### 1. Change of Ownership - Title IV Eligibility Cessation

Under 34 CFR § 600.31, a change of ownership resulting in a change of control causes an institution to **immediately cease qualifying** as an eligible Title IV institution. The acquisition of Midwest University (nonprofit) by American Education Holdings (for-profit) constitutes a change of control under four independent grounds: (a) acquisition of nonprofit institution by for-profit entity; (b) change in governance structure and composition of governing board; (c) transfer of substantial control to third party; and (d) change from nonprofit to proprietary tax status. Midwest University cannot assume continued Title IV eligibility post-closing. The institution must **reestablish eligibility through recertification** as if it were a new applicant for Title IV participation.

The recertification process requires: (i) **90-day advance notice** to Department prior to anticipated closing date (34 CFR § 600.20(g)(1)(i)); (ii) **10-day post-closing application** through E-App system within 10 business days of change of ownership (§ 600.20(g)(1)(ii)); (iii) **same-day audited balance sheet** (for proprietary institutions) or audited statement of financial position (for nonprofits converting to proprietary) as of closing date; (iv) **proof of HLC accreditation approval** including clear statement that HLC has approved the change of ownership; and (v) **financial responsibility demonstration** including composite score calculation and, if applicable, letter of credit equal to 10%-25% of prior year Title IV funds.

#### 2. Financial Responsibility Standards - Composite Score Methodology

The Department determines an institution's financial responsibility using a **three-ratio composite score** methodology (34 CFR § 668.171-668.174): **(a) Primary Reserve Ratio** (measures viability and liquidity), **(b) Equity Ratio** (measures capital resources and borrowing capacity), and **(c) Net Income Ratio** (measures profitability and sustainability). Each ratio is calculated from audited financial statements, converted to a strength factor score using algorithmic formulas in Appendices A and B to Subpart L, weighted according to institution type, and summed to produce a composite score ranging from -1.0 to +3.0.

**Critical Weighting Difference for Nonprofit vs. For-Profit**:
- **Nonprofit institutions** (Appendix B): Primary Reserve 40%, Equity 40%, Net Income 20%
- **Proprietary institutions** (Appendix A): Primary Reserve 30%, Equity 40%, Net Income 30%

Midwest University currently scores **2.3** as a nonprofit, placing it squarely in the "financially responsible" zone (≥1.5). However, upon conversion to for-profit status post-acquisition, MU will be reclassified as proprietary and subject to the for-profit weighting formula, which places **greater emphasis on profitability** (30% weight on net income vs. 20% for nonprofits).

**Composite Score Thresholds and Consequences**:

| Score Range | Status | Requirements | Title IV Participation |
|-------------|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **1.5 to 3.0** | Financially Responsible | None | Full participation; advance payment method |
| **1.0 to 1.4** | "Zone" - Not Responsible | 10% LOC ($18.2M); HCM1 | Conditional; provisional certification |
| **< 1.0** | Not Financially Responsible | 25% LOC ($45.5M); HCM2 | Conditional; reimbursement payment method |

The **2023 Final Rule** (88 Fed. Reg. 74,568, effective July 1, 2024) significantly enhanced financial oversight post-change of ownership, imposing: (i) mandatory financial protection (LOC or cash) for institutions not financially responsible following ownership change; (ii) extended provisional certification up to 3 complete award years (vs. prior 2-year maximum); (iii) new financial tests on owners and entities exercising substantial control; (iv) expanded triggering events for LOC requirements (composite score <1.5, withdrawal of owner certification, judgments >$1M); and (v) enhanced reporting on related-party transactions.

#### 3. Impact of Acquisition Debt on Composite Score

**Critical Transaction Risk**: The $780M purchase price, if financed with substantial debt at the **institutional level**, will significantly deteriorate Midwest University's composite score. The Equity Ratio (40% weight) is most vulnerable to leveraged transactions because debt reduces the numerator (Modified Equity/Net Assets) while increasing the denominator (Modified Assets), compressing the ratio. The Primary Reserve Ratio (30% for proprietary, 40% for nonprofit) is secondarily affected because debt service (interest expense) increases Total Expenses in the denominator while potentially reducing Expendable Net Assets in the numerator if operating losses occur.

**Debt Impact Modeling** (based on current composite score 2.3, Title IV funds $182M):

| Debt at Institution Level | Est. Post-Acquisition Composite Score | Zone Status | LOC Requirement | HCM Status |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **$300M** | 1.8 - 2.1 | Financially Responsible | None | None |
| **$500M** | 1.3 - 1.6 | Zone / Borderline | 10% = **$18.2M** | HCM1 (delayed payment) |
| **$700M** | 0.8 - 1.2 | Not Responsible | 25% = **$45.5M** | HCM2 (reimbursement) |

**Key Variables Affecting Actual Score**: (a) debt terms (interest rate, amortization schedule, covenant requirements); (b) whether debt is at Holdco or institutional level; (c) equity infusion amount and timing; (d) same-day balance sheet optimization; (e) asset purchase vs. stock purchase structure; and (f) fair market value step-up of assets.

**Critical Mitigation Strategy**: Structure acquisition debt at **holding company level** (American Education Holdings LLC) rather than Midwest University level. Under this structure, AEH borrows $700M secured by AEH assets and future distributions from MU, but debt does not appear on MU's financial statements. MU's balance sheet reflects only equity investment from AEH, preserving composite score near current 2.3 level. However, Department may scrutinize: (i) related-party guarantee arrangements; (ii) management fees or service agreements that effectively transfer funds to Holdco for debt service; (iii) restrictions on MU's ability to retain earnings; and (iv) whether Holdco structure is substantive or merely avoids financial responsibility regulations.

**Regulatory Precedent**: Department has authority to "look through" corporate structures and examine substance over form under administrative capability regulations (34 CFR § 668.16). The 2023 Final Rule expanded scrutiny of entities exercising "substantial control" over institutions, potentially reaching through to Holdco debt service obligations if Department determines they materially impair institutional financial viability.

#### 4. 90/10 Rule - For-Profit Institution Revenue Requirement

The 90/10 rule (20 U.S.C. § 1094(d)) applies **exclusively to proprietary (for-profit) institutions**, requiring that they derive **at least 10% of revenue from non-federal sources** to remain Title IV eligible. The rule ensures market viability by preventing institutions from depending entirely on federal student aid. **Currently, the rule does not apply** to Midwest University as a nonprofit 501(c)(3). **Upon conversion to for-profit status**, MU immediately becomes subject to the 90/10 rule.

**American Rescue Plan Act 2021 Expansion**: Effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2023, the definition of "federal revenue" was expanded to include **GI Bill benefits and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance**, which were previously excluded (creating the "90/10 loophole" that incentivized aggressive veteran recruitment). Post-ARPA, the rule effectively becomes **"85/15"** for institutions with significant military/veteran populations.

**MU's Current Revenue Profile**:
- Total Revenue: $680M
- Title IV Revenue: $182M (26.8% of total)
  - Pell Grants: $38M
  - Direct Loans: $144M
- Non-Federal Revenue: $498M (73.2% of total)

**90/10 Compliance Assessment**: **LOW RISK**. MU's current 26.8% federal revenue percentage provides a **63.2 percentage point cushion** below the 90% threshold. To violate the 90/10 rule, MU would need to increase Title IV revenue from $182M to $612M (assuming total revenue remains constant at $680M), a **236% increase** in federal aid. This would require dramatic enrollment mix shift toward Pell-eligible students, massive tuition increases without corresponding increases in institutional aid, or collapse of non-federal revenue sources.

**Sanctions for Non-Compliance**: (a) **Single year violation**: Institution enters provisional eligibility for 2 years; must report 90/10 quarterly; subject to program reviews. (b) **Two consecutive years violation**: Institution loses Title IV eligibility for **at least 2 fiscal years**; must demonstrate compliance for 2 additional years without Title IV participation to regain eligibility. This is effectively a **4-year Title IV ban**, which would be catastrophic for MU given its 26.8% dependency on federal funds ($182M).

**Nonprofit-to-For-Profit Conversion Enhanced Scrutiny**: The 2023 Final Rule imposes additional requirements on converting institutions: (i) must demonstrate 90/10 compliance for **2 complete consecutive fiscal years** before Department approves conversion for Title IV purposes; (ii) prohibited from advertising as nonprofit until Department approves conversion; (iii) must continue demonstrating gainful employment compliance (if applicable); and (iv) enhanced reporting on revenue sources, ownership, and related-party transactions for 2-year period post-conversion.

#### 5. HLC Change of Control - Condition Precedent to Closing

Higher Learning Commission (HLC) accreditation is a **mandatory prerequisite** for Title IV eligibility (20 U.S.C. § 1099b(a); 34 CFR § 600.4(a)(5)(i)). Under federal regulations governing recognized accrediting agencies (34 CFR § 602.22(a)(1)(ii)(B)), HLC **must** have policies requiring approval of substantive changes including **"any change in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution."** HLC policy (INST.G.20.010) mandates that institutions **must receive HLC approval prior to undergoing** a Change of Control. Consummating the transaction without prior HLC approval results in **loss of accreditation** and immediate loss of Title IV eligibility.

**HLC Application and Review Process**:
1. **Pre-application consultation** (1-3 months, strongly recommended): Informal discussions with HLC staff to preview transaction structure, address concerns, and determine documentation requirements.

2. **Application preparation and submission** (2-3 months): Institution prepares comprehensive Application for Change of Control including: (a) detailed transaction description and structure; (b) information on new owners and controlling entities; (c) financial projections and viability analysis; (d) evidence of continued mission compatibility; (e) governance structure documentation; (f) student outcome impact assessment; and (g) stakeholder engagement summary.

3. **HLC staff and peer review** (2-4 months): HLC conducts Change of Control Evaluation through peer reviewers, potentially including: (a) consultation with transactional attorneys and corporate finance experts; (b) review of financial pro formas and debt service coverage; (c) assessment of mission compatibility; (d) on-site Change of Control Visit (at HLC discretion); and (e) preparation of Change of Control Report for Board.

4. **HLC Board decision** (occurs at next scheduled Board meeting after review completion): HLC Board of Trustees meets three times per year (typically February, June, November). Board has **sole decision-making authority** to approve or deny application. Approval may be conditional (e.g., enhanced reporting, specific commitments).

5. **Post-approval monitoring**: Upon approval, institution is placed on **"Accredited Change of Control"** status for typically **no more than 2 years**. During this period, HLC monitors: (a) continued compliance with accreditation criteria; (b) financial stability and sustainability; (c) educational quality maintenance; and (d) mission integrity preservation.

**Total HLC Timeline**: **6-9 months** from initial consultation to Board decision, depending on application complexity, transaction structure complexity, whether on-site visit required, and alignment with Board meeting schedule.

**HLC Denial Grounds**: Board may deny based on: (i) **financial instability** (insufficient resources post-transaction to support educational mission); (ii) **mission incompatibility** (proposed changes inconsistent with accredited mission and Criteria for Accreditation); (iii) **governance concerns** (inadequate structure, conflicts of interest); (iv) **educational quality risks** (concerns about maintaining academic standards, student support); or (v) **prior performance issues** (new owner's track record with other institutions shows quality decline, compliance issues, or closures).

#### 6. DOE Recertification Timeline and Provisional Certification

**Post-Closing Recertification Process**:

**Day -90 (Pre-Closing)**: Institution provides 90-day advance notice to Department including proposed transaction description, state authorization, HLC correspondence, and financial statements.

**Day 0 (Closing Date)**: Change of ownership occurs. Midwest University's existing Title IV eligibility **immediately ceases** under 34 CFR § 600.31(a).

**Day 1-10 (Post-Closing)**: Institution submits materially complete E-App application within 10 business days of closing, including: (a) transaction documents; (b) **same-day audited balance sheet** (as proprietary institution); (c) HLC approval letter; (d) state authorization as for-profit; (e) IRS documentation (if tax status changed); (f) ownership and control disclosure; and (g) financial responsibility calculations.

**Day 11-30 (TPPPA Issuance)**: Department issues **Temporary Provisional Program Participation Agreement (TPPPA)** allowing institution to continue Title IV participation on provisional basis. TPPPA initially expires on **last day of month following month of closing** (e.g., if closing September 15, TPPPA expires October 31).

**Months 2-6 (Department Review)**: Department conducts recertification review including: (a) completeness verification; (b) financial responsibility determination (composite score calculation); (c) letter of credit determination (if score <1.5); (d) accreditation verification; (e) state authorization verification; (f) background checks on owners; and (g) administrative capability assessment. TPPPA extended month-to-month if institution timely submits required documents.

**Month 6-12 (Provisional Certification)**: Department issues **provisional Program Participation Agreement** for period **not later than end of third complete award year** following provisional certification date (34 CFR § 668.13(c)(2)(ii)). Example: If provisional PPA issued December 1, 2025, it expires no later than June 30, 2029 (end of 2028-2029 award year, the third complete award year).

**Years 2-4 (Provisional Period Compliance)**: Institution must: (a) submit annual audited financial statements and compliance audits; (b) maintain composite score ≥ 1.5 for 2 consecutive fiscal years (if converting nonprofit to for-profit); (c) demonstrate 90/10 compliance for 2 consecutive fiscal years; (d) maintain cohort default rates below thresholds; (e) complete Title IV training within 12 months; (f) satisfy HLC Accredited Change of Control monitoring (up to 2 years); and (g) apply for renewal of certification at least 90 days before provisional period expires.

**Conditions During Provisional Period**: (i) subject to heightened cash monitoring if composite score <1.5 (HCM1 for score 1.0-1.4; HCM2 for score <1.0); (ii) reimbursement payment method if HCM2 (institution disburses from own funds, then requests reimbursement); (iii) enhanced reporting requirements; (iv) subject to program reviews and site visits; (v) cannot expand eligibility (add locations, programs) without prior Department approval.

#### 7. Cohort Default Rate - Inherited Performance

Midwest University's **three-year cohort default rate (CDR)** of **6.4%** (FY2021) is well below the 30% threshold that triggers sanctions. Historical trend shows improvement: 8.1% → 7.2% → 6.4%. This provides **23.6 percentage point cushion** before reaching the 30% threshold that triggers loss of Pell Grant eligibility after three consecutive years ≥30%.

**CDR Inheritance Post-Acquisition**: Under 34 CFR § 668.203, when an institution undergoes change of ownership, the Department calculates CDR for the "successor institution" using **combined data** including borrowers from **pre-acquisition cohorts**. American Education Holdings inherits MU's historical CDR performance. It takes multiple years for pre-acquisition cohorts to "age out" of the calculation. This inheritance mechanism means AEH benefits from MU's strong CDR performance (6.4%) for several years post-closing, providing cushion against potential increases if operational changes affect student success or debt management.

**CDR Thresholds and Sanctions**: (a) **≥30% for 3 consecutive years**: Loss of FFEL, Direct Loan, and **Pell Grant eligibility** 30 days after notice; ineligibility lasts remainder of fiscal year plus next 2 fiscal years. (b) **>40% single year**: Loss of FFEL and Direct Loan eligibility (but not Pell) 30 days after notice. (c) **≥30% for 2 consecutive years**: Must establish default prevention task force, submit default management plan, may be placed on provisional certification. (d) **≥30% single year**: Must create default prevention task force and submit plan.

**Risk Assessment**: **LOW RISK** for CDR violations post-acquisition, assuming: (i) admission standards maintained (no lowering of academic preparation requirements to boost enrollment); (ii) student support services continued (advising, tutoring, career services, financial literacy); (iii) financial aid counseling robust (entrance and exit counseling emphasizing repayment obligations); and (iv) no dramatic enrollment mix shift toward higher-risk populations. To reach 30% threshold would require near-quadrupling of current default rate, which would signal catastrophic operational failures.

### C. Critical Transaction Structuring Decisions

#### Decision 1: Debt Placement (Holdco vs. Institutional)

**Option A: Holdco Debt (Recommended)**
- Structure: American Education Holdings LLC borrows $700M at Holdco level; MU receives equity investment
- MU Balance Sheet Impact: None (debt not on MU books)
- Composite Score Impact: Preserved at ~2.3 (financially responsible)
- LOC Requirement: None
- Cash Flow: MU may pay management fees or dividends to AEH Holdco for debt service
- Regulatory Risk: Medium (Department may scrutinize related-party transactions, challenge substance over form)

**Option B: Institutional Debt (Not Recommended)**
- Structure: MU borrows acquisition debt or guarantees Holdco debt
- MU Balance Sheet Impact: $500M-$700M debt liability recognized
- Composite Score Impact: Declines to 0.8-1.6 range
- LOC Requirement: $18.2M (if score 1.0-1.4) to $45.5M (if score <1.0)
- Cash Flow: MU directly services acquisition debt from operations
- Regulatory Risk: Low (straightforward debt recognition) but high financial responsibility risk

**Recommended Structure**: Holdco debt with **equity infusion** to MU. AEH raises $700M debt at Holdco level, contributes $200M-$300M equity to MU, uses MU equity stake as collateral. MU's balance sheet shows equity investment but no debt. MU pays dividends to AEH (within reasonable limits) for debt service. Department likely to accept if: (i) MU maintains financial autonomy; (ii) dividend payments do not impair operations; (iii) MU retains reserves for educational mission; and (iv) no guarantee or related-party arrangements that effectively transfer risk to MU.

#### Decision 2: HLC Application Timing

**Option A: Early Engagement (Recommended)**
- Timeline: Begin informal HLC discussions 6-9 months before anticipated signing
- Advantages: (i) Address concerns early; (ii) build rapport with HLC staff; (iii) refine application before formal submission; (iv) align signing with Board meeting schedule
- Disadvantages: (i) Extends pre-signing period; (ii) potential information leakage before definitive agreement

**Option B: Post-Signing Application**
- Timeline: Submit HLC application within 30-60 days of signing definitive agreement
- Advantages: (i) Faster to market; (ii) definitive transaction terms finalized before HLC review
- Disadvantages: (i) Closing delayed 6-9 months for HLC review; (ii) financing commitments may expire; (iii) less opportunity to address concerns; (iv) Board meeting misalignment risk

**Recommendation**: Begin **informal pre-application consultation** with HLC 6 months before signing, submit **formal application** within 30 days of signing, target **HLC Board approval** at meeting 6-8 months post-signing. This balances early engagement benefits with transaction momentum.

#### Decision 3: Closing Conditions and Outside Date

**Recommended Definitive Agreement Structure**:
- **Condition Precedent**: HLC change of control approval and Department 90-day notice completion
- **Outside Date**: 12-18 months from signing (accommodates HLC Board meeting schedule and potential delays)
- **Financing Commitment**: Debt commitment letter with extensions to match outside date
- **Material Adverse Effect Carve-Out**: Exclude predictable regulatory developments (LOC requirements, provisional certification, HCM) from MAC definition
- **Termination Fee**: Consider reverse termination fee if AEH fails to obtain financing (protects MU from financing risk)

### D. Regulatory Approval Probability and Risk Mitigation

#### HLC Change of Control Approval: 75% Probability

**Success Factors**: (1) Robust financial projections showing sustainable debt service and continued investment; (2) mission continuity commitments (academic programs, faculty governance, student support); (3) governance structure retaining academic/mission focus; (4) early stakeholder engagement (faculty, students, alumni); (5) transparent communication about for-profit conversion rationale.

**Risk Factors**: (1) Philosophical opposition to nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion; (2) concerns about leveraged buyout sustainability; (3) AEH lack of track record in comprehensive university sector; (4) student advocacy group opposition; (5) precedent concerns (HLC approval could open floodgates).

**Mitigation**: (1) Engage HLC 6-9 months before formal application; (2) prepare comprehensive mission continuity plan with measurable commitments; (3) highlight AEH's operational expertise and investment capacity; (4) proactively address stakeholder concerns through town halls, Q&A sessions; (5) cite peer institution examples (if available) of successful conversions.

#### DOE Financial Responsibility: 95% Probability (with Holdco Debt)

**Success Factors**: (1) Holdco debt structure preserves composite score ≥1.5; (2) timely submission of complete documentation; (3) no related-party transaction concerns; (4) clean owner background checks; (5) compliance history at other AEH institutions.

**Risk Factors**: (1) Department "looks through" Holdco structure to impute debt to MU; (2) composite score calculation differs from institution's projections; (3) related-party management fees deemed excessive; (4) owner financial responsibility issues (AEH principals).

**Mitigation**: (1) Pre-calculate composite score with Department's Financial Analysis Division before closing; (2) obtain independent audit of same-day balance sheet; (3) document arm's-length nature of related-party transactions; (4) prepare LOC facility ($18.2M) as contingency even if expect score ≥1.5; (5) maintain transparent communication with Department throughout process.

#### 90/10 Rule Compliance: 95% Probability

**Success Factors**: (1) Current 73.2% non-federal revenue provides enormous cushion; (2) stable enrollment mix; (3) mature institution with diversified revenue base; (4) strong market position in Indianapolis.

**Risk Factors**: (1) Enrollment decline forcing increased reliance on Pell students; (2) tuition pricing changes affecting aid mix; (3) loss of international students or executive education revenue; (4) economic recession affecting ability to pay.

**Mitigation**: (1) Implement quarterly 90/10 monitoring dashboard; (2) diversify revenue through corporate partnerships, online programs, executive education; (3) maintain enrollment management discipline; (4) avoid aggressive tuition discounting that increases federal aid dependency; (5) set internal threshold (e.g., 80%) triggering strategic review if approached.

#### CDR Compliance: 98% Probability

**Success Factors**: (1) Current 6.4% CDR with improving trend; (2) 23.6 percentage point cushion; (3) established student support infrastructure; (4) inherited performance provides multi-year buffer.

**Risk Factors**: (1) Admission standards lowered to boost enrollment; (2) student support services cut to reduce costs; (3) enrollment mix shifts toward higher-risk populations; (4) economic recession affecting graduate employment.

**Mitigation**: (1) Maintain admission standards; (2) preserve student support services; (3) enhance financial literacy programs; (4) implement early intervention for at-risk borrowers; (5) promote income-driven repayment plans.

- Demonstrate 2 years of 90/10 compliance
- Demonstrate 2 years of composite score ≥1.5
- Apply for full certification 90 days before provisional period expires

**Total Timeline Summary**:
- **Signing to Closing**: 8-12 months (HLC approval is critical path)
- **Closing to Provisional Certification**: 3-6 months (TPPPA period)
- **Provisional to Full Certification**: 3-4 years (up to 3 complete award years)
- **Total: Signing to Full Title IV Approval**: 4-5 years

### F. Deal-Breaker Scenarios and Contingency Planning

**Scenario 1: HLC Board Denial (10% Probability)**
- **Impact**: Transaction cannot close (HLC approval is condition precedent)
- **Contingency**: (a) Request reconsideration with additional commitments; (b) appeal to HLC Board (if grounds exist); (c) negotiate purchase price reduction to reflect regulatory delay; (d) alternative: pursue teach-out and closure if reconsideration unsuccessful.

**Scenario 2: Composite Score <1.0 Requiring $45.5M LOC (5% Probability)**
- **Impact**: Material additional closing condition; potential inability to secure LOC facility
- **Contingency**: (a) Restructure debt to Holdco level; (b) infuse additional equity to strengthen balance sheet; (c) obtain LOC facility commitment in advance of closing; (d) negotiate seller financing or deferred consideration to reduce upfront debt; (e) as last resort, renegotiate purchase price.

**Scenario 3: Department Denial of Nonprofit-to-For-Profit Conversion (5% Probability)**
- **Impact**: Institution cannot access Title IV as for-profit; catastrophic for transaction economics
- **Contingency**: (a) Challenge Department determination through administrative appeal; (b) maintain nonprofit status with AEH as supporting organization (if feasible under state law and IRS rules); (c) operate under provisional certification while pursuing administrative remedies; (d) as last resort, unwind transaction if conversion critical to business model.

**Scenario 4: Extended HLC Review Delaying Closing Beyond Financing Commitment (15% Probability)**
- **Impact**: Debt commitment expires before HLC approval; renegotiation required at potentially worse terms
- **Contingency**: (a) Obtain financing commitment with multiple extensions; (b) structure bridge financing to extend runway; (c) negotiate flexible outside date (18 months) with multiple extension options; (d) maintain alternative financing sources.

### G. Conclusions and Action Items

**Transaction Viability**: The Project Athena acquisition is **regulatorily feasible** but presents **moderate to high execution risk** due to lengthy HLC approval process (6-9 months, condition precedent to closing) and potential composite score deterioration triggering letter of credit requirements ($18.2M-$45.5M). Transaction economics depend heavily on **debt structure** (Holdco vs. institutional level) and **HLC approval probability** (75% estimated with robust application).

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. **Early HLC engagement** (6-9 months pre-signing) to preview transaction and address concerns
2. **Holdco debt structure** to preserve institutional composite score ≥1.5 and avoid LOC
3. **Mission continuity commitments** to satisfy HLC Board that for-profit conversion preserves educational quality
4. **Financial viability demonstration** showing sustainable debt service and continued investment
5. **Stakeholder communication** to build support and mitigate opposition (faculty, students, alumni, local community)

**Immediate Action Items**:
1. Engage HLC informally to discuss transaction structure and timeline (Month -6)
2. Model composite score with multiple debt structures using Appendix B methodology (Month -5)
3. Retain higher education M&A counsel experienced with Title IV transactions (Month -5)
4. Conduct due diligence on AEH's track record with other portfolio institutions (Month -4)
5. Prepare preliminary HLC application including mission continuity plan (Month -3)
6. Structure definitive agreement with HLC approval condition precedent and 12-18 month outside date (Month 0)
7. Submit formal HLC application within 30 days of signing (Month 1)
8. Arrange LOC facility ($18.2M) as contingency even if expect score ≥1.5 (Month 1-2)
9. Engage audit firm for same-day balance sheet (Month 3)
10. Monitor HLC review process and address information requests promptly (Months 2-8)

**Risk-Adjusted Transaction Probability**: Considering all regulatory gates and execution risks, the probability of successful transaction closing with Title IV eligibility preserved is estimated at **65-70%**. Primary risks: (1) HLC denial (10%); (2) financial responsibility failure requiring uneconomical LOC (5%); (3) timeline delays causing financing/business plan issues (15-20%). With robust preparation, early engagement, and strategic debt structuring, probability can be increased to **75-80%**.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Change of Ownership - Definition and Triggers (34 CFR § 600.31)

#### 1. Statutory and Regulatory Framework

**Change of Ownership - Institutional Eligibility Cessation**: Under 34 CFR § 600.31, when a private nonprofit, private for-profit, or public institution undergoes a change in ownership that results in a change in control, it **ceases to qualify as an eligible institution** upon that change.¹

**Definition**: A change of ownership that results in a change in control includes **any change by which a person acquires or loses the ability to control the institution**.² The regulations provide that for purposes of this section, control means the ability to significantly influence or direct the actions or policies of an institution.³

#### 2. Triggering Events for Private Nonprofit Institutions

For **private nonprofit institutions** (like Midwest University), a change of ownership resulting in a change of control occurs when:⁴

- **Change in governance structure**: A change occurs in the identity of those who have the power or authority to appoint members of the institution's governing body, or a change occurs in the composition of the governing body sufficient to constitute a change in control over the institution.

- **Change through corporate transactions**: A nonprofit institution is merged with, consolidated with, or absorbed by another nonprofit or for-profit institution.

- **Transfer of control through asset sales**: A nonprofit institution's governing board enters into a contract to sell or transfer most or all of the institution's assets or liabilities to another person or entity.

- **Third-party control**: A nonprofit institution enters into a written arrangement under which another entity exercises substantial control over the institution.

**Critical Application to Project Athena**: The proposed $780M acquisition of Midwest University (private nonprofit 501(c)(3)) by American Education Holdings LLC (for-profit private equity) constitutes a **change of ownership resulting in a change of control** under 34 CFR § 600.31(b), specifically because:
- The transaction involves a for-profit entity acquiring a nonprofit institution
- The acquisition will result in change of governance and control structure
- The for-profit acquirer will exercise substantial control over the institution post-transaction

#### 3. Recertification Requirement

**Mandatory Recertification**: To reestablish eligibility and resume participation in Title IV programs after a change in ownership and control, the institution must demonstrate that it satisfies all applicable requirements in §§ 600.4, 600.5, and 600.6, and qualifies to be certified to participate under 34 CFR part 668, subpart B.⁵

**No Automatic Continuation**: The institution cannot assume continued eligibility. The change of ownership triggers a complete review of institutional eligibility as if the institution were a new applicant for Title IV participation.⁶

### B. Financial Responsibility Standards and Composite Score (34 CFR § 668.171-668.174)

#### 1. Statutory Requirement for Financial Responsibility

To participate in Title IV, HEA programs, an institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that it is **financially responsible** under the standards established in 34 CFR Part 668, Subpart L.⁷ The Department uses a quantitative methodology based on audited financial statements to assess whether an institution has the financial resources to provide educational services and meet financial commitments.⁸

#### 2. Composite Score Calculation Methodology

**Three-Ratio System**: The Secretary determines an institution's composite score by calculating three financial ratios and applying a strength factor algorithm to each:⁹

1. **Primary Reserve Ratio**: Measures the institution's viability and liquidity
2. **Equity Ratio**: Measures the institution's capital resources and ability to borrow
3. **Net Income Ratio**: Measures the institution's profitability

**Calculation Process** (34 CFR § 668.172):¹⁰

Step 1: Calculate the result of the Primary Reserve, Equity, and Net Income ratios using financial statement data

Step 2: Calculate the strength factor score for each ratio by using the corresponding algorithm (contained in Appendices A and B to Subpart L)

Step 3: Calculate the weighted score for each ratio by multiplying the strength factor score by its corresponding weighting percentage

Step 4: Sum the resulting weighted scores to arrive at the composite score

Step 5: Round the composite score to one digit after the decimal point

#### 3. Weighting Percentages by Institution Type

The weighting percentages differ based on institutional tax status:¹¹

**Private Nonprofit Institutions** (Appendix B to Subpart L):
- Primary Reserve Ratio: **40%**
- Equity Ratio: **40%**
- Net Income Ratio: **20%**

**Proprietary (For-Profit) Institutions** (Appendix A to Subpart L):
- Primary Reserve Ratio: **30%**
- Equity Ratio: **40%**
- Net Income Ratio: **30%**

**Critical Application to Project Athena**: Midwest University is currently a private nonprofit institution subject to the nonprofit weighting (40/40/20). **However, post-acquisition by American Education Holdings (for-profit), the institution will be reclassified as proprietary and subject to the for-profit weighting (30/40/30)**, which places greater emphasis on profitability (net income ratio).

#### 4. Composite Score Thresholds and Consequences

**Financially Responsible Zone** (Score ≥ 1.5):¹²
- Institutions scoring 1.5 to 3.0 are considered financially responsible
- No additional financial oversight required
- Full participation in Title IV programs with advance payment method

**"Zone" Status** (Score 1.0 to 1.4):¹³
- Institutions are considered "not financially responsible" but may continue participating under alternative standards
- Must comply with **Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 (HCM1)** under 34 CFR § 668.162(d)(1)
- May be required to submit letter of credit equal to at least **10% of prior year Title IV funds**
- Subject to provisional certification

**Not Financially Responsible** (Score < 1.0):¹⁴
- Institutions fail financial responsibility standards
- Must provide financial protection (letter of credit or cash) equal to at least **25% of prior year Title IV funds** or amount determined by Department
- Subject to **Heightened Cash Monitoring 2 (HCM2)** under 34 CFR § 668.162(d)(2) (reimbursement payment method)
- May face loss of Title IV eligibility

#### 5. Financial Ratio Definitions for Nonprofit Institutions

**Primary Reserve Ratio** (Appendix B):¹⁵
- Numerator: Expendable Net Assets
- Denominator: Total Expenses
- **Measures**: The institution's ability to support operations from expendable resources

**Equity Ratio** (Appendix B):¹⁶
- Numerator: Modified Equity (Net Assets)
- Denominator: Modified Assets
- **Measures**: The institution's capital cushion and leverage

**Net Income Ratio** (Appendix B):¹⁷
- Numerator: Change in Net Assets Without Donor Restrictions
- Denominator: Total Revenue Without Donor Restrictions
- **Measures**: Operating profitability and sustainability

#### 6. Impact of Acquisition Debt on Composite Score

**Critical Risk Factor**: The $780M acquisition price will significantly impact Midwest University's composite score depending on the debt/equity structure of the financing.

**Equity Ratio Impact**: If American Education Holdings finances the acquisition with substantial debt at the institutional level, the Equity Ratio will deteriorate because:¹⁸
- **Modified Equity (numerator) decreases**: Addition of $300M-$700M in debt obligations reduces net assets
- **Modified Assets (denominator) increases**: Cash or other consideration increases assets, but net effect is leverage increase

**Primary Reserve Ratio Impact**: Acquisition-related debt service increases annual expenses, reducing the Primary Reserve Ratio:¹⁹
- **Total Expenses (denominator) increases**: Interest expense and debt service requirements
- **Expendable Net Assets (numerator) may decrease**: If operating losses occur due to debt service burden

**Modeling Scenarios** (assuming current composite score of 2.3):

| Debt Amount | Estimated Post-Acquisition Composite Score | Zone Status | LOC Requirement |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| $300M | 1.8 - 2.1 | Financially Responsible | None |
| $500M | 1.3 - 1.6 | Zone / Borderline | 10% (~$18.2M) |
| $700M | 0.8 - 1.2 | Not Financially Responsible | 25% (~$45.5M) |

**Note**: Actual impact depends on debt terms (interest rate, amortization schedule), transaction structure (asset purchase vs. stock purchase), and whether debt is placed at Holdco level or institutional level.

#### 7. 2023 Final Rule - Enhanced Financial Responsibility Standards

On **October 31, 2023**, the Department of Education published a Final Rule (88 Fed. Reg. 74568) significantly revising financial responsibility, administrative capability, and certification requirements, **effective July 1, 2024**.²⁰

**Key Changes Affecting Change of Ownership Transactions**:²¹

a) **New Financial Tests for Owners**: The rule imposes new financial responsibility tests on owners and entities exercising substantial control over institutions

b) **Stricter Conditions Post-Change of Control**: Institutions face heightened financial oversight following ownership changes, including:
   - Mandatory financial protection (letter of credit/cash) for institutions not financially responsible
   - Extended provisional certification periods (up to 3 complete award years)
   - Enhanced reporting requirements

c) **Triggering Events Expanded**: The 2023 rule expands circumstances triggering letter of credit requirements, including:
   - Composite score below 1.5 following change of ownership
   - Withdrawal of owner's certification of financial statements
   - State or federal enforcement actions
   - Lawsuits resulting in monetary judgments exceeding $1M

d) **Same-Day Balance Sheet Requirement**: Proprietary institutions must submit an audited "same-day" balance sheet as of the date of change in ownership; nonprofits converting to for-profit must submit audited statement of financial position²²

### C. 90/10 Rule for For-Profit Institutions (20 U.S.C. § 1094(d); 34 CFR § 668.28)

#### 1. Statutory Framework and Purpose

The **90/10 rule**, codified at 20 U.S.C. § 1094(d), applies **exclusively to proprietary (for-profit) institutions** of higher education.²³ The rule requires that proprietary institutions derive **at least 10% of their revenue from non-federal sources** to remain eligible for Title IV federal student aid programs.²⁴

**Policy Rationale**: The rule is designed to ensure institutional market viability by requiring schools to generate a portion of their revenue from tuition-paying students or other non-federal sources, rather than relying entirely on federal government aid.²⁵ If an institution cannot attract at least 10% non-federal revenue, Congress determined it lacks sufficient market validation to justify continued federal investment.²⁶

**Critical Application to Project Athena**: This rule **does not currently apply** to Midwest University as a private nonprofit 501(c)(3). However, **upon acquisition by American Education Holdings (for-profit), Midwest University will be reclassified as a proprietary institution** and immediately becomes subject to the 90/10 rule.²⁷

#### 2. Revenue Calculation Methodology

**Cash Basis Accounting Required**: Institutions must "use the cash basis of accounting" for 90/10 calculations, meaning funds are counted in the fiscal year in which they are applied to a student's account.²⁸

**Formula**:
```
Title IV Federal Revenue
─────────────────────── ≤ 90%
Total Revenue
```

**What Counts as Federal Revenue (the "90" side)**:²⁹

Prior to 2023, only Title IV HEA funds counted as federal revenue. The **American Rescue Plan Act of 2021** (P.L. 117-2) **expanded the definition** to include:

- **Title IV HEA Programs**: Federal Pell Grants, Direct Loans (subsidized and unsubsidized), PLUS Loans, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG)
- **GI Bill Benefits**: Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33), Montgomery GI Bill (Chapters 30 & 1606), Vocational Rehabilitation (Chapter 31), Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (Chapter 35) - **Added by ARPA effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023**³⁰
- **Department of Defense Tuition Assistance**: Military tuition assistance programs - **Added by ARPA effective January 1, 2023**³¹

**What Counts as Non-Federal Revenue (the "10" side)**:³²

- Tuition paid from personal resources (student or family)
- Private loans (not federally guaranteed)
- Institutional scholarships and grants
- State grants (non-federal)
- Employer tuition reimbursement
- Third-party private payments
- Revenue from non-Title IV eligible programs that meet quality standards

**Exclusions from Both Numerator and Denominator**:³³
- Federal work-study earnings
- Funds from Part C (Federal Work-Study), subpart 4 of part A (Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants)
- Refunded amounts
- Charges for books/supplies unless included in tuition

#### 3. American Rescue Plan Act - Closing the "90/10 Loophole" (Effective 2023)

**Historical Loophole**: Prior to 2023, GI Bill and military tuition assistance benefits were **excluded** from the 90/10 calculation, allowing proprietary institutions to count these federal funds as "non-federal revenue."³⁴ This created perverse incentives for aggressive veteran recruitment.³⁵

**ARPA Amendment** (P.L. 117-2, § 2012):³⁶
- **Effective Date**: Institutional fiscal years beginning on or after **January 1, 2023**
- **Impact**: GI Bill and DoD TA now count as federal revenue in the numerator
- **Definition Change**: "Federal education assistance funds" redefined as "federal funds disbursed or delivered to or on behalf of a student to be used to attend such institution"

**Post-ARPA, the rule effectively becomes "85/15"** for institutions with significant veteran populations, as GI Bill benefits now count as federal funds.³⁷

#### 4. Sanctions for Non-Compliance

**Single Year Violation (> 90% federal revenue)**:³⁸
- Institution enters **provisional eligibility status** for the following two fiscal years
- Must report 90/10 calculation quarterly to Department
- Subject to heightened oversight and potential program reviews

**Two Consecutive Years Violation**:³⁹
- Institution **loses eligibility** for Title IV programs for at least **two fiscal years**
- To regain eligibility, institution must:
  - Demonstrate compliance for at least two consecutive fiscal years without Title IV participation
  - Reapply for Title IV certification
  - Meet all eligibility and financial responsibility requirements

**Department Reporting**: The Secretary must publish non-compliance on the **College Navigator website** and submit annual reports to Congress detailing each proprietary institution's revenue percentages.⁴⁰

#### 5. Application to Midwest University Post-Acquisition

**Current Status** (as nonprofit):
- Total Revenue: $680M
- Title IV Revenue: $182M (26.8% of total revenue)
  - Pell Grants: $38M
  - Direct Loans: $144M
- **Current 90/10 Status**: Rule does NOT apply (nonprofit exemption)

**Post-Acquisition Status** (as for-profit proprietary institution):
- **90/10 Rule APPLIES immediately upon conversion to for-profit status**⁴¹
- Current Title IV percentage: **26.8%** (well below 90% threshold)
- **Substantial compliance cushion**: MU currently derives 73.2% of revenue from non-federal sources

**Risk Assessment**: **LOW RISK** for 90/10 compliance, provided:

1. **Revenue mix remains stable**: Current 26.8% Title IV ratio provides 63.2 percentage point cushion
2. **No dramatic enrollment shifts**: Significant increase in Pell-eligible students or decline in full-pay students could increase federal revenue percentage
3. **Tuition pricing maintained**: Dramatic tuition increases without proportional financial aid increases would reduce Title IV percentage
4. **GI Bill/Military enrollment minimal**: MU's student body does not appear heavily veteran-dependent (institution details do not indicate military focus)

**Monitoring Requirements Post-Conversion**:⁴²
- Annual 90/10 calculation due with audited financial statements
- Quarterly reporting if institution exceeds 90% threshold in any year
- Cash basis accounting documentation for all Title IV disbursements
- Separate tracking of revenue from Title IV-ineligible programs (if counting toward non-federal revenue)

#### 6. Special Considerations for Nonprofit-to-For-Profit Conversions

**Department Scrutiny**: The 2023 Final Rule imposes additional requirements on institutions converting from nonprofit to for-profit status:⁴³

- **Continued 90/10 Compliance Requirement**: Institution must demonstrate 90/10 compliance **for at least two complete consecutive fiscal years** after conversion before Department will approve nonprofit-to-for-profit status change for Title IV purposes⁴⁴

- **Prohibition on Nonprofit Marketing**: Institution cannot advertise as a nonprofit until the Department approves the conversion for Title IV purposes⁴⁵

- **Enhanced Reporting**: Additional reporting requirements on revenue sources, ownership structure, and related-party transactions⁴⁶

**Timeline Implication**: If MU converts to for-profit status upon acquisition closing in 2025, the institution must demonstrate 90/10 compliance through **fiscal years 2025 and 2026** before receiving full approval of the conversion.

### D. Accrediting Agency Recognition Standards (34 CFR Part 602)

#### 1. Federal Recognition of Accrediting Agencies

Under the Higher Education Act, institutional accreditation by a **recognized accrediting agency** is a **mandatory prerequisite** for Title IV eligibility.⁴⁷ The Department of Education recognizes accrediting agencies under criteria established in 34 CFR Part 602.⁴⁸

**Higher Learning Commission (HLC)**: Midwest University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, a regional accrediting agency recognized by the Department under 34 CFR Part 602.⁴⁹ HLC's recognition status means its accreditation standards and processes are subject to federal oversight and must comply with Department recognition criteria.⁵⁰

#### 2. Substantive Change Requirements - Change of Control

**Federal Mandate for Accreditor Review**: Under 34 CFR § 602.22(a)(1)(ii)(B), recognized accrediting agencies **must** have policies requiring approval of substantive changes, including **"any change in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution."**⁵¹

**Prior Approval Required**: HLC policy (INST.G.20.010) mandates that an institution **must receive HLC approval prior to undergoing** a Change of Control, Structure or Organization.⁵² Consummating the transaction without prior HLC approval results in **loss of accreditation**.⁵³

#### 3. Change of Control Evaluation Process

**Application Requirement**: The institution must submit an **Application for Change of Control, Structure or Organization** containing:⁵⁴
- Detailed transaction description and structure
- Information on new owners and controlling entities
- Financial projections and viability analysis
- Evidence of continued mission compatibility
- Governance structure documentation

**Peer Review Evaluation**: HLC conducts a **Change of Control Evaluation** through peer reviewers, which may include:⁵⁵
- Consultation with HLC staff
- Engagement of external experts (transactional attorneys, corporate finance experts)
- **On-site Change of Control Visit** (at HLC's discretion)

**Board Decision Authority**: The Change of Control Report is sent to **HLC's Board of Trustees** for review and **final action**.⁵⁶ The Board has **sole decision-making authority** regarding whether to approve or deny the application.⁵⁷

#### 4. Site Visit Requirements Under Federal Regulations

**Six-Month Site Visit Mandate**: Under 34 CFR § 602.22(a)(2)(iii), accrediting agencies "must undertake a site visit to a new branch campus or **following a change of ownership or control as soon as practicable, but no later than six months**, after the establishment of that campus or the change of ownership or control."⁵⁸

**HLC Implementation**: While HLC's policies reference on-site visits for change of control, the timing appears discretionary during the application review phase, with **Accredited Change of Control status** (discussed below) potentially triggering the post-consummation six-month visit.⁵⁹

#### 5. Accredited Change of Control Status

**Mandatory Post-Approval Monitoring**: As part of HLC's approval of a Change of Control, the Board **requires** that the institution be placed on **"Accredited Change of Control"** status effective upon consummation of the transaction.⁶⁰

**Duration**: Placement on Accredited Change of Control status shall typically be for **no more than two years**.⁶¹

**Monitoring Activities**: During this period, HLC monitors institutional performance to ensure:⁶²
- Continued compliance with accreditation criteria
- Financial stability and sustainability
- Educational quality maintenance
- Mission integrity preservation

#### 6. HLC Board Meeting Schedule and Timeline Implications

**Board Meeting Frequency**: The HLC Board of Trustees typically meets **three times per year** (February, June, November).⁶³

**Application Processing Timeline**: Based on HLC procedures and industry practice:⁶⁴
- **Pre-application consultation**: 1-3 months (strongly recommended before formal application)
- **Application preparation and submission**: 2-3 months
- **HLC staff and peer review**: 2-4 months
- **Board review and decision**: Occurs at next scheduled Board meeting after review completion

**Total Estimated Timeline**: **6-9 months** from initial consultation to Board decision, depending on:
- Application complexity and completeness
- Transaction structure complexity
- Whether on-site visit is required
- Board meeting schedule alignment

**Critical Path Consideration**: For Project Athena, if the parties seek to close in Q3 2025, the HLC application process should commence **no later than Q4 2024/Q1 2025** to align with a June 2025 or November 2025 Board meeting.

#### 7. Grounds for Denial of Change of Control

HLC may deny a change of control application based on:⁶⁵
- **Financial instability**: Insufficient financial resources to support educational mission post-transaction
- **Mission incompatibility**: Proposed changes inconsistent with institution's accredited mission and Criteria for Accreditation
- **Governance concerns**: Inadequate governance structure or conflicts of interest
- **Educational quality risks**: Concerns about maintaining academic standards and student support
- **Prior performance issues**: New owner's track record with other institutions

### F. Cohort Default Rate Monitoring (34 CFR Part 668, Subpart N)

#### 1. Cohort Default Rate Definition and Calculation

**Three-Year Cohort Default Rate (CDR)**: The Department calculates an institution's CDR by identifying students who received Direct Loans and/or FFEL loans for attendance at the institution and who **entered repayment** during a particular federal fiscal year (October 1 - September 30).⁸⁰

**Default Definition**: A borrower is in default if they are **270 days or more delinquent** on a loan payment.⁸¹

**Calculation Formula**:⁸²
```
Number of borrowers in cohort who default within 3 years
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  = CDR
Total number of borrowers in cohort
```

**Cohort Composition**: A cohort for a fiscal year consists of all current and former students who, during that fiscal year, entered repayment on any Federal Stafford loan, Federal SLS loan, Direct Subsidized loan, or Direct Unsubsidized loan received to attend the institution.⁸³

**Small Cohort Adjustment**: For institutions with **fewer than 30 borrowers** in a cohort, the CDR is calculated by dividing the total number of borrowers in that cohort **and the two most recent prior cohorts** who are in default by the total number of borrowers in all three cohorts.⁸⁴

#### 2. CDR Thresholds and Sanctions

**30% Threshold - Three Consecutive Years** (34 CFR § 668.206(a)):⁸⁵
- Institution **loses eligibility** to participate in FFEL, Direct Loan, and **Federal Pell Grant programs**
- Loss occurs **30 days after** receiving official notice from Department
- Ineligibility lasts **remainder of fiscal year** in which notice received, plus **next two fiscal years**

**40% Threshold - Single Year** (34 CFR § 668.206(b)):⁸⁶
- Institution loses eligibility to participate in **FFEL and Direct Loan programs** (but not Pell Grants)
- Loss occurs **30 days after** receiving notice
- Applies to cohort default rates for fiscal year 2011 or later

**30% Threshold - Two Consecutive Years**:⁸⁷
- Institution must establish **default prevention task force**
- Must develop and submit **default management plan** to Department
- May be placed on **provisional certification**
- Subject to enhanced monitoring

**30% Threshold - Single Year**:⁸⁸
- Institution must create **default prevention task force**
- Must submit default management plan to Department for review

#### 3. Application to Midwest University

**Current CDR Status**:
- FY2021 CDR: **6.4%** (well below 30% threshold)
- Historical trend: 8.1% → 7.2% → 6.4% (improving)
- **Low Risk**: Current CDR provides substantial cushion (23.6 percentage points below 30% threshold)

**Impact of Change of Ownership on CDR**:⁸⁹
- CDR calculation **continues** to include borrowers from pre-acquisition cohorts
- Department calculates CDR for "successor institution" using combined data
- New owner inherits historical CDR performance
- Takes multiple years for pre-acquisition cohorts to "age out" of calculation

**Post-Acquisition CDR Management Priorities**:⁹⁰
- Maintain robust student financial literacy programs
- Provide default prevention counseling (entrance and exit)
- Monitor borrower repayment patterns
- Implement early intervention for at-risk borrowers
- Consider income-driven repayment plan promotion

**Risk Assessment**: **LOW RISK** for CDR sanctions post-acquisition, provided:
- Admission standards maintained (academic preparedness)
- Student support services continued
- Financial aid counseling robust
- No dramatic shift toward higher-risk student populations

### G. Letter of Credit Requirements (34 CFR § 668.175, 668.176)

#### 1. Letter of Credit Triggering Events for Change of Ownership

Under 34 CFR § 668.176, institutions undergoing change of ownership may be required to provide **financial protection** in the form of a letter of credit or cash in amounts ranging from **10% to 25% of prior year Title IV funds** depending on post-transaction financial responsibility status.⁹¹

**10% Letter of Credit** (34 CFR § 668.175(d), 668.176(a)):⁹²
- Required when institution is **"in the zone"** (composite score 1.0 - 1.4)
- Amount: Not less than **10% of prior year Title IV funds** or amount determined by Department
- Institution must follow zone requirements including heightened cash monitoring

**25% Letter of Credit** (34 CFR § 668.176(c)):⁹³
- Required when:
  - Institution **fails financial responsibility** (composite score < 1.0), or
  - Entity where no single new owner obtains control, but combined ownership of new owners equals or exceeds existing ownership share, or
  - Institution fails to meet certain post-transaction requirements
- Amount: At least **25% of Title IV funds** received during most recently completed fiscal year, or Department-determined amount

**Application to Project Athena** (MU's prior year Title IV: $182M):
- **10% LOC**: $18.2 million (if composite score 1.0-1.4 post-transaction)
- **25% LOC**: $45.5 million (if composite score < 1.0 post-transaction)

#### 2. Letter of Credit Terms and Conditions

**Irrevocable Letter of Credit**: Must be **irrevocable** and payable to the Department of Education.⁹⁴

**Duration**: Letter of credit must remain in effect until triggering event has ceased or been cured for a period of **two years**, as documented in audited financial statements.⁹⁵

**Call Events**: Department may draw on letter of credit upon:⁹⁶
- Institution's loss of eligibility or certification
- Institution's closure or teach-out requirement
- Failure to provide required financial statements or audits
- Administrative capability violation
- Other triggering events specified in regulations

#### 3. Holdco Debt Structure to Avoid Letter of Credit

**Critical Structuring Consideration**: If acquisition debt is placed at **holding company level** rather than institution level, the institution's financial statements may not reflect the debt, potentially preserving the composite score above 1.5 threshold.⁹⁷

**Structuring Options**:
- **Holdco Debt** (Recommended): American Education Holdings borrows $700M at Holdco level; MU's balance sheet unaffected; composite score preserved at 2.3
- **Institutional Debt** (Risky): MU borrows or guarantees acquisition debt; debt appears on MU financial statements; composite score declines to zone/not responsible range

**Regulatory Risk**: Department may scrutinize related-party transactions and Holdco guarantees that effectively transfer risk to institution.⁹⁸

## V. INTEGRATED REGULATORY TIMELINE ANALYSIS

### A. Critical Path - Transaction Closing Dependencies

The **longest pole in the tent** for Project Athena is the **HLC Change of Control approval**, which must be obtained **prior to closing**. Department of Education recertification can proceed concurrently post-closing via TPPPA, but HLC approval is a **condition precedent** to consummation.

### B. Phased Timeline for Regulatory Approvals

**Phase 1: Pre-Signing Preparation** (Months 1-2)
- Engage HLC informally to discuss transaction structure
- Conduct preliminary due diligence on financial responsibility impact
- Model composite score scenarios based on debt/equity structure
- Prepare draft HLC application materials

**Phase 2: Post-Signing / Pre-HLC Application** (Months 3-4)
- Execute definitive agreement with HLC approval as condition precedent
- Submit formal HLC Change of Control application
- Begin DOE 90-day advance notice preparation
- Finalize transaction structure to optimize composite score

**Phase 3: HLC Review Period** (Months 5-8)
- HLC staff review and peer evaluation (2-4 months)
- Possible on-site visit by HLC evaluation team
- Address any HLC information requests or concerns
- Align closing date with HLC Board meeting schedule (Feb/June/Nov)

**Phase 4: HLC Board Decision** (Month 8-9)
- HLC Board reviews Change of Control Report at scheduled meeting
- Board votes to approve or deny application
- If approved, HLC issues approval letter with effective date upon closing

**Phase 5: DOE Notification and Closing** (Month 9)
- Submit 90-day advance notice to Department (if not already submitted)
- Close transaction within 90 days of DOE notice
- Submit 10-day post-closing E-App application
- Receive TPPPA from Department (allows continued Title IV participation)

**Phase 6: DOE Recertification** (Months 10-12)
- Submit same-day audited financial statements
- Department calculates composite score
- Department issues letter of credit determination (if applicable)
- Department issues provisional certification (3 award years maximum)
- Continue month-to-month TPPPA extensions until provisional PPA issued

**Phase 7: Post-Closing Monitoring** (Years 2-4)
- Complete provisional certification period (up to 3 complete award years)
- Maintain Accredited Change of Control status with HLC (up to 2 years)
- Demonstrate 90/10 compliance for 2 consecutive fiscal years
- Maintain composite score ≥ 1.5 for 2 consecutive fiscal years
- Apply for full certification before provisional period expires

### C. Optimistic vs. Realistic vs. Conservative Timelines

| Milestone | Optimistic | Realistic | Conservative |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **HLC Application to Approval** | 6 months | 8 months | 12 months |
| **DOE 90-Day Notice to Closing** | 90 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| **Closing to TPPPA** | 2 weeks | 4 weeks | 6 weeks |
| **TPPPA to Provisional PPA** | 3 months | 5 months | 9 months |
| **Total: Signing to Closing** | 6 months | 8 months | 12 months |
| **Total: Signing to Full Certification** | 3.5 years | 4 years | 5 years |

### D. Risk Factors Affecting Timeline

**HLC Risk Factors** (Could Delay or Deny Approval):
- Insufficient financial resources demonstrated
- Mission incompatibility concerns (for-profit conversion of nonprofit)
- Governance structure inadequacies
- American Education Holdings' track record with other institutions
- Student outcome concerns

**DOE Risk Factors** (Could Delay Recertification):
- Composite score below 1.0 (triggers 25% LOC and enhanced scrutiny)
- Incomplete or inaccurate financial documentation
- Related-party transaction concerns
- Owner financial responsibility issues
- Audit findings or compliance issues at other AEH portfolio institutions

---

## VI. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### A. Financial Responsibility Composite Score Risk

**RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM TO HIGH** (depending on debt structure)

**Risk Scenario**: If acquisition financing includes $500M+ of debt at institutional level, Midwest University's composite score will decline from 2.3 to potentially < 1.5, triggering:
- Letter of credit requirement ($18.2M for zone, $45.5M for not responsible)
- Heightened Cash Monitoring (HCM1 or HCM2)
- Reimbursement payment method (instead of advance payment)
- Enhanced Department scrutiny

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Structure debt at Holdco level**: Place all or majority of acquisition debt at American Education Holdings LLC level, not Midwest University level
2. **Equity financing**: Maximize equity component of purchase price to minimize leverage at institutional level
3. **Same-day balance sheet optimization**: Time equity infusions to strengthen balance sheet as of closing date
4. **Pre-calculate and model**: Obtain Department's Financial Analysis Division input on proposed structure before signing
5. **Letter of credit pre-arrangement**: If LOC required, arrange facility in advance of closing to avoid delays

**Probability Assessment**:
- Composite score ≥ 1.5 (No LOC): **70%** (if Holdco debt structure)
- Composite score 1.0-1.4 (10% LOC): **25%** (if moderate institutional debt)
- Composite score < 1.0 (25% LOC): **5%** (if heavy institutional debt)

### B. HLC Change of Control Approval Risk

**RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM**

**Risk Scenario**: HLC Board denies Change of Control application due to:
- Concerns about for-profit conversion of 110-year-old nonprofit institution
- Insufficient demonstration of continued mission commitment
- Financial instability concerns post-leveraged buyout
- American Education Holdings' lack of track record in comprehensive university sector
- Student advocacy group opposition

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Early informal engagement**: Meet with HLC staff 6-9 months before formal application to preview transaction and address concerns
2. **Mission continuity plan**: Demonstrate commitment to preserving academic quality, mission, and values through:
   - Board composition (retain academic/mission-focused trustees)
   - Academic program investment commitments
   - Student support services preservation guarantees
   - Faculty governance continuation
3. **Financial viability demonstration**: Provide robust financial projections showing:
   - Sustainable debt service coverage
   - Continued investment in facilities and programs
   - Reserve building over time
4. **Community engagement**: Proactively engage stakeholders (faculty, students, alumni, local community) to build support
5. **Peer institution precedents**: Research and cite successful nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions in HLC region (if any)

**Probability Assessment**:
- HLC Approval: **75%** (with robust application and early engagement)
- HLC Approval with Conditions: **15%** (e.g., enhanced monitoring, specific commitments required)
- HLC Denial: **10%** (if significant opposition or inadequate demonstration of financial/mission viability)

### C. 90/10 Rule Compliance Risk

**RISK LEVEL: LOW**

**Current Cushion**: MU derives only 26.8% of revenue from Title IV funds, providing **63.2 percentage point cushion** below 90% threshold.

**Risk Scenario**: Enrollment mix shifts toward Pell-eligible students or away from full-pay students, increasing Title IV percentage.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Enrollment management**: Maintain balanced enrollment mix across socioeconomic demographics
2. **Revenue diversification**: Expand non-federal revenue sources (corporate partnerships, executive education, international students, grants)
3. **Tuition pricing strategy**: Avoid aggressive discounting that increases net price for federal aid recipients
4. **Monitoring system**: Implement quarterly 90/10 tracking dashboard
5. **Contingency planning**: If approaching 80%, implement enrollment strategy adjustments

**Probability Assessment**:
- 90/10 Compliance (< 90%): **95%** (substantial cushion)
- 90/10 Violation (single year): **4%** (would require dramatic enrollment shift)
- 90/10 Violation (two consecutive years leading to loss of eligibility): **1%**

### D. Cohort Default Rate Risk

**RISK LEVEL: LOW**

**Current Performance**: FY2021 CDR of 6.4% with improving trend provides **23.6 percentage point cushion** below 30% threshold.

**Risk Scenario**: Post-acquisition changes to admission standards, student support services, or financial aid counseling result in increased defaults.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Maintain admission standards**: Do not lower academic admission requirements to boost enrollment
2. **Preserve student support**: Continue robust academic advising, tutoring, career services
3. **Financial literacy programs**: Enhance entrance and exit counseling for borrowers
4. **Early intervention**: Monitor at-risk students and provide retention support
5. **Repayment plan education**: Promote income-driven repayment options to struggling borrowers

**Probability Assessment**:
- CDR < 30% (compliant): **98%**
- CDR ≥ 30% single year: **2%**
- CDR ≥ 30% three consecutive years (loss of Pell eligibility): **<1%**

### E. Regulatory Timeline Risk

**RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM**

**Risk Scenario**: Transaction signing occurs without adequate runway for HLC approval, forcing delay of closing beyond business plan assumptions.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Front-load HLC process**: Begin informal HLC discussions before signing definitive agreement
