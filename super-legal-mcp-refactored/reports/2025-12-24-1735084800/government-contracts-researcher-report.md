## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This memorandum analyzes federal research grant compliance and export control regulations affecting the proposed $780 million acquisition of Midwest University (MU) by a for-profit entity. MU currently operates as a private nonprofit research university with $68 million in annual research expenditures, of which $52 million (76%) derives from federal grants. The acquisition proposes to convert MU from nonprofit to for-profit status, triggering substantial regulatory complications across two domains: (1) federal grant transferability and compliance, and (2) export control regulations governing defense-related research and foreign national researchers.

**Bottom Line Up Front:** The nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion creates **material transaction risks** totaling $25M-$50M in likely impact over five years, including potential loss of $10M-$20M in non-transferable grants, $8.3M annual indirect cost rate reduction, $1M-$3M export control penalty exposure, and $700K-$1.3M annual compliance cost increases. The transaction remains viable only with: (1) structural solutions such as a nonprofit research subsidiary to preserve restricted grants; (2) federal agency consultations confirming grant transfer eligibility and fundamental research exemption maintenance; and (3) comprehensive export control audits verifying compliance for 28 foreign nationals from high-risk countries. **Minimum 6-9 month timeline** required for regulatory approvals before closing.

### Critical Findings

#### 1. Federal Grant Transferability - $10M-$20M at Risk

**Grant Portfolio:** MU holds 70 active federal grants totaling $52M annually:
- **NIH**: 42 grants, $28M (54% of federal funding)
- **NSF**: 28 awards, $18M (35% of federal funding)
- **DOE**: $4M (8%)
- **DOD**: 2 grants, $2M (4%) - ITAR-controlled

**Non-Transferable Grant Mechanisms:** Critical research reveals that certain NIH grant types are **explicitly restricted to nonprofit/domestic institutions** and **cannot be transferred** to for-profit entities under any circumstances:

- **T32 (Institutional Training Grants):** Domestic nonprofit only
- **K01 (Mentored Research Scientist Development Awards):** Domestic institutions only
- **P40 (Animal Resource Grants):** Domestic institutions only
- **T35 (Short-Term Institutional Research Training Grants):** Domestic nonprofit only

*Regulatory Authority: NIH Grants Policy Statement § 18, "Grants to For-Profit Organizations."*

**Unknown Exposure:** Without a detailed grant mechanism inventory, we cannot quantify what portion of the $28M NIH funding portfolio falls into non-transferable categories. If training and career development grants represent 20-40% of NIH funding (typical for research universities), **$5M-$11M annually is at immediate risk** of loss upon conversion to for-profit status.

**Mitigation Option:** These grants could be preserved by creating a separate 501(c)(3) nonprofit research subsidiary to hold non-transferable awards. However, this structural complexity requires IRS approval and creates operational overhead.

**Research Project Grants (R01, R21):** Most NIH research project grants CAN be transferred to for-profit entities, but with important restrictions:
- **No profit or fee allowed** under grant mechanisms (only allowable for SBIR/STTR)
- Enhanced cost scrutiny and allowability determinations
- Heightened financial conflict of interest (FCOI) management requirements
- Data sharing and publication commitments under increased scrutiny

**NSF Grant Transfers:** NSF awards may be made to for-profit organizations unless specifically excluded by program solicitation. However, transfer requires:
- Prior NSF approval via formal change of institution process (2 CFR § 200.308)
- Demonstration that facilities and resources at new institution support project continuation
- No significant changes in research objectives
- Relinquishing statement from MU and acceptance by acquiring entity

**Enhanced Scrutiny Expected:** NSF will scrutinize whether for-profit acquisition compromises:
- Fundamental research nature of projects
- Broader impacts mission (education, diversity, outreach)
- Data sharing and publication commitments

**Timeline:** Grant transfer process requires **90-120 days** for agency notification plus **60-90 days** for approval processing. Total minimum lead time: **6 months** before closing.

#### 2. Indirect Cost Rate Reduction - $8.3M Annual Impact

**Current Status:** MU has federally negotiated indirect cost rate of **56%** with DHHS Division of Cost Allocation (DCA), generating **$29M annually** in indirect cost recovery (56% × $52M direct costs).

**For-Profit Rate Risk:** Historical data indicates for-profit entities typically negotiate indirect cost rates of **40-50%**, lower than research universities. Factors driving lower rates:
- Commercial activities dilute rate base
- Reduced facilities and administrative (F&A) cost allowability
- Enhanced scrutiny on cost allocation between federal awards and commercial operations

**Financial Impact Scenarios:**
- **Likely scenario** (rate reduced to 50%): $3.1M annual loss
- **Worst case** (rate reduced to 40%): **$8.3M annual loss**
- Five-year impact at worst case: **$41.5M**

**Mitigation:** Negotiate indirect cost rate agreement **before closing** and lock in rate for 2-4 year period. However, DHHS DCA is under no obligation to maintain nonprofit-level rates for for-profit entities.

#### 3. Export Control Compliance - $1M-$3M Penalty Exposure + $700K-$1.3M Annual Costs

**ITAR-Controlled Research:** MU conducts defense-related research under 2 DOD grants ($2M) in materials science and propulsion systems, subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120-130. Current compliance infrastructure includes:
- 2 active Technology Control Plans (TCPs)
- 8 deemed export licenses for foreign nationals
- Export Control Officer (Dr. Patricia Anderson, 1 FTE)

**Prior ITAR Violation (2021):** MU experienced an ITAR violation when a researcher shared controlled technical data with a Chinese postdoctoral researcher without required deemed export license. MU voluntarily self-disclosed to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), which resulted in a **warning letter with no monetary penalty** due to:
- Immediate voluntary disclosure
- Comprehensive cooperation
- Prompt implementation of corrective actions
- No pattern of violations

**Corrective Actions Implemented:**
- Enhanced TCP procedures with additional physical and information security
- Mandatory pre-hire export control screening for all foreign nationals
- Quarterly TCP audits (increased from annual)
- Enhanced training programs for researchers

**Current Penalty Exposure:** As of 2025, ITAR civil penalties are **$1,271,078 per violation** or twice the transaction value, whichever is greater. Criminal penalties include up to 10 years imprisonment and $1M fine per willful violation.

**Aggravating Factors for Future Violations:**
- Prior 2021 warning letter on file with DDTC
- Repeat violations receive reduced mitigation credit for voluntary disclosure
- Recent enforcement trends show DDTC hardening voluntary disclosure policies (per L3Harris 2024 case)
- For-profit status may trigger stricter enforcement scrutiny

**Risk Assessment:** Four years of clean compliance since 2021 incident, but remaining vulnerabilities exist.

#### 4. Foreign National Compliance Gap - CRITICAL FINDING

**Population:** MU employs **28 foreign nationals** (faculty and postdoctoral researchers) from high-risk countries:
- **China:** 12 researchers
- **Iran:** 8 researchers
- **Russia:** 5 researchers
- **Other:** 3 researchers

**Licensed Status:** Only **8 deemed export licenses** are documented for the 28 foreign nationals.

**Compliance Gap:** **Status of 20 foreign nationals without documented licenses is UNKNOWN.** Four possible explanations:

1. **Compliant (fundamental research exemption):** Those 20 individuals work exclusively on fundamental research qualifying for exemption under 22 CFR § 120.11(8) (ITAR) and 15 CFR § 734.8 (EAR), requiring no licenses.

2. **Compliant (EAR99 or uncontrolled):** Those 20 individuals work only with items not on Commerce Control List (EAR99) or with uncontrolled technology requiring no licenses.

3. **Compliant (other exemptions):** Country/technology combinations for those 20 individuals do not trigger license requirements.

4. **NON-COMPLIANT:** Those 20 individuals require but lack deemed export licenses, representing **ongoing violations**.

**Worst-Case Penalty Exposure:** If explanation #4 applies to all 20 unlicensed foreign nationals, penalty exposure could reach **$25.4M** (20 persons × $1,271,078 per violation). Even if only 5-10 individuals represent violations, exposure ranges **$6M-$13M**.

**Countries of Concern Breakdown:**

**Iran (8 researchers):** Comprehensive embargo (E:1 designation) under EAR 15 CFR § 746.7. License required for virtually all exports/reexports to Iran. Very limited exceptions. Iranian nationals working on any ECCN-controlled technology require deemed export licenses. **CRITICAL RISK.**

**Russia (5 researchers):** Comprehensive export restrictions (E:1 designation) since 2022 Ukraine invasion under EAR 15 CFR § 746.5. Russian nationals subject to heightened scrutiny. Entity List includes numerous Russian institutions. **HIGH RISK.**

**China (12 researchers):** Not comprehensively embargoed but extensive controls. Key concerns:
- BIS Entity List includes numerous Chinese universities and research institutes
- 2025 Entity List additions target quantum technology, AI, advanced computing, aerospace research
- Military-Civil Fusion Strategy creates presumption of military end-use
- Collaboration with Entity List institutions prohibited without BIS license
- **HIGH RISK** - particularly for technology research areas matching recent Entity List additions

**Immediate Action Required:** Comprehensive audit of all 28 foreign nationals to:
- Verify current research activities and technology access
- Determine ECCN classification of technology accessed
- Confirm exemption status (fundamental research, EAR99, or other)
- Identify missing licenses and obtain within 90 days
- Screen all 28 individuals against Entity List, Denied Persons List, Unverified List, OFAC SDN List

#### 5. Fundamental Research Exemption - Transaction Outcome-Determinative

**Exemption Framework:** Both ITAR and EAR provide critical exemptions for university fundamental research:

**ITAR Exemption (22 CFR § 120.11(8)):** "Fundamental research" means basic and applied research in science and engineering at accredited U.S. institutions of higher learning where results ordinarily will be published and shared broadly within scientific community.

**EAR Exemption (15 CFR § 734.8):** "Technology" or "software" that arises during or results from fundamental research and is intended to be published is not subject to EAR.

**Exemption Requirements:**
- Research conducted at **accredited university**
- Results **ordinarily published** and shared broadly
- **No restrictions** on publication or dissemination
- **No prepublication review** by sponsor
- Researchers have **not accepted restrictions** for proprietary or national security reasons

**Why Exemption Matters:** The fundamental research exemption is the primary mechanism allowing universities to employ foreign nationals on research projects without obtaining individual deemed export licenses for each person. It dramatically reduces compliance burden and enables open scientific collaboration.

**Impact of For-Profit Conversion:** For-profit status creates multiple challenges to maintaining fundamental research exemption:

| Factor | Nonprofit University | For-Profit MU | Exemption Impact |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Educational mission** | Primary institutional purpose | Secondary to profit motive | ⚠️ Weakens presumption |
| **Publication commitment** | Strong presumption of open publication | Commercial interests may restrict | ⚠️ Creates doubt |
| **Accreditation** | Standard for universities | Must maintain accreditation | ⚠️ Uncertain if for-profit affects accreditation |
| **Proprietary restrictions** | Typically minimal | Profit motive suggests IP protection | ⚠️ Contradicts "no restrictions" requirement |
| **Regulatory interpretation** | Well-established | Ambiguous for for-profit | ⚠️ Risk of adverse determination |

**Regulatory Ambiguity:** Neither ITAR nor EAR explicitly addresses whether for-profit universities qualify for fundamental research exemption. DDTC and BIS have not issued definitive guidance on this question. The exemption language focuses on "accredited institutions of higher learning" and "ordinarily published" results, not tax status per se. However, for-profit status creates a **rebuttable presumption** that research serves commercial purposes with proprietary restrictions.

**Consequence if Exemption Lost:**

If DDTC/BIS determine that for-profit MU does not qualify for fundamental research exemption, operational impacts include:

1. **All research involving defense articles** (ITAR) or controlled dual-use items (EAR) requires authorization
2. **All 28 foreign nationals** require individual deemed export licenses (current: only 8)
3. **Export classification** required for all research projects before foreign national access
4. **Technology Control Plans** required for all controlled research (current: only 2)
5. **Severe restrictions** on international collaboration
6. **Publication delays** for export control pre-publication reviews
7. **ITAR registration** may become mandatory ($3,000 annual fee + substantial reporting burden)

**Compliance Cost Impact:** Analysis in Section E.6 estimates **$700K-$1.3M annual cost increase** if fundamental research exemption is lost:
- Deemed export licenses: $50K-$100K (legal fees for 20+ additional licenses)
- Export classifications: $100K-$200K (classifying all research projects)
- Compliance staffing: $300K-$500K (increase from 1 FTE to 3-5 FTE)
- Training programs: $50K-$100K (comprehensive training)
- IT security systems: $200K-$400K (enhanced controls for ITAR/EAR data)

**Operational Impacts:**
- 3-6 month delays in hiring foreign nationals (license approval timelines)
- Reduced competitiveness for international graduate student recruitment
- Faculty attrition if compliance burden perceived as excessive
- Loss of research competitiveness in international collaborations
- Potential loss of non-ITAR federal funding if universities determine compliance burden too high

#### 6. Grant Compliance Infrastructure at Risk

**NIH Compliance Requirements:** All 42 NIH grants ($28M) are subject to comprehensive compliance requirements that for-profit status affects:

**Financial Conflict of Interest (42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F):**
- Investigators must disclose significant financial interests (>$5,000)
- Institution must review, manage, and report FCOIs to NIH
- For-profit acquisition creates **inherent financial conflicts** (institutional interest in commercialization of research)
- Enhanced FCOI management plans likely required
- Public reporting obligations
- **Risk:** NIH may impose additional oversight or management requirements on for-profit entity

**Institutional Review Board (45 CFR Part 46 - Common Rule):**
- MU's IRB (15 members, 120 active protocols) must maintain independence
- For-profit status raises concerns about commercial pressure compromising human subjects protection
- IRB members must be free of financial conflicts
- **Risk:** NIH may require enhanced COI screening or independent IRB oversight

**Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC):**
- PHS Policy requires compliance with Animal Welfare Act (9 CFR Subchapter A)
- MU's IACUC (12 members, 35 active protocols) must continue USDA oversight
- PHS Assurance status must be maintained or renegotiated
- **Risk:** Minimal, as for-profit entities can maintain IACUC compliance, but renegotiation required

**NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy (Effective Jan 2023):**
- All NIH grants generating scientific data require Data Management and Sharing Plans (DMSPs)
- Data must be shared via public repositories with specified timelines
- For-profit status creates tension: NIH requires open data sharing; commercial interests favor proprietary control
- **Risk:** NIH may scrutinize whether data will be truly publicly accessible or subject to commercial restrictions

**NSF Compliance Requirements:** 28 NSF awards ($18M) subject to:

**2 CFR Part 200 (Uniform Guidance):**
- For-profit entities remain subject to Uniform Guidance
- No profit/fee allowable under grants (only contracts)
- Enhanced cost scrutiny on allocation between federal awards and commercial activities
- Property purchased with federal funds remains subject to federal requirements

**Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training:**
- Required for students and postdocs on NSF awards
- Minimum 8 contact hours, face-to-face instruction
- For-profit status does not affect RCR obligations

### Strategic Recommendations Summary

The research identifies six critical recommendations to address federal grant and export control risks:

**1. Immediate Compliance Audits (30-45 days, $150K-$250K):**
- Engage export control compliance firm for comprehensive third-party audit
- Inventory all 70 federal grants by mechanism type to identify non-transferable grants (T32/K01/P40)
- Audit all 28 foreign nationals for deemed export license requirements and exemption status
- Screen all researchers and collaborators against Entity List, Denied Persons List, OFAC SDN List
- Review international collaborations for Entity List connections

**2. Federal Agency Consultations (60-90 days, $50K-$100K legal counsel):**
- **DDTC:** Confirm ITAR fundamental research exemption eligibility post-acquisition
- **BIS:** Confirm EAR fundamental research exemption eligibility post-acquisition
- **NIH Program Officers:** Discuss all 42 grant transfers, identify non-transferable grants
- **NSF Program Officers:** Discuss 28 award transfers and continued eligibility
- **DHHS Division of Cost Allocation:** Begin indirect cost rate renegotiation to lock in rate ≥50%

**3. Transaction Structuring (Nonprofit Subsidiary Recommended):**
- Create separate 501(c)(3) research subsidiary to hold non-transferable grants (T32/K01/P40)
- Subsidiary maintains fundamental research exemption and educational mission
- For-profit parent provides infrastructure and support under service agreements
- Advantage: Preserves $28M NIH funding and research exemptions
- Disadvantage: Structural complexity, IRS approval required, operational overhead

Alternative: Full for-profit conversion accepting $10M-$20M grant loss and faculty attrition risks.

**4. Enhanced Export Control Compliance ($700K-$1.3M annually):**
- Increase staffing from 1 FTE to 3 FTE ($300K-$500K)
- Automated denied party screening system ($50K-$100K setup)
- IT security upgrades for ITAR/EAR data ($200K-$400K)
- Obtain all missing deemed export licenses ($50K-$100K for 20 licenses)
- Quarterly audits, enhanced training, incident response protocols

**5. Protective Acquisition Agreement Provisions:**
- **Condition precedent:** Closing conditioned on obtaining NIH/NSF preliminary transfer approvals and DDTC/BIS fundamental research exemption confirmation
- **Indemnification:** Seller indemnifies for pre-closing export control violations
- **Purchase price adjustments:** If >$5M grants non-transferable or indirect cost rate <50%
- **Transition services:** Retain Dr. Patricia Anderson (Export Control Officer) for 12 months

**6. Immediate Iranian/Russian National Review:**
- 8 Iranian and 5 Russian nationals subject to comprehensive embargoes/sanctions
- Verify exemption status for all 13 individuals within 30 days
- Obtain licenses or restrict access within 90 days if required
- Review against OFAC SDN List
- Highest-risk violation category requiring urgent attention

### Transaction Viability Assessment

**Conditional Proceed:** Transaction remains viable **only if**:

1. ✅ Compliance audits reveal no major ongoing violations (exposure <$5M)
2. ✅ DDTC/BIS confirm fundamental research exemption available or can be maintained with structural solutions
3. ✅ Non-transferable grants represent <30% of federal funding (<$15M)
4. ✅ NIH/NSF receptive to grant transfers with for-profit entity or nonprofit subsidiary structure
5. ✅ Indirect cost rate negotiable at ≥50%
6. ✅ No undisclosed Entity List collaborations or major sanctions violations

**Deal-Breaker Scenarios:**
- Majority (>50%) of NIH grants are T32/K01/P40 (non-transferable): **$14M+ annual loss**
- DDTC/BIS definitively deny fundamental research exemption: **$700K-$1.3M annual compliance costs + operational restrictions**
- Audit reveals ongoing violations for 10+ foreign nationals: **$12M+ penalty exposure**
- Undisclosed Entity List collaborations trigger BIS enforcement: **Reputational and penalty risk**

**Required Timeline:** **6-9 months minimum** from present to closing to complete:
- 30-45 days: Compliance audits
- 60-90 days: Federal agency consultations
- 90-120 days: Indirect cost rate negotiation
- 120 days: Grant transfer application submissions
- 60-90 days: Regulatory approvals

Total: **6 months optimistic, 9 months realistic, 12+ months if complications arise.**

### Financial Impact Summary (5-Year Projection)

| Scenario | Grant Loss | IDC Rate Impact | Export Penalties | Enhanced Compliance | Transaction Costs | **5-Year Total** |
|----------|------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Best Case** | $0 | $0 | $0 | $1M | $200K | **$1.2M** |
| **Likely Case** | $25M-$50M | $15M-$20M | $1M-$3M | $3.5M | $600K | **$45M-$77M** |
| **Worst Case** | $100M+ | $40M+ | $25M+ | $6.5M | $1M | **$172M+** |

**Likely case assumptions:**
- $5M-$10M annual grant loss × 5 years = $25M-$50M
- $3M-$4M annual IDC reduction × 5 years = $15M-$20M
- $1M-$3M one-time penalties for 1-2 discovered violations
- $700K annual enhanced compliance × 5 years = $3.5M
- $600K transaction costs (audits, legal, consultants)

**Recommendation:** Transaction valuation must account for **$45M-$77M in likely federal compliance and export control impacts over five years.** Purchase price adjustments, earnouts tied to grant transfers, and indemnification provisions are essential to allocate these risks appropriately between buyer and seller.

### Conclusion

The proposed acquisition of Midwest University presents substantial federal grant and export control compliance challenges inherent in converting a nonprofit research university to for-profit status. The $52M annual federal research funding (76% of research budget) is at material risk due to: (1) certain NIH grants cannot transfer to for-profit entities; (2) fundamental research exemptions from export controls may be lost; (3) 28 foreign nationals from high-risk countries present potential deemed export compliance gaps; and (4) indirect cost rates likely to decrease.

However, the transaction **remains viable with proper structuring** (nonprofit research subsidiary), **comprehensive compliance due diligence** (export control audits, grant inventories), and **federal agency consultation** (DDTC, BIS, NIH, NSF) to confirm regulatory approvals before closing. The critical path requires **minimum 6-9 months** for regulatory approvals, and transaction costs of **$45M-$77M over five years** in the likely case scenario must be incorporated into valuation models.

**Immediate action items** include: (1) comprehensive export control audit of 28 foreign nationals; (2) grant mechanism inventory to identify non-transferable awards; (3) meetings with DDTC/BIS to confirm fundamental research exemption status; and (4) NIH/NSF program officer consultations regarding grant transfers. These due diligence steps must be completed **before executing definitive acquisition agreement** to identify deal-breaker issues and structure transaction to preserve maximum federal research funding.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. NIH GRANT COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

#### 1. Financial Conflict of Interest (42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F)

**Regulatory Authority:** 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F establishes standards to ensure that the design, conduct, and reporting of NIH-funded research is free from bias resulting from investigator financial conflicts of interest.¹

**Applicability:** This regulation applies to each institution applying for or receiving PHS research funding by means of a grant or cooperative agreement, except SBIR Phase I applicants.² The 2011 Final Rule became effective August 24, 2012, and current requirements remain in effect as of 2025.³

**Key Requirements for Midwest University:**

a) **Institutional Policy**: MU must maintain a written FCOI policy that complies with 42 CFR § 50.604 requirements, including:
   - Designation of an institutional official to solicit and review disclosures
   - Mechanisms for researchers to report significant financial interests (SFIs)
   - Procedures to identify and manage FCOIs before expenditure of funds
   - Enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance⁴

b) **Investigator Disclosure**: Each investigator must disclose SFIs ($5,000 threshold) to the institution:
   - At time of application for PHS funding
   - Annually during the period of the award
   - Within 30 days of discovering or acquiring a new SFI⁵

c) **Significant Financial Interest Definition** (42 CFR § 50.603):
   - Remuneration from any entity exceeding $5,000 in the preceding 12 months
   - Equity interest exceeding $5,000 or representing more than 5% ownership
   - Intellectual property rights and interests⁶

d) **FCOI Management**: When an FCOI exists, the institution must develop and implement a management plan before expenditure of funds, which may include:
   - Public disclosure of FCOIs
   - Monitoring of research by independent reviewers
   - Modification of the research plan
   - Disqualification from participation in affected research
   - Divestiture of financial interests
   - Severance of relationships creating the conflict⁷

e) **Reporting to NIH**: Institutions must report FCOIs to NIH through the eRA Commons FCOI Module:
   - Prior to expenditure of funds
   - Within 60 days of identification for existing awards
   - Annual FCOI reports during the project period
   - Public accessibility requirement: FCOI information available via written request within 5 business days⁸

**Training Requirements**: Investigators must complete FCOI training:
- Prior to engaging in PHS-funded research
- Every 4 years
- Immediately when institutional policy changes
- Within reasonable time after non-compliance⁹

**MU Current Compliance Status**: Research profile indicates 42 active NIH grants totaling $28M. Assumption: MU has existing FCOI policies compliant with 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart F.

**Post-Acquisition Risk**: For-profit acquisition creates heightened FCOI scrutiny due to inherent financial interests in research outcomes. NIH may require enhanced monitoring and management plans.

#### 2. Institutional Review Board Requirements (45 CFR Part 46 - Common Rule)

**Regulatory Authority:** 45 CFR Part 46 contains the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, commonly known as the "Common Rule," codified by 15 federal departments and agencies.¹⁰

**Current Status (2025):** Title 45 CFR Part 46 is up to date as of December 19, 2025. The 2018 revisions to the Common Rule became effective January 21, 2019.¹¹

**Four Subparts:**
- **Subpart A**: Federal Policy (Common Rule) - applies to all human subjects research
- **Subpart B**: Additional protections for pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates
- **Subpart C**: Additional protections for prisoners
- **Subpart D**: Additional protections for children¹²

**IRB Composition Requirements** (45 CFR § 46.107):
- At least 5 members with varying backgrounds
- At least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas
- At least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas
- At least one member not affiliated with the institution and not part of immediate family of person affiliated with institution
- Members with competence to review specific research activities¹³

**MU Current Status**: IRB with 15 members reviewing 120 active protocols - exceeds minimum composition requirements.

**Levels of IRB Review** (2018 Common Rule revisions):
a) **Exempt Research**: Certain categories of research exempt from ongoing IRB review
b) **Expedited Review**: Minimal risk research may qualify for review by IRB chair or designated member
c) **Full Board Review**: Required for research involving more than minimal risk¹⁴

**Single IRB (sIRB) Requirements**: As of January 25, 2018, all NIH-funded multi-site research must use a single IRB-of-Record. As of January 19, 2020, all federally funded multi-site research must rely on a single IRB-of-Record.¹⁵

**Informed Consent Requirements**: 2018 Common Rule revised informed consent requirements to emphasize key information must be presented first and organized/presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.¹⁶

**Post-Acquisition Compliance Risk**: IRB must maintain independence from financial interests. For-profit acquisition may require enhanced conflict-of-interest screening for IRB members and additional safeguards to ensure protection of human subjects is not compromised by commercial interests.

#### 3. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)

**Regulatory Authority:** Two federal mandates govern IACUC requirements:
1. **Animal Welfare Act (AWA)** - 9 CFR Subchapter A, enforced by USDA
2. **Public Health Service (PHS) Policy** on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals¹⁷

**PHS Policy Requirements**: Institutions with PHS Assurance must:
- Base animal care programs on the *Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals*
- Comply with applicable USDA regulations (9 CFR Subchapter A) under the Animal Welfare Act
- Compliance with USDA regulations is an absolute requirement of PHS Policy¹⁸

**IACUC Responsibilities** (9 CFR § 2.31):
- Review and approve/deny all animal use protocols before work commences
- Inspect all animal facilities at least once every 6 months using 9 CFR Subchapter A as evaluation basis
- Review the institution's program for humane care and use of animals every 6 months
- Make recommendations to institutional official regarding animal care and use
- Review concerns involving care and use of animals at the research facility¹⁹

**MU Current Status**: IACUC with 12 members reviewing 35 active protocols - adequate composition for regulatory compliance.

**Post-Acquisition Compliance**: IACUC oversight must continue unchanged. PHS Assurance status must be maintained or renegotiated if institutional status changes from nonprofit to for-profit.

#### 4. NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy (Effective January 25, 2023)

**Policy Overview**: NIH Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy became effective January 25, 2023, requiring all grant applications generating scientific data to include a Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMSP).²⁰

**Applicability**: The policy applies to:
- All competing grant applications submitted on or after January 25, 2023
- Contract proposals submitted on or after January 25, 2023
- All 42 of MU's NIH grants would be subject to this policy for any competing renewals²¹

**Required DMSP Content** (Maximum 2 pages):
- **Data type**: Description of scientific data to be generated
- **Related tools, software, and code**: Tools needed to access or manipulate data
- **Standards**: Applicable data/metadata standards
- **Data preservation, access, and timelines**: Where data will be archived, how long, when sharing will occur
- **Access, distribution, or reuse considerations**: Factors affecting data sharing (privacy, IP, pathogens)
- **Oversight**: Who will be responsible for compliance²²

**Scientific Data Definition**: Data commonly accepted in the scientific community as sufficient quality to validate and replicate research findings. Excludes:
- Laboratory notebooks
- Preliminary analyses
- Case report forms
- Drafts of scientific papers
- Plans for future research
- Peer reviews
- Physical objects (laboratory specimens)²³

**Compliance and Oversight**:
- ICO-approved DMSP becomes a Term and Condition of the Notice of Award
- DMSP is a "living document" and can be updated with ICO approval
- Researchers must document compliance in annual Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPR)
- Beginning October 1, 2024, RPPRs include standard questions on data sharing status, repositories, and unique identifiers²⁴

**Budget Considerations**:
- Costs for data management and sharing are allowable and should be requested in budget justification
- As of October 5, 2023, NIH no longer requires single DMS cost line item
- DMS costs may be requested across multiple cost categories
- Costs must be incurred during performance period²⁵

**MU Compliance Status**: All 42 NIH grants assumed to have compliant DMSPs as required for grants awarded since January 2023.

**Post-Acquisition Risk**: For-profit status may create concerns about proprietary data restrictions conflicting with NIH's data sharing requirements. Enhanced scrutiny likely on whether data will be truly publicly accessible or subject to commercial restrictions.

### B. NSF GRANT COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

#### 1. Uniform Administrative Requirements (2 CFR Part 200)

**Regulatory Authority:** 2 CFR Part 200 establishes uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements for federal awards to non-federal entities.²⁶ This regulation, commonly known as the "Uniform Guidance," was issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

**Current Status (2025):** Title 2 is up to date as of December 22, 2025, with the last amendment effective October 1, 2025.²⁷ The Department of Labor published an FAQ document dated January 15, 2025, addressing common questions about 2 CFR Part 200.²⁸

**Scope:** 2 CFR Part 200 contains multiple subparts covering:
- **Subpart A**: Acronyms and Definitions
- **Subpart B**: General Provisions
- **Subpart C**: Pre-Federal Award Requirements and Contents of Federal Awards
- **Subpart D**: Post Federal Award Requirements (financial management, property, procurement, performance/financial monitoring)
- **Subpart E**: Cost Principles (allowable/unallowable costs)
- **Subpart F**: Audit Requirements (Single Audit Act)²⁹

**Key Requirements for MU's 28 NSF Awards ($18M):**

a) **Financial Management Standards** (2 CFR § 200.302):
   - Financial management system that provides accurate, current, and complete disclosure
   - Records that identify source and application of funds
   - Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property, and assets
   - Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts
   - Written procedures for determining allowability of costs³⁰

b) **Property Standards** (2 CFR §§ 200.310-200.316):
   - Equipment purchased with federal funds remains subject to federal requirements
   - Inventory procedures and control systems
   - Disposition requirements when equipment no longer needed for project³¹

c) **Procurement Standards** (2 CFR §§ 200.317-200.327):
   - Competition requirements for purchases
   - Conflict of interest provisions
   - Contract cost and price analysis
   - Record retention requirements³²

d) **Subrecipient Monitoring** (2 CFR § 200.332):
   - Pass-through entities must evaluate subrecipients' risk of noncompliance
   - Monitoring activities during performance period
   - Verification that subrecipients are audited as required³³

e) **Cost Principles** (2 CFR Subpart E):
   - Costs must be allowable, allocable, and reasonable
   - Selected items of cost (2 CFR § 200.420-200.475) specify allowability
   - Unallowable costs include entertainment, alcoholic beverages, lobbying, certain advertising³⁴

**Post-Acquisition Compliance Risk**: For-profit entities remain subject to 2 CFR Part 200, but profit/fee is not allowable under grants (only under contracts). Enhanced scrutiny on cost allocation between federal awards and commercial activities.

#### 2. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training

**NSF Requirements:** NSF requires RCR training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers supported by NSF funding.³⁵

**Required RCR Topics:**
- Research misconduct (falsification, fabrication, plagiarism)
- Data acquisition, management, sharing, and ownership
- Conflict of interest and commitment
- Publication practices and responsible authorship
- Mentor/mentee relationships
- Peer review
- Collaborative science
- Human subjects
- Animal welfare³⁶

**Format Requirements:**
- Face-to-face instruction (online instruction alone insufficient)
- Minimum of 8 contact hours
- Combination of formal coursework and informal workshops/seminars acceptable
- Repeated annually or biannually³⁷

**MU Compliance**: Assumption that current NSF awards comply with RCR training requirements for supported students/postdocs.

**Post-Acquisition Risk**: Minimal impact on RCR training obligations; requirements continue unchanged.

#### 3. NSF Award Transfer Procedures

**Regulatory Framework:** NSF grant transfers are governed by:
- 2 CFR § 200.308 (Prior approval requirements for changes of recipient organization)
- NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter VI
- NSF Grant General Conditions (GC-1)³⁸

**Prior Approval Requirement:** Transfer of a grant from one institution to another before the project performance period expires requires NSF prior approval.³⁹

**NSF Transfer Approval Criteria:**
1. Project has been relinquished by original institution before project performance period expiration
2. Facilities and resources at new institution allow successful project performance
3. Principal Investigator plans no significant change in research objectives and level of expenditures⁴⁰

**Transfer Process:**
a) **Preliminary Approval**: PI must notify NSF Program Office to request preliminary approval for grant transfer
b) **Institutional Agreement**: Both original and new institution must agree to transfer
c) **Formal Notification**: Transfer electronically initiated by PI through Research.gov
d) **Documentation Required**:
   - Relinquishing statement from original institution
   - Transfer request from receiving institution
   - Updated budget for remaining project period
   - Certification from receiving institution of facilities and administrative capability⁴¹

**NSF 2-Month Rule:** If PI is transferring between institutions, notification to NSF must occur no later than 2 months after initial absence from the institution.⁴²

**Post-Acquisition Complexity for MU:**
- If MU becomes for-profit entity, NSF will scrutinize whether transfer is appropriate
- NSF likely to require enhanced justification that research mission remains paramount
- Risk: Some NSF programs may have eligibility restrictions for for-profit entities (requires award-by-award analysis)

### C. CHANGE OF GRANTEE INSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS: NONPROFIT TO FOR-PROFIT

#### 1. NIH Grant Transfer Policy (Nonprofit to For-Profit)

**General Principle:** NIH grants may be awarded to organizations that are domestic or foreign, public or private, nonprofit or for-profit, **unless specifically excluded** by the funding opportunity announcement or program policy.⁴³

**Critical Finding - Grant Mechanism Restrictions:** The following NIH grant mechanisms are **explicitly restricted to nonprofit/domestic institutions** and **CANNOT** be transferred to for-profit entities:⁴⁴

| Grant Mechanism | Description | For-Profit Eligibility |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **K01** | Mentored Research Scientist Development Award | ❌ Domestic institutions only |
| **T32** | Institutional Training Grants | ❌ Domestic nonprofit only |
| **T35** | Short-Term Institutional Research Training Grants | ❌ Domestic nonprofit only |
| **P40** | Animal Resource Grants | ❌ Domestic institutions only |
| **R43/R44** | SBIR Phase I/Phase II | ❌ Domestic small businesses only |

**Implication for MU**: Among MU's 42 NIH grants totaling $28M, any awards in the above categories **cannot be transferred** to a for-profit acquirer. These grants would need to be:
- **Relinquished** to NIH with funds returned, OR
- **Restructured** with nonprofit research subsidiary maintaining the grants

**Research Project Grants (R01, R21, etc.):** For-profit entities ARE eligible for most NIH research project grants. However, **NIH will not provide profit or fee** under grant mechanisms (profit/fee only allowed for SBIR/STTR and contracts).⁴⁵

#### 2. NIH Change of Recipient Organization Process

**Regulatory Requirement:** Change of recipient organization requires **prior NIH approval** before the expiration of the approved project period (2 CFR § 200.308).⁴⁶

**Two Transfer Pathways:**

a) **Relinquishing Award:**
   - Original institution returns all unexpended funds to NIH
   - New institution submits new competing application
   - No guarantee of re-award
   - Timeline: 6-12 months for recompetition⁴⁷

b) **Transferring Award (Type 7 Change of Organization):**
   - Original institution formally relinquishes administrative responsibility
   - New institution assumes award with NIH approval
   - Faster process (60-90 days typical)
   - Requires:
     * Relinquishing Statement from original institution
     * Transfer application from receiving institution via eRA Commons
     * Updated budget for remainder of project period
     * Facilities and resources certification
     * No significant change in scope or objectives⁴⁸

**Timeline Requirement:** Transfer request must be submitted **before** the anticipated start date at the new organization, preferably **several months in advance**.⁴⁹

**NIH Review Factors for Nonprofit-to-For-Profit Transfer:**
- Will research mission be maintained without commercial compromise?
- Are facilities and resources adequate for project continuation?
- Will data sharing and publication policies comply with NIH requirements?
- Are human subjects/animal welfare protections maintained?
- Will financial conflicts of interest be adequately managed?⁵⁰

#### 3. For-Profit Grant Restrictions and Profit/Fee Policy

**No Profit or Fee Under Grants:** NIH explicitly prohibits payment of profit or fee to for-profit recipients under grant programs (except SBIR/STTR).⁵¹ This means:
- Indirect cost rate applies, but no profit margin added
- All costs must be allowable, allocable, and reasonable under 2 CFR Part 200
- Enhanced cost scrutiny compared to nonprofit recipients

**Allowable Cost Scrutiny:** For-profit recipients face greater scrutiny on:
- Executive compensation (reasonableness standards)
- Cost allocation between federal awards and commercial activities
- Related-party transactions
- Profit-motivated expenses vs. research necessity⁵²

**Practical Impact:** For-profit MU would receive federal funds for direct costs plus indirect costs at negotiated rate, but no additional profit margin. Total federal funding could effectively decrease compared to nonprofit status.

#### 4. NSF Grant Transfer to For-Profit Entity

**General Eligibility:** NSF awards may be made to for-profit organizations unless specifically excluded by program solicitation.⁵³

**Transfer Process Same as NIH:** 2 CFR § 200.308 prior approval requirement applies. NSF must approve:
1. Relinquishing statement from MU (as nonprofit)
2. Transfer application from acquiring entity (as for-profit)
3. Evidence of adequate facilities and resources
4. No significant scope changes⁵⁴

**Enhanced Scrutiny Expected:** NSF likely to question whether for-profit acquisition compromises:
- Fundamental research nature of projects
- Data sharing and publication commitments
- Broader impacts mission (education, diversity, outreach)⁵⁵

**Risk Assessment:** Some NSF awards may have program-specific nonprofit requirements. **Award-by-award review required** to identify transfer-ineligible grants.

#### 5. Indirect Cost Rate Renegotiation Risk

**Current Status:** MU has federally negotiated indirect cost rate of **56%** with DHHS Division of Cost Allocation (DCA).⁵⁶

**Annual Indirect Cost Recovery:** $29M (56% × $52M direct federal costs)

**For-Profit Rate Negotiation:**
- For-profit entities negotiate rates with same federal cognizant agency (DHHS DCA)
- Historical data: For-profit rates typically range 40-50% (lower than research universities)
- Rate based on allowable facilities and administrative (F&A) costs
- Commercial activities may dilute rate base⁵⁷

**Worst-Case Scenario:**
- Rate reduced from 56% to 40%
- Annual loss: $8.3M in indirect cost recovery
- This represents 12% of total research budget ($68M)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Negotiate rate BEFORE closing transaction. Lock in rate for 2-4 year period in rate agreement.

#### 6. Recommendations: Grant Transfer Strategy

**Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing):**
1. **Inventory Analysis**: Catalog all 70 federal grants (42 NIH, 28 NSF) by mechanism type
2. **Eligibility Determination**: Identify which grants can/cannot transfer to for-profit entity
3. **Financial Impact**: Calculate funding at risk from ineligible transfers
4. **Agency Consultation**: Meet with NIH and NSF program officers to discuss acquisition and transfer feasibility

**Structural Options:**
1. **Option A - Full Transfer**: Transfer all eligible grants to for-profit MU, relinquish ineligible grants
2. **Option B - Nonprofit Subsidiary**: Create separate 501(c)(3) research institute to hold restricted grants (T32, K01, P40)
3. **Option C - Staged Transition**: Allow current grants to expire naturally, future applications through for-profit entity

**Timeline Considerations:**
- NIH/NSF notification: 90-120 days before closing
- Transfer approval process: 60-90 days
- Total lead time needed: 6 months minimum

### D. ITAR EXPORT CONTROL COMPLIANCE

#### 1. International Traffic in Arms Regulations Overview

**Regulatory Authority:** 22 CFR Parts 120-130, administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), U.S. Department of State.⁵⁸

**Legal Foundation:** Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. § 2751 et seq., implemented through Executive Order 13637.⁵⁹

**Current Status (2025):** Title 22 CFR is up to date as of December 22, 2025, last amended November 7, 2025. Recent updates removed items from the U.S. Munitions List (USML) that no longer warrant inclusion and added items that warrant control.⁶⁰

**Scope:** ITAR controls the export and import of:
- **Defense articles**: Items designated on the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR § 121.1)
- **Defense services**: Furnishing of assistance or training with respect to defense articles
- **Technical data**: Information required for design, development, production, manufacture, assembly, operation, repair, testing, maintenance, or modification of defense articles⁶¹

**Defense Article Definition** (22 CFR § 120.6): Any item or technical data designated in § 121.1, including:
- Technical data recorded or stored in any physical form
- Models, mockups revealing technical data
- Forgings, castings, and unfinished products clearly identifiable by mechanical properties, material composition, geometry, or function as defense articles⁶²

#### 2. MU's ITAR-Controlled Research

**Current Status:**
- **2 DOD grants** totaling **$2M**
- Research areas: Materials science, propulsion systems
- **2 active Technology Control Plans (TCPs)**
- **8 deemed export licenses** for foreign nationals⁶³

**USML Categories Likely Applicable:**
- **Category IV**: Launch vehicles, guided missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, mines (propulsion systems research)
- **Category XIII**: Materials, coatings, treatments (materials science research)⁶⁴

#### 3. Technology Control Plan (TCP) Requirements

**Definition:** A TCP is the university's internal management plan specifying security measures for export-controlled technology from delivery/generation through return/disposal when project completes.⁶⁵

**When TCPs Required:**
- Receiving export-controlled technology from sponsor/collaborator
- Research subject to government-imposed national security controls
- Sending/carrying export-controlled technology outside United States⁶⁶

**Required TCP Components:**

a) **Personnel Restrictions:**
   - Access limited to "U.S. persons" (citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylum/amnesty recipients)
   - All personnel and visitors screened against denied parties lists before access
   - Export Control Manager must document screening results
   - All personnel must be briefed on TCP and certify understanding⁶⁷

b) **Physical Security:**
   - Controlled access areas (locked laboratories, badge access)
   - Secure storage for ITAR documents and hardware
   - Visitor logs and escort procedures
   - Signage identifying controlled areas⁶⁸

c) **Information Security:**
   - Encrypted electronic storage for technical data
   - Secure transmission protocols (SFTP, encrypted email)
   - Access controls for computers containing ITAR data
   - Prohibition on cloud storage without DDTC approval⁶⁹

d) **Monitoring and Audits:**
   - PI review of TCP at minimum annually
   - Updates for personnel changes reported to Export Control Officer
   - Internal audits of compliance
   - Correction of deficiencies within defined timeframes⁷⁰

**MU Compliance Status:** 2 active TCPs for 2 DOD grants. Assumption: TCPs adequately implemented based on 2021 corrective actions.

**Post-Acquisition Risk:** For-profit status may require enhanced TCP security measures if DDTC perceives increased risk of unauthorized disclosure for commercial advantage.

#### 4. ITAR Penalties and Enforcement

**Civil Penalties (22 CFR § 127.1):** As of 2025, civil penalties for AECA/ITAR violations are **$1,271,078 per violation**, or **twice the value of the transaction** that is the basis for the violation.⁷¹

**Criminal Penalties:**
- Willful unlawful export/disclosure: Up to **10 years imprisonment** and/or **$1,000,000 fine** per violation
- Conspiracy to violate ITAR: Up to 5 years imprisonment⁷²

**Additional Consequences:**
- **Debarment**: Prohibition from participating in export of defense articles
- **Loss of export privileges**: Inability to engage in ITAR-controlled activities
- **Reputational damage**: Public disclosure of violations⁷³

#### 5. Fundamental Research Exemption Under ITAR

**Exemption Definition** (22 CFR § 120.11(8)): "Fundamental research" means basic and applied research in science and engineering at accredited U.S. institutions of higher learning where results ordinarily will be published and shared broadly within scientific community.⁷⁴

**Exemption Requirements:**
- Research conducted at **accredited university**
- Results **ordinarily published** and shared broadly
- **Not restricted** from publication or dissemination
- **No prepublication review** by sponsor⁷⁵

**Exemption Does NOT Apply When:**
- Research subject to publication restrictions
- Foreign nationals excluded from participation
- Sponsor retains prepublication approval rights
- Results classified or subject to national security restrictions⁷⁶

**Critical Issue for MU Acquisition:** For-profit acquisition raises question: Does MU remain "accredited institution of higher learning" for ITAR fundamental research exemption?

**DDTC Interpretation:** Fundamental research exemption focused on **educational mission** and **publication commitment**, not tax status per se. However, for-profit status creates presumption of commercial application and proprietary restrictions.⁷⁷

**Post-Acquisition Risk Analysis:**

| Factor | Nonprofit University | For-Profit MU | Impact on Exemption |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Educational mission | Primary | Secondary to profit | ⚠️ Weakens |
| Publication commitment | Strong presumption | Commercial concerns | ⚠️ Weakens |
| Accreditation | Standard | Must maintain | ⚠️ Uncertain |
| Foreign national access | Presumed open | Scrutinized | ⚠️ Weakens |

**Consequence if Exemption Lost:**
- All research involving defense articles requires DDTC authorization
- All foreign nationals require deemed export licenses
- Severe limitations on international collaboration
- Substantial compliance burden increase⁷⁸

#### 6. ITAR Registration Requirements

**Registration Mandate** (22 CFR § 122.1): Any person who engages in United States in the business of manufacturing or exporting defense articles or furnishing defense services must register with DDTC.⁷⁹

**University Exception:** Universities conducting fundamental research generally **not required** to register because exemption applies.⁸⁰

**Post-Acquisition Risk:** If for-profit MU loses fundamental research exemption, **ITAR registration may become mandatory**.

**Registration Requirements:**
- Annual registration fee: $3,000
- Designation of empowered official
- Detailed description of defense articles/services
- Compliance with ongoing reporting requirements⁸¹

### E. EAR EXPORT CONTROL COMPLIANCE

#### 1. Export Administration Regulations Overview

**Regulatory Authority:** 15 CFR Parts 730-774, administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), U.S. Department of Commerce.⁸²

**Current Status (2025):** Title 15 CFR is up to date as of July 24, 2025, last amended May 2, 2025.⁸³

**Scope:** EAR controls dual-use items (commercial and military applications) and certain purely commercial items:
- **Commerce Control List (CCL)**: Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) for controlled items
- **EAR99**: Items not on CCL, generally no license required (but restrictions for embargoed countries)⁸⁴

**Key Difference from ITAR:**
- ITAR: Military/defense-specific items (presumptive license requirement for all countries)
- EAR: Dual-use and commercial items (license depends on item, destination, end-use, end-user)⁸⁵

#### 2. Fundamental Research Exemption Under EAR

**Exemption Definition** (15 CFR § 734.8): "Technology" or "software" that arises during or results from fundamental research and is intended to be published is **not subject to the EAR**.⁸⁶

**Fundamental Research Definition** (15 CFR § 734.8(c)): Research in science, engineering, or mathematics where:
- Results **ordinarily published** and shared broadly within research community
- Researchers have **not accepted restrictions** for proprietary or national security reasons⁸⁷

**Application to Universities:** Research conducted by scientists, engineers, or students at a university normally will be considered fundamental research.⁸⁸

**Exemption Does NOT Apply When:**
- **Publication restrictions** on scientific and technical information
- Institution **accepted restrictions** on foreign national participation due to proprietary/national security reasons
- Sponsor retains **prepublication review** rights
- Research funded by intelligence community (automatic restriction)⁸⁹

**Educational Information Exclusion** (15 CFR § 734.9): Information taught in courses listed in university catalogues and associated teaching laboratories is excluded from EAR, even if concerning controlled items.⁹⁰

**Publicly Available Information** (15 CFR § 734.7): Technology or software already published or will be published is exempt. Includes:
- Information released at open conferences (all technically qualified persons eligible to attend, can take notes)
- Patents and published patent applications
- Information available in public libraries⁹¹

#### 3. Deemed Export Under EAR

**Deemed Export Definition** (15 CFR § 734.13): Release of technology or source code subject to EAR to a foreign national in the United States is **deemed to be an export** to the foreign national's most recent country of citizenship or permanent residency.⁹²

**Foreign National Definition:** Person who is not:
- U.S. citizen
- U.S. lawful permanent resident (green card holder)
- Protected individual (refugee, asylee)⁹³

**License Requirements:** Deemed exports require licenses on **item-by-item, country-by-country basis**. Not all items require licenses; depends on:
- ECCN classification of technology
- Country(ies) of foreign national's citizenship/residence
- End-use of technology
- Denied party screening results⁹⁴

**MU Situation Analysis:**
- 28 foreign nationals from China (12), Iran (8), Russia (5), other (3)
- 8 deemed export licenses currently held
- **Gap**: 20 foreign nationals without deemed export licenses

**Possible Explanations for Gap:**
1. Those 20 individuals work on fundamental research projects (exemption applies, no license needed)
2. Those 20 individuals work with EAR99 items or uncontrolled technology (no license needed)
3. Those 20 individuals are from countries/technology combinations not requiring licenses
4. **Compliance gap** - licenses should exist but don't (HIGH RISK)⁹⁵

**Required Action:** Audit all 28 foreign nationals to verify export control status and license requirements.

#### 4. Countries of Concern Under EAR

**China:**
- Not comprehensively embargoed, but extensive controls
- Many Chinese universities/entities on **BIS Entity List** (requires license for any ECCN items)
- Military-Civil Fusion Strategy creates presumption of military end-use
- Recent 2025 Entity List additions focused on quantum technology, AI, advanced computing, aerospace⁹⁶

**Iran:**
- **Comprehensive embargo** (E:1 designation)
- License required for virtually all exports/reexports to Iran
- Broad prohibition on services to Iranian nationals
- Very limited exceptions (e.g., certain educational materials)⁹⁷

**Russia:**
- **Comprehensive export restrictions** (E:1 designation since 2022 Ukraine invasion)
- Extensive Russia-related sanctions programs
- Entity List includes numerous Russian institutions
- Deemed exports to Russian nationals highly scrutinized⁹⁸

**MU Foreign National Breakdown Risk Assessment:**

| Country | Count | Risk Level | Rationale |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|
| China | 12 | 🔴 HIGH | Entity List concerns, technology transfer risk |
| Iran | 8 | 🔴 CRITICAL | Comprehensive embargo, minimal exemptions |
| Russia | 5 | 🔴 HIGH | Sanctions, export restrictions |
| Other | 3 | 🟡 MEDIUM | Depends on specific countries |

#### 5. BIS Entity List and Restricted Parties Screening

**Entity List (15 CFR Supplement No. 4 to Part 744):** Entities determined to pose risk to U.S. national security or foreign policy. License required for any export of items subject to EAR to listed entities.⁹⁹

**2025 Entity List Updates - University Impact:**
- **September 2025**: 2 Chinese Academy of Sciences institutes added (Aerospace Information Research Institute, National Time Service Center)
- **March 2025**: Multiple Chinese research institutes added for quantum technology, AI, advanced computing
- **October 2025**: Additional Chinese entities for semiconductor and computing technologies¹⁰⁰

**Denied Persons List:** Individuals and entities denied export privileges. **Any transaction** with denied person prohibited.¹⁰¹

**Unverified List:** Entities BIS unable to verify legitimacy and reliability (mainly China-based). Requires additional due diligence before export.¹⁰²

**Required Screening:** Before hiring or granting access to controlled technology, MU must screen against:
- Entity List
- Denied Persons List
- Unverified List
- Treasury Department OFAC SDN List¹⁰³

**MU Current Practice:** Export Control Officer (Dr. Patricia Anderson) conducts pre-hire screening. Post-acquisition must continue this practice with enhanced documentation.

#### 6. Post-Acquisition Export Control Compliance Burden

**If Fundamental Research Exemption Lost:**

| Compliance Requirement | Current (Nonprofit) | For-Profit (No Exemption) | Annual Cost Increase |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Deemed export licenses | 8 (for ITAR only) | 28+ (all foreign nationals) | $50K-$100K (legal fees) |
| Export classifications | Minimal (ITAR only) | All research projects | $100K-$200K |
| Compliance staffing | 1 FTE | 3-5 FTE | $300K-$500K |
| Training programs | Basic | Comprehensive | $50K-$100K |
| IT security systems | Standard | Enhanced | $200K-$400K |
| **Total Annual Increase** | - | - | **$700K-$1.3M** |

**Operational Impacts:**
- Restrictions on international collaboration
- Delays in hiring foreign nationals (3-6 months for license approvals)
- Publication delays for export control reviews
- Reduced competitiveness for international graduate students
- Potential loss of non-ITAR federal funding if compliance burden too high¹⁰⁴

### F. PRIOR ITAR VIOLATION ANALYSIS (2021)

#### 1. Incident Summary

**Date:** 2021
**Nature of Violation:** ITAR-controlled technical data shared with Chinese postdoctoral researcher without required deemed export license
**Discovery:** Voluntary self-disclosure to DDTC
**Resolution:** DDTC warning letter; no monetary penalty
**Status:** Closed with corrective action¹⁰⁵

#### 2. Voluntary Disclosure Benefits

**22 CFR § 127.12 - Voluntary Disclosures:** DDTC strongly encourages voluntary disclosure and considers it a mitigating factor in determining administrative penalties.¹⁰⁶

**Mitigation Criteria Satisfied by MU:**
1. **Immediate Disclosure**: Violation reported to DDTC as soon as discovered
2. **Completeness**: Full disclosure of circumstances and extent of violation
3. **Cooperation**: Provided all requested information within 60-day supplemental period
4. **Corrective Action**: Implemented remedial measures before DDTC request
5. **No Pattern**: Isolated incident, not systemic noncompliance¹⁰⁷

**Penalty Avoided:** Civil penalties for ITAR violations in 2021 were approximately $1.2M per violation. Warning letter instead of monetary penalty represents **substantial benefit** of voluntary disclosure.¹⁰⁸

#### 3. Corrective Actions Implemented

**a) Enhanced Technology Control Plans:**
- Revised TCP procedures with additional access controls
- Increased physical security (badge access, visitor logs)
- Enhanced information security (encrypted storage, transmission protocols)
- Quarterly TCP audits instead of annual¹⁰⁹

**b) Pre-Hire Export Control Screening:**
- Mandatory screening for all foreign national hires
- Screening against: Entity List, Denied Persons List, Unverified List, OFAC SDN List
- Documentation requirements before access granted
- Export Control Officer approval required¹¹⁰

**c) Training Enhancement:**
- Mandatory ITAR/EAR training for all researchers with potential controlled technology access
- Annual refresher training
- Special training for principal investigators on TCP requirements
- Export control awareness for department chairs and deans¹¹¹

**d) Compliance Monitoring:**
- Quarterly audits of TCP compliance
- Annual export control program review
- Incident reporting procedures
- Escalation protocols for potential violations¹¹²

#### 4. Risk of Recurrence Assessment

**Strengths of Current Compliance Program:**
- Voluntary disclosure culture established
- Robust screening procedures
- Regular training and audits
- Export Control Officer (Dr. Patricia Anderson) with institutional knowledge
- Four years of clean record since 2021 incident¹¹³

**Remaining Vulnerabilities:**
- Only 1 FTE dedicated to export control (Dr. Anderson)
- 28 foreign nationals, 8 deemed export licenses (possible gap)
- Complexity increases if fundamental research exemption lost
- For-profit transition may introduce new compliance challenges¹¹⁴

**Risk Rating:** **MEDIUM** - Adequate corrective actions implemented, but ongoing vigilance required, especially post-acquisition.

#### 5. Penalty Exposure for Future Violations

**Current ITAR Civil Penalties (2025):** $1,271,078 per violation, or twice transaction value, whichever is greater.¹¹⁵

**Aggravating Factors for Future Violations:**
- **Prior Warning Letter**: DDTC aware of 2021 violation history
- **Reduced Mitigation Credit**: Repeat violations reduce voluntary disclosure benefit
- **Enhanced Scrutiny**: For-profit status may trigger stricter enforcement
- **Pattern Evidence**: Second violation demonstrates inadequate compliance system¹¹⁶

**Recent L3Harris Case Warning:** DDTC stated that voluntary disclosures directly related to ongoing investigations may **not receive mitigation credit**. This suggests enforcement posture is hardening.¹¹⁷

**Worst-Case Scenario:**
- Second ITAR violation discovered: $1.27M civil penalty
- Multiple violations (e.g., multiple foreign nationals): $1.27M × number of violations
- Criminal referral if willful: Up to 10 years imprisonment, $1M fine
- Debarment from DOD contracts: Loss of $2M DOD grants plus future opportunities¹¹⁸

#### 6. Post-Acquisition Export Control Recommendations

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Audit All 28 Foreign Nationals**: Verify deemed export license status, identify gaps
2. **DDTC Consultation**: Meet with DDTC to discuss acquisition, confirm fundamental research exemption status
3. **BIS Consultation**: Similar meeting with BIS regarding EAR compliance
4. **Third-Party Audit**: Engage export control compliance firm for independent assessment¹¹⁹

**Structural Enhancements:**
1. **Increase Export Control Staffing**: 1 FTE → 3 FTE (Officer + 2 analysts)
2. **IT Security Upgrade**: Implement enhanced controls for ITAR/EAR data
3. **Automated Screening**: Deploy software for continuous denied party screening
4. **Segregated Controlled Research**: Physical/organizational separation of ITAR research from other activities¹²⁰

**Policy Updates:**
1. **Revise TCP Templates**: Reflect for-profit status and enhanced security
2. **Update Foreign National Procedures**: More rigorous vetting and monitoring
3. **Publication Review Process**: Ensure export control review before publication (if exemption uncertain)
4. **Incident Response Plan**: Procedures for rapid identification, reporting, remediation¹²¹

**Cost of Enhanced Compliance:** $700K-$1.3M annually (as calculated in Section E.6), but necessary to mitigate $1M+ penalty exposure.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Federal Grant Transfer Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Probability | Financial Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| **NIH Training/Career Development Grants Cannot Transfer (T32, K01, P40)** | 🔴 HIGH | 🔴 CERTAIN | Unknown portion of $28M | Create nonprofit subsidiary to retain restricted grants |
| **NSF Grant Transfer Denials** | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 POSSIBLE | Portion of $18M | Early consultation with NSF, demonstrate continued research mission |
| **Indirect Cost Rate Reduction** | 🔴 HIGH | 🟡 PROBABLE | $8.3M annual loss (56%→40%) | Negotiate rate pre-closing, lock for 2-4 years |
| **Enhanced FCOI Scrutiny** | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🔴 CERTAIN | Compliance costs $100K-$200K | Strengthen FCOI policies, independent oversight |
| **IRB/IACUC Independence Concerns** | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 POSSIBLE | Research delays, NIH suspension | Enhanced COI screening for committee members |
| **Data Sharing Policy Conflicts** | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 POSSIBLE | Grant non-compliance | Maintain open publication commitment in policy |

**Aggregate Grant Transfer Risk:** $10M-$20M in federal funding could be lost or delayed due to nonprofit-to-for-profit transition.

### B. Export Control Compliance Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Probability | Financial/Operational Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|-------------|------------------------------|------------|
| **Loss of Fundamental Research Exemption** | 🔴 CRITICAL | 🟡 PROBABLE | $700K-$1.3M annual compliance costs; severe operational restrictions | Maintain educational mission, structure as nonprofit research subsidiary |
| **Deemed Export License Gap (20/28 Foreign Nationals)** | 🔴 HIGH | 🔴 CERTAIN | Immediate audit required; potential ongoing violations | Comprehensive audit, obtain missing licenses within 90 days |
| **ITAR Registration Requirement** | 🟡 MEDIUM | 🟡 POSSIBLE | $3K annual fee + substantial compliance burden | Determine if fundamental research exemption maintained |
| **Prior ITAR Violation (2021) Reduces Mitigation** | 🔴 HIGH | 🟡 POSSIBLE | $1.27M civil penalty if repeat violation | Enhanced compliance program, third-party audit |
| **Entity List Collaborations (Chinese Institutions)** | 🔴 HIGH | 🟡 PROBABLE | 12 Chinese researchers; scrutiny of collaborations | Screen all collaborations, terminate Entity List relationships |
| **Iran/Russia Nationals Comprehensive Embargo** | 🔴 CRITICAL | 🔴 CERTAIN | 8 Iranian + 5 Russian researchers under strict controls | Verify exemption status, obtain licenses if required |

**Aggregate Export Control Risk:** $1M-$3M in penalty exposure plus $700K-$1.3M annual compliance cost increase.

### C. Operational and Reputational Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Impact |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **International Collaboration Restrictions** | 🔴 HIGH | Reduced competitiveness for international graduate students; inability to collaborate with Entity List institutions |
| **Publication Delays** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Export control reviews delay publications; faculty recruitment/retention impact |
| **DOD Debarment Risk** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Second ITAR violation could result in debarment; loss of $2M DOD grants + future opportunities |
| **Faculty Attrition** | 🔴 HIGH | Researchers may leave if compliance burden too high or mission perceived as commercial vs. academic |
| **Accreditation Risk** | 🟡 MEDIUM | For-profit status may affect accreditation; impacts fundamental research exemption determination |

### D. Timeline and Transaction Risks

| Risk Factor | Issue | Impact on Closing |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Insufficient Lead Time for NIH/NSF Notifications** | Transfers require 90-120 days notification + 60-90 days approval | ⚠️ 6-month minimum required; rushed process risks denials |
| **Grant Inventory Incomplete** | Unknown which of 42 NIH grants are T32/K01/P40 (non-transferable) | ⚠️ Cannot quantify funding at risk without detailed inventory |
| **Foreign National License Status Unknown** | 28 foreign nationals, only 8 licenses documented - status of other 20 unknown | ⚠️ Potential ongoing violations discoverable in due diligence |
| **DDTC/BIS Pre-Transaction Consultation Not Conducted** | No indication MU consulted regulators about acquisition impact | ⚠️ Risk of adverse determination post-closing |

### E. Critical Path Risk Assessment

**Pre-Closing Critical Actions (Must Complete Before Transaction Close):**

| Action | Timeline | Risk if Not Completed |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| 1. Complete grant inventory (categorize by mechanism) | 30 days | Cannot structure transaction to preserve funding |
| 2. Audit 28 foreign nationals' export control status | 45 days | Potential violations discovered post-acquisition |
| 3. Meet with NIH/NSF program officers | 60 days | Grant transfers denied without consultation |
| 4. Meet with DDTC/BIS re: fundamental research exemption | 60 days | Adverse determination after closing |
| 5. Engage export control compliance firm for audit | 90 days | Undiscovered compliance gaps |
| 6. Negotiate indirect cost rate with DHHS | 120 days | Rate reduced post-closing, $8M annual loss |
| 7. Submit grant transfer applications (if proceeding) | 120 days | Grants lapse before approval |

**Overall Timeline:** **Minimum 6 months** required for compliance due diligence and regulatory approvals before closing.

### F. Deal Breaker Scenarios

**Scenarios That Could Make Acquisition Unviable:**

1. **Majority of NIH Grants Non-Transferable**: If >50% of $28M NIH funding in T32/K01/P40 categories, loss may exceed acquisition value.

2. **Fundamental Research Exemption Definitively Lost**: If DDTC/BIS confirm for-profit status precludes exemption, $700K-$1.3M annual compliance cost may make research operations unprofitable.

3. **Entity List Connections Undisclosed**: If MU has unreported collaborations with Entity List entities, could trigger BIS enforcement action and reputational damage.

4. **Multiple Ongoing ITAR/EAR Violations**: If audit reveals 20 foreign nationals without licenses represent ongoing violations, penalty exposure could reach $25M+ (20 persons × $1.27M).

5. **DOD Objects to Acquisition**: If DOD declines to transfer $2M ITAR grants due to for-profit status, may indicate broader federal government opposition.

---

### G. Risk Mitigation Priority Matrix

**Tier 1 - Immediate (Pre-LOI):**
- Grant mechanism inventory (identify T32/K01/P40)
- Foreign national export control audit
- Preliminary DDTC/BIS consultation

**Tier 2 - Due Diligence (LOI to Definitive Agreement):**
- Third-party export control compliance audit
- NIH/NSF program officer meetings
- Indirect cost rate negotiation initiation
- Structural alternatives analysis (nonprofit subsidiary)

**Tier 3 - Pre-Closing (Definitive Agreement to Close):**
- Submit grant transfer applications
- Obtain all missing deemed export licenses
- Implement enhanced compliance program
- Finalize indirect cost rate agreement

**Tier 4 - Post-Closing (0-12 months after acquisition):**
- Continuous monitoring of grant transfer approvals
- Quarterly export control audits
- Faculty retention initiatives
- Accreditation maintenance

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Key Findings

**1. Federal Grant Transferability - Significant Risk ($10M-$20M at Risk)**
- MU holds 42 NIH grants ($28M) and 28 NSF awards ($18M), totaling $46M annually
- NIH training and career development grants (T32, K01, P40) **cannot transfer** to for-profit entities
- Without grant mechanism inventory, cannot quantify exact funding at risk
- Indirect cost rate likely to decrease from 56% to 40-45%, representing $8.3M annual loss
- 6-month minimum lead time required for grant transfer process

**2. Export Control Compliance - Critical Risk ($1M-$3M Penalty Exposure + $700K-$1.3M Annual Costs)**
- MU has 2 DOD ITAR grants ($2M) with 2 active Technology Control Plans
- 28 foreign nationals from high-risk countries (China: 12, Iran: 8, Russia: 5, Other: 3)
- Only 8 deemed export licenses documented - **status of other 20 foreign nationals unknown**
- Prior 2021 ITAR violation (warning letter) reduces mitigation credit for future violations
- For-profit status may cause loss of fundamental research exemption, triggering massive compliance burden increase

**3. Fundamental Research Exemption - Transaction Outcome-Determinative**
- Both ITAR (22 CFR § 120.11(8)) and EAR (15 CFR § 734.8) provide exemptions for university fundamental research
- Exemption allows foreign nationals to access controlled technology without deemed export licenses
- Exemption requirements: accredited institution, results ordinarily published, no publication restrictions
- For-profit status creates presumption of commercial application and proprietary restrictions
- **If exemption lost:** All research requiring export controls, all foreign nationals requiring licenses, $700K-$1.3M annual cost increase

**4. Prior ITAR Violation - Moderate Risk with Enhanced Scrutiny**
- 2021 incident: ITAR data shared with Chinese postdoc without license
- Voluntary self-disclosure to DDTC resulted in warning letter (no fine)
- Adequate corrective actions implemented (enhanced TCPs, screening, training, audits)
- Four years clean record since 2021
- However: Prior violation reduces mitigation credit if second violation occurs
- DDTC enforcement posture hardening (per L3Harris 2024 case)

**5. Foreign National Compliance Gap - Immediate Action Required**
- **Critical Finding:** 28 foreign nationals, only 8 deemed export licenses
- 12 Chinese nationals pose Entity List collaboration risks (2025 additions to Entity List include quantum, AI, aerospace research)
- 8 Iranian nationals subject to comprehensive embargo (E:1 designation)
- 5 Russian nationals subject to comprehensive export restrictions
- If 20 unlicensed foreign nationals represent ongoing violations: **$25M penalty exposure** (20 × $1.27M)

### B. Strategic Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: Conduct Immediate Compliance Audits (30-45 Days)**

**Actions:**
- Engage export control compliance firm for comprehensive audit
- Inventory all 70 federal grants by mechanism type (identify T32/K01/P40)
- Audit all 28 foreign nationals for deemed export license requirements
- Screen all foreign researchers/collaborators against Entity List, Denied Persons List, OFAC SDN List
- Review all international collaborations for Entity List connections

**Cost:** $150K-$250K (one-time audit fee)

**Outcome:** Identifies compliance gaps before acquisition, allows informed decision on transaction viability

---

**Recommendation 2: Consult Federal Agencies Before Transaction (60-90 Days)**

**Meetings Required:**
- **DDTC (State Dept):** Confirm ITAR fundamental research exemption status post-acquisition
- **BIS (Commerce Dept):** Confirm EAR fundamental research exemption status post-acquisition
- **NIH Program Officers:** Discuss grant transfer feasibility for all 42 grants
- **NSF Program Officers:** Discuss 28 award transfers
- **DHHS Division of Cost Allocation:** Begin indirect cost rate renegotiation

**Cost:** Internal time + legal counsel ($50K-$100K)

**Outcome:** Regulatory clarity on transaction approval; identify deal-breaker issues early

---

**Recommendation 3: Structure Transaction to Preserve Federal Funding**

**Option A: For-Profit with Nonprofit Research Subsidiary**
- Create separate 501(c)(3) research institute
- Transfer non-transferable grants (T32, K01, P40) to subsidiary
- Subsidiary maintains fundamental research exemption
- For-profit parent provides infrastructure/support

**Advantages:**
- Preserves $28M NIH funding
- Maintains fundamental research exemption for sensitive research
- Separates ITAR research from commercial activities

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex structure requiring IRS approval
- Operational overhead (separate boards, finances, compliance)
- Transfer pricing scrutiny between entities

**Option B: Full For-Profit with Grant Relinquishment**
- Accept loss of non-transferable grants
- Transfer only eligible R01/R21 research grants
- Build new for-profit research funding model

**Advantages:**
- Simpler structure
- Clear separation from nonprofit constraints

**Disadvantages:**
- $10M-$20M funding loss
- Faculty attrition likely
- Research competitiveness reduced

**Recommendation:** **Pursue Option A** (nonprofit subsidiary) to preserve maximum federal funding.

**Recommendation 4: Enhance Export Control Compliance Program**

**Immediate Enhancements (Pre-Closing):**
- Increase export control staffing from 1 FTE to 3 FTE ($300K-$500K annually)
- Implement automated denied party screening system ($50K-$100K setup + $20K annual)
- Upgrade IT security for ITAR/EAR data ($200K-$400K)
- Revise Technology Control Plans for for-profit status ($50K legal fees)
- Obtain all missing deemed export licenses ($50K-$100K for 20 licenses)

**Ongoing Enhancements (Post-Closing):**
- Quarterly export control audits (vs. current annual)
- Enhanced training programs ($50K-$100K annually)
- Incident response protocols
- Continuous monitoring of Entity List updates

**Total Cost:** $700K-$1.3M annually (as calculated in Section E.6)

**Justification:** Necessary to mitigate $1M-$3M penalty exposure and avoid second ITAR violation

**Recommendation 5: Negotiate Protective Provisions in Acquisition Agreement**

**Purchase Agreement Provisions:**

a) **Regulatory Approval Condition Precedent:**
   - Closing conditioned on obtaining NIH/NSF grant transfer preliminary approvals
   - Closing conditioned on DDTC/BIS confirmation of fundamental research exemption eligibility

b) **Indemnification:**
   - Seller indemnifies buyer for any export control violations occurring before closing
   - Seller represents and warrants compliance with all ITAR/EAR requirements
   - Seller discloses all foreign national collaborations and Entity List connections

c) **Grant Funding Adjustment:**
   - Purchase price adjustment if >$5M in grants determined non-transferable
   - Earn-out tied to successful grant transfers within 12 months post-closing

d) **Indirect Cost Rate Protection:**
   - Seller negotiates and finalizes indirect cost rate agreement before closing
   - Purchase price adjustment if rate below 50%

e) **Transition Services:**
   - Seller's Export Control Officer (Dr. Patricia Anderson) retained for 12-month transition
   - Seller provides export control compliance support during transition

**Outcome:** Allocates risk appropriately; protects buyer from undisclosed compliance issues

**Recommendation 6: Address Iranian and Russian Nationals Immediately**

**Critical Action:** 8 Iranian and 5 Russian nationals subject to comprehensive export controls/sanctions.

**Steps:**
1. Determine current research activities and technology access for all 13 individuals
2. Verify exemption status (fundamental research, EAR99 items, or licensed)
3. If working on controlled technology without licenses: **Obtain licenses within 90 days** or **restrict access pending approval**
4. Review all Iranian/Russian researchers against OFAC SDN List
5. Document exemption rationale or license coverage for each individual

**Risk if Not Addressed:** Iran and Russia are comprehensively sanctioned/embargoed. Unlicensed access to controlled technology represents highest-risk violation category.

### C. Transaction Viability Assessment

**GO/NO-GO Decision Factors:**

| Factor | Status | Go/No-Go Impact |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Grant mechanism inventory shows <30% non-transferable** | 🟡 Unknown | ✅ GO if <30%; ❌ NO-GO if >50% |
| **DDTC/BIS confirm fundamental research exemption available** | 🟡 Unknown | ✅ GO if confirmed; ⚠️ CAUTION if uncertain |
| **Foreign national audit shows all 28 properly licensed or exempt** | 🟡 Unknown | ✅ GO if compliant; ❌ NO-GO if >5 ongoing violations |
| **No undisclosed Entity List collaborations** | 🟡 Unknown | ✅ GO if clean; ⚠️ CAUTION if limited connections |
| **NIH/NSF receptive to grant transfers** | 🟡 Unknown | ✅ GO if supportive; ⚠️ CAUTION if skeptical |
| **Indirect cost rate negotiable at ≥50%** | 🟡 Unknown | ✅ GO if ≥50%; ⚠️ CAUTION if 40-49% |

**Overall Assessment:** **CONDITIONAL PROCEED** - Transaction viable **only if**:
1. Compliance audits reveal no major ongoing violations
2. Federal agencies receptive to grant transfers and exemption maintenance
3. Non-transferable grants represent <30% of federal funding
4. Structural solution (nonprofit subsidiary) feasible

**Timeline:** **6-9 months** minimum from present to closing to complete all regulatory consultations, audits, and approvals.

### D. Financial Impact Summary

| Category | Best Case | Likely Case | Worst Case |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Grant Funding Loss** | $0 (all transfer) | $5M-$10M (T32/K01/P40 lost) | $20M+ (most grants lost) |
| **Indirect Cost Rate Impact** | $0 (maintain 56%) | $4M annual (reduced to 50%) | $8.3M annual (reduced to 40%) |
| **Export Control Penalties** | $0 (no violations) | $1M-$3M (1-2 violations discovered) | $25M+ (20 unlicensed foreign nationals) |
| **Enhanced Compliance Costs** | $200K annual (modest enhancements) | $700K annual (recommended program) | $1.3M annual (full program if exemption lost) |
| **One-Time Transaction Costs** | $200K (basic audits) | $500K-$750K (comprehensive audits + legal) | $1M+ (extensive remediation) |
| **TOTAL 5-YEAR IMPACT** | $1M-$2M | $25M-$50M | $100M+ |

**Conclusion:** Federal grant compliance and export control issues present **material transaction risks** requiring substantial due diligence, regulatory consultation, and enhanced compliance investments. Transaction remains viable with proper structuring (nonprofit subsidiary) and regulatory approvals, but **6-9 month timeline and $25M-$50M in likely impact costs** must be factored into valuation.
