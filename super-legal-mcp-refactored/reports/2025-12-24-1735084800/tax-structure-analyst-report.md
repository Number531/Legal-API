## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

**Project Athena—American Education Holdings' proposed $780 million acquisition of Midwest University—presents CRITICAL tax and financial viability concerns.** The conversion from 501(c)(3) nonprofit to for-profit status will trigger a **$32.7 million annual tax increase** (6,000% over current tax burden), consuming **73.5% of MU's pre-tax income.** After accounting for all taxes and debt service, MU will generate **negative cash flow**, raising fundamental questions about transaction viability absent substantial revenue increases or cost reductions.

**Key Findings:**
- **Annual Tax Burden:** $33.2M (vs. current $546K UBIT) = **6,000% increase**
- **Net Income Decline:** From $44.5M to $11.8M = **73.5% reduction**
- **Endowment One-Time Tax Exposure:** $103.6M if liquidated (avoidable via foundation structure)
- **Cash Flow After Taxes & Debt Service:** **NEGATIVE $6M annually**
- **Overall Risk Assessment:** **HIGH—Transaction may not be financially viable without fundamental business model changes**

### I.A. Comprehensive Tax Impact Summary

#### **Federal Income Tax Consequences**

**Loss of 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status:** Upon acquisition by AEH, MU will immediately lose tax-exempt status under IRC § 501(c)(3) and become subject to federal corporate income tax as a C corporation at 21% under IRC § 11(b).

**Current Federal Tax Profile:**
- MU currently pays $546,000 annually in Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) under IRC § 512 on auxiliary activities (bookstore, parking, advertising generating $2.6M taxable income)
- All core educational revenue ($680M) is tax-exempt

**Post-Conversion Federal Tax Profile:**
- ALL income becomes taxable (no distinction between educational and commercial revenue)
- Estimated taxable income: $45M (assuming no debt financing)
- Federal corporate income tax: $45M × 21% = **$9.45M annually**
- Quarterly estimated tax payments required under IRC § 6655

**Net Federal Tax Increase:** $8.9M annually ($9.45M - $546K current UBIT)

**With Recommended Debt Financing ($500M at 7% interest):**
- Interest expense: $35M annually
- IRC § 163(j) limits deduction to 30% of EBIT = $24M deductible
- Taxable income reduced to $21M ($45M - $24M)
- Federal tax: $21M × 21% = **$4.41M annually**
- Tax savings from leverage: $5.04M

**Critical Finding:** Debt financing provides significant tax benefit but creates $35M annual debt service obligation that MU cannot afford given overall tax burden.

#### **State and Local Tax Consequences (Indiana)**

**1. Indiana Corporate Income Tax (NEW)**
- Current: $0 (501(c)(3) organizations exempt)
- Post-conversion: 4.9% on adjusted gross income
- Estimated annual tax: $45M × 4.9% = **$2.2M** (no debt) or $21M × 4.9% = **$1.03M** (with debt)

**2. Property Tax Exemption Loss (MOST MATERIAL IMPACT)**
- Current: $0 (Indiana Code § 6-1.1-10-16 exempts educational property owned and operated by nonprofits "not used for profit")
- Post-conversion: **Complete loss of exemption** for all 250 acres, 85 buildings, 4.2M sq ft
- Assessed value: $650M
- Marion County effective commercial rate: 2.4%
- **Annual property tax: $15.6M**

This is the single largest tax increase and represents a **NEW operating expense** (property tax must be paid regardless of profitability).

**3. Sales Tax Exemption Loss**
- Current: $0 (Indiana Code § 6-2.5-5-21 exempts purchases by qualifying nonprofit educational institutions)
- Post-conversion: 7% Indiana sales tax applies to all purchases
- Annual taxable purchases: $85M (supplies, equipment, furniture, technology, construction materials)
- **Annual sales tax: $5.95M**

This represents another **NEW cash outflow** on every purchase.

**Total State/Local Tax Increase:** $23.75M annually

#### **Combined Annual Tax Burden**

| Tax Component | Current (Nonprofit) | With Debt Financing | Without Debt | Increase |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|----------|
| Federal income tax | $546,000 | $4,410,000 | $9,450,000 | +$3.86M / +$8.9M |
| Indiana corporate tax | $0 | $1,029,000 | $2,205,000 | +$1.03M / +$2.2M |
| Property tax | $0 | $15,600,000 | $15,600,000 | +$15.6M |
| Sales tax | $0 | $5,950,000 | $5,950,000 | +$5.95M |
| **TOTAL** | **$546,000** | **$26,989,000** | **$33,205,000** | **+$26.4M / +$32.7M** |

**Tax as % of Pre-Tax Income:** 60% (with debt) to 73.8% (without debt)

```

**CRITICAL FINDING: NEGATIVE CASH FLOW**

After paying all taxes and interest, MU will have **negative cash flow of approximately $6M annually.** This means:
- Cannot service debt principal payments
- Cannot fund capital improvements
- Cannot provide return to AEH investors
- Must draw on endowment liquidation proceeds or raise additional capital to fund ongoing losses

**Transaction is not financially viable under current business model.**

### I.C. Endowment Treatment: $65-73M Tax Decision

The $650M endowment represents the most consequential tax planning opportunity in the transaction. Two starkly different approaches:

#### **Option 1: Transfer to Private Foundation (RECOMMENDED)**

**Structure:**
- Form "Midwest University Foundation" as new 501(c)(3) private foundation 6-12 months pre-closing
- Transfer $468M in donor-restricted endowment funds tax-free (while MU still tax-exempt)
- Foundation files IRS Form 1023; classified as private foundation under IRC § 509
- For-profit MU retains $182M in board-designated (unrestricted) funds

**Tax Consequences:**
- **Transfer of $468M: TAX-FREE** (occurs while both entities are tax-exempt)
- Foundation pays 1.39% excise tax on net investment income (IRC § 4940): $306K annually
- Foundation must distribute 5% annually (IRC § 4942): $23.4M to support MU's educational mission
- If board-designated $182M liquidated: $30-38M capital gains tax (on proportional unrealized gains)

**Total One-Time Tax:** $30-38M (only on board-designated funds if liquidated)

**Advantages:**
- **Avoids $70-90M tax** on donor-restricted funds
- Preserves donor intent (critical for litigation risk management)
- Foundation investment returns taxed at 1.39% vs. 21% corporate rate
- Continued donor contributions possible (tax-deductible)
- $23.4M annual distribution supports MU programs

**Disadvantages:**
- AEH loses control of $468M
- Foundation board (not AEH) controls spending
- 5% mandatory distribution requirement
- Chapter 42 private foundation compliance burden (self-dealing prohibitions, excess business holdings rules)

#### **Option 2: Liquidate Endowment (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

**Structure:**
- For-profit MU retains entire $650M endowment
- Liquidate appreciated securities over time
- Pay capital gains tax on unrealized appreciation

**Tax Consequences:**
- Unrealized capital gains (estimated): $400M
- Federal corporate income tax (21%—C corps get NO capital gains preference): $84M
- Indiana corporate income tax (4.9%): $19.6M
- **Total tax on liquidation: $103.6M**

**Advantages:**
- AEH has complete control over proceeds
- No mandatory distributions
- Simplified administration (no foundation)

**Disadvantages:**
- **$103.6M tax hit** (16% of endowment value destroyed)
- **HIGH donor litigation risk** ($468M in restricted funds may not be legally available for for-profit use)
- Reputational damage ("raiding" educational endowment)
- Investment returns taxed at 21% going forward (vs. 1.39% in foundation)

#### **Recommended Bifurcated Approach**

**Transfer $468M donor-restricted funds to Foundation:**
- Tax savings: $70-90M (vs. liquidation)
- Legal protection: Honors donor intent
- Ongoing benefit: Tax-advantaged growth

**Retain $182M board-designated funds at MU:**
- No legal restrictions
- AEH control preserved
- Liquidate selectively as needed

**Net Tax Savings:** $65-73M one-time + ongoing 19.6% tax advantage on investment returns

### I.D. Critical Legal and Regulatory Risks

#### **1. Donor Litigation (HIGH PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)**

**Risk:** Donors who made restricted gifts may sue to prevent for-profit conversion or compel transfer of funds to continuing nonprofit entity.

**Legal Basis:**
- $468M in donor-restricted funds subject to legally binding restrictions
- Typical restrictions: Funds held in perpetuity, support nonprofit educational mission
- *Cy pres* doctrine: When donor intent becomes "impossible" to fulfill, courts redirect funds to nearest charitable purpose
- For-profit conversion arguably makes fulfilling nonprofit donor intent "impossible"

**Potential Outcomes:**
- Court injunction blocking transaction
- Forced transfer of restricted funds to nonprofit entity
- Return of funds to donors/donor estates
- Indiana Attorney General enforcement action (parens patriae for charitable assets)

**Probability:** HIGH if $468M retained by for-profit MU; LOW if transferred to Foundation

**Mitigation:** Transfer ALL donor-restricted funds to Foundation (non-negotiable)

#### **2. Accreditation Loss (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, CRITICAL IMPACT)**

**Risk:** Higher Learning Commission (regional accreditor) or U.S. Department of Education may challenge MU's accreditation upon for-profit conversion.

**Consequences:**
- Loss of accreditation = degrees not recognized, credits not transferable
- Loss of Title IV federal financial aid eligibility = 40-60% of students cannot afford tuition
- Enrollment collapse

**Historical Precedent:** Several nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions faced significant accreditation challenges (Grand Canyon University, others).

**Mitigation:**
- Engage HLC early in process (12+ months pre-closing)
- Obtain formal approval before closing
- Demonstrate commitment to educational quality
- Maintain faculty qualifications and resources

**Probability:** MEDIUM (accreditors skeptical of for-profit conversions but may approve with conditions)

**Impact:** CRITICAL (loss of accreditation terminates transaction viability)

#### **3. Cash Flow Insolvency (HIGH PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)**

**Risk:** Combined tax burden ($27-33M annually) plus debt service ($35M) exceeds MU's ability to generate cash.

**Analysis:**
- Current pre-tax income: $45M
- After all taxes: $11.8M (no debt) or negative (with debt)
- Debt service capacity: ZERO

**Required Business Model Changes:**
- Increase revenue: +$40M via tuition increases (13% tuition hike) or enrollment growth (20% more students)
- Reduce expenses: -$40M (25% expense reduction) = faculty/staff layoffs, program cuts
- Use endowment: Liquidate and use proceeds to fund losses for 10-15 years

**Probability:** HIGH absent radical business model transformation

**Impact:** HIGH—transaction fails within 2-3 years

#### **4. Enrollment Decline (MEDIUM PROBABILITY, HIGH IMPACT)**

**Risk:** For-profit status reduces enrollment due to:
- Perceived quality decline
- Loss of "nonprofit" prestige
- Reduced financial aid
- Negative media coverage

**Historical Precedent:** Several conversions experienced 20-40% enrollment decline in years following conversion.

**Impact on Financials:**
- 20% enrollment decline = 3,680 students lost
- Revenue loss: $110M (at $30K average tuition)
- **Completely destroys financial model**

**Probability:** MEDIUM (depends on communication strategy and market reaction)

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain educational quality
- Preserve financial aid programs
- Aggressive marketing
- Transparent stakeholder communication

### I.E. Deal Structure Recommendations

Based on comprehensive tax analysis, the following structure minimizes tax burden while managing legal risks:

#### **1. Endowment: Bifurcated Structure**
- **Transfer $468M donor-restricted** to Midwest University Foundation (private foundation)
- **Retain $182M board-designated** at for-profit MU
- **Tax Savings:** $65-73M one-time + ongoing

#### **2. Transaction Form: Stock Purchase with IRC § 338(g) Election**
- Structure as stock purchase (legal simplicity, regulatory ease)
- Elect § 338(g) to obtain step-up in asset basis to $780M
- IF deemed sale occurs while MU tax-exempt, gain is tax-free
- **Tax Benefit:** $3.4M annually in depreciation/amortization deductions over asset lives

**Caveat:** § 338(g) for nonprofit target is novel; requires IRS Private Letter Ruling (~$50-100K, 6-12 months)

#### **3. Financing: Optimize Debt/Equity Ratio**
- **Recommended:** $500M debt / $280M equity
- Interest expense: $35M annually
- IRC § 163(j) limits deduction to $24M (30% of EBIT)
- **Tax Savings:** $5.2M annually from interest deduction

**Critical Issue:** $35M annual debt service unaffordable given overall cash flow constraint. Alternatives:
- Lower debt level ($300M max = $21M interest, fully deductible under § 163(j))
- Holdco debt structure (AEH borrows, MU remains unlever ed)
- Payment-in-kind (PIK) interest for first 3-5 years (deferred cash payment)

#### **4. Closing Date: January 1**
- Avoids short-year tax return complexity
- MU files Form 990 for full prior year (nonprofit)
- MU files Form 1120 for full current year (taxable)

#### **5. Retirement Plans: 403(b) to 401(k) Conversion**
- Establish 401(k) effective at closing
- Offer tax-free rollover to employees
- Complete within 12 months

#### **6. Regulatory Approvals: Secure Before Closing**
- Higher Learning Commission (accreditation)
- U.S. Department of Education (Title IV)
- Indiana Commission for Higher Education

### I.F. Alternative Structure: Management Services Organization (MSO)

**IF full acquisition proves financially unfeasible**, AEH should consider:

**Structure:**
- MU remains 501(c)(3) nonprofit
- AEH forms for-profit MSO
- MSO provides management services under long-term contract
- MSO charges fee (10-15% of revenue = $68-102M)

**Tax Advantages:**
- MU preserves ALL tax exemptions (federal, state, local)
- No property tax: **$15.6M savings**
- No sales tax: **$5.95M savings**
- MU retains Title IV financial aid eligibility
- No donor litigation risk

**Trade-offs:**
- AEH does not own MU
- MSO profit taxed at 25.9% combined rate
- Less control than ownership

**Precedent:** Widely used in nonprofit hospital sector (Norton Healthcare, Catholic hospital systems)

**Recommendation:** Model MSO structure as **fallback option** if acquisition proves non-viable.

### I.G. Timeline and Professional Fees

**12-18 Months Pre-Closing:**
- Form Foundation, file Form 1023 (3-6 months processing)
- Engage accreditors and regulators
- File IRS Private Letter Rulings
- Conduct tax due diligence

**6 Months Pre-Closing:**
- Finalize endowment transfer agreements
- Establish 401(k) plan
- Draft purchase agreement with tax provisions

**At Closing:**
- Execute all transfers and elections
- File final Form 990, initial Form 1120

**Professional Fees Estimate:** $2-5 million
- M&A tax counsel (Big 4 or national law firm): $1-2M
- Higher education regulatory counsel: $500K-1M
- Nonprofit/charitable trusts counsel: $300-500K
- Valuation and transfer pricing: $200-400K
- IRS PLRs: $50-100K per ruling

### I.H. Final Recommendation: Proceed with Extreme Caution or Consider Alternatives

**Transaction Viability Assessment:** **MARGINAL TO NON-VIABLE** under current assumptions.

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Cash flow insolvency:** Negative $6M annually with debt; only $11.8M without debt (insufficient for $780M investment)
2. **Tax burden:** 73.5% of pre-tax income consumed by taxes
3. **Donor litigation risk:** HIGH if endowment not properly structured
4. **Accreditation risk:** MEDIUM probability of denial/conditions
5. **Enrollment risk:** Potential 20-40% decline destroys financial model

**Required for Transaction Success:**
- **Revenue increases:** +40% tuition or +20% enrollment
- **Expense reductions:** -25% operating costs
- OR: **Alternative MSO structure** preserving tax exemptions

**Recommended Course of Action:**

1. **Model MSO Alternative:** Calculate AEH's return via management fees vs. equity ownership
2. **If Acquisition Preferred:** Secure regulatory approvals BEFORE spending $2-5M on transaction costs
3. **Endowment Non-Negotiable:** Transfer $468M to Foundation (not optional from legal risk perspective)
4. **Financing:** Lower debt to $300M max or use Holdco structure
5. **Business Plan:** Develop concrete revenue growth/expense reduction plan achieving 30%+ margin improvement

**Bottom Line:** This is not a routine M&A transaction. The tax consequences are severe, the legal risks are high, and the financial viability is questionable. AEH should only proceed if prepared to fundamentally transform MU's business model and absorb significant transition risks.

**The tax burden alone may render this transaction economically unviable as currently structured.**

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. IRC § 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status: Requirements and Loss of Exemption

#### 1. Statutory Framework for Tax Exemption

Under IRC § 501(c)(3), organizations may qualify for federal income tax exemption if they are "organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes."¹ Educational institutions like Midwest University typically qualify under the "educational purposes" prong of this statute.

**Key Requirements for 501(c)(3) Status:**²

| Requirement | Description | MU Current Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Organizational Test** | Articles of incorporation must limit purposes to exempt purposes and permanently dedicate assets to exempt purposes | ✓ Met (organized 1945) |
| **Operational Test** | Must be operated exclusively for exempt purposes; no substantial part of activities may be non-exempt | ✓ Met (educational operations) |
| **Private Benefit Prohibition** | No part of net earnings may inure to benefit of private shareholders/individuals | ✓ Met (nonprofit structure) |
| **Lobbying Limitation** | No substantial part of activities may constitute lobbying | ✓ Met (educational focus) |
| **Political Campaign Prohibition** | Absolute prohibition on campaign intervention | ✓ Met (nonpartisan) |

**Educational Purpose Definition:**

The IRS defines "educational" purposes broadly to include:³
- Instruction or training of individuals for purpose of improving or developing their capabilities
- Instruction of the public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to the community
- Operation of educational institutions including colleges and universities

Midwest University clearly satisfies this definition through its operation of a degree-granting university serving 18,400 students.

#### 2. Mechanics of Losing Tax-Exempt Status

Upon acquisition by American Education Holdings, a for-profit corporation, Midwest University will lose its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status through one of two mechanisms:

**Option 1: Automatic Termination Upon Change in Ownership**

When a tax-exempt organization is acquired by a for-profit entity, the exempt organization ceases to meet the organizational and operational tests required by IRC § 501(c)(3).⁴ Specifically:

- The "organizational test" fails because the entity is no longer organized exclusively for exempt purposes—it is now organized to generate returns for shareholders
- The "operational test" fails because operations will be conducted to benefit private shareholders (AEH investors), violating the private inurement prohibition
- Assets are no longer permanently dedicated to charitable purposes

**Option 2: Voluntary Termination Under IRC § 507**

Alternatively, MU could voluntarily terminate its 501(c)(3) status prior to or concurrent with the acquisition. However, this approach is generally not used for public charities like universities (as distinguished from private foundations).

**Timing of Status Change:**

Tax-exempt status terminates effective on the date of the ownership change (closing date).⁵ This creates a "short tax year" requiring:
- Final Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax) covering January 1 through closing date
- Initial Form 1120 (U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return) covering closing date through December 31

#### 3. Consequences of Loss of Exemption

The loss of 501(c)(3) status triggers multiple tax consequences:

**Federal Income Tax:** MU will become subject to federal corporate income tax under IRC § 11 at a 21% rate on all taxable income.⁶ This represents a fundamental shift from exempt status to full taxation.

**State Income Tax:** MU will become subject to Indiana corporate income tax at 4.9%.⁷ Indiana provides that nonprofit educational institutions certified as 501(c)(3) organizations are exempt from state corporate income tax, but this exemption will be lost upon conversion.

**Property Tax Exemption Loss:** Under Indiana Code § 6-1.1-10-16, property tax exemption requires that property be "owned, occupied, and used" for educational purposes and "not used for profit."⁸ Conversion to for-profit ownership terminates this exemption.

**Sales Tax Exemption Loss:** Indiana Code § 6-2.5-5-21 provides sales tax exemptions for purchases by organizations "organized and operated exclusively for educational purposes" where "no part of its net income is used for the private benefit of any person."⁹ For-profit status disqualifies MU from this exemption.

**Loss of Donor Tax Deductibility:** Contributions to MU will no longer be tax-deductible for donors under IRC § 170, severely impairing fundraising capabilities.¹⁰

**Grant Eligibility:** Most private foundations and government grant programs require grantees to be 501(c)(3) organizations. Loss of this status will disqualify MU from most grant opportunities.¹¹

---

### B. Federal Income Tax Implications: From Exempt to Taxable

#### 1. Corporate Income Tax Under IRC § 11

Upon conversion to for-profit status, MU will be subject to federal corporate income tax as a C corporation. IRC § 11(b) imposes tax at a flat rate of 21% on taxable income.¹²

**Estimated Annual Federal Tax Liability:**

Based on MU's current financial performance:

```
Annual Revenue:                           $680,000,000
Annual Expenses:                          $635,000,000
Net Income (Pre-Tax):                     $ 45,000,000

Federal Corporate Income Tax (21%):       $  9,450,000

Net Income (After Federal Tax):           $ 35,550,000
```

**Key Assumptions in Calculation:**

- Revenue and expense figures remain constant post-acquisition
- No additional deductions are available (conservative estimate)
- Does not account for potential interest deductions if acquisition is debt-financed
- Assumes calendar year taxpayer

#### 2. Quarterly Estimated Tax Payment Obligations

Under IRC § 6655, corporations must make quarterly estimated tax payments.¹³ Failure to do so results in underpayment penalties.

**Payment Schedule (Calendar Year Taxpayer):**

| Installment | Due Date | Amount |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| 1st Quarter | April 15 | $2,362,500 (25% of annual tax) |
| 2nd Quarter | June 15 | $2,362,500 |
| 3rd Quarter | September 15 | $2,362,500 |
| 4th Quarter | December 15 | $2,362,500 |

**Safe Harbor Rules:**

Corporations can avoid penalties by paying the lesser of:
- 100% of current year tax liability
- 100% of prior year tax liability (not available for "large corporations" with taxable income ≥ $1 million)¹⁴

Since MU will be a "large corporation" immediately (taxable income of $45 million far exceeds $1 million threshold), it cannot use the prior year safe harbor except for the first installment in year one.

**First Year Complications:**

In the year of conversion, MU will need to carefully calculate estimated tax payments based on:
- Zero federal tax liability for pre-closing period (while still tax-exempt)
- Pro-rated tax liability for post-closing period (as taxable entity)

This creates complexity in determining the required installment amounts to avoid penalties.

#### 3. Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) Analysis

**Current UBIT Exposure:**

As a 501(c)(3) organization, MU is currently subject to Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) under IRC § 512 on income from activities not substantially related to its exempt purpose.¹⁵

MU's current UBIT activities include:

| Activity | Taxable Income | Tax at 21% | Notes |
|----------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Bookstore sales (non-educational items) | $1,200,000 | $252,000 | Clothing, gifts, non-textbook items |
| Parking operations (general public) | $780,000 | $163,800 | Parking for non-students/staff |
| Advertising revenue | $620,000 | $130,200 | Corporate sponsorships, ads |
| **Total UBIT** | **$2,600,000** | **$546,000** | Filed on Form 990-T |

**Post-Conversion Treatment:**

After conversion to for-profit status, the concept of UBIT becomes irrelevant. All income—whether from educational activities or auxiliary services—is taxed as ordinary corporate income.¹⁶ There is no distinction between "related" and "unrelated" business income for taxable corporations.

**Net Tax Increase from UBIT Expansion:**

```
Total corporate income tax (all income):    $9,450,000
Less: Current UBIT on auxiliary services:      $546,000
                                            ___________
Net incremental federal tax burden:         $8,904,000
```

This $8.9 million increase represents the taxation of MU's previously exempt educational operations (tuition, fees, grants, contracts, etc.).

#### 4. Research Income Implications

Under IRC § 512(b)(7) and (b)(8), universities enjoy special exclusions from UBIT for research income:¹⁷

- Research performed for the United States or any governmental entity (§ 512(b)(7))
- All research performed by colleges and universities (§ 512(b)(8))

Post-conversion, these exclusions no longer apply. Research contracts that currently generate tax-free revenue will become fully taxable. If MU has significant sponsored research revenue, this could materially increase the tax burden beyond the $9.45 million estimate.

**Recommendation:** AEH should conduct detailed analysis of MU's research revenue to quantify this additional exposure.

---

### C. State and Local Tax Consequences (Indiana)

#### 1. Indiana Corporate Income Tax

**Tax Rate and Base:**

Indiana imposes corporate income tax at 4.9% on adjusted gross income.¹⁸ Currently, MU is exempt from this tax as a certified 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational institution.¹⁹

**Estimated Annual Indiana Corporate Income Tax:**

```
Taxable Income (same as federal):           $45,000,000
Indiana Corporate Income Tax Rate:                 4.9%
                                            ___________
Annual Indiana Corporate Income Tax:        $ 2,205,000
```

**Combined Federal and State Income Tax:**

```
Federal corporate income tax:               $ 9,450,000
Indiana corporate income tax:               $ 2,205,000
                                            ___________
Total income tax burden:                    $11,655,000
```

This represents 25.9% effective tax rate on pre-tax income ($11,655,000 ÷ $45,000,000).

**Net Income After All Income Taxes:**

```
Pre-tax net income:                         $45,000,000
Less: Federal and state income tax:         $11,655,000
                                            ___________
After-tax net income:                       $33,345,000
```

#### 2. Property Tax Exemption Loss

**Current Exemption Status:**

Indiana Code § 6-1.1-10-16 provides property tax exemption for buildings "owned, occupied, and used" for educational purposes.²⁰ The statute requires that:

- Property must be owned by an educational institution
- Property must be occupied and used for educational purposes
- Property must be "predominantly used" (>50% of the time) for exempt purposes
- Property must not be "used for profit"²¹

MU currently satisfies all requirements and pays zero property tax on its 250-acre campus.

**Loss of Exemption Upon For-Profit Conversion:**

The critical requirement that property "not be used for profit" will be violated upon acquisition by AEH.²² Indiana courts have consistently held that property operated by a for-profit entity, even if used for educational activities, does not qualify for exemption.²³

**Property Subject to Taxation:**

| Property Category | Square Footage | Estimated Assessed Value |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Academic buildings | 2,100,000 | $300,000,000 |
| Student housing | 980,000 | $150,000,000 |
| Administrative offices | 420,000 | $60,000,000 |
| Athletic facilities | 350,000 | $50,000,000 |
| Auxiliary buildings (bookstore, dining) | 280,000 | $40,000,000 |
| Research facilities | 70,000 | $50,000,000 |
| **Total Buildings** | **4,200,000** | **$650,000,000** |
| Land (250 acres) | — | Included above |

**Marion County Property Tax Rate:**

Marion County (Indianapolis) property tax rates vary by taxing district, but the median effective rate is approximately 1.19%.²⁴ For commercial property in Indianapolis, rates typically range from 2.0% to 2.6% depending on location and taxing district.²⁵

**Conservative Estimate:** Using a 2.4% rate (within the commercial range):

```
Total Assessed Value:                       $650,000,000
Marion County Commercial Tax Rate:                  2.4%
                                            _______________
Estimated Annual Property Tax:              $ 15,600,000
```

**Property Tax Payment Schedule:**

Indiana property taxes are paid in two installments:
- May 10 (for taxes due on January 1 assessment)
- November 10 (second installment)

**First Year Complications:**

Property tax exemption terminates when "the property is conveyed by the nonprofit organization to another owner."²⁶ If closing occurs mid-year, MU may face pro-rated property tax for the portion of the year under for-profit ownership, though Indiana property tax mechanics may require full-year assessment depending on the assessment date and ownership as of that date.

#### 3. Sales Tax Exemption Loss

**Current Exemption Status:**

Indiana Code § 6-2.5-5-21 exempts purchases by nonprofit organizations from the 7% state sales tax, provided:²⁷

- The organization is organized and operated exclusively for educational purposes
- No part of its net income is used for private benefit
- Property purchased is used to carry on the nonprofit purpose
- Transaction is invoiced and paid directly by the organization

MU currently qualifies for this exemption on approximately $85 million in annual purchases.

**Loss of Exemption Upon For-Profit Conversion:**

For-profit entities do not qualify for the nonprofit sales tax exemption, regardless of whether they provide educational services.²⁸ Indiana does not provide sales tax exemption for for-profit educational institutions (except limited exemptions for early childhood education providers meeting specific requirements under IC § 6-1.1-10-46).²⁹

**Estimated Annual Sales Tax Liability:**

```
Annual Taxable Purchases:                   $85,000,000
Indiana Sales Tax Rate:                             7.0%
                                            ______________
Estimated Annual Sales Tax:                 $ 5,950,000
```

**Categories of Purchases Subject to Tax:**

| Category | Annual Purchases | Sales Tax (7%) |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Supplies and materials | $25,000,000 | $1,750,000 |
| Equipment purchases | $18,000,000 | $1,260,000 |
| Furniture and fixtures | $8,000,000 | $560,000 |
| Technology and computers | $12,000,000 | $840,000 |
| Construction materials | $15,000,000 | $1,050,000 |
| Other taxable services | $7,000,000 | $490,000 |
| **Total** | **$85,000,000** | **$5,950,000** |

**Non-Taxable Purchases:**

Certain items remain exempt from sales tax regardless of purchaser status:
- Purchases for resale (bookstore inventory)
- Certain food items
- Some services (professional services generally not subject to sales tax in Indiana)

**Sales Tax Registration and Compliance:**

Upon conversion, MU must:
- Register for sales tax collection if making retail sales
- Cease using Form NP-1 (nonprofit exemption certificate)³⁰
- Pay sales tax on all qualifying purchases
- File monthly or quarterly sales tax returns with Indiana Department of Revenue

#### 4. Summary of State and Local Tax Impact

**Total Annual State and Local Tax Burden:**

| Tax Type | Current (Exempt) | Post-Conversion | Increase |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Indiana corporate income tax | $0 | $2,205,000 | $2,205,000 |
| Property tax (Marion County) | $0 | $15,600,000 | $15,600,000 |
| Sales tax on purchases | $0 | $5,950,000 | $5,950,000 |
| **Total State/Local** | **$0** | **$23,755,000** | **$23,755,000** |

**Combined Federal, State, and Local Tax Impact:**

| Tax Type | Annual Liability |
|----------|------------------|
| Federal corporate income tax | $9,450,000 |
| Indiana corporate income tax | $2,205,000 |
| Property tax | $15,600,000 |
| Sales tax | $5,950,000 |
| **Total Annual Tax Burden** | **$33,205,000** |

**Net Income Impact:**

```
Current pre-tax net income:                 $45,000,000
Less: Current UBIT:                            $546,000
                                            ___________
Current after-tax net income:               $44,454,000

Post-conversion pre-tax net income:         $45,000,000
Less: Federal income tax:                    $9,450,000
Less: State income tax:                      $2,205,000
Less: Property tax (operating expense):     $15,600,000
Less: Sales tax (operating expense):         $5,950,000
                                            ___________
Post-conversion after-tax income:           $11,795,000

NET INCOME REDUCTION:                       $32,659,000 (73.5%)
```

**Critical Finding:** The combined tax burden of $33.2 million annually represents 73.5% of MU's current pre-tax net income. After-tax income will decline from $44.5 million to $11.8 million—a 73.5% reduction.

### D. Endowment Tax Treatment: Critical Strategic Decision

The treatment of MU's $650 million endowment represents the most consequential tax decision in the Project Athena transaction. Two primary options exist, each with dramatically different tax and operational implications.

#### 1. Endowment Overview and Composition

**Total Endowment Value:** $650,000,000

| Component | Amount | Percentage | Restrictions |
|-----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Donor-restricted funds | $468,000,000 | 72% | Legally restricted per donor gift agreements |
| Board-designated funds | $182,000,000 | 28% | Quasi-endowment; no legal restrictions |

**Estimated Cost Basis and Unrealized Gains:**

Assuming the endowment has been accumulated over MU's 79-year history (since 1945) with consistent investment returns, a reasonable estimate of unrealized capital gains is approximately $400 million:

```
Current Fair Market Value:              $650,000,000
Estimated Cost Basis:                   $250,000,000
                                        _____________
Unrealized Capital Gains:               $400,000,000
```

This assumes an average cost basis of approximately 38.5% of current value, consistent with long-term institutional endowments holding diversified portfolios.

#### 2. Option 1: Transfer Endowment to New Private Foundation

**Structure:**

- Form a new 501(c)(3) organization: "Midwest University Foundation" (the "Foundation")
- Transfer the $468 million in donor-restricted endowment funds to the Foundation
- Foundation applies for tax-exempt status via IRS Form 1023
- Foundation classified as private foundation under IRC § 509(a)
- For-profit MU retains $182 million in board-designated (unrestricted) funds

**Tax Treatment of Transfer:**

Under IRC § 501(c)(3), a transfer of assets from one tax-exempt organization to another tax-exempt organization can be accomplished tax-free if structured properly.³¹ The key requirements:

- Transferor (MU) must be tax-exempt at time of transfer (occurs before or simultaneously with for-profit conversion)
- Transferee (Foundation) must qualify for 501(c)(3) exemption
- Transfer must comply with state nonprofit corporation law
- Donor restrictions must be preserved (critical for donor-restricted funds)

**Form 1023 Application Process:**³²

The Foundation must file Form 1023 (Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3)) including:

- Part I: Identification of applicant
- Part II: Organizational structure (articles of incorporation, bylaws)
- Part VII: Foundation classification (will be private foundation under § 509(a))
- Part VIII: Financial data (projected endowment income and distributions)
- Part X: Qualification as supporting organization (if applicable—not likely here)

**Processing Time:** 3-6 months for IRS determination letter.³³ Foundation should apply well in advance of closing to ensure tax-exempt status is confirmed.

**Private Foundation Classification Under IRC § 509:**³⁴

The Foundation will be classified as a private foundation because it will not meet any of the "public charity" exceptions under § 509(a)(1)-(4):

- **Not § 509(a)(1):** Not a church, school, hospital, or publicly-supported charity
- **Not § 509(a)(2):** Does not receive substantial support from general public or governmental units
- **Not § 509(a)(3):** Not a supporting organization for another public charity
- **Not § 509(a)(4):** Not organized exclusively for testing for public safety

As a private foundation, the Foundation becomes subject to Chapter 42 excise taxes.

#### 3. Private Foundation Excise Taxes and Compliance Burdens

**IRC § 4940: Excise Tax on Net Investment Income³⁵**

The Foundation must pay 1.39% excise tax on net investment income:

```
Estimated Annual Investment Income (5% of $468M):    $23,400,000
Net Investment Income (after investment expenses):    $22,000,000 (est.)
Excise Tax Rate (IRC § 4940):                              1.39%
                                                      ____________
Annual Excise Tax (§ 4940):                          $   305,800
```

**IRC § 4942: Minimum Distribution Requirement³⁶**

Private foundations must distribute at least 5% of the fair market value of non-charitable-use assets annually for charitable purposes:

```
Fair Market Value of Endowment:                      $468,000,000
Minimum Distribution Percentage:                              5%
                                                      ____________
Annual Minimum Distribution Requirement:             $ 23,400,000
```

The Foundation must make "qualifying distributions" of at least $23.4 million annually to support MU's educational mission or other charitable purposes.

**Penalty for Non-Compliance:** 30% excise tax on undistributed income (first-tier tax); 100% tax if not corrected (second-tier tax).³⁷

**IRC § 4941: Self-Dealing Prohibitions³⁸**

The Foundation cannot engage in any "acts of self-dealing" with "disqualified persons," including:

- Sale, exchange, or leasing of property between Foundation and AEH/MU
- Lending of money or extension of credit
- Furnishing of goods, services, or facilities
- Payment of compensation
- Transfer to or use by Foundation of income or assets for benefit of disqualified person

**Penalty:** 10% excise tax on disqualified person; 5% on foundation manager if knowingly participated; 200% and 50% second-tier taxes if not corrected.

**Critical Constraint:** The Foundation cannot simply distribute all funds back to for-profit MU for any purpose AEH desires. Distributions must be for charitable/educational purposes consistent with donor intent.

**IRC § 4943: Excess Business Holdings³⁹**

The Foundation generally cannot hold more than 20% of the voting stock of a business enterprise. If the endowment includes holdings in AEH or related entities, this could trigger excess business holdings tax.

**IRC § 4944: Jeopardy Investments⁴⁰**

Investments that jeopardize carrying out exempt purposes are prohibited. Foundation must maintain prudent investment policies.

**IRC § 4945: Taxable Expenditures⁴¹**

Foundation must ensure expenditures are for charitable purposes and maintain proper grant-making procedures, including expenditure responsibility for grants to non-public charities.

**Advantages of Foundation Structure:**

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tax-exempt investment returns | Foundation pays zero federal income tax on investment gains (only 1.39% excise tax) |
| Preservation of donor intent | Donor restrictions honored; reduces litigation risk |
| Continued charitable contributions | Donors can continue making tax-deductible gifts to Foundation |
| Asset protection | Foundation assets insulated from AEH creditors |
| Reputational benefit | Demonstrates commitment to educational mission |

**Disadvantages of Foundation Structure:**

| Disadvantage | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Loss of AEH control | AEH cannot access $468M for any purpose; Foundation board controls |
| 5% mandatory distribution | $23.4M annually must be distributed for charitable purposes |
| Excise taxes | $306K annually in § 4940 tax |
| Complex compliance | Chapter 42 excise tax rules create administrative burden |
| Restricted distributions | Cannot simply transfer funds to for-profit MU for business purposes |

#### 4. Option 2: Liquidate Endowment and Pay Capital Gains Tax

**Structure:**

- For-profit MU retains entire $650 million endowment
- Liquidate endowment investments over time
- Pay capital gains tax on appreciation
- Use proceeds for any corporate purpose (no charitable restrictions)

**Tax Consequences of Liquidation:**

Upon liquidation of appreciated endowment assets, MU (as a C corporation) will recognize capital gain equal to the difference between sale proceeds and cost basis.

**Critical Tax Treatment for C Corporations:**

Unlike individuals, C corporations do NOT receive preferential capital gains tax rates. Capital gains are taxed at the ordinary corporate income tax rate of 21%.⁴²

```
Estimated Unrealized Capital Gains:                 $400,000,000
Federal Corporate Income Tax (21%):                  $84,000,000
Indiana Corporate Income Tax (4.9%):                  $19,600,000
                                                     ____________
Total Tax on Liquidation:                           $103,600,000
```

**Timing Considerations:**

MU need not liquidate all positions immediately. The tax is triggered upon sale of individual positions:

- Long-term positions (held >1 year): 21% federal rate
- Short-term positions (held ≤1 year): 21% federal rate (same as ordinary income)

However, maintaining the endowment in appreciated securities defers tax but creates basis "buildup" risk if positions continue appreciating.

**Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT):**

C corporations are NOT subject to AMT as of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.⁴³ Therefore, no AMT adjustment applies to capital gains.

**Net Proceeds Available to AEH:**

```
Endowment Fair Market Value:                        $650,000,000
Less: Federal capital gains tax (21%):               ($84,000,000)
Less: Indiana capital gains tax (4.9%):              ($19,600,000)
                                                     _____________
Net After-Tax Proceeds:                              $546,400,000
```

**Alternative: Phased Liquidation Strategy**

Rather than immediate liquidation, AEH could:

1. Retain endowment in investment portfolio
2. Take annual distributions to fund operations
3. Pay capital gains tax only on positions sold each year
4. Defer tax on unrealized appreciation until positions are liquidated

This approach defers the $103.6 million tax hit but limits access to the capital embedded in the endowment.

**Advantages of Liquidation/Retention:**

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Full AEH control | AEH can use all proceeds for any corporate purpose |
| No mandatory distributions | No 5% payout requirement |
| No excise taxes | No Chapter 42 private foundation taxes |
| Simplified administration | No Form 990-PF filing, no foundation compliance |
| Flexibility | Can invest funds in AEH business needs, debt paydown, etc. |

**Disadvantages of Liquidation/Retention:**

| Disadvantage | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Massive tax hit | $103.6M in federal and state capital gains tax |
| Donor litigation risk | Donor-restricted funds may not be legally available |
| Reputational damage | Public backlash against "raiding" educational endowment |
| Loss of tax-advantaged growth | Investment returns taxable at 21% (vs. 1.39% for foundation) |
| No charitable deduction | Donors cannot make tax-deductible contributions |

#### 5. Donor-Restricted Funds: Legal Constraints

**Critical Legal Issue:** The $468 million in donor-restricted endowment funds are subject to legally binding restrictions imposed by donors at the time of the gift.⁴⁴

**Typical Donor Restrictions:**

- Funds must be held in perpetuity (true endowment)
- Only investment income may be spent
- Spending limited to specific purposes (scholarships, professorships, program support)
- Funds must benefit MU's educational mission

**Legal Doctrine: Cy Pres⁴⁵**

When it becomes "impossible" or "impractical" to fulfill donor restrictions, courts may apply the *cy pres* doctrine to modify restrictions to achieve purposes "as near as possible" to donor intent.

**Application to For-Profit Conversion:**

If MU converts to for-profit status, it arguably becomes "impossible" to fulfill donor intent that funds support a nonprofit educational mission. Courts could apply *cy pres* to require:

- Transfer of funds to another nonprofit institution
- Transfer to a private foundation dedicated to educational purposes
- Return of funds to donors (or donor estates)

**Donor Litigation Risk:**

Donors (or their estates, or state attorneys general acting as parens patriae) could sue to:

- Enjoin the transaction
- Require transfer of restricted funds to a nonprofit entity
- Seek damages for breach of charitable trust

**Recommendation:** Transfer donor-restricted funds to Foundation to preserve donor intent and minimize litigation risk.

**Board-Designated Funds ($182M):**

The $182 million in board-designated funds are NOT legally restricted. The MU board has discretion to "undesignate" these funds and use them for any lawful purpose, including supporting for-profit operations or distributing to AEH.⁴⁶ These funds can be retained by for-profit MU without legal impediment.

#### 6. IRC § 4968: Endowment Excise Tax (Not Applicable Post-Conversion)

IRC § 4968 imposes a 1.4% excise tax on the net investment income of certain private colleges and universities with endowments exceeding $500,000 per student.⁴⁷

**MU Current Status:**

```
Endowment:                                          $650,000,000
Students:                                                 18,400
Endowment Per Student:                              $    35,326
```

MU's endowment per student ($35,326) is far below the $500,000 threshold. Therefore, MU is NOT currently subject to § 4968 excise tax.

**Post-Conversion Status:**

IRC § 4968 applies only to organizations "exempt from taxation under section 501(a)."⁴⁸ Upon conversion to for-profit status, MU loses § 501(a) exemption and § 4968 no longer applies.

**Tiered Rate Structure (Effective 2026):**⁴⁹

As amended by P.L. 119-21 (effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025), § 4968 now includes tiered rates:

- 1.4% for endowments $500K-$750K per student
- 4% for endowments $750K-$2M per student
- 8% for endowments >$2M per student

MU remains well below all thresholds, so this is not a concern either before or after conversion (and is irrelevant post-conversion since § 4968 only applies to § 501(a) organizations).

#### 7. Recommended Endowment Structure

**Recommendation:**

- **Transfer $468M donor-restricted funds to Midwest University Foundation (new private foundation)**
  - Avoids $90M-$103M capital gains tax on these funds
  - Preserves donor intent and minimizes litigation risk
  - Maintains tax-exempt investment returns (1.39% excise tax vs. 21% corporate tax on gains)
  - Allows continued donor contributions
  - Foundation supports MU through grants and scholarships ($23.4M annually via 5% distribution)

- **Retain $182M board-designated funds at for-profit MU**
  - No legal restrictions on use
  - AEH has full control for business purposes
  - Pay capital gains tax only if/when positions are liquidated
  - Estimated tax if fully liquidated: $30M-$38M (on proportional unrealized gains)

**Net Tax Savings vs. Full Liquidation:**

```
Tax if all funds liquidated by for-profit MU:       $103,600,000
Tax if donor-restricted funds in Foundation:        $      305,800 (annual excise tax)
Tax if board-designated retained & selectively liquidated: $30-38M (one-time)
                                                     ______________
Net Tax Savings (Foundation Structure):             $ 65-73M (one-time) + ongoing tax-advantaged growth
```

**Strategic Considerations:**

The Foundation structure sacrifices AEH control over $468M in exchange for:
- $65-73M in immediate tax savings
- Ongoing tax-advantaged growth (21% corporate tax avoided on investment returns)
- Legal protection from donor litigation
- Reputational benefits
- $23.4M annual support for MU's educational mission (via Foundation grants)

This is the optimal structure from both a tax minimization and legal risk management perspective.

### E. Employee Benefit Plan Transitions

#### 1. Retirement Plan Conversion: 403(b) to 401(k)

**Current Plan Structure:**

As a 501(c)(3) educational institution, MU currently offers 403(b) retirement plans to employees. IRC § 403(b) provides for "tax-sheltered annuity plans" exclusively available to:⁵⁰

- Employees of public schools
- Employees of 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations
- Certain ministers

**Post-Conversion Requirement:**

Upon conversion to for-profit status, MU loses eligibility to maintain 403(b) plans.⁵¹ The organization must convert to 401(k) plans, which are available to for-profit employers.

**Conversion Process:**⁵²

1. **Freeze 403(b) Plan:** Stop new contributions; maintain accounts for existing balances
2. **Establish 401(k) Plan:** Adopt 401(k) plan document and trust
3. **Employee Rollover:** Employees can roll over 403(b) balances to 401(k) via direct rollover
4. **IRS Compliance:** Ensure all conversions comply with IRC § 403(b) and § 401(k) distribution rules

**Tax Consequences to Employees:**

If properly structured as a direct rollover, employees will incur ZERO tax on the transfer of 403(b) balances to 401(k) accounts.⁵³ The funds remain tax-deferred until distributed in retirement.

**Employer Matching Obligations:**

AEH must decide whether to maintain MU's current employer matching formula or modify it. Any reduction in benefits could impact employee relations and retention.

**Timeline:**

The conversion should be completed within the first year following acquisition. The transition requires 6-12 months of planning and implementation.

#### 2. Deferred Compensation Arrangements: IRC § 409A Compliance

**§ 409A Overview:**

IRC § 409A regulates nonqualified deferred compensation plans (NQDCs) offered by for-profit employers.⁵⁴ Nonprofits offering NQDCs are generally subject to IRC § 457(f) instead of § 409A.⁵⁵

**Change in Tax Treatment:**

Upon conversion to for-profit status, any NQDC arrangements maintained by MU will become subject to § 409A rather than § 457(f).

**§ 409A Key Requirements:**⁵⁶

- Deferrals must be elected before the compensation is earned (generally by December 31 of prior year)
- Distributions may only occur upon specific events: separation from service, disability, death, change in control, unforeseeable emergency, or fixed schedule
- No acceleration of benefits except as specifically permitted
- Change in control of corporation is a permissible distribution event

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**⁵⁷

If a deferred compensation arrangement violates § 409A:
- Immediate income inclusion (taxed as ordinary income in year of violation)
- 20% excise tax on employee
- Interest penalties

**Change in Control Provision:**

The acquisition of MU by AEH likely constitutes a "change in control" under § 409A, which permits (but does not require) distribution of deferred compensation balances to affected employees.⁵⁸

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Audit all NQDC arrangements:** Identify any executives or key employees with deferred compensation
2. **Review plan documents:** Ensure compliance with § 409A (not § 457(f)) post-conversion
3. **Consider change-in-control distributions:** Pay out deferred balances at closing to avoid ongoing § 409A compliance burden
4. **Amend plan documents:** Update all NQDC plans to comply with § 409A requirements

**Estimated Affected Employees:**

University executives and senior administrators may have deferred compensation arrangements. AEH should request detailed information on all NQDC liabilities as part of due diligence.

#### 3. Other Employee Benefit Considerations

**Health and Welfare Plans:** Generally unaffected by for-profit conversion, but AEH should review for any nonprofit-specific provisions.

**Pension Plans (if any):** If MU maintains a defined benefit pension plan, AEH must assess funded status and ongoing obligations. Pension obligations transfer with the acquisition.

**ERISA Compliance:** 401(k) plans are subject to ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act). Ensure all fiduciary, disclosure, and reporting requirements are met.

**State Law Considerations:** Review Indiana employment law for any provisions specific to nonprofit vs. for-profit employers regarding benefits.

### F. Deal Structure and Tax Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Asset vs. Stock Purchase: Tax Implications

**Anticipated Structure: Stock Purchase**

Based on the transaction description ($780M acquisition of Midwest University), this appears to be structured as a stock purchase—AEH acquires 100% of the membership interests or stock of MU.

**Alternative: Asset Purchase**

In an asset purchase, AEH would form a new entity ("NewCo") and purchase MU's individual assets (real property, equipment, contracts, intangible assets). MU would then dissolve and distribute proceeds to its members (if any).

**Why Stock Purchase Likely:**

- Nonprofit corporations generally have no shareholders; membership interests may not exist
- Asset purchase would require transfer of hundreds of individual assets (real estate parcels, equipment, contracts)
- Regulatory approvals (accreditation, state licensure) easier to maintain with stock/entity-level acquisition
- Assumption of liabilities more straightforward in stock purchase

**Tax Consequences: Stock vs. Asset**

| Feature | Stock Purchase | Asset Purchase |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Buyer's Basis in Assets** | Carryover basis (MU's historic basis) | Stepped-up basis (fair market value) |
| **Depreciation/Amortization** | No step-up; limited tax benefit | Full step-up; significant tax benefit |
| **Goodwill Amortization** | None (stock basis not amortizable) | 15-year amortization under IRC § 197 |
| **Assumption of Liabilities** | Automatic | Must be negotiated |
| **Seller's Tax** | N/A (nonprofit seller) | Potentially taxable at entity level |

**Buyer's Preference:** Asset purchase with IRC § 338 election (discussed below) to obtain step-up in basis while maintaining legal form of stock purchase.

#### 2. IRC § 338 Election: Deemed Asset Sale

**Overview:**

IRC § 338 allows a buyer acquiring at least 80% of a target's stock to elect to treat the stock purchase as a deemed asset purchase for tax purposes.⁵⁹

**Two Types of § 338 Elections:**

**§ 338(g) Election:** Buyer makes unilateral election; two levels of tax (entity level + seller level). Generally disadvantageous unless seller is tax-exempt.

**§ 338(h)(10) Election:** Joint election by buyer and seller; only one level of tax (at entity level). Available only if:⁶⁰
- Target is an S corporation, OR
- Target is a subsidiary member of a consolidated group selling target stock

**Application to Project Athena:**

MU, as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is NOT a C corporation or S corporation. It has no shareholders in the traditional sense. Therefore:

- **§ 338(h)(10) election: NOT AVAILABLE** (MU is not an S corporation or subsidiary member of consolidated group)
- **§ 338(g) election: POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE** (if MU is treated as a corporation for tax purposes)

**Analysis of § 338(g) for Nonprofit Target:**

If AEH makes a § 338(g) election:

1. **Deemed Asset Sale by "Old MU":** MU is deemed to sell all assets at fair market value
2. **Tax on Deemed Asset Sale:** Normally this would trigger corporate-level tax. However, if MU is still tax-exempt at the moment of deemed sale, the gain may be tax-free.
3. **"New MU" Acquires Assets:** Deemed to acquire assets at stepped-up basis equal to purchase price ($780M)
4. **Tax Benefit to AEH:** Step-up in asset basis allows depreciation/amortization deductions

**Key Question: Timing of Loss of Tax-Exempt Status vs. § 338(g) Deemed Sale**

If the § 338(g) deemed asset sale occurs while MU is still tax-exempt, the gain on the deemed sale would be exempt from federal income tax. This creates a significant tax benefit to AEH (step-up in basis) with zero tax cost.

However, this is a highly technical area requiring IRS guidance or private letter ruling.

**Potential Tax Benefit of § 338(g) Election:**

Assuming MU's assets have low tax basis (likely, given much property has been owned for decades), a § 338(g) election could provide significant depreciation and amortization deductions:

```
Purchase Price Allocated to Depreciable Assets:    $400,000,000 (estimate)
MU's Current Tax Basis in Assets:                  $100,000,000 (estimate)
                                                    ______________
Step-Up in Basis:                                  $300,000,000

Annual Depreciation Benefit (straight-line, 39-year life):
$300M ÷ 39 years = $7.7M per year
Tax Savings (21% rate): $7.7M × 21% = $1.6M per year
```

Over the depreciable life of the assets, this could generate $60+ million in tax savings (present value significantly less).

**§ 197 Intangibles Amortization:**

If the purchase price exceeds the fair market value of tangible assets, the excess is allocated to § 197 intangibles (including goodwill) and amortized over 15 years:⁶¹

```
Total Purchase Price:                              $780,000,000
Less: Tangible Assets (real property, equipment):  $650,000,000 (estimate)
                                                    ______________
§ 197 Intangibles (Goodwill, etc.):               $130,000,000

Annual Amortization: $130M ÷ 15 = $8.67M
Tax Savings (21% rate): $8.67M × 21% = $1.82M per year
```

**Recommendation:** AEH should engage tax counsel to analyze feasibility and benefits of § 338(g) election, including whether MU can be treated as tax-exempt at the moment of deemed sale.

#### 3. Debt Financing and Interest Deductions

**Assumed Transaction Financing:**

Assume AEH finances the $780M purchase price with a combination of equity and debt:

- Equity: $280M
- Debt: $500M (senior secured term loan at 7% interest)

**Interest Deduction Benefit:**

Interest paid on acquisition debt is generally deductible under IRC § 163, subject to limitations.

**Annual Interest Expense:**

```
Debt Principal:                                    $500,000,000
Interest Rate:                                              7.0%
                                                    ______________
Annual Interest Expense:                           $ 35,000,000

Tax Benefit (21% federal rate):                    $  7,350,000
```

**IRC § 163(j) Limitation on Interest Deductions:**⁶²

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted IRC § 163(j), which limits business interest deductions to:
- 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI), OR
- 30% of EBITDA for tax years 2018-2021; 30% of EBIT for tax years 2022+

**Application to For-Profit MU:**

```
MU Pre-Tax Income (before interest):               $ 45,000,000
Add: Interest Expense:                             $ 35,000,000
                                                    ______________
Adjusted Taxable Income (approximates EBIT):       $ 80,000,000

§ 163(j) Limitation (30% of ATI):                  $ 24,000,000

Interest Expense:                                  $ 35,000,000
§ 163(j) Limitation:                               $ 24,000,000
                                                    ______________
Disallowed Interest Deduction:                     $ 11,000,000
```

**Impact on Taxable Income:**

```
Pre-Tax Income (before interest):                  $ 45,000,000
Less: Deductible Interest (§ 163(j) limited):      $(24,000,000)
                                                    ______________
Taxable Income:                                    $ 21,000,000

Federal Corporate Income Tax (21%):                $  4,410,000
Indiana Corporate Income Tax (4.9%):               $  1,029,000
                                                    ______________
Total Income Tax:                                  $  5,439,000
```

This is substantially lower than the $11.655M income tax estimated earlier, demonstrating the significant tax benefit of debt financing.

**Disallowed Interest Carryforward:**

The $11M of disallowed interest can be carried forward indefinitely to future tax years (subject to § 163(j) limitation in those years).⁶³

**Recommendation:** AEH should model various debt/equity ratios to optimize interest deductions while maintaining manageable leverage.

#### 4. Timing of Closing: Tax Year Considerations

**Optimal Closing Date: January 1**

Closing the transaction on January 1 (beginning of tax year) provides several administrative advantages:

- Avoids "short year" tax returns
- MU files Form 990 for full prior calendar year (as tax-exempt)
- MU files Form 1120 for full current calendar year (as taxable)
- Simplifies estimated tax payments (no pro-ration needed)
- Aligns with calendar year (most common corporate tax year)

**Alternative: Mid-Year Closing**

If closing occurs mid-year (e.g., June 30), MU must file:

- Form 990 (short year): January 1 - June 30 (as tax-exempt)
- Form 1120 (short year): June 30 - December 31 (as taxable)

This creates additional complexity and professional fees.

**Recommendation:** Target January 1 closing date if feasible from a business and regulatory perspective.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Legal and Litigation Risks

#### 1. Donor Litigation Over Restricted Endowment Funds

**Risk:** Donors who made restricted gifts to MU may sue to prevent the for-profit conversion or to compel transfer of their restricted gifts to a continuing nonprofit entity.

**Probability:** HIGH if $468M in donor-restricted funds are not transferred to a private foundation.

**Potential Claims:**
- Breach of charitable trust
- Cy pres petition to redirect funds to another nonprofit university
- Violation of gift agreements and donor intent
- State attorney general enforcement action (Indiana AG acts as parens patriae for charitable assets)

**Damages/Remedies:**
- Injunction blocking transaction
- Court order transferring restricted funds to nonprofit entity
- Return of funds to donors or donor estates
- Negative publicity and reputational harm

**Mitigation:**
- Transfer all donor-restricted funds ($468M) to Midwest University Foundation
- Obtain legal opinions on donor restriction compliance
- Notify major donors in advance of transaction
- Consider obtaining donor consents for high-value restricted gifts

#### 2. Accreditation and Regulatory Approvals

**Risk:** Regional accreditation agencies (Higher Learning Commission), state education departments, and federal agencies (Department of Education) may challenge or rescind MU's accreditation/approvals upon for-profit conversion.

**Impact:**
- Loss of accreditation = students cannot transfer credits, institution loses legitimacy
- Loss of federal financial aid eligibility = 40-60% of students may be unable to afford tuition
- State licensure issues = cannot grant degrees in Indiana

**Mitigation:**
- Engage with Higher Learning Commission early in transaction process
- Obtain approval from Indiana Commission for Higher Education
- Ensure continued eligibility for Title IV federal financial aid programs
- Maintain educational quality standards post-acquisition

#### 3. Tax Authority Challenges

**Risk:** IRS or Indiana Department of Revenue may challenge the transaction structure, particularly:

- Treatment of endowment transfer to Foundation as tax-free
- Denial of property tax exemption (if AEH attempts to maintain partial exemption)
- Characterization of transaction as taxable sale requiring gain recognition

**Mitigation:**
- Obtain IRS private letter ruling on key tax issues
- Engage experienced tax counsel for transaction structuring
- Maintain detailed documentation of all tax positions
- File timely and accurate tax returns for all entities

### B. Financial and Operational Risks

#### 4. Cash Flow Impact from Tax Burden

**Risk:** The $33.2M annual tax burden (vs. current $546K) represents a 6,000% increase. This will materially reduce cash available for operations, capital improvements, and debt service.

**Impact on Debt Service Coverage:**

If AEH finances acquisition with $500M debt at 7% interest:

```
Pre-Tax Income:                                    $ 45,000,000
Less: Interest Expense (limited):                  $(24,000,000)
                                                    ______________
Taxable Income:                                    $ 21,000,000
Less: Income Taxes:                                $ (5,439,000)
                                                    ______________
After-Tax Income:                                  $ 15,561,000

Less: Property Tax:                                $(15,600,000)
Less: Sales Tax:                                   $ (5,950,000)
                                                    ______________
Cash Available for Debt Service:                   $ (5,989,000)
```

**Critical Finding:** After accounting for all taxes, MU will have NEGATIVE cash flow, unable to service acquisition debt.

**This analysis assumes MU must pay property tax and sales tax as operating expenses, which effectively consumes all operating income.**

**Recommendation:** AEH must either:
- Substantially increase tuition/revenue (+$40M+)
- Reduce operating expenses (-$40M+)
- Use endowment liquidation proceeds to fund ongoing losses
- Reconsider transaction viability

#### 5. Student Enrollment Risk

**Risk:** For-profit conversion may negatively impact student enrollment due to:

- Perceived decline in educational quality
- Loss of "nonprofit" prestige
- Reduced financial aid availability
- Negative media coverage and public perception

**Historical Precedent:** Several nonprofit-to-for-profit university conversions have experienced 20-40% enrollment declines in the years following conversion (e.g., National University, Grand Canyon University faced challenges during transitions).

**Impact:**

20% enrollment decline = 3,680 students lost
Revenue loss (assuming $30K avg. tuition) = $110M

This would devastate the financial model underlying the acquisition.

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain educational quality and faculty
- Aggressive marketing and student retention efforts
- Preserve financial aid programs
- Communicate benefits of new ownership to students and parents

### C. Reputational and Political Risks

#### 6. Public and Political Backlash

**Risk:** Nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions of educational institutions are politically controversial and attract negative media attention.

**Potential Stakeholder Opposition:**
- Students and alumni
- Faculty and staff
- Indiana state legislature
- Local community leaders
- National higher education advocacy groups

**Historical Examples:**
- Grand Canyon University for-profit conversion (2004) and subsequent re-conversion to nonprofit (2018) amid controversy
- Student protests and faculty votes of no confidence at several institutions

**Impact:**
- Adverse media coverage
- State legislative hearings or investigations
- Regulatory scrutiny
- Difficulty recruiting students and faculty

**Mitigation:**
- Proactive communication strategy highlighting benefits (capital investment, improved facilities, etc.)
- Engagement with key stakeholders prior to public announcement
- Commitment to preserving educational mission and quality
- Consider maintaining some "public benefit" aspects of operations

### D. Tax-Specific Risks

#### 7. Section 382 NOL Limitations (if applicable)

**Risk:** If MU has net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards from prior years (unlikely given $45M annual income, but possible from earlier years), IRC § 382 would limit annual NOL utilization following the ownership change.

**IRC § 382 Limitation:**⁶⁴

Annual NOL deduction limited to:
```
Fair Market Value of Loss Corporation × Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate
```

**Application:**

If MU has $50M in NOL carryforwards:

```
FMV of MU:                                         $780,000,000 (purchase price)
Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate (Dec. 2024):                     4.75% (approx.)
                                                    ______________
Annual § 382 Limitation:                           $ 37,050,000
```

The limitation is likely not binding given MU's taxable income of $21-45M annually (depending on interest deductions), so NOLs could be fully utilized within 2-3 years.

**Recommendation:** Confirm MU's NOL carryforward balance as part of tax due diligence.

#### 8. State Tax Nexus Expansion

**Risk:** If AEH operates in multiple states, the acquisition of MU may create income tax nexus in Indiana for the AEH consolidated group (if AEH consolidates MU for state tax purposes).

**Impact:** AEH's entire consolidated income may become subject to Indiana income tax (apportioned), not just MU's income.

**Mitigation:** Structure MU as separate legal entity that files standalone Indiana tax returns, avoiding consolidation with AEH.

### E. Endowment-Specific Risks

#### 9. Foundation Minimum Distribution Requirement Reduces Available Funds

**Risk:** If $468M is transferred to Foundation, the 5% minimum distribution requirement ($23.4M annually) must be satisfied regardless of Foundation's ability to generate that level of income.

**Scenario:** Market downturn reduces endowment value to $350M, but 5% distribution still required:

```
Endowment FMV After Downturn:                      $350,000,000
Required 5% Distribution:                          $ 17,500,000
Investment Income (4% return):                     $ 14,000,000
                                                    ______________
Shortfall (must invade principal):                 $  3,500,000
```

In down markets, Foundation may need to invade principal to meet distribution requirements, eroding endowment over time.

**Mitigation:** Foundation should maintain prudent investment policies and diversified portfolio. Consider operating foundation status if MU can meet requirements (direct charitable operations).

#### 10. Self-Dealing Restrictions Limit Foundation's Ability to Support For-Profit MU

**Risk:** IRC § 4941 self-dealing prohibitions prevent Foundation from making payments to MU except for qualifying charitable purposes at fair market value.

**Prohibited Transactions:**
- Grants to support MU's business operations
- Below-market-rate loans to MU
- Guarantees of MU's debt
- Payment of MU's expenses unrelated to charitable mission

**Permitted Transactions:**
- Grants for scholarships awarded to students under proper procedures
- Grants for specific charitable programs (must satisfy IRC § 4945 expenditure responsibility)
- Fair market value rent payments if Foundation leases property from MU

**Impact:** Foundation's $23.4M annual distribution cannot simply be paid to MU to offset operating losses. Funds must be distributed in accordance with charitable purposes.

**Mitigation:** Structure distributions as:
- Student scholarships (directly benefit students, not MU corporate operations)
- Endowed faculty chairs (support educational mission)
- Research grants (must satisfy IRC § 4945 requirements)

### F. Summary Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Probability | Impact | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Donor litigation | High | High | **CRITICAL** |
| Accreditation loss | Medium | Critical | **HIGH** |
| Cash flow insufficiency | High | High | **CRITICAL** |
| Enrollment decline | Medium | High | **HIGH** |
| Public backlash | High | Medium | **MEDIUM** |
| Tax authority challenges | Low | High | **MEDIUM** |
| Foundation compliance | Medium | Medium | **MEDIUM** |

**Overall Assessment:** Project Athena presents HIGH overall risk from a tax and financial viability perspective. The combination of massive tax burden increase and potential revenue decline creates significant risk to transaction success.

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Tax Consequences

The conversion of Midwest University from a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational institution to a for-profit entity under American Education Holdings ownership will trigger profound and financially material tax consequences across federal, state, and local jurisdictions.

**Quantified Annual Tax Burden:**

| Tax Type | Current (Nonprofit) | Post-Conversion (For-Profit) | Annual Increase |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Federal income tax | $546,000 (UBIT only) | $9,450,000 | $8,904,000 |
| Indiana corporate income tax | $0 | $2,205,000 | $2,205,000 |
| Property tax (Marion County) | $0 | $15,600,000 | $15,600,000 |
| Sales tax on purchases | $0 | $5,950,000 | $5,950,000 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL TAX** | **$546,000** | **$33,205,000** | **$32,659,000** |

**Tax Burden as Percentage of Pre-Tax Income:** 73.8% ($33.2M ÷ $45M)

**Net Income Impact:**

```
Current after-tax income (nonprofit):          $44,454,000
Post-conversion after-tax income (for-profit): $11,795,000
                                                ___________
NET INCOME DECLINE:                            $32,659,000 (73.5% reduction)
```

**One-Time Tax Exposures:**

| Event | Tax Liability | Avoidance Strategy |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Endowment liquidation (all $650M) | $103,600,000 | Transfer $468M to private foundation |
| Board-designated fund liquidation ($182M) | $30-38M | Retain in portfolio; liquidate selectively |

### B. Recommended Transaction Structure

Based on comprehensive tax analysis, we recommend the following optimal structure for Project Athena:

#### 1. **Endowment Structure: Bifurcated Approach**

**Transfer $468M Donor-Restricted Funds to Midwest University Foundation (New Private Foundation):**

- Form Foundation 6-12 months prior to closing
- File IRS Form 1023 for 501(c)(3) determination
- Transfer donor-restricted endowment while MU is still tax-exempt (tax-free transfer)
- Foundation classified as private foundation under IRC § 509(a)
- Foundation makes 5% annual distributions ($23.4M) to support MU educational programs via scholarships, faculty chairs, and research grants
- **Tax Savings:** Avoids $70-$90M capital gains tax on restricted funds
- **Legal Protection:** Minimizes donor litigation risk by preserving donor intent
- **Ongoing Benefit:** Investment returns taxed at 1.39% (excise tax) vs. 21% (corporate rate)

**Retain $182M Board-Designated Funds at For-Profit MU:**

- No legal restrictions on use
- AEH maintains full control
- Liquidate selectively as needed for operations/debt service
- Pay capital gains tax only on positions sold (estimated $30-38M if fully liquidated)

**Net Result:** $65-73M in immediate tax savings + ongoing tax-advantaged growth in Foundation

#### 2. **Deal Structure: Stock Purchase with IRC § 338(g) Election**

- Structure as stock purchase for legal/regulatory simplicity
- Elect IRC § 338(g) to obtain step-up in asset basis to $780M purchase price
- If deemed asset sale occurs while MU is still tax-exempt, gain may be tax-free to "Old MU"
- AEH obtains stepped-up depreciable basis generating $1.6M annual depreciation tax savings
- Goodwill/intangibles amortized over 15 years under IRC § 197 generating $1.82M annual tax savings
- **Total Annual Tax Benefit:** $3.4M from increased depreciation/amortization

**Caveat:** § 338(g) election for nonprofit target is novel and requires IRS private letter ruling to confirm treatment.

#### 3. **Debt Financing Strategy: Optimize Interest Deductions**

- Finance acquisition with $500M senior debt at 7% interest rate
- Annual interest expense: $35M
- IRC § 163(j) limits deduction to $24M (30% of EBIT)
- Reduces federal and state income tax by $5.2M annually ($24M × 21.7% combined rate)
- Carry forward $11M disallowed interest indefinitely

**Impact on Taxable Income:**

```
Pre-tax income (before interest):              $45,000,000
Less: Deductible interest:                    ($24,000,000)
                                               ___________
Taxable income:                                $21,000,000

Federal income tax (21%):                      $ 4,410,000
Indiana income tax (4.9%):                     $ 1,029,000
                                               ___________
Total income tax:                              $ 5,439,000
```

This is $6.2M lower than the $11.655M income tax without debt financing—a 53% reduction in income taxes through leverage.

#### 4. **Retirement Plan Conversion: 403(b) to 401(k)**

- Establish 401(k) plan effective at closing
- Freeze 403(b) plan; no new contributions
- Offer direct rollover to employees (tax-free transfer)
- Timeline: Complete conversion within 12 months post-closing

#### 5. **Deferred Compensation: § 409A Compliance**

- Audit all executive NQDC arrangements
- Consider change-in-control distributions at closing to eliminate ongoing § 409A compliance burden
- Amend any continuing NQDC plans for § 409A (vs. § 457(f)) compliance

#### 6. **Closing Date: January 1 Target**

- Close on January 1 to avoid short-year tax complications
- MU files Form 990 for full prior year (as tax-exempt)
- MU files Form 1120 for full current year (as taxable)
- Simplifies estimated tax payment calculations

### C. Tax Return Filing and Compliance Requirements

#### 1. **Year of Conversion: Dual Filing Obligations**

**Midwest University (Entity-Level Returns):**

| Return Type | Period Covered | Due Date | Key Features |
|-------------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| Form 990 (Final) | Jan. 1 - Closing Date | 15th day of 5th month after short year end | Check "Final return/terminated" box; complete Schedule N (Liquidation) |
| Form 1120 (Initial) | Closing Date - Dec. 31 | 15th day of 4th month after year end (April 15 or March 15) | First corporate income tax return; attach §338(g) election if applicable |
| Indiana IT-20 (Initial) | Closing Date - Dec. 31 | Same as Form 1120 | Indiana corporate income tax return |
| Form 990-T (Final UBIT) | Jan. 1 - Closing Date | 15th day of 5th month after short year end | Final UBIT return for pre-closing period |

**Midwest University Foundation (New Entity):**

| Return Type | Period Covered | Due Date | Key Features |
|-------------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| IRS Form 1023 | Application | File 6-12 months pre-closing | Application for 501(c)(3) determination |
| Form 990-PF (Initial) | First full year after formation | 15th day of 5th month after year end | Private foundation return; report excise tax |

**American Education Holdings (Parent/Acquirer):**

| Return Type | Period Covered | Due Date | Key Features |
|-------------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| Form 1120 (Consolidated?) | Full tax year | 15th day of 4th month | Determine whether to consolidate MU or file separately |

#### 2. **Ongoing Annual Compliance (Post-Conversion)**

**For-Profit Midwest University:**

- **Form 1120:** U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return (annually)
- **Indiana IT-20:** Corporate Adjusted Gross Income Tax Return (annually)
- **Quarterly Estimated Taxes:** IRC § 6655 requires quarterly installments (April 15, June 15, Sept. 15, Dec. 15)
- **Employment Taxes:** Form 941 (quarterly), Form 940 (annual unemployment tax)
- **Property Tax Filings:** Marion County annual personal property returns
- **Sales Tax Returns:** Indiana Department of Revenue (monthly or quarterly)

**Midwest University Foundation:**

- **Form 990-PF:** Return of Private Foundation (annually)
- **Form 4720:** Return of Certain Excise Taxes (if applicable for Chapter 42 violations)
- **State Registration:** Indiana Attorney General registration for charitable organizations
- **Form 5227:** Split-Interest Trust Information Return (if applicable)

#### 3. **First-Year Estimated Tax Payment Strategy**

MU becomes a "large corporation" (taxable income >$1M) immediately upon conversion, which limits safe harbor options.

**Year 1 Estimated Tax Payment Schedule (Assuming January 1 Closing):**

| Installment | Due Date | Calculation Method | Estimated Amount |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1st Quarter (Jan-Mar) | April 15 | 100% of prior year (zero—was tax-exempt) OR annualized current year | $1,360,000 (25% of $5.44M) |
| 2nd Quarter (Apr-Jun) | June 15 | Annualized current year method | $1,360,000 |
| 3rd Quarter (Jul-Sep) | Sept. 15 | Annualized current year method | $1,360,000 |
| 4th Quarter (Oct-Dec) | Dec. 15 | Annualized current year method | $1,360,000 |

**Total Estimated Tax (Federal + Indiana):** $5,439,000 (assuming debt-financed structure)

**Critical:** Failure to pay sufficient estimated taxes results in underpayment penalties calculated under IRC § 6655.

### D. Key Recommendations for AEH Leadership

#### **Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Reconsider Transaction Viability:**
   - The combined annual tax burden of $33.2M (73.5% of pre-tax income) creates severe cash flow constraints
   - After debt service, property tax, and sales tax, MU will have negative cash flow
   - Unless AEH can increase tuition substantially (+$40M) or reduce expenses (-$40M), the transaction may not be financially viable
   - **Alternative:** Consider maintaining MU as a tax-exempt nonprofit with AEH as management services provider under contract (preserves tax exemptions while providing AEH with management fees)

2. **Endowment Structure is Non-Negotiable:**
   - Transfer all $468M in donor-restricted funds to Foundation to avoid $70-90M tax and mitigate donor litigation risk
   - Do NOT attempt to retain donor-restricted funds at for-profit MU—legal and reputational risks are unacceptable
   - Foundation's $23.4M annual distribution provides ongoing support for educational mission

3. **Engage Regulatory Authorities Early:**
   - Higher Learning Commission (accreditation)
   - Indiana Commission for Higher Education
   - U.S. Department of Education (Title IV financial aid eligibility)
   - Failure to obtain approvals could invalidate entire transaction

4. **Obtain IRS Private Letter Ruling:**
   - Request ruling on IRC § 338(g) election treatment for nonprofit target
   - Request ruling on tax-free treatment of endowment transfer to Foundation
   - Request ruling on any novel tax positions
   - **Timeline:** PLR process takes 6-12 months; budget for $50K-$100K in professional fees

5. **Debt Structure Optimization:**
   - Model multiple debt/equity scenarios to maximize interest deductions while maintaining manageable leverage
   - Consider HoldCo debt (AEH borrows) vs. MU-level debt (affects which entity gets interest deduction)
   - IRC § 163(j) limitation ($24M deductible vs. $35M total interest) suggests lower debt levels may be optimal

6. **Communicate Proactively with Stakeholders:**
   - Students, faculty, alumni, donors
   - Indiana state legislators
   - Local media and community leaders
   - Transparent communication about benefits (capital investment, facility improvements, preserved educational quality)

#### **Tax Planning Recommendations:**

7. **Maximize § 197 Intangibles Amortization:**
   - Engage valuation firm to allocate maximum purchase price to § 197 intangibles (goodwill, student lists, accreditation value, brand)
   - 15-year amortization provides $1.82M annual tax savings over life of assets

8. **State Tax Structure:**
   - File MU as standalone Indiana taxpayer (do not consolidate with AEH parent for state purposes)
   - Avoids apportioning AEH's broader income to Indiana
   - Simpler compliance and less exposure to multistate tax audits

9. **Transfer Pricing Documentation:**
   - If AEH provides management services to MU post-acquisition, maintain IRC § 482 transfer pricing documentation
   - Ensure intercompany charges are at arm's length to avoid IRS adjustment risk

10. **NOL Due Diligence:**
    - Confirm whether MU has any NOL carryforwards from prior years
    - If yes, quantify and assess IRC § 382 limitation impact
    - Unlikely given current profitability, but prudent to verify

### E. Alternative Structure: Management Services Agreement (Tax-Preserving Alternative)

**If the cash flow analysis proves prohibitive, AEH should consider an alternative structure:**

**Structure:**
- MU remains a 501(c)(3) nonprofit educational institution
- AEH forms a for-profit management services company ("MSO")
- MSO enters into long-term management services agreement with MU
- MSO provides comprehensive services: administration, finance, facilities, IT, marketing
- MSO charges management fee (e.g., 10-15% of revenue = $68-$102M annually)
- MU retains educational operations, accreditation, tax-exempt status

**Advantages:**
- MU preserves all tax exemptions (federal, state, local)
- No property tax ($15.6M savings)
- No sales tax ($5.95M savings)
- MU retains federal financial aid eligibility (critical)
- Donor-restricted endowment remains at MU (no transfer complications)
- Lower regulatory risk (accreditation agencies more receptive)
- AEH generates profit via management fees

**Disadvantages:**
- AEH does not own MU (no equity ownership)
- MU board retains ultimate authority (though may be populated with AEH designees)
- Management fee must be at fair market value (IRC § 4958 excess benefit transaction rules)
- Less integration/control than full ownership

**Tax Treatment:**
- MSO files Form 1120 and pays 21% federal + 4.9% Indiana tax on management fee profit
- MU continues filing Form 990 (tax-exempt)
- IRS may scrutinize arrangement under private benefit and excess benefit doctrines

**Precedent:** Several nonprofit hospitals and universities use MSO structures to partner with for-profit management companies while preserving tax-exempt status (e.g., Norton Healthcare, various Catholic hospital systems).

**Recommendation:** Model this alternative structure as a fallback if full acquisition proves financially unfeasible due to tax burden.

### F. Timeline and Action Items

**12-18 Months Pre-Closing:**
- [ ] Form Midwest University Foundation
- [ ] File IRS Form 1023 for Foundation (3-6 month processing time)
- [ ] Engage Higher Learning Commission regarding for-profit conversion
- [ ] Engage Indiana Commission for Higher Education
- [ ] File IRS Private Letter Ruling requests on key tax issues
- [ ] Conduct detailed tax due diligence on MU (NOLs, UBIT, tax basis in assets)
- [ ] Engage valuation firm for purchase price allocation (IRC § 1060)

**6 Months Pre-Closing:**
- [ ] Finalize endowment transfer agreements (donor-restricted funds to Foundation)
- [ ] Review all donor gift agreements for restrictions and obtain consents where feasible
- [ ] Establish 401(k) plan for post-closing implementation
- [ ] Audit all NQDC arrangements for § 409A compliance
- [ ] Draft definitive purchase agreement with tax provisions (§ 338(g) election, indemnification, closing date)

**At Closing:**
- [ ] Transfer $468M donor-restricted endowment to Foundation
- [ ] Execute IRC § 338(g) election (if favorable PLR obtained)
- [ ] File final Form 990 for MU (short year through closing date)
- [ ] Implement 401(k) plan; freeze 403(b) plan
- [ ] Register with Indiana Department of Revenue for sales tax and corporate income tax
- [ ] File property tax returns with Marion County Assessor

**Post-Closing (Year 1):**
- [ ] File initial Form 1120 for MU (first corporate return)
- [ ] Make quarterly estimated tax payments (April 15, June 15, Sept. 15, Dec. 15)
- [ ] File Form 990-PF for Foundation (first private foundation return)
- [ ] Complete 403(b) to 401(k) rollover for all employees
- [ ] Pay property tax installments (May 10, Nov. 10)
- [ ] File monthly/quarterly sales tax returns

### G. Conclusion: Proceed with Extreme Caution

Project Athena presents **high financial and legal risk** driven primarily by the massive tax burden increase upon nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion. The $32.7M annual tax increase (6,000% over current UBIT) will consume 73.5% of MU's pre-tax income, leaving minimal cash flow for debt service, capital investment, or return to AEH investors.

**Critical Success Factors:**

1. **Endowment**: Transfer donor-restricted funds to Foundation (non-negotiable)
2. **Debt Structure**: Optimize leverage to maximize interest deductions while maintaining debt service capacity
3. **Revenue Growth**: Increase tuition or enrollment to offset tax burden
4. **Cost Reduction**: Significant expense cuts required to maintain profitability
5. **Regulatory Approvals**: Secure accreditation and Title IV eligibility (transaction-blocking if denied)

**Bottom Line:** Without substantial revenue increases or expense reductions, the transaction may be financially unviable due to tax consequences. AEH should seriously consider the alternative MSO structure, which preserves tax exemptions while allowing AEH to profit via management fees.

**Legal and Tax Team Required:**

- M&A tax counsel (Big 4 or national law firm)
- Higher education regulatory counsel
- Nonprofit/charitable trusts counsel
- State and local tax specialists (Indiana)
- Valuation and transfer pricing economists
- IRS private letter ruling specialists

**Estimated Professional Fees for Transaction:** $2-5 million (legal, tax, valuation, regulatory).

This is not a routine acquisition—the tax, legal, and regulatory complexity rivals large hospital system conversions and requires elite-level advisory support.

## IX. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)
✓ All relevant federal tax code provisions researched (IRC §§ 11, 163, 338, 403, 409A, 501, 509, 512, 4940-4945, 4968, 6655)
✓ Indiana state tax statutes comprehensively reviewed (corporate income, property tax, sales tax)
✓ IRS forms and filing requirements analyzed (Forms 990, 1120, 1023, 990-PF)
✓ Multiple search strategies employed (federal law, state law, regulatory guidance, secondary sources)
✓ Cross-referenced findings across authoritative sources
✓ Identified gaps clearly documented (PLRs, donor agreements, property assessments)

### Confidence Levels
| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Federal income tax rate (21%) | **High** | Statutory (IRC § 11(b)) |
| Indiana corporate tax rate (4.9%) | **High** | Official Indiana DOR website |
| Loss of 501(c)(3) status upon for-profit conversion | **High** | IRS guidance, multiple secondary sources |
| Property tax exemption loss | **High** | Indiana Code § 6-1.1-10-16 statutory language |
| Sales tax exemption loss | **High** | Indiana Code § 6-2.5-5-21 and DOR bulletins |
| Marion County property tax rate (2.4%) | **Medium-High** | Based on published rates, exact rate depends on specific taxing district |
| Estimated endowment unrealized gains ($400M) | **Medium** | Assumed based on typical institutional endowment appreciation; actual basis unknown |
| § 338(g) treatment for nonprofit target | **Medium** | Limited precedent; IRS PLR recommended |
| Donor litigation risk assessment | **Medium-High** | Based on general charitable trust law; specific risk depends on donor agreement language |
| Accreditation risk assessment | **Medium** | Based on historical precedent; outcome depends on specific HLC evaluation |

### Known Limitations
- **Endowment cost basis:** Actual cost basis unknown; used 38.5% ratio based on typical long-term institutional portfolios
- **Property tax assessments:** Used estimated $650M assessed value; actual assessment requires formal Marion County Assessor review
- **Donor gift agreements:** Specific restriction language not reviewed; assumed typical perpetual endowment restrictions
- **Research income:** MU's actual sponsored research revenue not quantified; could materially impact taxable income estimate
- **§ 338(g) election:** Novel application to nonprofit target; no published IRS guidance; PLR recommended
- **State tax conformity:** Indiana's conformity to federal tax base generally assumed; specific modifications not comprehensively analyzed

### Peer Review Recommendations
This report should be reviewed by:
1. **Big 4 or national law firm M&A tax counsel** for transaction structuring
2. **Nonprofit/charitable trust counsel** for donor restriction analysis and cy pres implications
3. **Indiana state and local tax specialist** for property tax assessment and sales tax compliance
4. **Higher education regulatory counsel** for accreditation and Title IV implications
5. **Valuation firm** for IRC § 1060 purchase price allocation and endowment basis determination
