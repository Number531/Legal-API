## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. Transaction Overview and Critical Legal Obstacles

Project Athena—the proposed $780M acquisition of Midwest University (a private nonprofit 501(c)(3) institution in Indianapolis) by American Education Holdings (a for-profit entity)—faces formidable legal obstacles rooted in charitable trust doctrine, accreditation standards for for-profit educational institutions, and contractual obligations to tenured faculty. This case law research reveals that **the transaction as currently structured has only a 15-25% probability of obtaining all required regulatory approvals** and closing successfully.

The core legal challenge is that **nonprofit educational assets accumulated through tax exemption and charitable donations cannot be simply transferred to a for-profit entity**. The Blue Cross conversion cases from the 1990s-2000s established clear precedent: when nonprofit entities (subsidized by taxpayers and charitable contributions) convert to for-profit status, regulators require that charitable assets be set aside in perpetuity for public benefit, typically through creation of independent charitable foundations funded with the fair market value of the converted entity.

For Midwest University, this principle applies with particular force to the **$468M in donor-restricted endowment funds** (72% of the total $650M endowment). Indiana's cy pres doctrine (Indiana Code 30-4-3-27) mandates that property given for charitable purposes must remain dedicated to those purposes when the original purpose becomes impracticable. The Indiana Attorney General—a mandatory party to cy pres proceedings—will scrutinize any proposal to transfer educational endowment funds to a for-profit corporation. Based on Blue Cross precedents in California ($3.2B), Missouri ($500M), Colorado ($155M), and Wisconsin ($600M combined), the Indiana AG will likely require the $468M donor-restricted endowment be transferred to a separate 501(c)(3) foundation, not to American Education Holdings.

### B. Charitable Trust Doctrine: The Endowment Obstacle

Indiana Code 30-4-3-27 codifies the cy pres doctrine, providing that when property given to a charitable trust becomes impossible, impracticable, wasteful, or illegal to carry out the particular purpose, and the settlor manifested a general charitable intention, a court may direct the application of property to some charitable purpose within the general charitable intention. Critically, the statute limits the power to distribute to noncharitable beneficiaries: such distribution prevails over cy pres only if the trust property is to revert to the settlor and the settlor is still alive, or less than 21 years have elapsed since trust creation.

Most of Midwest University's donor-restricted endowment gifts likely date back decades (the university has existed since the late 19th century), meaning the 21-year window has long closed. These funds cannot revert to donors or their estates; they must remain dedicated to charitable educational purposes in perpetuity. The charitable trust doctrine—sometimes called the "asset lock"—establishes that all assets of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit are permanently dedicated to the organization's charitable purpose and held in trust for the public's benefit.

**Blue Cross Conversion Precedent**: The wave of Blue Cross Blue Shield conversions provides the most directly analogous precedent. In California, Blue Cross agreed to distribute all its assets (over $3.2 billion) to two grant-making health foundations. In Missouri, a settlement created a foundation valued at nearly $500 million. In Colorado, Anthem paid $155 million (the fair market value of Blue Cross) to the Caring for Colorado Foundation. In Wisconsin, approximately $600 million was distributed to medical colleges. The consistent principle: charitable assets accumulated through tax exemption and public support cannot be privatized but must remain dedicated to charitable purposes.

**Application to Midwest University**: Without restructuring the transaction, the probability of Indiana Attorney General approval is **10-20%**. The AG will require:
1. Independent valuation of fair market value of all charitable assets
2. Transfer of $468M donor-restricted endowment to separate 501(c)(3) foundation
3. Foundation governed by independent board (not controlled by American Education Holdings)
4. Perpetual restriction on use of principal for charitable educational purposes
5. Annual grant-making to support Midwest University students/programs

With such a protective structure, probability of approval increases to **60-75%**.

### C. Title IX Due Process Litigation: Doe v. Midwest University

The pending *Doe v. Midwest University* litigation (S.D. Ind. 2024) presents moderate-to-high risk. The court's denial of Midwest University's motion to dismiss in June 2024 indicates that the plaintiff alleged sufficient facts to state plausible claims for relief. The case will proceed to discovery, where plaintiff will obtain potentially damaging evidence.

**Controlling Precedent**: The case is governed by *Doe v. Purdue University*, 928 F.3d 652 (7th Cir. 2019), authored by then-Judge Amy Coney Barrett. The Seventh Circuit rejected the rigid doctrinal tests of other circuits (erroneous outcome, selective enforcement) and adopted a simplified standard: plaintiff must show that "sex was a motivating factor" in the university's decision to discipline him. This standard—now adopted by the Third, Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits—is more plaintiff-friendly than earlier frameworks.

**Evidence of Gender Bias**: *Doe v. Oberlin College*, 60 F.4th 345 (6th Cir. 2023), established that a hearing panel's decision may itself constitute evidence of gender bias. The Sixth Circuit held that "patterns of decision-making" (such as a "100 percent responsibility rate" for male respondents) can support an inference of gender bias. Courts have also found plausible bias allegations based on:
- Biased Title IX training materials ("believe survivors" mandates)
- Pressure from federal OCR investigations
- Societal pressures from Me Too movement
- Procedural irregularities (failure to follow university's own procedures)
- Investigator or hearing panel bias

**Damages Exposure**: The 2022 Supreme Court decision in *Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller*, 142 S. Ct. 1562, held that emotional distress damages are not recoverable under Title IX. Plaintiff can recover only out-of-pocket compensatory damages: lost tuition, housing, ROTC scholarships (as in *Purdue*), transfer costs, and lost career opportunities. Settlement data shows Title IX defense cases typically settle for $20,000-$30,000, though cases that proceed to trial can result in verdicts of $300,000-$800,000 including attorney fees.

**Recommended Resolution**: Settle before discovery for $250,000-$350,000 with confidentiality provision and expungement of disciplinary finding from student's record. This avoids discovery costs ($150,000-$300,000 in attorney fees), eliminates 40-60% probability of plaintiff verdict, and prevents reputational damage from public trial. **Critical for acquisition**: Under successor liability principles, American Education Holdings will inherit this liability if the transaction closes, as the acquisition creates "substantial continuity" of operations.

### D. ABA Law School Accreditation: The InfiLaw Cautionary Tale

The most significant precedent for for-profit ownership of ABA-accredited law schools is the collapse of the InfiLaw System. InfiLaw Corporation, owned by private equity firm Sterling Partners, operated three for-profit law schools. **All three ultimately lost ABA accreditation or closed**:

**Charlotte School of Law** (North Carolina):
- Provisionally accredited 2008; fully accredited 2011
- Placed on probation November 2016 for admissions standards violations
- Lost federal student aid December 2016
- Closed August 2017 after ABA rejected teach-out plan
- Allegations: Admitted students with low LSAT scores to maximize tuition; paid students to delay bar exam to inflate passage rates

**Arizona Summit Law School** (Phoenix):
- Operated 2005-2018
- Probation March 2017 for noncompliance with academic/admissions standards
- Bar passage rate: 20.1% (third consecutive year below 31%)
- **ABA involuntarily withdrew accreditation July 9, 2018**—possibly the first involuntary revocation of an operating law school's accreditation
- School closed fall 2018

**Florida Coastal School of Law** (Jacksonville):
- Operated until 2021
- May 2020: ABA found significant noncompliance with Standard 316 (75% bar passage requirement)
- InfiLaw relinquished ownership April 2021
- Closed after summer 2021 term

**Common Failure Modes**:
1. **Admissions Standards Compromise**: All three schools admitted under-qualified students (low LSAT, low GPA) to maximize enrollment and tuition revenue
2. **Bar Passage Collapse**: Low admissions standards led to bar passage rates below 25-30%, triggering ABA noncompliance
3. **Profit Motive vs. Educational Quality**: For-profit ownership structure created incentives to prioritize revenue over educational outcomes
4. **ABA Standard 316**: The 2019 revision requiring 75% of graduates to pass a bar exam within 2 years proved fatal for schools with poor outcomes
5. **Federal Student Aid Dependence**: Loss of federal student aid eligibility made schools financially unviable

**ABA Standards on Academic Freedom**: While ABA Standard 102 addresses provisional approval (not operational independence), other standards are critical:
- **Standard 208**: Requires law schools to adopt, publish, and adhere to written policies protecting academic freedom
- **Standard 405(b)**: Security of position (tenure) is crucial for law professors to maintain academic freedom
- **Standard 316**: At least 75% of graduates must pass a bar exam within 2 years of graduation

**Application to Midwest University Law School**: The ABA will scrutinize whether American Education Holdings will maintain admissions standards, resist pressure to admit under-qualified students for revenue, and protect faculty tenure and academic freedom. Without robust operational independence protections, probability of ABA approval is **20-30%**.

**Required Mitigating Factors**:
- Independent law school board (7 members: 4 faculty-elected, 2 academic/legal professionals, 1 AEH representative)
- Guaranteed budget allocation (65% of law school tuition revenue)
- Admissions standards floor (Median LSAT ≥ 155, Median GPA ≥ 3.3, locked for 5 years)
- Faculty tenure protected (no terminations except for cause or bona fide financial exigency)
- Faculty control over curriculum, scholarship, teaching methods

With these protections, probability of ABA approval increases to **55-70%**.

**Consequence of Denial**: Loss of ABA accreditation means graduates cannot sit for bar exams in most states → enrollment collapse → law school closure within 1-2 years → loss of entire law school component of transaction (700 JD students, significant tuition revenue).

### E. Faculty Tenure Rights and the Bloomfield College Precedent

Midwest University has 680 tenured or tenure-track faculty members whose contractual rights will survive the acquisition. Most states now recognize that faculty handbooks create binding contracts, and tenure provisions are enforceable as additional compensation plans.

**Leading Case**: *AAUP, Bloomfield Chapter v. Bloomfield College*, 322 A.2d 846 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1974), aff'd 346 A.2d 615 (App. Div. 1975)—described as "one of the most extensive judicial explorations of financial exigency in higher education"—established that financial stress does not justify unilateral revocation of tenure. The court stated: "Even though the college is under financial stress, and that 'something had to be done,' it does not follow that the college's freedom of response extends to the unilateral revocation of a contractually protected employment status and the discharge of tenured teachers as a matter of unbridled discretion."

The court found that Bloomfield College's claimed financial exigency could not "reasonably support its claim of demonstrably bona fide financial exigency" and ordered reinstatement of all terminated tenured faculty.

**AAUP Definition**: Financial exigency is "a severe financial crisis that fundamentally compromises the academic integrity of the institution as a whole and that cannot be alleviated by less drastic means." Before terminating tenured faculty for financial exigency:
1. Institution must make every effort to place faculty in other suitable positions
2. Tenured appointments should not be terminated in favor of retaining non-tenured faculty
3. Faculty member entitled to full hearing before faculty committee
4. On-the-record adjudicative hearing with due process protections

**Successor Liability**: Under federal common law, a successor corporation assumes predecessor's liabilities if:
1. Successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume liabilities
2. Transaction is a de facto merger
3. Successor is "mere continuation" of predecessor
4. Transaction is fraudulent

The Project Athena transaction involves substantial continuity of operations (same campus, students, programs, faculty), creating strong successor liability. American Education Holdings will assume Midwest University's contractual obligations to tenured faculty.

**University Merger Precedents**:
- **Rosemont-Villanova**: Tenured faculty offered contracts at Villanova and can apply for tenured status
- **Puget Sound to Seattle University**: Seattle U agreed to honor all rank and tenure, retain all staff, offer comparable compensation
- **Indiana University Policy**: "Contractual rights and obligations of faculty and graduate students shall be honored during mergers and reorganizations. Except under conditions of financial exigency, the appointments of tenured and probationary tenure-track faculty members shall not be terminated as a consequence of merger or reorganization."

**Litigation Risk**: If American Education Holdings attempts mass tenure terminations (e.g., 100 faculty), probability of successful challenges is **70-85%**. Individual settlements: $100,000-$300,000 each. Total exposure: **$10M-$30M**. Additional consequence: AAUP censure, creating severe reputational damage and impairing faculty recruitment for years.

### F. HLC Regional Accreditation and Marjorie Webster Deference

The Higher Learning Commission requires prior Board approval for change of control. Only after HLC approval may Midwest University consummate the transaction. Without mission/quality protections, probability of approval is **25-35%**.

**Judicial Review Standard**: *Marjorie Webster Junior College v. Middle States Association*, 432 F.2d 650 (D.C. Cir. 1970), established highly deferential judicial review. The D.C. Circuit held that courts should accord "substantial deference" to accreditors' professional judgment regarding educational standards. The extent of deference varies with subject matter and degree of harm, but courts recognize that accreditors possess specialized expertise in evaluating educational quality.

**Application**: If HLC denies change of control, judicial review will apply this highly deferential standard. Midwest University would need to prove HLC's decision was arbitrary, capricious, contrary to its own standards, or based on improper motives—a very difficult burden.

**Required Mitigating Factors for HLC Approval**:
- Commitment to maintain educational mission as primary purpose
- Financial sustainability plan demonstrating long-term viability
- Protection of academic programs and student services
- Maintenance of faculty governance and academic freedom
- Evidence that for-profit ownership will not compromise quality

With robust protections, probability of approval increases to **50-65%**.

**Consequence of Denial**: Loss of regional accreditation means students cannot transfer credits, federal financial aid eligibility is lost, enrollment collapses, and institution closes within 6-12 months. This is a transaction-killing event.

### G. Employment Discrimination: Dr. Chen EEOC Charge

The pending EEOC charge by Dr. Susan Chen (tenure denial, race/sex discrimination allegations) creates moderate risk and complicates regulatory approvals.

**McDonnell Douglas Framework**: The burden-shifting framework requires:
1. Plaintiff establishes prima facie case (protected class membership, qualifications, rejection under discriminatory circumstances)
2. Employer articulates legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason
3. Plaintiff proves employer's reason is pretext for discrimination

**Tenure-Specific Precedent**: Evidence that an employer departed from normal procedural sequence when denying tenure may establish inference of discrimination sufficient to satisfy prima facie burden.

**Pretext Evidence**: Plaintiff can show pretext through:
- Weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies in employer's stated reasons
- Comparator evidence (similarly situated white/male faculty granted tenure with comparable records)
- Subjective criteria applied inconsistently
- Procedural irregularities

**Litigation Exposure**:
- Probability of EEOC cause finding: **30-45%**
- Settlement range: $200,000-$500,000
- Verdict risk: $400,000-$1,200,000 (reinstatement with tenure, back pay, front pay 2-5 years, emotional distress, attorney fees)

**Acquisition Impact**: Unresolved discrimination charge creates:
1. Successor liability risk for American Education Holdings
2. Reputational risk during acquisition
3. HLC accreditation concerns (commitment to diversity, equal opportunity)
4. Potential for class action if systemic patterns exist

**Recommendation**: Engage in good-faith EEOC conciliation; consider tenure reconsideration through independent review panel.

### H. Overall Transaction Risk Assessment and Required Modifications

**Current Structure Probability of Success**: **15-25%**

The transaction faces three critical regulatory approvals:
1. Indiana Attorney General (cy pres/charitable trust compliance)
2. HLC change of control
3. ABA law school change of control

**If any one fails, the transaction cannot close as currently structured** (or law school must be excluded).

**Required Transaction Modifications**:

**1. Endowment Restructuring (CRITICAL)**:
- Create separate **Midwest University Educational Foundation** (501(c)(3))
- Transfer $468M donor-restricted endowment to foundation (not to AEH)
- Independent foundation board (majority community representatives)
- Foundation makes annual grants to support educational programs
- American Education Holdings acquires operating assets for $312M (campus, equipment, programs, unrestricted $182M endowment)
- **Effect**: Probability of Indiana AG approval increases from 10-20% to 60-75%

**2. Law School Operational Independence (CRITICAL)**:
- Independent law school board (4 faculty-elected, 2 academic professionals, 1 AEH)
- Guaranteed budget: 65% of law school tuition revenue
- Admissions standards floor: Median LSAT ≥ 155, GPA ≥ 3.3 (locked 5 years)
- Faculty tenure protected; faculty control curriculum
- **Effect**: Probability of ABA approval increases from 20-30% to 55-70%

**3. HLC Mission Preservation (CRITICAL)**:
- Educational mission as primary purpose (documented in charter)
- No dividends/profit distributions for 5 years (reinvest surplus)
- Faculty governance maintained (senate authority over curriculum)
- Student services protected at current levels
- **Effect**: Probability of HLC approval increases from 25-35% to 50-65%

**4. Faculty Tenure Commitments (MODERATE)**:
- 5-year transition protection: honor all existing tenure commitments
- Maintain faculty handbook governance provisions
- No retrenchment without demonstrable bona fide financial exigency (AAUP definition)
- Shared governance procedures for handbook amendments
- **Effect**: Eliminates $10M-$30M litigation exposure risk

**5. Litigation Resolution (MODERATE)**:
- Title IX: Settle for $250,000-$350,000 with confidentiality and expungement
- EEOC: Good-faith conciliation; independent tenure review for Dr. Chen
- **Effect**: Removes successor liability exposure; improves regulatory approval prospects

### I. Alternative Structures with Higher Success Probability

**Alternative 1: Affiliation Model (70-85% approval probability)**
- Midwest University remains 501(c)(3)
- American Education Holdings provides management services for fee
- Endowment remains with nonprofit university
- Avoids cy pres/charitable trust issues
- Simpler accreditation approval process

**Alternative 2: For-Profit Subsidiary Model (60-75% approval probability)**
- Midwest University (501(c)(3)) remains parent
- Creates for-profit subsidiary for certain operations (online, continuing education)
- Traditional campus programs remain nonprofit
- Endowment stays with nonprofit parent

**Alternative 3: Exclude Law School (55-70% approval probability for remaining institution)**
- American Education Holdings acquires undergraduate/graduate programs only
- Law school remains separate nonprofit or affiliates with another ABA institution
- Eliminates ABA for-profit ownership concerns

### J. Critical Timeline and Path Forward

**Estimated Timeline** (with required modifications): **18-30 months**

| Approval | Duration | Probability (Modified Structure) |
|----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Indiana AG (endowment) | 9-16 months | 60-75% |
| HLC change of control | 12-18 months | 50-65% |
| ABA law school | 12-18 months | 55-70% |
| Title IX settlement | 2-4 months | 85-95% |
| EEOC resolution | 6-12 months | 65-75% |

**Combined Probability of All Approvals** (with modifications): **25-35%**

**Recommendation**: The transaction requires fundamental restructuring to be viable. The endowment must be separated into a 501(c)(3) foundation, the law school must have robust operational independence protections, and HLC mission preservation commitments are essential. Even with these modifications, the transaction faces material regulatory approval risk. American Education Holdings should seriously consider Alternative 1 (Affiliation Model) or Alternative 2 (For-Profit Subsidiary), both of which preserve the nonprofit structure and dramatically increase approval probability to 60-85%.

Without restructuring, the transaction has a **high probability of failure** due to Indiana AG denial of endowment transfer, HLC denial of change of control, or ABA denial of law school transfer. The InfiLaw precedent demonstrates that for-profit ownership of law schools creates structural conflicts between profit maximization and educational quality that accreditors view as incompatible with accreditation standards. The Blue Cross conversion precedent establishes that charitable assets cannot be privatized without setting aside fair market value in perpetuity for charitable purposes. These legal constraints are not negotiable—they reflect fundamental principles of charitable trust law and accreditation standards developed over decades of precedent.

## III. INDIANA CHARITABLE TRUST LAW

### A. Statutory Framework

#### Indiana Code 30-4-3-27: Cy Pres Doctrine

Indiana has codified the cy pres doctrine in Indiana Code 30-4-3-27, which provides that when property given to a charitable trust becomes impossible, impracticable, wasteful, or illegal to carry out the particular purpose, and the settlor manifested a general charitable intention, a court may direct the application of property to some charitable purpose which falls within the general charitable intention of the settlor.¹

The statute contains an important limitation: The terms of a charitable trust that would result in distribution to a noncharitable beneficiary prevails over the court's power to apply cy pres only if the trust property is to revert to the settlor and the settlor is still alive, or less than twenty-one years have elapsed since the trust was created.²

**Application to Project Athena**: The $468M in donor-restricted endowment funds at Midwest University are likely subject to cy pres principles. The statute's requirement that funds remain dedicated to charitable purposes creates a significant obstacle to transferring these assets to a for-profit entity (American Education Holdings). The 21-year limitation suggests that older endowment gifts—many likely dating back decades—cannot revert to donors and must be redirected to charitable purposes if the original purpose becomes impracticable.

#### Indiana Code 30-4-5.5: Attorney General Enforcement Authority

Under Indiana Code chapter 30-4-5.5, the Indiana Attorney General has enforcement authority over trustees of benevolent trusts who commit a breach of trust.³ Indiana law defines "qualified beneficiary" to mean the Attorney General, if the trust is a charitable trust having its principal place of administration in Indiana.⁴

The Attorney General must receive notice for all court proceedings involving trusts for benevolent public purposes, including trust modifications, terminations, deviations, decanting, appointment of successor trustees, trust contests, and accountings filed with the court for approval.⁵

**Application to Project Athena**: The Indiana Attorney General is a mandatory party to any cy pres proceeding involving Midwest University's endowment. The AG must review and approve any proposed transfer or modification of the $468M donor-restricted endowment. The AG represents the public interest in enforcing charitable trusts and will scrutinize whether transferring educational endowment funds to a for-profit entity comports with donor intent and charitable trust principles.

### B. Role of Attorney General in Cy Pres Proceedings

The Attorney General is a mandatory party to virtually all cy pres proceedings because they represent the public interest in enforcing charitable trusts.⁶ The Attorney General's office often submits proposals for substitute beneficiaries and purposes, which the court weighs alongside those of the trustee.⁷

A significant factor in cy pres proceedings is the type of charitable activity the donor sought to support, such as education, healthcare, or animal welfare. For example, funds meant for a closed university program were reallocated to support scholarships.⁸

**Application to Project Athena**: The Indiana AG will likely scrutinize whether American Education Holdings, as a for-profit entity, can serve as a proper recipient of charitable educational endowment funds. The AG may propose alternative arrangements, such as:
- Transfer of the $468M donor-restricted funds to a separate 501(c)(3) foundation that makes grants to support Midwest University students
- Cy pres modification to redirect funds to other Indiana educational institutions
- Conditions requiring that endowment income be used exclusively for scholarships and educational purposes, with strict oversight

### C. Donor Intent and Restricted Gifts

Courts applying cy pres doctrine must respect donor intent to the maximum extent possible. When donors restrict gifts to specific educational purposes (e.g., scholarships, endowed chairs, building funds), those restrictions create enforceable charitable trusts that cannot be diverted to general corporate purposes or profit-making activities.⁹

**Application to Project Athena**: Midwest University's endowment is 72% donor-restricted ($468M). Each restricted gift likely contains specific language about perpetual use for educational purposes. Examples might include:
- Endowed faculty chairs in specific departments
- Scholarship funds for students from particular geographic areas or demographic groups
- Building and equipment funds for specific facilities
- Program endowments for law school, medical school, etc.

Transferring these funds to a for-profit entity raises fundamental questions about whether donor intent can be satisfied when the recipient institution is profit-maximizing rather than charitable. Indiana courts applying cy pres doctrine will likely require that any such transfer include stringent protections to ensure perpetual use for charitable educational purposes consistent with original donor intent.

## IV. ENDOWMENT TRANSFER PRECEDENT: NONPROFIT-TO-FOR-PROFIT CONVERSIONS

### A. Charitable Trust Doctrine and Asset Lock Principle

The conversion of a nonprofit to a for-profit entity is governed by the **charitable trust doctrine** or "asset lock," which establishes that all assets of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit are permanently dedicated to its specific charitable purpose and held in trust for the public's benefit.¹⁰

A health care "for-profit conversion" is the sale of all or a substantial part of the assets of a charitable entity to a for-profit entity.¹¹ A nonprofit can transition into a for-profit business, but the process is complex and highly regulated, involving a structured transaction that dissolves the nonprofit and transfers its operations to a new for-profit company.¹²

**Application to Project Athena**: The proposed $780M acquisition of Midwest University by American Education Holdings constitutes a for-profit conversion subject to the charitable trust doctrine. All of Midwest University's assets—including the $650M endowment—are charitable assets held in trust for public educational purposes. The transaction cannot simply transfer these assets to a for-profit entity without ensuring their continued dedication to charitable purposes.

### B. State Attorney General Oversight and Approval Requirements

State attorneys general are mandated to oversee the due application of charitable funds and ensure nonprofit directors fulfill their fiduciary duties to the nonprofit corporation.¹³ Attorneys general serve as protectors of charitable trusts and charitable assets, including charitable interests in endowment funds.¹⁴

The Attorney General's office ensures charitable assets are not misused by reviewing the transaction to confirm the nonprofit is receiving **fair market value** for its assets.¹⁵ Depending on state laws, approval of the Secretary of State, Attorney General, or a court may be required before transferring substantially all of a nonprofit's assets to another entity.¹⁶

**Tennessee Law Example**: Tennessee law requires nonprofit organizations to notify the Attorney General at least 45 days prior to the close of any merger, sale of substantially all assets, or conversion to another business entity form.¹⁷

**Pennsylvania Law Example**: Pennsylvania's Attorney General, as *parens patriae*, must review fundamental change transactions involving charitable health care entities to ensure public interest in charitable assets is fully protected.¹⁸

**Application to Project Athena**: Indiana's Attorney General must approve the transaction under similar principles. The AG will conduct a thorough review to ensure:
1. Fair market value determination for Midwest University's assets
2. Protection of the $650M endowment for continued charitable use
3. Safeguards ensuring educational mission continuity
4. Compliance with donor restrictions on $468M in restricted funds

### C. Blue Cross Conversions: Precedent for Charitable Asset Preservation

The wave of Blue Cross Blue Shield plan conversions from nonprofit to for-profit status in the 1990s and 2000s established important precedent for protecting charitable assets in for-profit conversions.

#### 1. Requirement to Preserve Charitable Assets

Because the assets of nonprofit entities subsidized by taxpayers are charitable trusts, those assets must continue to serve charitable purposes because they belong to the community.¹⁹ Regulators are typically required to determine whether the assets of the plan are charitable and belong to the public, and if so, that the fair market value of the plan will be set aside for the public.²⁰

Most conversions were approved once the plans agreed to set aside millions of dollars in the public trust, and it soon became standard for plans to propose upfront that assets be earmarked for charitable or public purposes.²¹

#### 2. Creation of Charitable Foundations

The endowment of a completely new foundation is the most common result of conversions that redirect significant charitable resources.²² While some of these may be new public foundations, most are established as private independent foundations.²³

**California**: Blue Cross of California agreed to distribute all of its assets, over $3.2 billion, to two grant-making health foundations, creating The California Endowment and the California HealthCare Foundation.²⁴

**Missouri**: Suits were settled with an agreement to use RightChoice stock to create a foundation valued at nearly $500 million.²⁵

**Colorado**: Anthem paid $155 million (the fair market value of Blue Cross) to the Caring for Colorado Foundation, a nonprofit corporation created to receive and use the funds to serve the health care needs of Colorado citizens.²⁶

**Wisconsin**: The Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance approved the conversion, and proceeds from the company's sale were distributed to both the Medical College of Wisconsin and the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine; both received approximately $300 million to be used to improve the health of Wisconsin residents.²⁷

**Application to Project Athena**: These precedents strongly suggest that Indiana's Attorney General will require that Midwest University's $650M endowment be preserved in a separate 501(c)(3) charitable foundation rather than transferred directly to American Education Holdings. The Blue Cross conversions establish the principle that charitable assets accumulated through tax exemption and public support cannot be privatized but must remain dedicated to charitable purposes through a foundation or similar vehicle.

### D. Educational Institution Conversions: Limited Precedent

The search results revealed one educational conversion precedent:

**Tulane University Hospital Conversion**: The City of Jacksonville and Tulane University received conversion proceeds totaling approximately $115 million, with Tulane University reported using the proceeds, in part, for working capital, an addition to its endowment, and capital to fund the development of new programs.²⁸

**Application to Project Athena**: This precedent shows that educational institutions can receive conversion proceeds to augment their endowments. However, this involved a nonprofit hospital sale by a university, not the conversion of the university itself to for-profit status. The Project Athena transaction is more fundamental—the entire university is being acquired by a for-profit entity, not merely a subsidiary operation.

### E. Fair Market Value and Public Interest Standards

An acquisition is not in the public interest unless appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that:
1. The value of public or charitable assets is safeguarded
2. The public or charitable assets' value is spent in a manner that corresponds with the potential risk associated with the acquisition²⁹

Both state and federal law require the proceeds from the sale of not-for-profit, tax-exempt assets to be used for charitable purposes.³⁰ Conversions of not-for-profit hospitals have resulted in multimillion-dollar endowments to charitable institutions.³¹

**Application to Project Athena**: The $780M purchase price must be scrutinized to ensure it represents fair market value for Midwest University's assets, including:
- $650M endowment
- Real property (campus, buildings, facilities)
- Intellectual property and reputation
- Accreditation status (HLC, ABA law school)
- Student enrollment and tuition revenue streams

The Indiana AG will likely require an independent valuation and may challenge whether the purchase price adequately compensates the public for the loss of a charitable educational institution.

## V. TITLE IX DUE PROCESS CASE LAW

### A. Foundational Principles: Private Universities and Contract Rights

Private universities are not legally required by the Constitution to promise fair procedures to their students, but nearly all universities have student handbooks and manuals that set out rules and standards for their student judicial systems.³² When a student agrees to attend a university and pay tuition, relying upon the rules and regulations the university has established, a contractual relationship is created.³³

The consensus of courts is that the relationship between a student and a university has "a strong, albeit flexible, contractual flavor," and promises made in handbooks have to be "substantially observed."³⁴ Courts have held that some courts have found that students of private schools have a right to "good faith and fair dealing" such that schools may not suspend or expel students without some rudimentary safeguards of fairness.³⁵

**Application to Doe v. Midwest University**: The expelled student's claims are grounded in breach of contract and Title IX gender discrimination, not constitutional due process (which only applies to public universities). Midwest University's student handbook and Title IX policies create contractual obligations that must be "substantially observed."

### B. Title IX Gender Discrimination Framework

Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs receiving federal funding. Students expelled following Title IX proceedings have successfully brought federal lawsuits claiming that gender bias affected either the decision to pursue charges or the outcome of disciplinary proceedings.

#### 1. Yusuf v. Vassar College: The Foundational Two-Theory Framework

In *Yusuf v. Vassar College*, 35 F.3d 709 (2d Cir. 1994), the Second Circuit established two distinct theories for Title IX gender discrimination claims:³⁶

**Erroneous Outcome Theory**: Plaintiffs must allege particular facts sufficient to cast some articulable doubt on the accuracy of the outcome of the disciplinary proceeding. If no such doubt exists based on the record before the disciplinary tribunal, the claim must fail.³⁷

**Selective Enforcement Theory**: The plaintiff alleges that, regardless of guilt or innocence, the severity of the penalty and/or the decision to initiate the proceeding was affected by the student's gender.³⁸

In *Yusuf*, the plaintiff alleged that males accused of sexual harassment at Vassar are "historically and systematically" and "invariably found guilty, regardless of the evidence, or lack thereof." The court stated these allegations would more than suffice in a Title VII case and easily meet the requirements of Title IX.³⁹

**Application to Doe v. MU**: The plaintiff likely asserts both theories: (1) erroneous outcome (evidence was excluded, hearing panel was biased, cross-examination was limited), and (2) selective enforcement (university has a pattern of finding male students responsible regardless of evidence due to pressure from OCR and advocacy groups).

#### 2. Doe v. Purdue University: The Simplified "Sex as Motivating Factor" Standard

In *Doe v. Purdue University*, 928 F.3d 652 (7th Cir. 2019), then-Judge Amy Coney Barrett authored an opinion rejecting the rigid doctrinal tests of other circuits and adopting a more flexible standard.⁴⁰

The Seventh Circuit held that instead of imposing specific doctrinal elements not found in the Title IX statute, the correct standard should simply require plaintiffs to set forth enough evidence, from the totality of the case, showing "that **sex was a motivating factor** in a university's decision to discipline a student."⁴¹

**Background**: John Doe, a Purdue student, was found guilty of sexual violence against his former girlfriend Jane Doe and was suspended for one academic year. As a result, he was expelled from the Navy ROTC program, losing both his scholarship and his planned military career.⁴²

The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal, finding that Doe had alleged sufficient facts to raise a plausible inference that sex was a motivating factor in Purdue's decision.⁴³

**Impact**: The *Purdue* standard has been adopted by the Third, Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits, and the Fifth Circuit has signaled likely acceptance.⁴⁴ This represents a circuit-wide consensus on a more plaintiff-friendly pleading standard.

**Application to Doe v. MU**: The Southern District of Indiana (within the Seventh Circuit) will apply the *Purdue* standard. Doe need not satisfy rigid doctrinal tests but must plead facts sufficient to create a plausible inference that his male gender motivated the university's decision. Evidence of gender bias in training materials, investigator bias, hearing panel composition, or disparate treatment patterns would satisfy this standard.

#### 3. Doe v. Oberlin College: Hearing Panel Decision as Evidence of Bias

In *Doe v. Oberlin College*, 60 F.4th 345 (6th Cir. 2023), a divided Sixth Circuit panel held that a hearing panel's decision may itself constitute evidence of gender bias.⁴⁵

The court lowered the pleading standard, holding that "patterns of decision-making" in an institution's cases were sufficient to demonstrate gender bias in a particular case.⁴⁶ The court considered not only Doe's allegations of gender bias (which were substantial), but also the substance of the hearing panel's decision in Doe's case.⁴⁷

**Evidence of Bias Cited**:
- Pro-complainant statements made by Oberlin's Title IX coordinator and Doe's own advisor
- The "100 percent responsibility rate" for respondents in sexual misconduct hearings in 2015–16
- Pressure on Oberlin from OCR's investigation into the College's handling of sexual misconduct claims⁴⁸

**Application to Doe v. MU**: If Midwest University has a very high finding rate for male respondents (e.g., 90-100% responsibility findings), this statistical pattern can itself support an inference of gender bias. Combined with other evidence (biased training materials, investigator bias, procedural irregularities), this creates a strong Title IX claim.

#### 4. Doe v. Baum: Cross-Examination as Constitutional Right

In *Doe v. Baum*, 903 F.3d 575 (6th Cir. 2018), the Sixth Circuit held that when a Title IX disciplinary proceeding comes down to a credibility determination, the accused student has a constitutional right under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to cross-examine his accuser.⁴⁹

The court concluded that "if a university is faced with competing narratives about potential misconduct, the administration must facilitate some form of cross-examination in order to satisfy due process."⁵⁰

**Impact on Single Investigator Model**: The decision calls into question the single-investigator model used by many institutions, in which one person serves as investigator, prosecutor, and adjudicator without any hearing or opportunity for witness cross-examination.⁵¹

**Note**: *Doe v. Baum* applies only to **public universities** (constitutional due process) and only in the Sixth Circuit. However, private universities in all circuits may face breach of contract claims if their handbooks promise "fair procedures" or a "hearing" but then use a single-investigator model that denies cross-examination.

**Application to Doe v. MU**: If Midwest University's Title IX procedures promised a "hearing" or "opportunity to question witnesses" but then limited cross-examination, this could support both Title IX (gender bias in excluding exculpatory evidence) and breach of contract claims. The 2020 Title IX regulations (34 C.F.R. § 106.45) now require live hearings with cross-examination for formal Title IX complaints, which may be incorporated into MU's policies.

### C. Evidence of Gender Bias in Title IX Proceedings

Courts have found plausible gender bias allegations based on the following types of evidence:

#### 1. Biased Training Materials

Students have alleged that hearing panels were trained using materials that would lead to unfair bias, with evidence suggesting "the training materials used to train these panel members are biased against males."⁵²

Courts have cited concerns about hearing panel members' published works as evidence of possible gender bias, such as a co-chair's dissertation examining gender norms and moral behavior.⁵³

#### 2. Pressure from Federal Investigations and Social Movements

Courts have considered as evidence of bias:
- Pressure from OCR investigations into a university's handling of sexual misconduct claims
- Societal pressures from the Me Too movement
- Obama-era guidance creating pressure to increase responsibility findings⁵⁴

#### 3. Statistical Patterns

A "100 percent responsibility rate" for male respondents in sexual misconduct hearings can support an inference of gender bias.⁵⁵

#### 4. Procedural Irregularities

Factors that have led to Title IX defense lawsuits being allowed to proceed include:
- Failure to follow the university's own procedures
- Failure to interview witnesses
- Biased persons in meaningful roles (investigator, coordinator, hearing panel)
- Bias in Title IX training materials⁵⁶

**Application to Doe v. MU**: The motion to dismiss was denied in June 2024, meaning the court found that Doe's complaint stated plausible claims for relief. This suggests Doe alleged sufficient facts regarding gender bias, procedural irregularities, and/or erroneous outcome to survive dismissal. The case will proceed to discovery, where Doe can obtain evidence of:
- Midwest University's Title IX training materials
- Statistical data on responsibility findings by gender
- Communications showing pressure to increase findings against male students
- Evidence of investigator or hearing panel bias

### D. Damages and Remedies in Title IX Cases

#### 1. Available Damages

**Compensatory Damages**: Plaintiffs filing Title IX claims typically will not recover compensatory damages unless they offer evidence that the discrimination was willful, deliberate, or intentional.⁵⁷

**Punitive Damages**: Not available for Title IX claims, as the Supreme Court held that punitive damages are not available for Spending Clause violations.⁵⁸

**Emotional Distress Damages**: In *Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller*, 142 S. Ct. 1562 (2022), the Supreme Court held that emotional distress damages are not recoverable under Title IX or Title VI.⁵⁹ Because plaintiffs can now only recover compensatory damages (out of pocket costs) resulting from discrimination, fewer Title IX cases are likely to go to trial and parties will settle for lower amounts.⁶⁰

**Out-of-Pocket Losses Recoverable**:
- Lost tuition and housing from periods when the student was suspended or expelled⁶¹
- Lost ROTC scholarship (as in *Doe v. Purdue*)⁶²
- Lost career opportunities (e.g., military career, graduate school admission)
- Costs of transferring to another institution

#### 2. Settlement Amounts

Claims settled with students accused of sexual misconduct cost universities less in damages on average—around **$20,000 to $30,000**.⁶³ These settlements typically cover the accused student's losses in tuition and housing from periods when they were suspended or expelled.⁶⁴

**Application to Doe v. MU**: The $500K-$2M exposure estimate appears high given recent precedent limiting emotional distress damages. A more realistic exposure range would be:
- **Settlement Range**: $150,000-$500,000 (tuition refund, lost semester, transfer costs, attorney fees, nuisance value)
- **Verdict Risk (if liability found)**: $300,000-$800,000 (one-year suspension tuition/housing, reputational harm, lost opportunities, attorney fees)

The $500K-$2M range may reflect inclusion of reinstatement value, expungement, and attorney fees under a fee-shifting provision if Doe prevails on his Title IX claim.

## VI. DOE V. MIDWEST UNIVERSITY ANALYSIS

### A. Procedural Posture

*Doe v. Midwest University*, No. 1:24-cv-XXXX (S.D. Ind. filed 2024), survived a motion to dismiss in June 2024. This indicates that the court found Doe's complaint stated plausible claims for relief under *Iqbal*/*Twombly* pleading standards.⁶⁵

### B. Likely Claims Alleged

Based on the survival of the motion to dismiss and application of Seventh Circuit precedent, Doe likely asserted:

1. **Title IX Gender Discrimination** (*Doe v. Purdue* standard): Allegations that sex was a motivating factor in Midwest University's decision to find him responsible and expel him.

2. **Breach of Contract**: Allegations that Midwest University failed to follow procedures promised in its student handbook and Title IX policies.

3. **Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing**: Allegations that the university acted in bad faith by denying him a fair process.

### C. Likelihood of Plaintiff Success

**Moderate to High Risk** for Midwest University, based on:

1. **Motion to Dismiss Denied**: The case survived dismissal, meaning the court found Doe alleged sufficient facts to create plausible claims.

2. **Seventh Circuit Plaintiff-Friendly Standard**: The *Purdue* "sex as motivating factor" standard (adopted by Justice Barrett) is more favorable to plaintiffs than the rigid tests used in some other circuits.

3. **Discovery Will Likely Reveal Damaging Evidence**: Doe will obtain:
   - Title IX training materials (potential bias against male students)
   - Statistical data on responsibility findings (disparate impact on males)
   - Investigator and panel communications (potential bias)
   - Comparator evidence (similar cases treated differently)

4. **Pattern Evidence**: If Midwest University has a high responsibility-finding rate for male respondents (e.g., >85%), this supports an inference of gender bias under *Doe v. Oberlin*.

### D. Settlement Recommendation

**Recommended Settlement Range**: $250,000-$500,000

**Rationale**:
- Avoids discovery costs ($150,000-$300,000 in attorney fees)
- Eliminates verdict risk ($300,000-$800,000 if liability found)
- Avoids reputational damage from public trial
- Prevents creation of adverse precedent binding on university
- May include confidentiality provision and expungement from student's record

**Litigation Risk if No Settlement**:
- 40-60% probability of plaintiff verdict (given motion to dismiss denial and Seventh Circuit precedent)
- $300,000-$800,000 damages exposure (tuition, housing, transfer costs, lost opportunities, attorney fees)
- Reinstatement and expungement remedies (non-monetary but significant)

## VII. ABA LAW SCHOOL FOR-PROFIT OWNERSHIP PRECEDENT

### A. InfiLaw Corporation: The Cautionary Tale

InfiLaw System was a consortium of for-profit law schools owned almost entirely by private equity company Sterling Partners.⁶⁶ The system operated three law schools, all of which ultimately lost ABA accreditation or closed:

#### 1. Charlotte School of Law

**History**: Established in 2006; provisionally accredited by ABA in 2008; fully accredited in 2011.⁶⁷

**Problems Identified**:
- InfiLaw and Charlotte School of Law intentionally admitted students with bad grades and low or no LSAT scores to maximize tuition revenue⁶⁸
- In 2014, the school began paying students to delay taking the bar exam to inflate bar passage rates⁶⁹
- The school faced compliance issues tied to admission policies and practices⁷⁰

**ABA Action**: Placed on probation in November 2016; lost federal student aid in December 2016 after Department of Education found school was not honest with students about ABA accreditation issues.⁷¹

**Closure**: August 2017, after ABA Council rejected teach-out plan.⁷²

**Litigation**: Multiple lawsuits alleged problematic practices. Students filed fraud lawsuit claiming the school misrepresented job placement rates and bar passage statistics.⁷³

#### 2. Arizona Summit Law School

**History**: Operated from 2005 to 2018 in Phoenix, Arizona.⁷⁴

**Problems Identified**:
- Placed on probation in March 2017 for noncompliance with standards involving academic standards and admissions⁷⁵
- Extremely low bar passage rates: 20.1% pass rate on July 2017 exam
- Third consecutive year with passage rate below 31% on Arizona bar exam⁷⁶

**ABA Action**: ABA withdrew accreditation effective July 9, 2018, marking what may be the first time that approval of an operating law school was involuntarily revoked by the Council.⁷⁷

**Closure**: School began closing fall 2018; did not offer fall classes after losing accreditation approval.⁷⁸

**Litigation**: Arizona Summit sued ABA, becoming the third for-profit InfiLaw school to sue the ABA over accreditation findings, arguing due process rights were violated.⁷⁹

#### 3. Florida Coastal School of Law

**History**: Located in Jacksonville, Florida; operated until 2021.⁸⁰

**Problems Identified**:
- May 15, 2020: ABA determined significant noncompliance with Standard 316 (revised 2019 to require at least 75% of graduates pass a bar exam within two years)⁸¹
- August 2020: Florida Coastal demonstrated compliance, asserting 75% of 2018 graduates passed a bar exam⁸²

**Closure**: InfiLaw relinquished ownership in April 2021; school closed after Summer 2021 term.⁸³

### B. Common Themes: Why For-Profit Law Schools Failed

1. **Admissions Standards Compromise**: All three schools were accused of admitting under-qualified students to maximize tuition revenue, leading to poor bar passage rates.

2. **Bar Passage Rates**: Extremely low bar passage rates (below 25-31%) triggered ABA noncompliance findings.

3. **Profit Motive vs. Educational Mission**: The for-profit ownership structure created incentives to prioritize revenue over educational quality.

4. **ABA Standard 316**: The revised 2019 standard requiring 75% of graduates to pass a bar exam within two years proved fatal for schools with poor outcomes.

5. **Federal Student Aid Dependence**: Loss of federal student aid eligibility (due to ABA accreditation issues) made schools financially unviable.

### C. ABA Standards on Academic Freedom and Operational Independence

While ABA Standard 102 addresses "Provisional Approval" (not operational independence as originally thought), other standards address academic freedom:

**Standard 208 (Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression)**: Requires law schools to adopt, publish, and adhere to written policies protecting academic freedom.⁸⁴ This standard was created to strengthen protections beyond previous Standard 405(b), which only required schools to have a policy without requiring adherence.⁸⁵

**Standard 405(b) (Tenure and Academic Freedom)**: Security of position (tenure) is crucial for law professors to maintain academic freedom, providing protection against external pressures and unjust dismissal.⁸⁶

**Application to Project Athena**: The ABA will scrutinize whether American Education Holdings (for-profit) will:
1. Maintain admissions standards to ensure bar passage rates remain above 75%
2. Resist pressure to admit under-qualified students for tuition revenue
3. Protect academic freedom and faculty tenure
4. Maintain operational independence from profit-maximizing demands
5. Provide adequate resources for legal education quality

### D. Lessons from InfiLaw for Project Athena

**Critical Risk**: The InfiLaw precedent demonstrates that for-profit ownership of law schools creates structural conflicts between profit maximization and educational quality that the ABA views as incompatible with accreditation standards.

**ABA Likely Concerns**:
1. Will American Education Holdings pressure Midwest University Law School to lower admissions standards to increase enrollment and tuition revenue?
2. Will budget cuts compromise bar passage rates and trigger Standard 316 noncompliance?
3. Will faculty tenure and academic freedom be protected from profit-driven decision-making?
4. Will the law school maintain sufficient operational independence?

**Mitigating Factors Needed**:
- Independent law school board with majority faculty and academic representatives
- Guaranteed budget allocation as percentage of revenue
- Contractual protection of faculty tenure and academic freedom
- Maintenance of admissions standards (LSAT, GPA medians)
- Firewall between for-profit parent and law school academic decisions

## VIII. FACULTY TENURE CONTRACT RIGHTS

### A. Faculty Handbooks as Enforceable Contracts

Most states now recognize that specific promises embodied in employee handbooks may be binding on employers.⁸⁷ Courts have found that tenure and tenure-track provisions in faculty handbooks are additional compensation plans that form an enforceable part of faculty members' contracts with universities.⁸⁸

In the higher education context, handbook commitments can be treated as contractually enforceable but afford colleges and universities flexibility to amend handbook policies so long as modifications are reasonable in light of academic custom, made with reasonable advance notice, and adopted consistent with principles of shared governance.⁸⁹

**Key Precedent**: In a notable case, the court noted that the faculty handbook was incorporated into each individual faculty member's letter of appointment, observed that the handbook's preamble stated it was "legally binding," and concluded that the university faculty handbook was "legally binding and enforceable upon both parties."⁹⁰

**Application to Project Athena**: Midwest University's faculty handbook likely contains provisions on tenure, promotion, dismissal, and shared governance that are contractually binding. The 680 tenured and tenure-track faculty members have enforceable contractual rights that survive the acquisition unless explicitly modified through proper procedures.

### B. Shared Governance as Contractual Obligation

Shared governance refers to the joint responsibility of faculty, administrations, and governing boards to govern colleges and universities, with differences in each group's voice determined by the extent of its responsibility for and expertise on particular issues.⁹¹

The Faculty Handbook contains central policies of universities developed through shared governance, containing official policies established by the Board of Trustees or by the President under authority delegated by the Board of Trustees.⁹²

**Example—NYU**: The Faculty Handbook at NYU was approved by the University Board of Trustees, with the amendment process outlined within the handbook's Foreword. The policies outlined in the Faculty Handbook form part of the essential employment understandings between faculty members and the University.⁹³

**Application to Project Athena**: If Midwest University's faculty handbook incorporates AAUP principles or contains specific shared governance provisions (faculty senate authority, curriculum control, budget consultation), these create contractual obligations that American Education Holdings must honor or modify through proper shared governance procedures.

### C. Financial Exigency and Tenure Termination

#### 1. Definition and Standards

Under AAUP standards, termination may occur under extraordinary circumstances because of a demonstrably bona fide financial exigency, defined as "a severe financial crisis that fundamentally compromises the academic integrity of the institution as a whole and that cannot be alleviated by less drastic means."⁹⁴

Before terminating an appointment because of financial exigency, the institution must make every effort to place the faculty member in another suitable position, and tenured appointments should not be terminated in favor of retaining faculty without tenure, except in extraordinary circumstances.⁹⁵

#### 2. Leading Case: AAUP v. Bloomfield College

In *AAUP, Bloomfield Chapter v. Bloomfield College*, 322 A.2d 846 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1974), aff'd 346 A.2d 615 (App. Div. 1975)—described as "one of the most extensive judicial explorations of financial exigency in higher education"—the court held that tenure adoption reflects "concern for the general welfare by providing for the benefits of uninhibited scholarship and its free dissemination."⁹⁶

The court was particularly critical of the college's actions, stating that even though "the college is under financial stress, and that 'something had to be done,' it does not follow that the college's freedom of response extends to the unilateral revocation of a contractually protected employment status and the discharge of tenured teachers as a matter of unbridled discretion."⁹⁷

The court found that "the facts surrounding its economic existence cannot reasonably support its claim of demonstrably bona fide financial exigency." The court ordered that the college reinstate all terminated faculty members and continue the tenured status of those who were tenured before termination.⁹⁸

#### 3. Courts Recognize Implied Financial Exigency Right

Several courts have held that even without specific language on financial exigency, there is an implied right in higher education to terminate positions on the basis of a real, declared financial exigency.

In *Krotkoff v. Goucher College*, 585 F.2d 675 (4th Cir. 1978), the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the termination of a tenured faculty member for reasons of financial exigency despite the absence of explicit language in the appointment documents.⁹⁹

Courts have found that AAUP's 1940 Statement "represent widely shared norms within the academic community" and academic custom and usage as demonstrated by AAUP's 1940 Statement added an implied "financial exigency" limitation to the tenure contract.¹⁰⁰

#### 4. Due Process Requirements

If the administration issues notice to terminate an appointment because of financial exigency, the faculty member has the right to a full hearing before a faculty committee, with essentials of an on-the-record adjudicative hearing observed.¹⁰¹

**Application to Project Athena**: American Education Holdings cannot invoke "financial exigency" to terminate tenured faculty merely because the for-profit business model requires higher profit margins. The Bloomfield College precedent establishes that financial stress alone does not justify unilateral revocation of tenure. Any financial exigency claim must demonstrate:
1. Severe financial crisis fundamentally compromising academic integrity
2. Crisis cannot be alleviated by less drastic means (budget cuts, program consolidation)
3. Tenured faculty not terminated in favor of non-tenured faculty
4. Good faith efforts to place terminated faculty in other suitable positions
5. Full hearing before faculty committee with due process protections

### D. Successor Liability in Change of Ownership

Under federal common law, a successor corporation takes on the liabilities of its predecessor if:
1. The successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the liabilities of the predecessor
2. The transaction may be considered a de facto merger
3. The successor may be considered a "mere continuation" of the predecessor
4. The transaction is fraudulent¹⁰²

Successor liability typically arises when there is substantial continuity of the business between the seller and the buyer—if the buyer continues the same business operations, employs the same workforce, or uses the same assets and customer base, courts may be more inclined to apply successor liability.¹⁰³

#### University Merger Precedents

**Rosemont-Villanova Merger**: Villanova will take on Rosemont's assets and liabilities, and tenured and tenure-track faculty will be offered contracts at Villanova and can apply for tenured status via the university's guidelines.¹⁰⁴

**University of Puget Sound Law School to Seattle University**: Seattle University agreed to honor all rank and tenure for faculty, to retain all staff and to offer comparable compensation.¹⁰⁵

**Indiana University Policy**: Contractual rights and obligations of faculty and graduate students shall be honored during mergers and reorganizations. Except under conditions of financial exigency, the appointments of tenured and probationary tenure-track faculty members shall not be terminated as a consequence of merger or reorganization.¹⁰⁶

**Application to Project Athena**: The Project Athena transaction is structured as an acquisition of Midwest University by American Education Holdings, creating substantial continuity of operations (same campus, same students, same programs, same faculty). This creates a strong argument for successor liability—American Education Holdings assumes Midwest University's contractual obligations to tenured faculty. The transaction would likely be viewed as a de facto merger or "mere continuation" under successor liability principles.

## IX. EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CASE LAW (EEOC CHARGE - DR. SUSAN CHEN)

### A. McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Framework

The *McDonnell Douglas* burden-shifting framework is the most important analytical structure in employment discrimination law.¹⁰⁷ It works as follows:

1. The plaintiff must plead and prove a prima facie case of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence
2. The burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory motive for its conduct
3. The burden of production shifts back to the employee to prove the employer's provided motive is pretext for the discriminatory conduct¹⁰⁸

The framework has been applied in university faculty employment discrimination cases, including tenure denial cases.¹⁰⁹

### B. Prima Facie Case of Tenure Denial Discrimination

An employee must have enough evidence to make a prima facie case of discrimination that allows a judge or jury to infer that discrimination took place.¹¹⁰ In hiring/promotion contexts (including tenure), the elements are:
1. Membership in a protected class
2. Qualification for the position
3. Rejection under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination¹¹¹

**Tenure-Specific Precedent**: Evidence that an employer departed from its normal procedural sequence when denying tenure to a plaintiff may establish an inference of discrimination sufficient to satisfy the prima facie burden, from which a jury may infer that the tenure denial stemmed from racial discrimination.¹¹²

### C. Comparator Analysis

Comparative evidence is not an essential element of a prima facie case of discrimination. However, a plaintiff may prove pretext by offering evidence that similarly situated employees who are not in the plaintiff's protected group were treated more favorably or did not receive the same adverse treatment.¹¹³

A "similarly-situated" analysis calls for a flexible, common-sense examination of all relevant factors, and a similarly-situated employee need not be identical in every conceivable way.¹¹⁴ However, the existence of different supervisors can present a major obstacle to proving discrimination based on disparate treatment.¹¹⁵

**Application to Dr. Chen's EEOC Charge**: To establish comparator evidence, Dr. Chen would need to identify similarly situated faculty members (same department or similar field, similar publication records, similar teaching evaluations) who received tenure despite having qualifications comparable to or weaker than hers. If white and/or male candidates with similar or inferior credentials received tenure, this supports an inference of race/sex discrimination.

### D. Pretext Analysis

A plaintiff can demonstrate pretext by pointing to evidence from which a jury could reasonably disbelieve the employer's articulated legitimate reasons or believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer's action.¹¹⁶

The plaintiff must point to "weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons."¹¹⁷ However, the plaintiff cannot simply show that the employer's decision was wrong or mistaken, since the factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer.¹¹⁸

**Ways to Show Pretext**:
- Facts showing the employer's 'business decision' was so lacking in merit as to call into question its genuineness, allowing an inference of pretext¹¹⁹
- In the employment context, a defendant may not merely state that the employment decision was based on hiring the "best qualified" applicant but must provide specifics regarding qualifications and demonstrate why that person's qualifications were considered superior¹²⁰

**Application to Dr. Chen's EEOC Charge**: If Midwest University's stated reasons for tenure denial are:
- Subjective and vague ("insufficient research quality" without clear metrics)
- Inconsistent with treatment of comparators (white/male faculty with similar records granted tenure)
- Shifting explanations (reasons change over time or differ between decision-makers)
- Procedural irregularities (failure to follow handbook procedures, external reviewer selection anomalies)

These factors would support a finding of pretext, allowing a jury to infer that race and/or sex discrimination motivated the tenure denial.

### E. Litigation Risk Assessment

**EEOC Investigation Phase**: The EEOC will investigate Dr. Chen's charge and issue a determination. Possible outcomes:
1. **Cause Finding**: EEOC finds reasonable cause to believe discrimination occurred (leads to conciliation efforts)
2. **No Cause Finding**: EEOC finds no reasonable cause (Dr. Chen receives right-to-sue letter and can file lawsuit)
3. **EEOC Lawsuit**: In rare cases, EEOC may file suit on behalf of charging party

**Litigation Exposure if Dr. Chen Files Lawsuit**:
- **Settlement Range**: $200,000-$500,000 (back pay, front pay, emotional distress, attorney fees)
- **Verdict Risk**: $400,000-$1,200,000 if liability found (reinstatement with tenure, back pay from tenure denial date, front pay for 2-5 years, compensatory damages for emotional distress, attorney fees)

**Complications for Project Athena**: An unresolved EEOC charge creates uncertainty:
1. American Education Holdings may inherit liability if charge progresses to lawsuit
2. Reputational risk from discrimination lawsuit during acquisition
3. Potential for class action if systemic discrimination patterns exist
4. Impact on HLC accreditation review (commitment to diversity and equal opportunity)

---

## X. HIGHER EDUCATION ACCREDITATION JUDICIAL REVIEW

### A. HLC Change of Control Requirements

The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) requires prior review and approval of acquisitions by the HLC Board of Trustees. Only following HLC Board approval may a member institution consummate an acquisition or other transaction.¹²¹

HLC issues Public Disclosure Notices regarding denial of an application for Change of Control, Structure or Organization. These PDNs contain information about the action, findings of the Board, and the availability of appeal.¹²²

### B. Judicial Review Standard: Marjorie Webster Junior College

The leading case on judicial review of accreditation decisions is *Marjorie Webster Junior College, Inc. v. Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, Inc.*, 432 F.2d 650 (D.C. Cir. 1970).¹²³

**District Court Holding**: The District Court found that denying accreditation to all proprietary institutions solely by reason of their proprietary character was arbitrary and unreasonable, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.¹²⁴

**Appellate Court Reversal**: The appellate court reversed and established a **highly deferential standard of review**. The court held that judicial review of the accrediting association's standards should accord substantial deference to the association's judgment regarding the ends that it serves and the means most appropriate to those ends.¹²⁵

**Rationale for Deference**:
1. **Necessity for Intervention**: The extent of judicial power to regulate the standards set by private professional associations must be related to the necessity for intervention, with the extent of deference due to the professional judgment of the association varying both with the subject matter at issue and with the degree of harm resulting from the association's action.¹²⁶

2. **Limited Harm**: The court noted that denial of accreditation by Middle States was not tantamount to exclusion from operating successfully as a junior college, and the record did not support the conclusion that the college would be unable to operate successfully unless it was considered for accreditation.¹²⁷

**Application to Project Athena**: If the HLC Board denies the change of control application for Midwest University's acquisition by American Education Holdings, judicial review will apply a highly deferential standard. The HLC's determination that a for-profit conversion is incompatible with Midwest University's educational mission or threatens educational quality would receive substantial deference. Midwest University would need to show:
1. HLC decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to its own standards
2. HLC failed to follow its own procedures
3. Decision was based on discriminatory or improper motives
4. Significant procedural irregularities denied fair consideration

This is a very difficult standard to meet. Courts generally defer to accreditor expertise and professional judgment.

### C. Limited Precedent for Change of Control Denials

The research did not reveal specific published cases of HLC denying change of control applications for nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions. This suggests either:
1. Such transactions are rare
2. Institutions withdraw applications before formal denial
3. Denials occur but are not publicly litigated

The InfiLaw precedent (all three for-profit law schools ultimately losing ABA accreditation) suggests that accreditors view for-profit ownership skeptically when educational quality deteriorates.

## XI. RISK ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Endowment Transfer and Charitable Trust Compliance

**Risk Level: CRITICAL**

**Key Findings**:
1. Indiana's cy pres doctrine (Ind. Code 30-4-3-27) requires donor-restricted endowment funds ($468M) to remain dedicated to charitable purposes
2. Indiana Attorney General is mandatory party to any cy pres proceeding and will scrutinize for-profit transfer
3. Blue Cross conversion precedent establishes that charitable assets accumulated through tax exemption cannot be privatized
4. Charitable trust doctrine ("asset lock") requires fair market value determination and continued dedication to charitable purposes

**Probability of Indiana AG Approval (without protective structure)**: 10-20%

**Recommended Structure**:
- Transfer $468M donor-restricted endowment to separate 501(c)(3) foundation
- Foundation makes annual grants to support Midwest University students/programs
- Independent foundation board (majority community representatives, not AEH-controlled)
- Perpetual restriction on use of principal for charitable educational purposes
- Fair market value analysis by independent appraiser

**Probability of Approval (with protective structure)**: 60-75%

### B. Title IX Litigation (Doe v. Midwest University)

**Risk Level: MODERATE-HIGH**

**Key Findings**:
1. Motion to dismiss denied (June 2024) indicates court found plausible claims
2. Seventh Circuit *Purdue* standard is plaintiff-friendly ("sex as motivating factor")
3. *Doe v. Oberlin* precedent allows statistical patterns as evidence of bias
4. Discovery will likely reveal damaging evidence (training materials, statistics, communications)

**Probability of Plaintiff Verdict**: 40-60%

**Damages Exposure**:
- Settlement Range: $250,000-$500,000
- Verdict Range: $300,000-$800,000 (tuition, lost opportunities, attorney fees)

**Recommendation**: Settle before discovery for $250,000-$350,000 with confidentiality provision and expungement

**Acquisition Impact**: This liability would transfer to American Education Holdings under successor liability principles

### C. ABA Law School Accreditation Risk

**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Key Findings**:
1. InfiLaw precedent: All three for-profit law schools lost ABA accreditation (Charlotte 2017, Arizona Summit 2018, Florida Coastal 2021)
2. Common failure modes: admissions standards compromise, bar passage decline, profit motive vs. educational quality
3. ABA Standard 316 (75% bar passage within 2 years) is strict bright-line rule
4. Academic freedom (Standard 208) and tenure (Standard 405) protections required

**Probability of ABA Change of Control Approval (without protections)**: 20-30%

**Required Mitigating Factors**:
- Independent law school board (majority faculty/academic representatives)
- Guaranteed budget allocation (% of tuition revenue)
- Contractual protection of faculty tenure and academic freedom
- Maintenance of admissions standards (LSAT/GPA medians)
- Operational independence firewall from for-profit parent

**Probability of Approval (with robust protections)**: 55-70%

**Consequence of Denial**: Midwest University Law School loses ABA accreditation → graduates ineligible to sit for bar exam in most states → enrollment collapse → school closure within 1-2 years

### D. HLC Regional Accreditation Risk

**Risk Level: HIGH**

**Key Findings**:
1. HLC requires prior board approval for change of control
2. *Marjorie Webster* establishes highly deferential judicial review standard
3. No published precedent for nonprofit-to-for-profit university conversions
4. InfiLaw precedent suggests accreditors view for-profit ownership skeptically

**Probability of HLC Approval (without mission/quality protections)**: 25-35%

**Required Mitigating Factors**:
- Commitment to maintain educational mission and non-profit educational purposes
- Financial sustainability plan demonstrating long-term viability
- Protection of academic programs and student services
- Maintenance of faculty governance and academic freedom
- Evidence that for-profit ownership will not compromise educational quality

**Probability of Approval (with robust protections)**: 50-65%

**Consequence of Denial**: Midwest University loses regional accreditation → students cannot transfer credits, federal financial aid eligibility lost, enrollment collapse, institutional closure within 6-12 months

### E. Faculty Tenure and Shared Governance Obligations

**Risk Level: MODERATE**

**Key Findings**:
1. Faculty handbooks are enforceable contracts in most states
2. *Bloomfield College* precedent: financial stress does not justify unilateral revocation of tenure
3. Successor liability principles: AEH assumes contractual obligations to tenured faculty
4. University merger precedents show tenure rights typically honored

**Probability of Successful Tenure Challenges (if AEH attempts mass terminations)**: 70-85%

**Liability Exposure (if 100 tenured faculty sue)**:
- Individual settlements: $100,000-$300,000 each
- Total exposure: $10M-$30M
- AAUP censure (reputational damage, faculty recruitment impaired)

**Recommendation**: Contractually commit to honor all existing tenure commitments and maintain faculty handbook governance provisions for minimum 5-year transition period

### F. Employment Discrimination (EEOC Charge - Dr. Chen)

**Risk Level: MODERATE**

**Key Findings**:
1. *McDonnell Douglas* burden-shifting framework applies
2. Prima facie case can be established through comparator evidence and procedural irregularities
3. Pretext can be shown through subjective criteria, shifting justifications

**Probability of EEOC Cause Finding**: 30-45%

**Litigation Exposure (if lawsuit filed)**:
- Settlement Range: $200,000-$500,000
- Verdict Range: $400,000-$1,200,000 (reinstatement with tenure, back/front pay, emotional distress, attorney fees)

**Recommendation**: Engage in good-faith EEOC conciliation; consider tenure reconsideration through independent review panel

**Acquisition Impact**: Unresolved discrimination charge creates reputational risk and HLC compliance concerns

### G. Overall Transaction Risk Assessment

**Probability of Transaction Closing with All Regulatory Approvals**: 15-25%

**Critical Path Dependencies**:
1. Indiana AG approval of endowment transfer structure (CRITICAL)
2. HLC change of control approval (CRITICAL)
3. ABA law school change of control approval (CRITICAL for law school)
4. Resolution of Title IX litigation (MODERATE)
5. Resolution of EEOC charge (MODERATE)

**If Any Critical Approval Fails**: Transaction cannot close, or law school must be excluded from acquisition

### H. Recommended Transaction Modifications

#### 1. Endowment Structure (CRITICAL)

**Create Two Entities**:
- **American Education Holdings** acquires operating assets (campus, programs, operations)
- **Midwest University Educational Foundation** (501(c)(3)) receives $468M donor-restricted endowment
- Foundation makes annual grants to support educational programs

**Purchase Price Allocation**:
- Operating assets: $312M (campus, equipment, programs, unrestricted $182M endowment)
- Charitable foundation endowment: $468M (transferred to 501(c)(3), not to AEH)

#### 2. Law School Protections (CRITICAL)

**Operational Independence Agreement**:
- Independent law school board (7 members: 4 faculty-elected, 2 academic/legal professionals, 1 AEH representative)
- Guaranteed budget: 65% of law school tuition revenue allocated to law school operations
- Admissions standards floor: Median LSAT ≥ 155, Median GPA ≥ 3.3 (locked for 5 years)
- Faculty tenure protected: No terminations except for cause or bona fide financial exigency
- Academic freedom: Faculty control curriculum, scholarship, teaching methods

#### 3. HLC Compliance Commitments (CRITICAL)

**Mission Preservation**:
- Maintain educational mission as primary purpose (documented in amended charter/bylaws)
- No dividends or profit distributions for first 5 years (reinvest all operating surplus)
- Faculty governance maintained (faculty senate authority over curriculum, academic standards)
- Student services protected (counseling, advising, academic support maintained at current levels)

#### 4. Faculty Tenure Commitments (MODERATE)

**5-Year Transition Protection**:
- Honor all existing tenure commitments
- Maintain faculty handbook governance provisions
- No retrenchment without demonstrable bona fide financial exigency (AAUP definition)
- Shared governance procedures followed for any handbook amendments

#### 5. Litigation Resolution (MODERATE)

**Title IX Settlement**: $250,000-$350,000 with confidentiality and expungement

**EEOC Charge**: Good-faith conciliation; consider independent tenure review panel for Dr. Chen

### I. Alternative Structures to Consider

#### Alternative 1: Affiliation Model (Not Acquisition)

Instead of outright acquisition, structure as affiliation/management agreement:
- Midwest University remains 501(c)(3)
- American Education Holdings provides management services for fee
- Endowment remains with nonprofit university
- Avoids cy pres/charitable trust issues
- Simpler accreditation approval process

**Probability of Regulatory Approval**: 70-85%

#### Alternative 2: Spin Out For-Profit Subsidiary

- Midwest University (501(c)(3)) remains parent
- Creates for-profit subsidiary for certain operations (online programs, continuing education)
- Traditional campus programs remain nonprofit
- Endowment stays with nonprofit parent
- Less disruptive to accreditation

**Probability of Regulatory Approval**: 60-75%

#### Alternative 3: Exclude Law School from Acquisition

- American Education Holdings acquires undergraduate/graduate programs
- Law school remains separate nonprofit or affiliates with another ABA-accredited institution
- Eliminates ABA for-profit ownership concerns
- Simplifies transaction structure

**Probability of Regulatory Approval (for remaining institution)**: 55-70%

### J. Transaction Timeline Estimate (with modifications)

| Phase | Duration | Critical Dependencies |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Endowment structure design & Indiana AG preliminary consultation | 3-4 months | Legal counsel, independent valuation |
| Indiana AG formal application & review | 6-12 months | Cy pres petition, court approval |
| HLC substantive change application | 12-18 months | Site visit, board review, monitoring |
| ABA change of control application | 12-18 months | Law school independence structure |
| Title IX litigation settlement | 2-4 months | Confidential negotiations |
| EEOC charge resolution | 6-12 months | Conciliation or litigation |

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 18-30 months from initiation to closing

**Critical Path**: Indiana AG approval and HLC approval run in parallel; both must be completed before closing

## XIV. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment

✓ **Indiana Charitable Trust Law**: Comprehensive research of Indiana Code provisions, cy pres doctrine, Attorney General authority, and Blue Cross conversion precedent across multiple states

✓ **Title IX Due Process**: Complete circuit analysis including Seventh Circuit controlling precedent (*Purdue*), Second Circuit foundational framework (*Yusuf*), Sixth Circuit bias standard (*Oberlin*), and Supreme Court damages limitation (*Cummings*)

✓ **ABA Law School Accreditation**: Exhaustive research of InfiLaw Corporation precedent (all three schools), ABA standards on academic freedom and bar passage, and for-profit ownership structural issues

✓ **Faculty Tenure Rights**: Thorough analysis of faculty handbook enforceability, *Bloomfield College* financial exigency precedent, successor liability doctrine, and university merger practices

✓ **Employment Discrimination**: Complete *McDonnell Douglas* framework analysis, prima facie case elements, comparator analysis standards, and pretext showing methods

✓ **Accreditation Judicial Review**: *Marjorie Webster* deferential standard, HLC change of control requirements, limited published precedent for denials

### Confidence Levels by Finding

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Indiana AG will require endowment separation | High | Consistent Blue Cross precedent + cy pres statutory framework |
| Title IX settlement range $250K-$500K | High | *Cummings* damages limitation + settlement data |
| InfiLaw precedent shows for-profit risk | Very High | All three schools closed/lost accreditation (documented) |
| Faculty tenure rights enforceable | High | *Bloomfield* precedent + handbook contract doctrine |
| HLC/ABA approval requires protections | High | InfiLaw failure + *Marjorie Webster* deference |
| Overall transaction success 15-25% | Moderate | Compound probability of multiple critical approvals |

### Known Limitations

1. **Doe v. Midwest University**: No public docket access; analysis based on user-provided facts (motion to dismiss denied June 2024, $500K-$2M exposure estimate). Cannot verify specific allegations or procedural history without court records.

2. **HLC Change of Control Precedent**: No published cases found of HLC denying nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions. This may indicate such transactions are rare, institutions withdraw applications, or denials are not publicly litigated. Analysis relies on InfiLaw accreditation precedent and *Marjorie Webster* judicial review standard.

3. **Indiana Attorney General Practice**: No specific Indiana AG precedent for educational institution for-profit conversions found. Analysis relies on Blue Cross health care conversion precedent from other states and Indiana cy pres statutory framework.

4. **Dr. Chen EEOC Charge**: No access to EEOC charge specifics. Analysis based on *McDonnell Douglas* framework and general tenure denial discrimination case law.

5. **ABA Law School Operational Independence**: ABA Standard 102 addresses "Provisional Approval," not operational independence. Analysis relies on Standards 208, 316, 405 (academic freedom, bar passage, tenure) and InfiLaw precedent showing ABA concerns with for-profit ownership.

### Alternative Research Methods Considered

**CourtListener Database**: Attempted to use CourtListener for federal and state case law research. However, the primary research was conducted via WebSearch due to tool availability and comprehensiveness of results. WebSearch provided access to Justia, CourtListener, official court websites, and legal databases, yielding high-quality precedent.

**PACER Access**: Federal court dockets (including *Doe v. Midwest University*) would require PACER access for complete procedural history and pleadings. Analysis based on user-provided facts (motion to dismiss denied June 2024) and applicable legal standards.

### Methodology: Systematic Search Strategy

1. **Statutory Research**: Indiana Code provisions on charitable trusts, cy pres doctrine, Attorney General enforcement authority
2. **Federal Case Law**: Systematic circuit-by-circuit review of Title IX due process precedent, focusing on Seventh Circuit (controlling) and other circuits (persuasive)
3. **Specialized Accreditation Research**: InfiLaw Corporation timeline (2006-2021), ABA accreditation standards, HLC change of control policies
4. **Comparative Precedent**: Blue Cross conversions, university mergers, hospital system conversions
5. **Employment Law Frameworks**: *McDonnell Douglas*, AAUP standards, EEOC guidance

### Cross-Referenced Findings

All major findings cross-referenced across multiple sources:
- Cy pres doctrine: Indiana statute + IRS guidance + state AG practices + Blue Cross precedent
- Title IX standards: *Yusuf*, *Purdue*, *Oberlin*, *Baum* + circuit analysis + FIRE/ATIXA commentary
- InfiLaw precedent: News reports + ABA Journal + Wikipedia + litigation records
- Faculty tenure: *Bloomfield* + AAUP standards + university merger precedents + state handbook enforceability guides
