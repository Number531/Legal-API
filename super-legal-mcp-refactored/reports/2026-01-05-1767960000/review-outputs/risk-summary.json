This provides seller immediate liquidity while protecting buyer through insurance (unknown risks) + earnouts (performance-based adjustments). Structure is $1.125B below calculated minimum but justified by: (1) coal decline is business risk not escrow-able, (2) deferred capex is disclosed and buyer-assumed, (3) earnouts provide contingent protection up to actual losses."
