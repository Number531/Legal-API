## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This employment and labor law research memorandum analyzes ASBC's pending employment litigation, multi-state alcohol server training compliance, wage/hour class action risk, and WARN Act applicability in the context of ABP's proposed acquisition. Research identifies **CRITICAL wage/hour class action exposure ($1.8M-$11.8M)** and **HIGH-risk EEOC retaliation claim ($231K-$688K)**, along with significant regulatory compliance gaps in 3 of 5 operating states.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Gonzalez EEOC retaliation charge has strong prima facie case** based on 2-week temporal proximity between wage complaint and termination; settlement range $150K-$350K

2. **Wage/hour class action poses CRITICAL systemic risk** with 950 potential class members alleging unpaid prep/cleanup work (15-30 min/shift); exposure $1.8M-$11.8M depending on certification and opt-in rates

3. **Multi-state server training compliance gaps expose ASBC to regulatory violations** in Oregon (March 2025 rule change), Washington (criminal penalties), and California (2025 renewal wave)

4. **Smith v. ASBC dram shop defense weakened by lack of supplemental training** beyond mandatory state requirements; absence of incident logs undermines defense

5. **WARN Act applies to post-acquisition layoffs** if ABP plans facility closures or workforce reductions affecting 50+ employees

### Risk Assessment: HIGH

---

### A. EEOC RETALIATION: GONZALEZ V. ASBC (HIGH RISK)

**Background:**
Maria Gonzalez, Hispanic female bartender at Denver taproom (2022-2024), filed wage complaint with Colorado Department of Labor in **July 2024** alleging unpaid overtime for prep/cleanup work (15-30 min/shift). ASBC terminated Gonzalez in **August 2024** (approximately 2 weeks post-complaint). Gonzalez filed EEOC charge in **October 2024** alleging national origin discrimination and retaliation.

**Prima Facie Retaliation Case:**
- **Protected activity:** Wage complaint protected under FLSA § 215(a)(3) and Colorado COMPS Order
- **Adverse action:** Termination
- **Causal link:** **2-week temporal proximity** between complaint and termination

**Legal Analysis:**
Courts consistently find 2-week temporal proximity "very close" and sufficient to establish prima facie retaliation case. Lower courts have specifically held that less than two weeks creates strong inference of causation. Post-*Nassar* (2013), temporal proximity alone insufficient to rebut employer's stated reason, but **temporal proximity combined with other evidence** (inconsistent explanations, procedural deviations) may defeat summary judgment.

**2025 Legal Development:**
Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch (March 2025) questioned whether McDonnell Douglas framework "distorts" analysis by requiring plaintiffs to "win" at summary judgment stage. Eleventh Circuit now requires "big picture" approach—even if employer's explanation legitimate, **other evidence supporting retaliation inference** may survive summary judgment.

**Pretext Vulnerability:**
ASBC states termination based on:
1. Customer complaints (3 complaints June-July 2024)
2. Cash register discrepancies ($350 shortage over 6 months)
3. Tardiness (late 8 times in 2024)

**Critical questions:**
- Were performance issues **documented BEFORE July 2024 wage complaint?** If not, timing highly suspicious
- **Comparator evidence:** Were non-Hispanic employees retained despite similar infractions?
- **Progressive discipline:** Did ASBC follow standard procedures (warnings, PIP) or move directly to termination?

**National Origin Discrimination (Weaker Claim):**
Gonzalez must show similarly situated non-Hispanic employees treated more favorably. Requires **comparator analysis** of Denver taproom terminations 2022-2024. Current evidence gap—no information on whether ASBC terminated non-Hispanic bartenders for comparable conduct.

**Exposure Quantification:**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Back Pay (16 months) | $35,200 |
| Compensatory Damages | $50,000 - $200,000 |
| Punitive Damages | $0 - $100,000 |
| **Statutory Cap (500+ employees)** | **$300,000** (compensatory + punitive combined) |
| Front Pay (1-2 years) | $26,400 - $52,800 |
| Attorney's Fees | $120,000 - $300,000 |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | **$231,600 - $688,000** |

**Settlement Range:** $150,000 - $350,000

---

### B. WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTION RISK (CRITICAL)

**Gonzalez Wage Complaint:**
Alleges 15-30 minutes/shift unpaid prep/cleanup work:
- **Prep:** Stocking bar, cutting garnishes, setting up POS system
- **Cleanup:** Washing glassware, restocking supplies, cashing out register

**FLSA "Integral and Indispensable" Analysis:**
All alleged tasks meet DOL standard for compensable time. Under *Steiner v. Mitchell* (1956), activities performed before/after scheduled shift that are **integral and indispensable** to primary job duties must be compensated. Bartender prep/cleanup clearly satisfies this standard—cannot bartend without stocked supplies, clean glassware, operational POS system.

**Colorado COMPS Order Overtime:**
If off-the-clock work pushed employees over 40 hours/week OR 12 hours/day, ASBC owes **overtime rate (1.5×)**, not straight time. Colorado 2024 update clarified tipped employee overtime rate is 1.5× minimum wage ($11.79 × 1.5 = $17.69/hour), **excluding tips** from calculation.

**Class Certification Risk:**
Under FLSA collective action (29 U.S.C. § 216(b)), plaintiffs need only "**modest factual showing**" that employees similarly situated. If Gonzalez demonstrates:
- Common policy/practice requiring off-the-clock prep/cleanup across all 18 taprooms
- Similar duties performed by all bartenders/servers
- Consistent amount of unpaid time

**Then 950 taproom employees become potential class members.**

**Exposure Calculations:**

**Scenario 1: Full Class (100% Opt-In)**
- 950 employees × 15-30 min/shift × 5 shifts/week × 104 weeks (2 years) × $18.84/hour (overtime)
- **Back wages:** $2.3M - $4.7M
- **With liquidated damages (if willful):** $4.7M - $9.3M
- **With attorney's fees:** **$5.7M - $11.8M**

**Scenario 2: Realistic Class (30% Opt-In)**
Historical FLSA opt-in rates average 5-25%, often as low as 10%. Assuming 30% opt-in (285 employees):
- **Back wages:** $698K - $1.4M
- **With liquidated damages:** $1.4M - $2.8M
- **With attorney's fees:** **$1.8M - $3.6M**

**Scenario 3: Gonzalez Individual**
- **Back wages (2 years):** $2,449 - $4,898
- **With liquidated damages:** **$4,898 - $9,796**

**Class Certification Defenses:**
ASBC may defeat certification by demonstrating:
- Individual issues predominate (employees' hours/duties varied by location)
- No systematic policy—some employees paid for prep/cleanup
- Time records show no common practice

Recent 2025 trend: Courts adopting **heightened certification standards**, rejecting lenient "conditional certification" approach. However, conditional certification still granted frequently if plaintiffs meet "modest factual showing."

**CRITICAL RISK:** Even if ASBC defeats full class certification, **Gonzalez's individual claim remains viable**, and smaller classes (state-specific or location-specific) may still be certified.

---

### C. MULTI-STATE ALCOHOL SERVER TRAINING COMPLIANCE (HIGH RISK)

**Compliance Matrix:**

| State | Employees | Mandatory? | Certification Duration | Key Deadline | Compliance Status |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Oregon** | 380 | **YES** | 5 years | **IMMEDIATE** (as of March 31, 2025) | **CRITICAL GAP** |
| **Washington** | 95 | **YES** | 5 years | 60 days (new hires) | **HIGH RISK** |
| **California** | 47 | **YES** | 3 years | 60 days (new hires) | **2025 RENEWAL WAVE** |
| **Colorado** | 190 | NO (voluntary) | 2 years | N/A | Recommended for liability protection |
| **North Carolina** | 142 | NO (recommended) | 4 years | N/A | Recommended for liability protection |

**Oregon CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAP:**
Effective March 31, 2025, Oregon **eliminated 45-day grace period** for temporary service permits. All employees must complete OLCC Alcohol Server Education + exam **BEFORE serving alcohol**. No exceptions. Violation consequences:
- **Employee:** Criminal citation, up to $500 fine, up to 90 days jail
- **Employer:** Liquor license suspension, fines, civil liability

**5-year renewal tracking essential:** Employees certified in 2020 expire in 2025. ASBC must verify certification status for all 380 Oregon employees and implement automated expiration alerts.

**Washington HIGH RISK:**
RCW 66.20.310 requires **MAST permit within 60 days of hire**. Criminal penalties for non-compliance (up to $500 fine + 90 days jail for employee; monetary fine + license suspension for employer). 95 Washington employees must maintain current MAST permits (5-year validity, NOT renewable—must retake training/exam).

**California 2025 RENEWAL WAVE:**
AB 1221 became mandatory July 1, 2022 (3-year validity). Employees certified in 2022 **expire in 2025**. California taproom (47 employees) requires proactive renewal tracking to avoid lapses.

**Colorado/North Carolina (Voluntary):**
While not legally required, training strengthens dram shop defense and provides:
- Colorado: Up to 25% liquor liability insurance discount for TIPS certification
- Colorado: Liquor Enforcement Division may mitigate fines/penalties for violations if Responsible Vendor trained
- North Carolina: Free 2-hour RASP course offered by ABC Commission

**CRITICAL ISSUE FOR SMITH V. ASBC:**
In dram shop litigation, **expired or missing certifications** undermine ASBC's defense that staff adequately trained. Plaintiff can argue inadequate training demonstrates negligence. Regulatory violations may be admissible as **evidence of negligence per se**.

---

### D. DRAM SHOP LIABILITY: SMITH V. ASBC (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK)

**Plaintiff's Allegation:**
ASBC taproom staff inadequately trained, failed to recognize Jones' visible intoxication, over-served alcohol, resulting in damages to Smith.

**Oregon Dram Shop Law (ORS 471.565):**
Servers **NOT liable** for damages caused by intoxicated patrons UNLESS plaintiff proves by **clear and convincing evidence**:
1. Server served alcohol to **visibly intoxicated** patron
2. Service was **substantial factor** in causing injury
3. Injury was **foreseeable**
4. Plaintiff did **NOT substantially contribute** to patron's intoxication

**NO Statutory Safe Harbor for Training:**
ORS 471.565 provides NO provision stating "completion of OLCC training = no liability." Training evidence relevant to **comparative negligence analysis** (did ASBC act reasonably?), but not dispositive.

**Constitutional Issue (*Bonner v. American Golf Corp.*):**
Oregon Supreme Court held ORS 471.565(1) would be **unconstitutional** if server served alcohol to patron who reached point of **involuntary intoxication** (loss of reason/volition). If Jones reached involuntary intoxication state, ASBC's statutory shield may erode.

**ASBC Defense Weaknesses:**
1. **Lack of supplemental training beyond OLCC minimum**
   - No role-playing scenarios for refusing service to difficult patrons
   - No practice in high-pressure situations (busy taproom, impatient customers)

2. **No documented cut-off policy or incident logs**
   - Absence of documentation = Plaintiff argues no intervention occurred
   - No paper trail showing staff attempted to cut off Jones or call manager

3. **No annual refresher training**
   - OLCC certification valid 5 years = long gap between training sessions
   - Skills/knowledge atrophy over time without reinforcement

**Supplemental Training Recommendations:**
To strengthen dram shop defense:
- **Role-playing scenarios:** Practice refusing service, handling confrontations
- **Manager supervision protocols:** Train managers to monitor staff, intervene when uncertain
- **Mandatory incident logs:** Document patron name, time, intoxication signs, actions taken
- **Annual refreshers:** Reinforce intoxication recognition beyond 5-year OLCC cycle

**Exposure Range:**
Depends on injury severity (Smith's damages):
- **Minor injury:** $100,000 - $250,000
- **Moderate injury:** $500,000 - $1,500,000
- **Severe injury/death:** $2,000,000 - $7,000,000+

**Insurance:** ASBC's liquor liability policy limits critical. Typical craft brewery policies: $1M-$2M per occurrence. If exposure exceeds policy limits, ASBC personally liable for excess.

---

### E. WARN ACT APPLICABILITY (MEDIUM CONDITIONAL RISK)

**WARN Act Coverage:**
ASBC's 1,850 employees exceed 100-employee threshold. Federal WARN Act (29 U.S.C. § 2101) applies.

**Triggering Events:**
- **Plant closing:** 50+ employees lose employment at single site within 30-day period
- **Mass layoff:** 50-499 employees (33%+ of workforce) OR 500+ employees (any percentage)

**Seller/Buyer Responsibility Split:**
- **ASBC (seller):** Responsible for pre-closing layoffs
- **ABP (buyer):** Responsible for post-closing layoffs

**Asset vs. Stock Purchase:**
- **Asset sale:** Seller retains WARN responsibility (seller closing plant)
- **Stock/going concern sale:** Buyer responsible for post-closing restructuring

**60-Day Notice Requirements:**
If WARN triggered, employer must provide written notice to:
1. Affected employees (or union representatives)
2. State Dislocated Worker Unit (CO, OR, NC, WA, CA)
3. Chief elected official of local government

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**
- **Back pay:** Up to 60 days for each affected employee
- **Benefits:** Value of health insurance, retirement (up to 60 days)
- **Civil penalties:** Up to $500/day for failure to notify local government (max $30,000)
- **Attorney's fees:** Prevailing employees entitled to fees

**Hypothetical Exposure:**
- **Close Denver brewery (120 employees):** $1.67M - $1.79M
- **Mass layoff (300 employees):** $3.72M - $3.96M

**ABP Due Diligence Recommendations:**
1. Determine post-acquisition workforce retention plans
2. If layoffs planned, calculate 60-day notice deadline
3. Negotiate ASBC indemnification for pre-closing WARN violations
4. ABP may avoid immediate WARN trigger by committing to 60+ day employee retention

**Colorado Mini-WARN:**
Colorado does NOT have stricter state-level WARN Act. Federal thresholds apply. However, California (1 taproom, 47 employees) has stricter mini-WARN requiring notice for 50+ employee layoffs.

### F. Aggregate Employment Liability Exposure

| Liability Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Probability |
|--------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Gonzalez EEOC Retaliation** | $231,600 | $688,000 | PROBABLE |
| **Wage/Hour Class (30% opt-in)** | $1,800,000 | $3,600,000 | PROBABLE |
| **Wage/Hour Class (100% opt-in)** | $5,700,000 | $11,800,000 | POSSIBLE |
| **Smith Dram Shop** | $100,000 | $7,000,000 | POSSIBLE |
| **WARN Act (if triggered)** | $1,670,000 | $3,960,000 | CONDITIONAL |
| **Training Compliance Gaps** | $100,000 | $500,000 | CERTAIN (regulatory fines + remediation) |

**Conservative Total (Probable Liabilities):** $2.1M - $4.3M
**Worst-Case Total (All Liabilities):** $9.6M - $27.5M

---

### G. Critical Action Items for ABP

**IMMEDIATE (Pre-Closing):**
1. **Timekeeping audit** (all 18 taprooms): Verify employees clock in/out for prep/cleanup
2. **Training compliance audit** (950 employees): Verify current certification status across 5 states
3. **Gonzalez comparator analysis:** Review Denver taproom terminations 2022-2024
4. **Settlement negotiations:** Explore Gonzalez EEOC settlement ($150K-$350K range)
5. **Union status inquiry:** Confirm no union representation or pending NLRB charges

**SHORT-TERM (30-60 Days Pre-Closing):**
6. **Insurance review:** Verify EPLI and liquor liability coverage limits
7. **WARN Act planning:** Determine post-acquisition workforce plans
8. **Smith dram shop assessment:** Evaluate settlement vs. litigation costs

**POST-CLOSING (Integration):**
9. **Implement corrected timekeeping policies:** Clock in BEFORE prep, clock out AFTER cleanup
10. **Centralized training tracking:** Automated alerts for certification expiration
11. **Supplemental dram shop training:** Role-playing, incident logs, annual refreshers
12. **Proactive wage/hour resolution:** If audit confirms violations, consider back pay to affected employees

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. EEOC RETALIATION CHARGE — MARIA GONZALEZ

#### 1. Legal Framework: Title VII Retaliation

**Prima Facie Case Elements:**
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must demonstrate:
1. She engaged in **protected activity**
2. The employer took **adverse action** against her
3. A **causal link** exists between the protected activity and the adverse action¹

**Gonzalez's Protected Activity:**
- **July 2024:** Filed wage complaint with Colorado Department of Labor alleging unpaid overtime (15-30 min/shift for prep/cleanup)
- **Protected under multiple statutes:**
  - FLSA § 215(a)(3) (anti-retaliation for wage complaints)
  - Colorado COMPS Order § 7 (prohibition on retaliation for asserting wage rights)
  - Title VII (if wage complaint included discrimination allegations)

#### 2. Temporal Proximity Analysis

**Two-Week Timeline is HIGHLY PROBATIVE:**
- **July 2024:** Gonzalez files wage complaint
- **August 2024:** ASBC terminates Gonzalez (approximately 2 weeks later)

**Legal Significance:**
Lower courts consistently find that **two weeks between protected activity and termination creates a sufficient inference of retaliation** at the prima facie stage.² Courts generally find:
- **Under 2 weeks:** "Very close" temporal proximity (strong inference of causation)
- **2-3 months:** Moderately suspicious
- **Beyond 6 months:** Requires substantial additional evidence³

**Important 2025 Development:**
Post-*Nassar* (2013), some courts no longer accept temporal proximity alone as sufficient to establish causation, but **temporal proximity combined with other evidence** (inconsistent employer explanations, procedural deviations) may defeat summary judgment.⁴

**Gonzalez Case Strength:**
✓ **Prima facie case likely satisfied** based on 2-week temporal proximity
✓ Temporal proximity strengthened by procedural deviations (if any) following complaint

#### 3. Pretext Analysis: ASBC's Stated Termination Reasons

**ASBC's Articulated Reasons:**
1. **Customer complaints** (3 complaints June-July 2024: rude service, incorrect orders)
2. **Cash register discrepancies** ($350 shortage over 6 months)
3. **Tardiness** (late 8 times in 2024)

**McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting (2025 Status):**
The traditional three-stage framework:
- **Stage 1:** Plaintiff establishes prima facie case → **GONZALEZ LIKELY SUCCEEDS**
- **Stage 2:** Employer articulates legitimate, non-discriminatory reason → **ASBC PROVIDES REASONS**
- **Stage 3:** Plaintiff demonstrates pretext (stated reason is false or not the real reason) → **KEY BATTLEGROUND**

**Critical Pretext Indicators (Favor Gonzalez):**

| Pretext Factor | Analysis | Gonzalez Strength |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Timing of Documentation** | Were performance issues documented BEFORE wage complaint? If not, suspicious | HIGH |
| **Comparator Evidence** | Were non-Hispanic employees retained despite similar performance issues? | CRITICAL |
| **Inconsistent Application** | Does ASBC tolerate $350 shortages/tardiness for others? | HIGH |
| **Procedural Deviations** | Was progressive discipline followed? Any deviation post-complaint? | MEDIUM |
| **Pretextual Pattern** | Evidence ASBC cited minor issues to mask retaliation | HIGH |

**2025 Legal Development:**
Justice Thomas and Gorsuch have questioned whether McDonnell Douglas "distorts" analysis by requiring plaintiffs to "win" at summary judgment.⁵ The **Eleventh Circuit** now requires a "big picture" approach—even if ASBC's explanation is legitimate, **other evidence supporting retaliation inference** may defeat summary judgment.⁶

**Key Discovery Questions:**
1. **Pre-complaint documentation:** Are customer complaints, cash discrepancies, tardiness documented in Gonzalez's personnel file BEFORE July 2024?
2. **Comparator analysis:** Did ASBC terminate non-Hispanic employees for similar infractions?
3. **Progressive discipline:** Did ASBC follow standard discipline procedures (warnings, PIP) or move directly to termination?

#### 4. National Origin Discrimination Claim

**Gonzalez Allegation:** Hispanic female subjected to national origin discrimination

**Legal Standard (McDonnell Douglas):**
Prima facie case requires showing:
1. Plaintiff is member of protected class (Hispanic) → **SATISFIED**
2. Qualified for position (bartender) → **SATISFIED** (2+ years employment)
3. Suffered adverse action (termination) → **SATISFIED**
4. **Similarly situated non-Hispanic employees treated more favorably** → **REQUIRES COMPARATOR EVIDENCE**⁷

**Comparator Evidence CRITICAL:**
- **Required showing:** Non-Hispanic employees with similar performance issues (customer complaints, cash discrepancies, tardiness) were NOT terminated
- **DOJ Guidance Example:** Hispanic student received 3-day suspension vs. non-Hispanic student received 2-day suspension for same fight⁸
- **Relevance to pretext:** "Especially relevant to showing pretext would be evidence that white employees involved in acts of comparable seriousness were nevertheless retained or rehired"⁹

**Current Evidence Gap:**
- No information provided on whether ASBC terminated non-Hispanic bartenders for similar conduct
- **Discovery essential:** Review termination records 2022-2024 for all Denver taproom employees

**Alternative Framework (Arlington Heights):**
Even without comparator evidence, Gonzalez may prove discrimination through:
- Statements by ASBC managers reflecting national origin bias
- Statistical evidence of disparate treatment of Hispanic employees
- Historical background of discrimination at ASBC¹⁰

#### 5. Exposure Quantification: Gonzalez EEOC Charge

**A. Back Pay (August 2024 - December 2025 = 16 months)**
- Monthly wage: $2,200 (estimated based on Colorado tipped minimum + tips)
- **Back pay exposure: $35,200** ($2,200 × 16 months)

**B. Compensatory Damages (Emotional Distress)**
- Available for retaliation claims under Title VII
- **Typical range:** $50,000 - $200,000 depending on severity
- Factors: Medical treatment, psychological harm, lost enjoyment
- **Estimated exposure: $75,000 - $150,000**

**C. Punitive Damages**
- Available if employer acted with "malice or reckless indifference"
- **Statutory cap (500+ employees):** $300,000 (combined compensatory + punitive)¹¹
- Given ASBC has 1,850 employees: **Maximum cap applies**
- If jury awards exceed cap, court reduces to $300,000

**D. Front Pay (In Lieu of Reinstatement)**
- If reinstatement not feasible (hostile work environment), court awards future lost wages
- **Typical period:** 1-2 years
- **Estimated exposure: $26,400 - $52,800** ($2,200/month × 12-24 months)

**E. Attorney's Fees**
- Prevailing plaintiff entitled to reasonable attorney's fees
- Estimated 300-500 hours at $400-600/hour
- **Estimated exposure: $120,000 - $300,000**

**TOTAL GONZALEZ EXPOSURE:**

| Component | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Back Pay | $35,200 | $35,200 |
| Compensatory Damages | $50,000 | $200,000 |
| Punitive Damages | $0 | $100,000 |
| **Statutory Cap** | **$50,000** | **$300,000** |
| Front Pay | $26,400 | $52,800 |
| Attorney's Fees | $120,000 | $300,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$231,600** | **$688,000** |

**Note:** Compensatory + punitive damages capped at $300,000 for employers with 500+ employees. Back pay, front pay, and attorney's fees NOT subject to cap.¹²

#### 6. Settlement Considerations

**Strengths for Gonzalez:**
- **Strong temporal proximity** (2 weeks)
- Potential for comparator evidence showing disparate treatment
- Sympathetic plaintiff (2-year employee, Hispanic female)
- EEOC may find "reasonable cause" and litigate on Gonzalez's behalf

**Weaknesses for Gonzalez:**
- ASBC has documented performance issues (if pre-dating complaint)
- No direct evidence of discriminatory animus
- National origin claim weaker without comparator evidence

**Settlement Range Estimate:**
Given litigation risk and exposure: **$150,000 - $350,000**

### B. MULTI-STATE ALCOHOL SERVER TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

#### 1. Compliance Matrix: Five-State Analysis

ASBC operates 18 taprooms across 5 states with 950 taproom/hospitality employees. Each state has distinct alcohol server training requirements with varying degrees of legal mandate and liability protection.

| State | Taprooms | Employees | Mandatory Training? | Certification Duration | Statute/Regulation | Liability Protection? |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Oregon** | 8 | ~380 | **YES** | 5 years | ORS 471.542 | Limited (comparative negligence) |
| **Colorado** | 4 | ~190 | **NO** (voluntary) | 2 years | Responsible Vendor Program | Yes (if certified) |
| **North Carolina** | 3 | ~142 | **NO** (strongly recommended) | 4 years | RASP (voluntary) | Limited |
| **Washington** | 2 | ~95 | **YES** | 5 years | RCW 66.20.310 (MAST) | Limited |
| **California** | 1 | ~47 | **YES** | 3 years | AB 1221 (RBS) | Limited |

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAP: 3 of 5 states require mandatory training.**

---

#### 2. Oregon: Mandatory Alcohol Server Education (ORS 471.542)

**Legal Requirement:**
ORS 471.542 requires the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC) to mandate alcohol server education for all service permit applicants and license holders authorizing on-premises consumption.¹³

**Who Must Be Certified:**
- All servers, bartenders, and managers who dispense or supervise alcohol service
- Licensees (unless they designate a qualified permit holder)¹⁴

**MAJOR CHANGE EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2025:**
Oregon **eliminated the 45-day grace period** for temporary service permits. As of March 31, 2025:
- Service permit application, server education course, AND OLCC-proctored exam must be **completed BEFORE serving alcohol**
- No employee may serve alcohol without completed certification
- CAMP (Cannabis and Alcohol Management Program) now manages all permits¹⁵

**Certification Validity:** 5 years from issuance date¹⁶

**Approved Training Providers:**
- TIPS (Training for Intervention ProcedureS)
- ServSafe Alcohol
- Other OLCC-approved courses

**ASBC COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS (Oregon):**
- **380 employees** across 8 Oregon taprooms must maintain current OLCC service permits
- **Renewal tracking critical:** Permits expire 5 years from issuance
- **New hire protocol:** NO employee may serve alcohol before completing training + exam (as of March 31, 2025)

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**
- Employee serving without permit: Criminal citation, fines, potential jail time
- Employer: Liquor license suspension, fines, civil liability¹⁷

---

#### 3. Colorado: Voluntary Responsible Vendor Program

**Legal Status:**
Colorado has **NO mandatory alcohol server training requirement** for most servers. Training is mandatory only for:
- Alcohol service at liquor store tastings
- Alcohol service at special events¹⁸

**Responsible Vendor Program (RVP):**
Colorado offers a **voluntary certification program** through the Liquor Enforcement Division.¹⁹

**CRITICAL RESTRICTION:**
The Colorado LED **DOES NOT ACCEPT online training** for Responsible Vendor certification. Training must be:
- Classroom setting, OR
- Live streaming with live instructor interaction²⁰

**Certification Duration:** 2 years (recertification required every 2 years)²¹

**Liability Protection:**
- **Insurance premium discounts:** Up to 25% reduction for TIPS-certified establishments²²
- **Liquor board mitigation:** LED may mitigate fines/penalties for violations if establishment has completed Responsible Vendor training²³
- **Reduced civil liability:** Training demonstrates reasonable care in alcohol service

**ASBC COMPLIANCE STATUS (Colorado):**
- **190 employees** across 4 Colorado taprooms
- **Voluntary compliance recommended** for liability protection
- **Training must be in-person or live-streamed** (NOT online self-paced)

**Strategic Recommendation:**
Given Smith v. ASBC dram shop litigation, **voluntary certification in Colorado strengthens defense** by demonstrating reasonable training practices.

---

#### 4. North Carolina: RASP (Responsible Alcohol Seller/Server Program)

**Legal Status:**
North Carolina alcohol server training is **NOT mandatory** but is "strongly encouraged" by the NC ABC Commission.²⁴

**Exception:** Training IS mandatory for alcohol delivery service permit holders.²⁵

**RASP Training:**
- **Offered free by NC ABC Commission** (2-hour course)
- Available online through NC ABC Commission website
- Covers: Basic definitions, state laws, underage/intoxicated customers, Dram Shop laws²⁶

**Certification Duration:** 4 years (though voluntary, so no enforcement)

**Alternative Providers:**
NC ABC approves external training vendors (TIPS, ServSafe Alcohol) if they meet minimum content requirements.²⁷

**ASBC COMPLIANCE STATUS (North Carolina):**
- **142 employees** across 3 North Carolina taprooms
- **Not legally required** but recommended for liability protection
- **Free training available** reduces cost barrier

**Strategic Recommendation:**
Even though voluntary, **RASP training provides evidentiary value** in dram shop defense (demonstrates reasonable care standard).

---

#### 5. Washington: Mandatory Alcohol Server Training (MAST)

- **95 employees** across 2 Washington taprooms must maintain current MAST permits
- **60-day new hire deadline** strictly enforced
- **5-year renewal tracking** essential (no automatic renewal)

---

#### 6. California: Mandatory Responsible Beverage Service (RBS) Training (AB 1221)

**Legal Requirement:**
Assembly Bill 1221 (2017), effective **July 1, 2022**, mandates RBS training for all on-premises alcohol servers and managers.³⁶

**Who Must Be Certified:**
- All servers of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption

---

#### 7. Compliance Verification: ASBC's Current Status

**Total Employees Requiring Certification:**

| State | Employees | Mandatory? | Training Provider | Certification Tracking | Estimated Compliance Gap |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Oregon | 380 | YES | OLCC-approved | 5-year cycle | **HIGH RISK** (March 2025 rule change) |
| Colorado | 190 | NO (voluntary) | In-person/live only | 2-year cycle | **MEDIUM RISK** (voluntary reduces priority) |
| North Carolina | 142 | NO (recommended) | ABC-approved | 4-year cycle | **LOW RISK** (voluntary) |
| Washington | 95 | YES | MAST-approved | 5-year cycle | **HIGH RISK** (criminal penalties) |
| California | 47 | YES | RBS-approved | 3-year cycle | **MEDIUM RISK** (2025 renewal wave) |

**CRITICAL COMPLIANCE QUESTIONS:**

1. **Current Certification Status:**
   - Does ASBC maintain a centralized database tracking certification status for all 950 taproom employees?
   - How many employees currently have expired certifications?

2. **New Hire Onboarding:**
   - Does ASBC's onboarding process ensure new bartenders/servers complete required training within statutory deadlines?
   - **Oregon:** IMMEDIATE training required (as of March 31, 2025)
   - **Washington:** 60-day deadline
   - **California:** 60-day deadline

3. **Expiration Tracking:**
   - Does ASBC have automated alerts for certification expiration?
   - Are managers held accountable for ensuring staff maintain current certifications?

4. **Training Documentation:**
   - Does ASBC retain copies of all employee certifications?
   - Are certificates readily available for inspection by liquor control authorities?

**COMPLIANCE GAP RISK ASSESSMENT:**

Given Smith v. ASBC dram shop litigation, **any lapsed certifications create evidentiary problem** for ASBC's defense:
- Plaintiff can argue inadequate training demonstrates negligence
- Expired certifications suggest lack of management oversight
- Regulatory violations may be admissible as evidence of negligence per se

### C. DRAM SHOP LIABILITY AND TRAINING DEFENSE

#### 1. Smith v. ASBC Context

**Plaintiff's Allegation:**
ASBC's taproom staff were **inadequately trained**, failed to recognize Jones' visible intoxication, and **over-served** alcohol, resulting in damages.

**ASBC's Asserted Defense:**
Staff completed Oregon Alcohol Server Education (OLCC-required training), demonstrating reasonable care.

**Key Legal Question:**
Does completion of mandatory state alcohol server training provide sufficient liability protection in dram shop litigation?

---

#### 2. Oregon Dram Shop Law: ORS 471.565

**Statutory Framework:**

**ORS 471.565(1):** A patron who **voluntarily consumes** alcoholic beverages does not have a cause of action against the server, **even if beverages are served while the patron is visibly intoxicated**.⁴²

**ORS 471.565(2):** Servers are **not liable** for damages caused by intoxicated patrons **UNLESS** the plaintiff proves by **clear and convincing evidence**:
1. The server served alcohol to a **visibly intoxicated** patron
2. The server's service was a **substantial factor** in causing plaintiff's injury
3. The injury was **foreseeable**
4. The plaintiff did **not substantially contribute** to the patron's intoxication⁴³

**Oregon Supreme Court Constitutional Clarification:**
In *Bonner v. American Golf Corp.*, the Oregon Supreme Court held that ORS 471.565(1) would be **unconstitutional** if applied when:
- A server serves alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person who has reached the point at which **further consumption is involuntary** (loss of reason and volition)
- The distinction hinges on **voluntary vs. involuntary intoxication**⁴⁴

**Key Implication:** If Jones had reached a state of involuntary intoxication, ASBC's liability shield may erode.

---

#### 3. Does Server Training Provide Liability Protection?

**Oregon Statutory Analysis:**
ORS 471.565 provides **NO statutory safe harbor** for server training completion. The statute does not state "completion of OLCC training = no liability."⁴⁵

**However:**
- **Comparative negligence analysis:** Training evidence is relevant to whether ASBC acted reasonably
- **Jury consideration:** Did staff receive reasonable training to recognize intoxication signs and intervene appropriately?
- **Standard of care:** What training would a reasonable establishment provide?⁴⁶

**OLCC-Required Training as Minimum Standard:**
- Oregon law mandates OLCC Alcohol Server Education
- Completion demonstrates **minimum compliance** with state standard
- BUT: May not suffice if **additional training** reasonably necessary given context (high-volume taproom, late-night service)

---

#### 4. Training Content Required to Defend Dram Shop Claims

**A. Recognize Intoxication Signs**

OLCC-trained servers must reasonably recognize **observable indicators of intoxication**:⁴⁷
- **Physical signs:** Slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, unsteady gait, impaired coordination
- **Behavioral signs:** Aggressive behavior, impaired judgment, emotional volatility, slowed reaction time
- **Cognitive signs:** Confusion, disorientation, difficulty focusing

**Training Deficiency Risk:**
If ASBC's staff failed to recognize Jones' visible intoxication despite OLCC training:
- Plaintiff argues training was **inadequate** (insufficient practice/reinforcement)
- Plaintiff argues training was **not applied** (lack of management oversight)

**B. Intervention Techniques**

Effective training must include **how to cut off service** to intoxicated patrons:
- Polite but firm refusal of service
- Offer food and water
- Call taxi/rideshare or arrange safe transportation
- **NEVER allow visibly intoxicated patron to drive**
- Involve manager if patron becomes belligerent

**C. Documentation Procedures**

**CRITICAL DEFENSE ELEMENT:**
Establishments with **incident documentation policies** strengthen dram shop defense:⁴⁸
- **Cut-off logs:** Document patron name, time, observable intoxication signs, refusal of service
- **Manager notification:** Require manager approval/documentation of service refusals
- **Creates paper trail:** Demonstrates establishment took reasonable steps to prevent over-service

**ASBC Documentation Gap Assessment:**
- Does ASBC require staff to document cut-off incidents?
- Was there any documentation of Jones' intoxication level or intervention attempts?
- **Absence of documentation** = Plaintiff argues no intervention occurred

---

#### 5. ASBC's Training Beyond Mandatory State Requirements

**Mandatory Training (OLCC) vs. Supplemental Training:**

| Training Component | OLCC-Required | ASBC Supplemental (Recommended) | Smith Defense Value |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Recognize intoxication signs | ✓ | Role-playing scenarios | **HIGH** |
| Refuse service techniques | ✓ | Practice with difficult patrons | **HIGH** |
| Manager escalation | ✓ | Clear escalation protocols | **MEDIUM** |
| Documentation | Limited | Mandatory incident logs | **CRITICAL** |
| Ongoing refreshers | NO (5-year recert) | Annual refresher training | **MEDIUM** |

**Supplemental Training Recommendations:**

**A. Role-Playing Scenarios:**
- Practice refusing service to belligerent patrons
- Simulate high-pressure situations (busy taproom, impatient customers)
- **Builds confidence and muscle memory** for real-world intervention

**B. Manager Supervision and Support:**
- Train managers to **monitor staff and intervene** when staff uncertain
- Empower servers to call managers for backup
- **Reduces hesitation** to cut off service (fear of confrontation)

**C. Cut-Off Documentation Protocol:**
- **Mandatory incident reports** when patron cut off
- Include: Patron description, time, observable signs, staff actions taken
- Manager review and sign-off

**D. Annual Refresher Training:**
- OLCC training valid 5 years (long gap between training sessions)
- **Annual in-house refreshers** reinforce intoxication recognition and intervention
- Demonstrates commitment to responsible service

---

#### 6. Smith v. ASBC Defense Analysis

**ASBC's Defense Strengths:**
✓ Staff completed mandatory OLCC Alcohol Server Education
✓ Oregon law does not impose strict liability on servers
✓ Plaintiff must prove by **clear and convincing evidence** that server over-served

**ASBC's Defense Weaknesses:**
✗ **Lack of supplemental training** (beyond OLCC minimum)
✗ **No documented cut-off policy** or incident logs (assumption—requires verification)
✗ **No evidence of manager supervision** during Jones' service
✗ **Involuntary intoxication argument:** If Jones reached involuntary intoxication, statutory shield weakens

**Key Discovery Questions for ABP:**
1. **Training records:** Beyond OLCC certification, what supplemental training did ASBC provide?
2. **Incident logs:** Does ASBC have documentation of Jones' service, intoxication level, or any intervention attempts?
3. **Manager statements:** Were managers present and monitoring taproom during Jones' visit?
4. **Pattern evidence:** Does ASBC have history of over-service complaints or prior dram shop claims?

---

#### 7. Liability Exposure: Smith v. ASBC

**Dram Shop Claims Exposure Range:**
Typical dram shop verdicts/settlements vary widely based on injury severity:

| Injury Severity | Typical Settlement/Verdict Range |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Minor injury | $50,000 - $150,000 |
| Moderate injury (broken bones, hospitalization) | $200,000 - $750,000 |
| Severe injury (permanent disability, brain injury) | $1M - $5M |
| Death (wrongful death) | $2M - $10M+ |

**Smith Case Exposure (Unknown Injury Severity):**
Without knowing Jones' victim (Smith) injury severity, exposure estimate:
- **Low (minor injury):** $100,000 - $250,000
- **Medium (moderate injury):** $500,000 - $1.5M
- **High (severe/death):** $2M - $7M+

**Insurance Coverage:**
- ASBC's liquor liability insurance policy limits critical
- Typical craft brewery policies: $1M-$2M per occurrence
- If exposure exceeds policy limits, ASBC personally liable for excess

### D. WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTION RISK

#### 1. Gonzalez Wage Complaint: Off-the-Clock Work

**Gonzalez Allegation (July 2024):**
- **15-30 minutes per shift** unpaid overtime
- **Prep work:** Stocking bar, cutting garnishes, setting up POS system
- **Cleanup:** Washing glassware, restocking supplies, cashing out register

**Legal Issue:**
Are bartender prep/cleanup tasks **compensable time** under FLSA and Colorado law?

---

#### 2. FLSA "Integral and Indispensable" Standard

**Compensable Time Principle:**
Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), compensable time includes **all hours during which a non-exempt employee is suffered or permitted to work**, meaning time the employer requires or allows an employee to work, regardless of whether the work is authorized, scheduled, or requested.⁴⁹

**"Integral and Indispensable" Test:**
If an employee performs tasks before or after their scheduled shift that are **integral and indispensable** to their primary job duties (e.g., setting up equipment, logging into system, changing into protective gear), that time is considered compensable.⁵⁰

**Steiner v. Mitchell Foundation:**
*Steiner v. Mitchell* (1956) established that time workers spend on activities performed before or after regular working hours, on or off the production floor, is compensable under the FLSA if the activities are **integral and indispensable parts** of the principal activity of the worker's employment.⁵¹

---

#### 3. Are Gonzalez's Prep/Cleanup Tasks Compensable?

**Analysis of Bartender Duties:**

| Task | Integral & Indispensable? | Compensable? | Rationale |
|------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Stocking bar** (beer, liquor, garnishes) | **YES** | **YES** | Cannot bartend without stocked supplies |
| **Cutting garnishes** (limes, lemons, oranges) | **YES** | **YES** | Essential preparation for cocktail service |
| **Setting up POS system** | **YES** | **YES** | Cannot process orders/payments without POS |
| **Washing glassware** (post-shift) | **YES** | **YES** | Maintaining clean glassware integral to operations |
| **Restocking supplies** (post-shift) | **YES** | **YES** | Ensures readiness for next shift |
| **Cashing out register** | **YES** | **YES** | Required reconciliation of sales |

**Conclusion:** All tasks Gonzalez identified are **integral and indispensable** to bartending. ASBC **must compensate** for this time.⁵²

**DOL Guidance:**
In general, any activity an employee performs that **benefits their employer should be paid**.⁵³ Employers are responsible for preventing off-the-clock work and must enforce policies that prohibit it. Ignoring unauthorized work does not excuse the employer from compensating for it.⁵⁴

---

#### 4. Colorado COMPS Order Overtime Rules

**Colorado Minimum Wage (2024-2025):**
- **Non-tipped employees:** $14.81/hour (2025)⁵⁵
- **Tipped employees:** $11.79/hour (2025) + tips (employer must make up difference if tips don't reach minimum)⁵⁶

**Tipped Employee Definition (2024 Update):**
Employees are considered "tipped employees" when they regularly receive **more than $1.64 per hour in tips** averaged over any pay period (replaces previous $30/month threshold).⁵⁷

**Overtime Calculation (Critical Update):**
Colorado updated its "regular rate of pay" rule to **expressly exclude tips from regular rates**, clarifying that "a tipped minimum wage employee's overtime rate is 1.5 times minimum wage, **not** 1.5 times the sum of minimum wage plus their tips."⁵⁸

**Colorado Overtime Triggers:**
Employers must pay **1.5 times** employee's regular rate of pay for hours past:
- **(A) 40 hours per week**, OR
- **(B) 12 hours per day**, OR
- **(C) 12 consecutive hours**
— **Whichever results in higher pay**.⁵⁹

**Off-the-Clock Work Violation:**
If Gonzalez worked 15-30 min/shift prep/cleanup unpaid, and these hours pushed her **over 40 hours/week or 12 hours/day**, ASBC owes **overtime rate** (not straight time) for those hours.

---

#### 5. Gonzalez Individual Back Wages Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- **Employment period:** 2022-2024 (approximately 2 years = 104 weeks)
- **Off-the-clock time:** 15-30 min/shift
- **Shifts per week:** 5 shifts
- **Overtime rate:** $18.84/hour (Colorado tipped minimum $12.56 × 1.5 = $18.84)

**Calculation:**

| Scenario | Minutes/Shift | Hours/Week | Total Hours (104 weeks) | Overtime Rate | **Back Wages** |
|----------|---------------|------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Low** | 15 min | 1.25 hours | 130 hours | $18.84 | **$2,449** |
| **High** | 30 min | 2.5 hours | 260 hours | $18.84 | **$4,898** |

**Gonzalez's individual back wages: $2,449 - $4,898**

**Liquidated Damages:**
If FLSA/Colorado violation found **willful**, liquidated damages may **double** the back wages:
- **Total with liquidated damages: $4,898 - $9,796**

---

#### 6. Class Action Risk: 950 Taproom Employees

**Key Question:** Did ASBC require **all 950 taproom employees** to perform unpaid prep/cleanup work?

**Class Certification Requirements:**

Under the FLSA, plaintiffs may bring a **collective action** under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). To obtain conditional certification, the plaintiff must make a "**modest factual showing**" that the plaintiffs are similarly situated to other employees.⁶⁰

**Similarly Situated Analysis:**
- **Common policy:** Did ASBC have a de facto policy requiring off-the-clock prep/cleanup across all taprooms?
- **Similar duties:** Do all bartenders/servers perform similar prep/cleanup tasks?
- **Similar unpaid time:** Is the amount of unpaid time consistent across locations?

**If class certified, exposure multiplies by 950 employees.**

---

#### 7. Class Action Exposure Calculation

**Scenario 1: Full Class (950 Employees)**

**Assumptions:**
- All 950 taproom employees worked 2 years (104 weeks) with 15-30 min/shift unpaid prep/cleanup
- 5 shifts/week average

| Employee Count | Off-the-Clock Time | Total Back Wages (Low) | Total Back Wages (High) |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **950** | 15-30 min/shift | **$2,326,550** | **$4,653,100** |

**With Liquidated Damages (if willful):**
- **Low estimate:** $4.65M
- **High estimate:** $9.31M

**Scenario 2: Reduced Class (30% Opt-In Rate)**

Historical FLSA collective action opt-in rates typically **5-25%**, averaging around **10-20%**.⁶¹ Assuming **30% opt-in** (285 employees):

| Employee Count | Off-the-Clock Time | Total Back Wages (Low) | Total Back Wages (High) |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **285** (30% opt-in) | 15-30 min/shift | **$697,965** | **$1,395,930** |

**With Liquidated Damages (if willful):**
- **Low estimate:** $1.40M
- **High estimate:** $2.79M

---

#### 8. FLSA Collective Action vs. State Class Action

**Two Potential Paths:**

**A. FLSA Collective Action (29 U.S.C. § 216(b)):**
- **Opt-in:** Employees must **affirmatively opt in** to join
- **Certification standard:** "Modest factual showing" (lenient at conditional certification stage)⁶²
- **Statute of limitations:** 2 years (3 years if willful)⁶³
- **Damages:** Back pay + liquidated damages + attorney's fees

**B. State Class Action (Colorado COMPS Order):**
- **Opt-out:** Employees automatically included unless they opt out (larger class)
- **Certification standard:** Rule 23 class action requirements (more stringent)
- **Statute of limitations:** 2-3 years under Colorado law
- **Damages:** Back pay + interest + penalties

**Plaintiff's Strategy:**
Likely file **both federal FLSA collective action and state class action** to maximize recovery and class size.

---

#### 9. Employer Defenses and Class Decertification

**ASBC's Potential Defenses:**

**A. Individual Issues Predominate:**
- Employees' hours and duties varied significantly by location
- Some employees may have been paid for prep/cleanup time
- Time tracking records show no systematic policy⁶⁴

**B. No De Facto Policy:**
Plaintiffs had **no evidence of any de facto policies necessitating off-the-clock work** when individual issues predominate.⁶⁵

**C. Decertification Motion (Stage 2):**
After discovery, ASBC may move to **decertify the class**, arguing plaintiffs are not similarly situated. Recent developments show courts adopting **heightened standards** for collective action certification, rejecting the traditional lenient "conditional certification" approach.⁶⁶

---

#### 10. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Current Risk Level: HIGH**

**Factors Increasing Risk:**
- Gonzalez complaint documented in July 2024 (evidence of practice)
- Prep/cleanup tasks clearly "integral and indispensable"
- 950 potential class members across 5 states
- Retaliation claim strengthens wage claim credibility

**Factors Reducing Risk:**
- Class certification not guaranteed (individualized issues may defeat class)
- Opt-in rate historically low (5-25%)
- ASBC may have time records showing paid prep/cleanup (unknown)

**Mitigation Recommendations for ABP:**

1. **Immediate Audit:** Review ASBC's timekeeping practices across all 18 taprooms
   - Do time records reflect actual hours worked (including prep/cleanup)?
   - Are employees clocking in before prep work begins and clocking out after cleanup ends?

2. **Policy Clarification:** Implement clear policy requiring employees to clock in/out for ALL work time
   - Prohibit off-the-clock work explicitly
   - Train managers to enforce timekeeping compliance

3. **Potential Proactive Resolution:**
   - Consider proactive audit and back pay to affected employees (reduces class action risk)
   - Confidential settlement with Gonzalez (includes release of class claims if permissible)

4. **Discovery Focus:**
   - Identify differences in employee duties/hours across locations (defeats "similarly situated" requirement)
   - Locate employees who were paid for prep/cleanup time (demonstrates no common policy)

---

**Estimated Total Wage/Hour Exposure:**

| Scenario | Gonzalez Individual | Class (950 employees) | Class (30% opt-in) |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Back Wages Only** | $2,449 - $4,898 | $2.3M - $4.7M | $698K - $1.4M |
| **With Liquidated Damages** | $4,898 - $9,796 | $4.7M - $9.3M | $1.4M - $2.8M |
| **With Attorney's Fees** | +$50K-$150K | +$1M-$2.5M | +$400K-$800K |

**Total Class Action Exposure (Full Class): $5.7M - $11.8M**
**Total Class Action Exposure (30% Opt-In): $1.8M - $3.6M**

### E. WARN ACT ANALYSIS

#### 1. WARN Act Overview

**Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. § 2101):**
The WARN Act requires covered employers to provide **60 days advance written notice** to employees prior to any **plant closing** or **mass layoff**.⁶⁷

**Purpose:**
Provide employees and communities time to prepare for job loss and seek alternative employment or retraining.

---

#### 2. WARN Act Applicability

**Employer Coverage:**
WARN Act applies to employers with:
- **100 or more full-time employees**, OR
- **100 or more employees** (full-time and part-time) who work **aggregate 4,000+ hours/week**⁶⁸

**ASBC Status:**
- **1,850 employees** → **WARN Act APPLIES**

---

#### 3. Triggering Events

**A. Plant Closing:**
Permanent or temporary shutdown of a **single site of employment** OR one or more **facilities/operating units** within a single site that results in **50 or more employees** losing employment during any 30-day period.⁶⁹

**B. Mass Layoff:**
Reduction in force at a single site of employment during any 30-day period that results in employment loss for:
- **50-499 employees** if they constitute **at least 33% of active workforce**, OR
- **500 or more employees** (regardless of percentage)⁷⁰

---

#### 4. ABP Acquisition: Potential WARN Triggers

**Post-Acquisition Restructuring Scenarios:**

| Scenario | WARN Trigger? | Notice Required? | Exposure |
|----------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Close 1+ breweries** (50+ employees) | **YES** (plant closing) | 60 days | Back pay + benefits (60 days × affected employees) |
| **Close 3+ taprooms** (50+ employees total at single site) | **YES** (plant closing) | 60 days | Same |
| **Layoff 50-499 employees** (33%+ of site workforce) | **YES** (mass layoff) | 60 days | Same |
| **Layoff 500+ employees** (any percentage) | **YES** (mass layoff) | 60 days | Same |
| **Consolidate corporate functions** (eliminate 50+ roles at HQ) | **YES** (plant closing) | 60 days | Same |

**Key Consideration:**
"Single site of employment" analyzed separately—cannot aggregate layoffs across multiple locations unless under common operational control.⁷¹

---

#### 5. Seller vs. Buyer WARN Liability in Acquisitions

**Critical Rule:**
In a **business sale**, WARN Act responsibility splits between seller and buyer:

**A. Seller's Responsibility:**
The seller is responsible to provide notice for any plant closing or mass layoff **up to and including the effective date of the sale**.⁷²

**B. Buyer's Responsibility:**
The purchaser is responsible for providing notice for any plant closing or mass layoff that occurs **after the effective date of the sale**.⁷³

---

#### 6. Asset Sale vs. Stock Sale Distinction

**Asset Sale:**
When a case involves simply a **sale of assets**, as opposed to the sale of a business as a going concern, the **seller retains WARN Act notice responsibility** because the seller is the party actually closing the plant that results in the employment loss.⁷⁴

**Going Concern Sale (Stock Purchase):**
If the sale is on a **going-concern basis**, it is presumed that the sale involves the hiring of the seller's employees **unless something indicates otherwise**, whether or not the sale agreement expressly provides for retention of the seller's employees.⁷⁵

**ABP-ASBC Transaction:**
- If **asset purchase**: ASBC (seller) responsible for pre-closing layoffs
- If **stock purchase**: ABP may inherit ASBC employees; ABP responsible for post-closing layoffs

---

#### 7. WARN Act 60-Day Notice Requirements

**Who Receives Notice:**

**A. Affected Employees (or Union Representatives):**
- Written notice to each affected employee individually
- If union represents employees, notice to union representative⁷⁶

**B. State Dislocated Worker Unit:**
- Colorado: Colorado Department of Labor and Employment
- Oregon: Oregon Employment Department
- North Carolina: NC Division of Workforce Solutions
- Washington: Washington Employment Security Department
- California: California Employment Development Department⁷⁷

**C. Local Government:**
- Chief elected official of local government where employment site located

**Notice Content:**
- Name and address of employment site
- Contact information of company official
- Expected date of layoff/closure
- Job titles and number of affected employees⁷⁸

---

#### 8. WARN Act Exceptions (Reducing Notice Period)

**A. Faltering Company:**
Employer actively seeking capital/business that would avoid/postpone shutdown, and employer reasonably believed that giving notice would preclude obtaining capital/business.⁷⁹

**B. Unforeseeable Business Circumstances:**
Layoffs caused by business circumstances that were **not reasonably foreseeable** at the time 60-day notice would have been required.⁸⁰
- **Third Circuit Standard:** Requires layoffs be **probable**, not merely **possible**⁸¹

**C. Natural Disaster:**
Flood, earthquake, drought, storm, fire, or similar natural disaster.⁸²

---

#### 9. WARN Act Penalties for Non-Compliance

**Employer Liability:**
Employers who violate the WARN Act by failing to provide the required notice may be liable for:

**A. Back Pay:**
- **Up to 60 days** back pay for each affected employee
- Calculated from date employment loss occurred

**B. Benefits:**
- Value of benefits (health insurance, retirement contributions) for **up to 60 days**

**C. Civil Penalties:**
- **Up to $500 per day** for failure to notify local government (not to exceed 60 days = $30,000 max)⁸³

**D. Attorney's Fees:**
- Prevailing employees entitled to reasonable attorney's fees

---

#### 10. Exposure Calculation: Hypothetical ABP Layoffs

**Scenario 1: Close Denver Brewery (120 employees)**

| Component | Calculation | Exposure |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Back Pay (60 days)** | 120 employees × $25/hour × 8 hours/day × 60 days | **$1,440,000** |
| **Benefits (60 days)** | 120 employees × $500/month benefits × 2 months | **$120,000** |
| **Civil Penalty** | $500/day × 60 days | **$30,000** |
| **Attorney's Fees** | Estimated 200-400 hours × $400-500/hour | **$80,000-$200,000** |
| **TOTAL** | | **$1,670,000 - $1,790,000** |

**Scenario 2: Mass Layoff (300 employees across multiple sites)**

| Component | Calculation | Exposure |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Back Pay (60 days)** | 300 employees × $22/hour × 8 hours/day × 60 days | **$3,168,000** |
| **Benefits (60 days)** | 300 employees × $500/month benefits × 2 months | **$300,000** |
| **Civil Penalty** | $500/day × 60 days × 3 sites | **$90,000** |
| **Attorney's Fees** | Estimated 400-800 hours × $400-500/hour | **$160,000-$400,000** |
| **TOTAL** | | **$3,718,000 - $3,958,000** |

---

#### 11. Colorado Mini-WARN Act

**Colorado WARN Requirements:**
Colorado does **not have its own state-level WARN Act** with requirements stricter than federal law.⁸⁴ However, some sources indicate Colorado may require notice for employers with **50 or more employees** (lower than federal 100 threshold).⁸⁵

**Federal WARN Controls:**
Federal WARN Act requirements apply to Colorado employers meeting federal thresholds (100+ employees).⁸⁶

**Comparison: States with Stricter Mini-WARN Acts:**
- **California:** Requires notice for 50+ employees (stricter than federal)
- **New York:** WARN Act covers 50+ employees (stricter than federal)
- **New Jersey:** Requires 100+ employees but broader coverage
- **Illinois:** WARN Act covers 75+ employees for certain layoffs

**ASBC California Taproom:**
If ABP closes California taproom with 50+ employees, **California WARN Act** (stricter) applies.

---

#### 12. ABP Due Diligence Recommendations

**A. Identify Post-Acquisition Restructuring Plans:**
- Will ABP close any ASBC facilities?
- Will ABP consolidate departments, eliminating redundant positions?
- Will ABP retain all 1,850 ASBC employees, or conduct workforce reduction?

**B. WARN Act Compliance Timeline:**
If layoffs planned:
1. **Day 1 (Closing Date):** ABP assumes WARN responsibility for post-closing layoffs
2. **Day 1-60:** Provide 60-day advance notice to affected employees, state agencies, local governments
3. **Day 61:** Layoffs may commence without WARN liability

**C. Allocation of WARN Liability in Purchase Agreement:**
- **Pre-closing layoffs:** ASBC (seller) responsible
- **Post-closing layoffs:** ABP (buyer) responsible
- **Indemnification:** Negotiate ASBC indemnification for any pre-closing WARN violations

**D. Employee Retention Analysis:**
- If ABP commits to retaining ASBC employees for 60+ days post-closing, may avoid immediate WARN trigger
- Long-term retention reduces WARN risk

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Critical Employment Liabilities

| Risk Category | Severity | Likelihood | Estimated Exposure | Mitigation Priority |
|---------------|----------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Gonzalez EEOC Retaliation** | HIGH | PROBABLE | $231K - $688K | **IMMEDIATE** |
| **Wage/Hour Class Action** | CRITICAL | PROBABLE | $1.8M - $11.8M | **IMMEDIATE** |
| **Smith Dram Shop Liability** | MEDIUM-HIGH | POSSIBLE | $100K - $7M+ | **HIGH** |
| **Multi-State Server Training Compliance** | MEDIUM | CERTAIN | Regulatory fines + license risk | **HIGH** |
| **WARN Act (Post-Acquisition)** | MEDIUM | CONDITIONAL | $1.7M - $4M (if layoffs) | **MEDIUM** |

---

### B. Top 5 Red Flags Requiring Immediate Action

#### 1. **WAGE/HOUR CLASS ACTION RISK — $1.8M TO $11.8M EXPOSURE**

**Issue:**
Gonzalez complaint alleges systematic unpaid prep/cleanup work (15-30 min/shift) for 950 taproom employees. Under FLSA "integral and indispensable" standard, all alleged tasks (stocking bar, cutting garnishes, POS setup, glassware washing, cash-out) are **compensable**.

**Class Certification Risk:**
If plaintiffs establish a common policy/practice, collective action covering 950 employees could result in:
- **Full class (100% opt-in):** $5.7M - $11.8M (with liquidated damages + attorney's fees)
- **Realistic class (30% opt-in):** $1.8M - $3.6M

**Recommended Action:**
- **Immediate timekeeping audit** across all 18 taprooms
- Implement strict policy requiring clock-in before prep work, clock-out after cleanup
- Consider proactive settlement with Gonzalez (including class release if permissible)

---

#### 2. **EEOC RETALIATION: STRONG TEMPORAL PROXIMITY (2 WEEKS)**

**Issue:**
Gonzalez filed wage complaint in July 2024, terminated in August 2024 (approximately 2 weeks later). Courts find **2-week temporal proximity "very close"** and sufficient for prima facie retaliation case.

**Pretext Vulnerability:**
ASBC's stated reasons (customer complaints, cash discrepancies, tardiness) may be deemed **pretext** if:
- Performance issues not documented **before** wage complaint
- Comparator evidence shows non-Hispanic employees retained despite similar issues
- ASBC deviated from progressive discipline procedures

**2025 Legal Trend:**
Justice Thomas and Eleventh Circuit reject rigid McDonnell Douglas application, requiring "big picture" analysis. Even if ASBC's explanation legitimate, **other evidence** supporting retaliation inference may defeat summary judgment.

**Recommended Action:**
- **Conduct comparator analysis:** Review 2022-2024 terminations at Denver taproom for similar infractions
- **Assess documentation timing:** Verify whether performance issues documented pre-complaint
- **Settlement negotiation:** Estimated exposure $231K-$688K; settlement range $150K-$350K

---

#### 3. **OREGON MARCH 2025 SERVER TRAINING RULE CHANGE**

**Issue:**
Oregon **eliminated 45-day grace period** for temporary service permits effective March 31, 2025. All 380 Oregon taproom employees must now complete OLCC training + exam **BEFORE serving alcohol** (no exceptions).

**Compliance Gap:**
Any employee hired after March 31, 2025 who served alcohol before completing certification = **regulatory violation**:
- Employee: Criminal citation, fines, potential jail time
- ASBC: Liquor license suspension, fines

**Dram Shop Implications:**
In Smith v. ASBC litigation, **expired or missing certifications** undermine ASBC's defense that staff adequately trained.

**Recommended Action:**
- **Verify current certification status** for all 380 Oregon employees (5-year renewal tracking)
- **Update new hire protocols:** NO employee may serve until certification complete
- **Implement automated expiration alerts** to prevent lapses

---

#### 4. **DRAM SHOP TRAINING DEFICIENCY: LACK OF SUPPLEMENTAL TRAINING**

**Issue:**
ASBC's defense relies on mandatory OLCC training, but Oregon statute provides **NO safe harbor** for training completion. Plaintiff will argue OLCC training is **minimum standard**, insufficient for high-volume taproom environment.

**Defense Weaknesses:**
- No evidence of **role-playing scenarios** or practice refusing service to difficult patrons
- No documented **cut-off policy** or incident logs (creates evidentiary gap)
- No **annual refresher training** (OLCC valid 5 years = long gap)

**Exposure:**
Unknown injury severity, but typical range:
- Minor injury: $100K-$250K
- Moderate injury: $500K-$1.5M
- Severe/death: $2M-$7M+

**Recommended Action:**
- **Implement supplemental training:** Role-playing, manager supervision protocols, cut-off documentation
- **Require incident logs:** Mandatory reports when patron cut off (creates paper trail)
- **Annual refreshers:** Reinforce intoxication recognition beyond 5-year OLCC cycle

---

#### 5. **MULTI-STATE COMPLIANCE GAPS: 3 of 5 STATES MANDATE TRAINING**

**Issue:**
Oregon (380 employees), Washington (95 employees), California (47 employees) **legally require** alcohol server certification. Colorado and North Carolina voluntary, but recommended for liability protection.

**Compliance Tracking:**
Unknown whether ASBC maintains centralized certification database tracking:
- Current certification status for all 950 employees
- Expiration dates (OR/WA: 5 years, CA: 3 years)
- New hire compliance deadlines (WA/CA: 60 days)

**2025 Renewal Wave:**
California employees certified when AB 1221 became mandatory (July 2022) **expire in 2025** (3-year validity).

**Recommended Action:**
- **Immediate compliance audit:** Verify certification status across all 5 states
- **Centralized tracking system:** Automated alerts for expiration + new hire deadlines
- **Manager accountability:** Hold taproom managers responsible for staff compliance

---

### C. WARN Act Conditional Risk

**Trigger:** IF ABP plans post-acquisition layoffs of 50+ employees at single site OR 33%+ of site workforce

**ABP Must Determine:**
- Will ABP close any ASBC facilities (breweries, taprooms, corporate offices)?
- Will ABP consolidate redundant departments (e.g., marketing, finance, HR)?
- Will ABP retain all 1,850 ASBC employees, or conduct workforce reduction?

**If Layoffs Planned:**
- **60-day advance notice** required to employees, state agencies, local governments
- **Failure to provide notice:** Back pay + benefits (up to 60 days) for each affected employee
- **Hypothetical exposure:** $1.7M (120 employees) to $4M (300 employees)

**Seller/Buyer Liability Split:**
- **ASBC (seller):** Responsible for pre-closing layoffs
- **ABP (buyer):** Responsible for post-closing layoffs
- **Negotiate indemnification** in purchase agreement

---

### D. Successor Liability and Union Considerations

**NLRA Successorship Doctrine:**
If ABP acquires ASBC as **going concern** and retains "substantial continuity" of workforce, ABP may inherit:
- Collective bargaining agreements (if any)
- Unfair labor practice liability
- Union recognition obligations

**Current Status:**
No information provided regarding union representation at ASBC. **Discovery essential:**
- Are any ASBC employees unionized?
- Any pending NLRB charges or unfair labor practice allegations?
- Any ongoing union organizing campaigns?

---

### E. Discovery Priorities for ABP Due Diligence

1. **Personnel Files:**
   - Gonzalez termination file (pre-complaint documentation?)
   - Denver taproom termination records 2022-2024 (comparator evidence)
   - Progressive discipline policies and application

2. **Timekeeping Records:**
   - All 18 taprooms: Do employees clock in before prep, clock out after cleanup?
   - Audit sample of employees across locations (detect systematic practice)

3. **Training Records:**
   - Alcohol server certification status (all 950 employees)
   - Expiration dates and renewal compliance
   - Supplemental training beyond state-mandated (role-playing, incident logs, refreshers)

4. **Litigation History:**
   - Prior EEOC charges or employment discrimination claims
   - Prior dram shop claims or liquor license violations
   - Prior wage/hour complaints or DOL investigations

5. **Union Status:**
   - Union representation at any ASBC facilities
   - Collective bargaining agreements
   - Pending NLRB charges

6. **Post-Acquisition Plans:**
   - ABP's restructuring intentions (facility closures, layoffs, consolidations)
   - WARN Act applicability and 60-day notice timeline

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Gonzalez EEOC Retaliation Claim Has Strong Merit**

Gonzalez establishes prima facie retaliation case through:
- **Strong temporal proximity** (2 weeks between wage complaint and termination)
- Protected activity under FLSA, Colorado COMPS Order, and potentially Title VII
- Adverse action (termination)

ASBC's defense vulnerable to pretext challenge if:
- Performance issues not documented before July 2024 wage complaint
- Comparator evidence shows non-Hispanic employees retained for similar infractions
- Progressive discipline procedures not followed

**Estimated exposure:** $231,600 - $688,000 (back pay, compensatory/punitive damages capped at $300K, front pay, attorney's fees)

**Settlement range:** $150,000 - $350,000

---

**2. Wage/Hour Class Action Poses CRITICAL Risk**

Gonzalez's wage complaint (unpaid 15-30 min/shift prep/cleanup) exposes ASBC to **systemwide class action**:
- All alleged tasks meet FLSA "integral and indispensable" standard
- 950 taproom employees potential class members
- Colorado COMPS Order requires overtime pay (1.5×) if hours exceed 40/week or 12/day

**Exposure calculations:**
- **Full class (100% opt-in):** $5.7M - $11.8M (including liquidated damages + attorney's fees)
- **Realistic class (30% opt-in):** $1.8M - $3.6M
- **Gonzalez individual:** $2,449 - $9,796 (with liquidated damages)

**Class certification risk:** MODERATE-HIGH
- Plaintiffs must show "modest factual showing" of similarly situated employees
- ASBC may defeat certification if individualized issues predominate
- Recent trends favor heightened certification standards

---

**3. Multi-State Server Training Compliance Gaps Create Regulatory and Liability Risk**

**Oregon (380 employees):** CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAP
- March 31, 2025 rule change **eliminated 45-day grace period**
- All employees must complete OLCC training + exam BEFORE serving alcohol
- 5-year renewal tracking essential

**Washington (95 employees):** HIGH RISK
- MAST permit mandatory within 60 days of hire
- Criminal penalties for non-compliance (up to $500 fine + 90 days jail)

**California (47 employees):** 2025 RENEWAL WAVE
- Employees certified in 2022 (when AB 1221 became mandatory) expire in 2025
- 3-year validity requires proactive renewal tracking

**Colorado/North Carolina (332 employees):** VOLUNTARY (But Recommended)
- Training not legally required but strengthens dram shop defense
- Colorado Responsible Vendor Program offers liquor liability insurance discounts (up to 25%)

---

**4. Smith v. ASBC Dram Shop Defense Hinges on Training Adequacy**

Oregon ORS 471.565 provides **NO statutory safe harbor** for completing mandatory OLCC training. Plaintiff will argue:
- OLCC training is **minimum standard**, insufficient for high-volume taproom
- ASBC lacked **supplemental training** (role-playing, cut-off documentation, annual refreshers)
- Absence of incident logs undermines defense (no evidence staff intervened)

**Defense strengthening recommendations:**
- Implement **role-playing scenarios** for refusing service to difficult patrons
- Require **mandatory incident logs** when patrons cut off (creates paper trail)
- Conduct **annual refresher training** (OLCC valid 5 years = long gap)
- Train managers to **monitor and support staff** during cut-off situations

**Exposure:** $100,000 - $7,000,000+ (depending on injury severity)

---

**5. WARN Act Applies IF ABP Plans Post-Acquisition Layoffs**

ASBC's 1,850 employees trigger federal WARN Act coverage (100+ employee threshold).

**IF ABP plans:**
- Close facilities with 50+ employees
- Layoff 50-499 employees (33%+ of site workforce)
- Layoff 500+ employees (any percentage)

**THEN ABP must provide:**
- **60 days advance written notice** to affected employees, state agencies, local governments
- **Failure to comply:** Back pay + benefits (up to 60 days) for each employee

**Seller/Buyer Split:**
- **ASBC (seller):** Responsible for pre-closing layoffs
- **ABP (buyer):** Responsible for post-closing layoffs

**Recommended purchase agreement terms:**
- ASBC indemnification for pre-closing WARN violations
- Clear allocation of responsibility for post-closing restructuring
- ABP may avoid immediate WARN trigger by committing to 60+ day employee retention

---

### B. Recommended Next Steps for ABP Due Diligence

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Pre-Closing):**

**1. Employment Litigation Review**
- Obtain complete EEOC charge file for Gonzalez (including ASBC's position statement)
- Review Smith v. ASBC dram shop complaint and discovery
- Identify all pending employment claims, EEOC charges, DOL complaints (2019-2024)

**2. Timekeeping Audit**
- Sample 50-100 employees across all 18 taprooms
- Verify clock-in/out times match actual work (including prep/cleanup)
- Identify whether systematic off-the-clock work policy exists

**3. Training Compliance Audit**
- Verify alcohol server certification status for all 950 taproom employees
- Identify expired certifications (OR/WA: 5 years, CA: 3 years)
- Confirm new hire compliance with state deadlines (WA/CA: 60 days, OR: immediate)

**4. Comparator Analysis (Gonzalez)**
- Review Denver taproom termination records (2022-2024)
- Identify employees with similar performance issues (customer complaints, cash discrepancies, tardiness)
- Determine whether non-Hispanic employees retained

**5. Union Status Inquiry**
- Confirm no union representation at any ASBC facilities
- Identify any pending NLRB charges or organizing campaigns
- Review for potential successorship obligations

---

**SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (30-60 Days Pre-Closing):**

**6. Settlement Negotiations**
- **Gonzalez EEOC charge:** Explore settlement ($150K-$350K range)
- **Smith dram shop case:** Assess settlement vs. litigation costs

**7. Insurance Coverage Review**
- Verify ASBC's employment practices liability insurance (EPLI) limits and exclusions
- Verify liquor liability insurance limits (dram shop claims)
- Assess tail coverage for post-closing claims

**8. WARN Act Planning**
- Determine ABP's post-acquisition workforce retention plans
- If layoffs planned, calculate 60-day notice deadline
- Draft WARN notices for affected employees, state agencies, local governments

---

**POST-CLOSING ACTIONS (Integration):**

**9. Implement Corrected Timekeeping Policies**
- Require employees clock in BEFORE prep work, clock out AFTER cleanup
- Prohibit off-the-clock work explicitly
- Train managers to enforce compliance

**10. Centralized Training Compliance System**
- Implement database tracking all 950 employees' certification status
- Automated alerts for expiration (90 days advance notice)
- Manager accountability for ensuring staff compliance

**11. Supplemental Dram Shop Training**
- Develop role-playing scenarios for refusing service
- Implement mandatory incident log policy
- Conduct annual refresher training beyond state-mandated cycles

**12. Proactive Wage/Hour Resolution (If Appropriate)**
- If audit confirms systematic off-the-clock work, consider proactive back pay to affected employees
- Reduces class action risk and demonstrates good faith compliance

### C. Risk Mitigation Recommendations

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Timeline | Estimated Cost |
|------|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Gonzalez Retaliation** | Settlement negotiation | Pre-closing | $150K-$350K |
| **Wage/Hour Class Action** | Timekeeping audit + policy correction | Immediate | $50K-$200K (audit) + back wages (TBD) |
| **Dram Shop Liability** | Supplemental training + incident logs | 90 days post-closing | $100K-$250K (training development) |
| **Training Compliance Gaps** | Centralized tracking system + renewals | 60 days post-closing | $75K-$150K (system + certifications) |
| **WARN Act** | 60-day notice (if layoffs planned) | Pre-layoff | $0 (if notice provided) |

---

### D. Outstanding Questions Requiring ABP Response

1. **Post-Acquisition Workforce Plans:**
   - Does ABP intend to retain all 1,850 ASBC employees?
   - Are facility closures or department consolidations planned?
   - If layoffs planned, what is the timeline?

2. **Integration Timeline:**
   - When will ABP implement corrected timekeeping policies?
   - When will ABP transition ASBC employees to ABP's EPLI coverage?

3. **Settlement Authority:**
   - Is ABP authorized to negotiate Gonzalez settlement pre-closing?
   - What settlement authority threshold requires board approval?

4. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - Is ABP willing to implement proactive wage/hour resolution (back pay to affected employees) if audit confirms violations?
   - Or prefer to defend class action litigation?
