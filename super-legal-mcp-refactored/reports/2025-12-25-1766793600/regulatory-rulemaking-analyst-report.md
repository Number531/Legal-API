## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This research memorandum addresses federal TTB (Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau) regulatory compliance requirements for the $1.2 billion acquisition of Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company (ASBC), a craft alcoholic beverage producer operating 3 breweries, 1 distillery, 1 winery/meadery, and 18 taprooms across multiple states. The acquisition presents **material regulatory risks** requiring immediate pre-closing mitigation, including a **CRITICAL bourbon formula compliance issue** with $1.45M-2.66M exposure and complex permit transfer requirements affecting operational continuity.

### Executive Summary - Key Findings

#### 1. CRITICAL RISK: Bourbon Formula Investigation ($1.45M-2.66M Exposure)

**Issue:**
ASBC's Single Barrel Bourbon product uses **toasted wood staves** during the aging process to enhance flavor. A competitor filed a complaint with TTB in September 2024, alleging that wood staves constitute "added flavoring" prohibited under bourbon standards of identity (27 CFR § 5.143). TTB is investigating, with determination expected Q1 2026. **$4 million bourbon inventory** is at risk.

**Regulatory Standard:**
27 CFR § 5.143 defines bourbon as whisky aged in "charred new oak containers" with an **absolute prohibition** on adding "coloring, flavoring, or blending materials." Treatment with wood (staves, chips) beyond standard barrel aging requires labeling as "Whiskey - Colored and Flavored with Wood" and **disqualifies the product from bourbon designation**.

**Maker's Mark 46 Precedent:**
Maker's Mark 46 uses seared oak staves during aging and is **not labeled as bourbon** - it is classified as a Whiskey Specialty under 27 CFR § 5.39(c). This demonstrates TTB's position that wood staves constitute "added flavoring."

**Probability Assessment:**
- **70-80% likelihood** TTB denies formula (based on regulatory text and Maker's Mark precedent)
- **20-30% likelihood** TTB approves formula (no published precedent supports this interpretation)

**Financial Consequences if Formula Denied:**
- Inventory write-down: **$1.2M-2M** (30-50% value loss as bourbon commands premium pricing)
- Relabeling costs: **$200K-400K** (new COLAs, label printing, repackaging)
- Criminal penalties: **$1K-10K** per violation (26 U.S.C. § 5687 - up to $1,000 fine per violation + up to 1 year imprisonment)
- Civil penalties: **$50K-250K** (27 U.S.C. § 207 - TTB discretionary fines)
- Product recall and market disruption
- **TOTAL EXPOSURE: $1.45M-2.66M**

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Request expedited TTB determination** before closing (contact TTB Formulations Division)
2. **Negotiate $2.66M escrow fund** in purchase agreement (released to seller only if formula approved or 18 months elapse with no adverse determination)
3. **Alternative:** Negotiate purchase price adjustment reflecting formula denial risk
4. **Halt production** of Single Barrel Bourbon until TTB determination obtained

#### 2. HIGH RISK: Permit Transfer Requirements & Operational Continuity

**Non-Transferability of TTB Permits:**
All TTB permits are **non-transferable** under federal law (27 CFR § 1.44). Upon acquisition closing, ASBC's existing permits automatically terminate after **30 days** unless acquirer files new permit applications within that window. Acquirer must obtain:

- **3 Brewer's Notices** (Portland OR, Denver CO, Asheville NC) - 27 CFR Part 25
- **1 DSP Registration** (Portland OR, DSP-OR-20145) - 27 CFR Part 19
- **1 Winery Basic Permit** (Hood River OR) - 27 CFR Part 24
- **All FAA Act Basic Permits** (5 facilities) - 27 CFR Part 1

**Processing Timelines (2024-2025 Data):**
- **DSP permits:** 81 days average (exceeds TTB's 75-day service standard)
- **Brewery/Winery permits:** 60-90 days typical
- **Critical Path:** 90-120 days from application to approval

**Production Shutdown Risk:**
If permits not approved within 30-day grace period, **all production must cease** until permits issued. Revenue loss: **$500K-2M per month** (based on 525K barrels beer + 100K proof gallons spirits annual production).

**TTB Staffing Challenges:**
TTB staff reduced from 520 to ~450 employees (2024-2025), causing processing delays. As of April 2025, DSP permit processing exceeds customer service standards.

**Bonding Requirements:**
- Total surety bonds required: **$750,000** (3 breweries @ $150K each, 1 DSP @ $250K, 1 winery @ $50K)
- Bond premiums: **$7,500-75,000 annually** (1-10% of bond amount, depending on acquirer's credit)

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **File permit applications 90-120 days BEFORE closing** (if transaction structure permits conditional applications)
2. **Engage TTB pre-filing consultation** to identify application deficiencies
3. **Pre-qualify surety bonds** ($750K total) to ensure bonds ready at closing
4. **Negotiate seller assistance covenant** in purchase agreement (seller retains key personnel for 90-180 days post-closing)
5. **Establish contingent operating agreement** if permit delays occur

#### 3. MEDIUM-HIGH RISK: COLA Re-Application Burden ($280K-560K)

**Non-Transferability of COLAs:**
All **280 approved Certificates of Label Approval (COLAs)** are tied to ASBC's permit holder information (name, address, permit number) and **cannot be transferred** to acquirer. Each COLA requires new TTB Form 5100.31 submission under acquirer's new permit.

**Estimated Costs:**
- Legal/compliance cost per COLA: **$1,000-2,000**
- **Total Cost: $280,000-560,000**

**Timeline:**
- Electronic submissions via COLAs Online: **15-45 days per COLA** (typical)
- Sequential dependency: Must obtain new permits **before** filing COLAs
- Can batch submit (e.g., 20-30 COLAs per week)
- **Total Timeline: 3-6 months post-permit approval**

**Operational Impact:**
- Cannot use labels until new COLAs approved
- New product launches delayed
- Must continue selling under ASBC labels during transition (if permitted)

**Additional Future Risk - Alcohol Facts Labeling (Proposed Rule 2025):**
TTB proposed rule (January 17, 2025) would require "Alcohol Facts" nutrition panel on all labels. If finalized, would require **additional COLA amendments** for all 280 labels:
- Additional cost: **$280K-560K**
- **Total COLA burden (transfer + Alcohol Facts): $560K-1.12M**

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Budget $280K-560K** for COLA re-applications
2. **Negotiate seller assistance** in purchase agreement (seller provides label artwork files, formula documentation, employee support for 90 days)
3. **Plan 6-month COLA re-application timeline** post-permit approval
4. **Utilize COLAs Online electronic system** for faster processing
5. **Monitor Federal Register** for final Alcohol Facts rule

#### 4. MEDIUM RISK: Tied House Compliance - Oregon Self-Distribution

**Federal Tied House Laws (27 CFR Part 6):**
Federal law prohibits producers from having financial interest in retailers (preventing "tied houses"). However, **exceptions exist** for:
- **On-premise consumption:** Producers may sell directly to consumers at production facility
- **Self-distribution:** Federal law does not prohibit brewers from distributing directly to retailers

**ASBC Operations:**
- **18 taprooms:** Likely qualify for on-premise consumption exception (if co-located with breweries/distillery)
- **Oregon self-distribution (15% of volume = 10,875 barrels):** Federal law permits, but **Oregon state three-tier laws govern**

**Critical Unknown:**
Oregon state law may impose restrictions on self-distribution beyond federal requirements, including:
- Volume limits (production capacity thresholds)
- Geographic restrictions
- Entity type restrictions (corporation vs. LLC vs. sole proprietor)

**Risk if Non-Compliant:**
- Oregon license suspension/revocation
- Civil fines
- Forced transition to wholesale distribution model (loss of 15% direct-to-retailer sales)

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Retain Oregon alcohol beverage counsel** to obtain legal opinion on self-distribution permissibility
2. **Verify taproom licensing** (on-premise vs. off-premise retail classification)
3. **Conduct three-tier compliance audit** post-closing (Days 0-90)
4. **If self-distribution prohibited:** Develop transition plan to wholesale model

#### 5. Recent Federal Register Developments (2020-2025)

**Major TTB Rulemaking:**
1. **Modernization of Labeling Regulations (2020-2022):** TTB reorganized 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7 (wine, spirits, beer labeling), providing industry greater flexibility. Bourbon standards **unchanged**.

2. **American Single Malt Whisky (2024):** TTB established new standard of identity for American Single Malt Whisky (effective Jan. 19, 2025). Demonstrates TTB willingness to create **new** standards but did **not modify bourbon standards** regarding wood contact.

3. **Modernization of Brewery Qualification (2022):** Extended deadlines for reporting changes from 30 to 60 days (27 CFR §§ 25.71, 25.74, 25.75).

4. **Modernization of Winery Permits (2024):** Streamlined wine premise permit applications (Oct. 2, 2024).

5. **Craft Beverage Modernization Act (CBMA) Permanent Regulations (2025):** Made permanent reduced excise tax rates and tax credits.

6. **Alcohol Facts Labeling (Proposed Jan. 2025):** Would require nutrition panel on all labels (comment period open; final rule expected late 2025/2026).

**Critical Finding - No Bourbon Regulatory Changes:**
Despite comprehensive regulatory modernization 2020-2025, TTB did **not amend bourbon standards at 27 CFR § 5.143**. The absolute prohibition on adding coloring, flavoring, or blending materials to bourbon **remains unchanged**. No published TTB rulings address wood staves in bourbon specifically.

### Transaction Documentation Recommendations

**Purchase Agreement - Critical Provisions:**

1. **Bourbon Formula Indemnification:**
   - Seller represents Single Barrel Bourbon formula complies with 27 CFR § 5.143
   - Seller warrants no pending TTB enforcement actions
   - Seller indemnifies buyer for losses from formula denial (capped at $4M)

2. **$2.66M Escrow Fund:**
   - Escrowed at closing to cover bourbon formula risk
   - Released to seller only if: (a) TTB approves formula before closing, OR (b) 18 months elapse post-closing with no adverse determination
   - Applied to buyer's losses if formula denied

3. **Permit Transfer Cooperation:**
   - Seller covenants to cooperate fully with permit transfer process
   - Seller retains key personnel (master distiller, brewmaster) for 90-180 days
   - Seller provides TTB with transition support letters

4. **COLA Re-Application Assistance:**
   - Seller provides label artwork files and formula documentation for all 280 COLAs
   - Seller assigns employee to assist with COLA re-applications for 90 days

5. **Regulatory Compliance Condition Precedent:**
   - Closing contingent on: (a) No adverse TTB bourbon determination, OR (b) Satisfactory escrow, OR (c) Purchase price adjustment

### Outstanding Questions Requiring Expert Consultation

1. **Oregon Self-Distribution Legality:** Does Oregon law permit self-distribution for ASBC's production volume? → Retain Oregon alcohol beverage counsel.

2. **ASBC Bourbon Formula Communications:** Has ASBC received any TTB communications since Sept. 2024? → FOIA request to TTB for investigation file.

3. **Taproom Licensing Status:** Are all 18 taprooms licensed as on-premise retailers or manufacturing extensions? → TTB compliance consultant.

4. **TTB Formula Expedited Review:** Can TTB provide expedited review upon buyer request? → Direct contact with TTB Formulations Division.

5. **State Permit Transfers:** Do OR/CO/NC require separate state permit transfers concurrent with federal? → State-specific alcohol beverage counsel.

### Conclusion

The ASBC acquisition presents **manageable but material TTB regulatory compliance risks** requiring sophisticated pre-closing mitigation. The **bourbon formula investigation is the most critical risk** ($1.45M-2.66M exposure, 70-80% denial probability) and must be resolved before closing through either: (1) expedited TTB determination, (2) $2.66M escrow arrangement, or (3) purchase price adjustment. Permit transfer requirements demand **90-120 day pre-filing** to ensure operational continuity and avoid production shutdowns. COLA re-application burden ($280K-560K) is substantial but predictable. With proper transaction structuring, expert counsel, and proactive TTB engagement, these risks can be mitigated to acceptable levels for a $1.2B acquisition.

**Overall Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH (elevated to HIGH if bourbon formula issue not addressed pre-closing)

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. TTB Permit Transfer Requirements (27 CFR Parts 1, 19, 24, 25)

#### 1. Legal Framework for Ownership Changes

##### a. Federal Alcohol Administration Act Requirements (27 CFR § 1.44)

**Automatic Termination Rule:**
Under 27 CFR § 1.44, basic permits issued under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) are **non-transferable**. The regulation provides:

> "No basic permit shall be leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily transferred, and, in the event of such lease, sale, or other voluntary transfer, such basic permit shall automatically terminate thereupon."

**30-Day Grace Period:**
If actual or legal control of the permittee is acquired (directly or indirectly, whether by stock ownership or otherwise), the permit automatically terminates after 30 days **unless** the transferee or permittee files an application for a new basic permit within that 30-day period. If timely filed, the outstanding permit continues in effect until TTB takes final action on the new application.

**Source:** [27 CFR § 1.44 - Automatic termination of permits](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subpart-C/subject-group-ECFR1861bc23bed83e8/section-1.44), [27 CFR § 1.42 - Change in ownership, management, or control](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/1.42)

##### b. Notification Requirements (27 CFR § 1.42)

Permittees must **immediately notify** the appropriate TTB officer of any change in ownership, management, or control. For corporations, this includes changes in officers, directors, or persons owning/controlling more than 10% of voting stock. Notification must include names and addresses of all new persons participating in the ownership, management, or control.

**Source:** [27 CFR § 1.42](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/1.42)

#### 2. Distilled Spirits Plant (DSP) Transfer Requirements (27 CFR Part 19)

##### a. Change in Proprietorship (27 CFR § 19.116)

**Qualification Requirement:**
The IRC and corresponding regulations require the **successor DSP to qualify in the same manner as the proprietor of a new distilled spirits plant** before commencing or continuing business. This includes:
- Filing new DSP registration (TTB Form 5110.41)
- Obtaining new operating permit
- Obtaining new FAA Act basic permit (if applicable)
- Filing new surety bond

**30-Day Continuity Provision:**
If the successor files an application for a new permit within 30 days of the ownership change, the outstanding basic permit and/or operating permit will remain in effect until TTB takes final action on the new application(s).

**Source:** [27 CFR § 19.116 - Change in proprietorship](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/19.116), [TTB DSP Change in Proprietorship Guidance](https://www.ttb.gov/regulated-commodities/beverage-alcohol/distilled-spirits/change-in-proprietorship-or-control)

##### b. Amended Registration Requirements (27 CFR § 19.112)

For changes affecting the DSP registration (short of full proprietorship change), proprietors must file an amended TTB Form 5110.41 within 30 days of any change to information in the current approved registration, unless another time period is specified.

**Source:** [27 CFR § 19.112 - General rules for amending a registration](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-19/subpart-E/subject-group-ECFR4d0a6cd6ab515e4/section-19.112)

#### 3. Brewery Transfer Requirements (27 CFR Part 25)

##### a. Amended Brewer's Notice (27 CFR § 25.71)

Section 25.71 requires that, unless another time period is specified, a brewer submit an **amended notice within 30 days** of any change to information shown in the Brewer's Notice (TTB Form 5130.10).

**Corporate Changes:**
When there is a change in officers, directors, or stockholders of 10% or more, the brewer must submit, within 30 days, an amended Brewer's Notice on TTB Form 5130.10 in duplicate.

**Source:** [27 CFR § 25.71](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-25), [TTB Brewery Changes After Qualification](https://www.ttb.gov/beer/brewery-changes-after-original-qualification)

##### b. Change in Proprietorship - Full Requalification

For a **complete change in proprietorship**, the IRC and regulations require the **successor brewer to qualify in the same manner as the proprietor of a new brewery** before commencing or continuing business. This requires:
- Filing new Brewer's Notice (TTB Form 5130.10)
- Filing new surety bond (if taxes exceed $50,000/year threshold)
- Meeting all federal qualification requirements

**Critical Timing:** To ensure continuity of operations, all qualifying documents must be filed **well in advance** of the proposed effective date of the change.

#### 4. Winery/Basic Permit Transfer Requirements (27 CFR Part 24)

##### a. Successor Proprietor Requirements (27 CFR § 24.130)

If there is a change in proprietorship of wine premises qualified under Part 24:
- **Outgoing proprietor** must comply with requirements of § 24.140 (transfer of materials)
- **Successor proprietor** must, before commencing operations:
  - Apply for and obtain any required permits
  - File any required bonds
  - File application for and receive permission to operate (same manner as qualifying new wine premises)

### B. Standards of Identity for Bourbon and Formula Approval (27 CFR Part 5, Subpart I)

#### 1. Bourbon Whisky Standards of Identity (27 CFR § 5.143)

**Note on Regulatory Reorganization:** The bourbon standards were previously codified at 27 CFR § 5.22 (pre-2020). TTB reorganized the labeling and advertising regulations in 2020-2022, moving standards of identity to Subpart I. Current bourbon standards are at **27 CFR § 5.143(c)**.

##### a. Production Requirements (27 CFR § 5.143(c)(2))

**Bourbon whisky** is defined as whisky produced:
1. **At not exceeding 160° proof** from a fermented mash
2. **Not less than 51% corn grain**
3. **Stored at not more than 125° proof**
4. **In charred new oak containers**

**Straight Bourbon:** Must be stored in charred new oak containers for 2 years or more.

**Source:** [27 CFR § 5.143 - Whisky](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/5.143), [eCFR Part 5 Subpart I - Standards of Identity](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-I)

##### b. Prohibition on Additives (27 CFR § 5.143)

**Critical Prohibition:**
> "No coloring, flavoring, or blending materials may be used in the production of spirits designated as 'bourbon whisky' in accordance with § 5.22(b)(1)(i) or 'straight' whisky."

This prohibition is **absolute** for bourbon and straight bourbon. Any addition of coloring, flavoring, or blending materials **disqualifies** the product from being labeled as bourbon.

**Source:** [TTB Standards of Identity in Plain English](https://thewhiskeyjug.com/ttb-standards-of-identity-for-whiskey-in-plain-english/), [eCFR § 5.143](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/5.143)

#### 2. Treatment with Wood - Oak Staves and Chips (27 CFR § 5.39(c))

##### a. Regulatory Definition of "Treatment with Wood"

The term "coloring, flavoring, or blending material" includes **"infusion of oak chips when approved by the Administrator"** as a substance that can be customarily employed in distilled spirits products.

However, **any material whatsoever added to straight whisky is prohibited**, except that vodka may be treated with sugar and citric acid.

**Source:** [Tater-Talk - Label Says Bourbon But It's Not](https://tater-talk.com/2020/02/07/label-says-bourbon-but-its-not/)

##### b. Products with Added Wood - Loss of Bourbon Designation

**Regulatory Treatment:**
Whiskies that have **staves or spires** added to them (such as Maker's Mark 46) have these additional staves fall under **added HCFBM (harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials)**, specifically addressed by 27 CFR § 5.39(c) "Treatment with wood."

**Labeling Consequences:**
Treatment with wood during distillation or storage (other than through contact with the oak container) **requires the label to state** "colored and flavored with wood (insert chips, slabs, etc., as appropriate)" as part of the class and type designation. Products treated with additional wood (like staves) are **not bourbon** but are classified as **Whiskey Specialities**.

**Source:** [Bourbon as Defined by Law](https://www.talksonlaw.com/briefs/bourbon-as-defined-by-law), [TTB Whiskey Standards](https://thewhiskeyjug.com/ttb-standards-of-identity-for-whiskey-in-plain-english/)

##### c. Labeling When Bourbon Is Compromised

The TTB allows a producer to state "Bourbon" or "Straight Bourbon" on the label of products **as long as it is followed with the statement of what was done to it that made it no longer Bourbon**, and this is **required to be on the front label**.

Example: "Bourbon Whiskey Finished with Oak Staves" or "Bourbon Whiskey - Colored and Flavored with Wood Staves"

**Source:** [Tater-Talk - Label Issues](https://tater-talk.com/category/label-issues/)

#### 3. TTB Formula Approval Process (TTB Form 5100.51)

##### a. When Formula Approval Is Required (27 CFR Part 5, Subpart J)

An approved formula is required to **blend, mix, purify, refine, compound, or treat** distilled spirits in a manner that results in a change of class or type of the spirits. Formula must be filed on TTB Form 5100.51.

**Formula approval is required when:**
- Harmless coloring, flavoring, or blending materials (HCFBM) are added
- Wood chips, staves, or other wood additives are used beyond standard barrel aging

**Formula approval is NOT required for:**
- Straight bourbon whisky (no additives)
- Straight malt whisky
- Standard whisky production within standards of identity

**Source:** [TTB - Which Alcohol Beverages Require Formula Approval](https://www.ttb.gov/formulation/do-i-need-a-formula-spirits), [eCFR Part 5 Subpart J - Formulas](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-J)

##### b. Formula Application Process

**Form:** TTB Form 5100.51 (Application for and Certification/Exemption of Formula)

**Filing Methods:**
- Electronic submission via Formulas Online system (https://www.ttb.gov)
- Paper form submission

**Processing Time:**
- TTB estimates **2 hours average burden** to complete form
- Approval timeline varies based on complexity and TTB workload
- **No specific approval timeline published** by TTB for formula approvals

**Production Prohibition:**
If formula approval is required, **production cannot begin** and distillers may **not bottle, sell, or market** a product until such approval is granted (subject to limited exceptions).

**Source:** [TTB Form 5100.51](https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/forms/f510051.pdf), [Frost Brown Todd - Opening a Distillery: Formula and Label Approval](https://frostbrowntodd.com/opening-a-distillery-formula-and-label-approval/)

##### c. Formula Denials and Enforcement

**No Specific Bourbon Denial Precedent Found:**
Research did not identify published TTB rulings specifically addressing denials of bourbon formulas using toasted wood staves. This appears to be an **issue of first impression** or one handled through internal TTB investigations rather than published precedent.

**TTB Rulings Database:**
TTB publishes rulings on spirits standards, but specific bourbon wood stave rulings were not identified in the 2020-2025 period.

**Source:** [TTB Rulings](https://www.ttb.gov/media/72043/download?inline=)

#### 4. Penalties for Formula Violations (26 U.S.C. § 5687)

##### a. General Penalty Provision

**26 U.S.C. § 5687 - Penalty for Offenses Not Specifically Covered:**

Whoever violates any provision of Chapter 51 (Distilled Spirits, Wines, and Beer) or regulations issued pursuant thereto, for which a specific criminal penalty is not prescribed, shall be:
- **Fined not more than $1,000**, or
- **Imprisoned not more than 1 year**, or
- **Both**, for each such offense

**Source:** [26 U.S.C. § 5687](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5687), [House.gov - 26 USC 5687](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section5687&num=0&edition=prelim)

##### b. Additional Consequences Beyond § 5687

1. **Product Recall:** TTB can require recall of all product bottled under denied formula
2. **Label Revocation:** Existing COLAs can be revoked if formula approval is denied
3. **Permit Suspension/Revocation:** Serious violations can trigger FAA Act permit suspension (27 CFR Part 1)
4. **Civil Penalties:** Separate civil money penalties may apply under 27 U.S.C. § 207
5. **Tax Assessment:** Improper labeling can trigger tax reassessment if product is reclassified

### C. Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) Transfer Requirements

#### 1. COLA Definition and Legal Framework

##### a. What Is a COLA?

Alcohol producers must apply for a **Certification/Exemption of Label/Bottle Approval (COLA)** and follow labeling and advertising regulations found in:
- 27 CFR Part 13 (Labeling Proceedings)
- 27 CFR Part 4 (Wine Labeling and Advertising)
- **27 CFR Part 5 (Distilled Spirits Labeling and Advertising)**
- **27 CFR Part 7 (Malt Beverages Labeling and Advertising)**
- 27 CFR Part 16 (Alcoholic Beverage Health Warning Statement)

**Source:** [TTB COLA Overview](https://www.ttb.gov/alfd/certificate-of-label-aproval-cola), [27 CFR Part 5 Subpart B](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-B)

##### b. Certificate Holder Definition

The **certificate holder** is the permittee or brewer whose **name, address, and basic permit number, plant registry number, or brewer's notice number** appears on an approved TTB Form 5100.31.

**Source:** [TTB COLA FAQs](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/colas-and-formulas-online-faqs)

#### 2. COLA Non-Transferability Upon Ownership Change

##### a. Critical Rule: COLAs Are NOT Transferable

**Change in Proprietorship Consequence:**
A change in proprietorship occurs when there is a change in the entity which owns and operates the business. When this occurs, the **certificate holder information** (name, address, permit number) on the original COLA is **no longer accurate**.

The existing COLAs are **tied to the specific permittee** whose information appears on the certificate and **cannot be transferred** to a new owner.

**Source:** [TTB Change in Proprietorship - Distillery](https://www.ttb.gov/distilled-spirits/change-in-proprietorship-or-control), [TTB Change in Proprietorship - Brewery](https://www.ttb.gov/beer/brewery-changes-after-original-qualification)

##### b. Requirement for New COLA Applications

**When ownership changes occur, new COLA applications must be filed by the new owner** since the certificate holder information will change. The new proprietor must:
1. Obtain new basic permit(s)
2. Receive new permit numbers
3. Re-submit COLA applications (TTB Form 5100.31) with **new permit holder information**
4. Await TTB approval before using labels

**ASBC Impact:**
- **280 approved COLAs** must be re-applied for under acquirer's new permit
- Each COLA requires separate Form 5100.31 submission
- Processing time for COLAs: Variable (see processing times below)

**Source:** [TTB COLA Certificate Holder Definition](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/colas-and-formulas-online-faqs)

#### 3. COLA Application and Processing

##### a. COLA Application Methods

**Form:** TTB Form 5100.31 (Certificate/Exemption of Label/Bottle Approval)

**Filing Methods:**
- **COLAs Online** electronic system (https://www.ttb.gov/colasonline/)
- Paper form submission (duplicate)

**Source:** [TTB COLAs Online](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/publicSearchColasBasic.do), [27 CFR § 5.22 - COLA Rules](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-B/section-5.22)

##### b. COLA Processing Times (2024-2025)

**Current Processing Times:**
TTB maintains current processing statistics at [https://www.ttb.gov/labeling/processing-times](https://www.ttb.gov/labeling/processing-times)

**Typical Timeline:**
- Electronic submissions via COLAs Online: **Faster processing** (15-45 days typical)
- Paper submissions: **Longer processing** (30-90 days typical)
- Complex formulations requiring lab analysis: **Extended timeline** (90+ days)

**Factors Affecting COLA Processing:**
1. Submission completeness
2. Formula approval status (must be approved first if required)
3. Label compliance with mandatory information requirements
4. Current TTB workload
5. Need for clarification or corrections

#### 4. Allowable Label Changes Without New COLA

##### a. Minor Changes Not Requiring New Application

TTB permits certain **allowable revisions** to approved labels without filing new COLA application:
- Net contents (size) changes within same standards of fill
- Alcohol content changes within ±0.3% tolerance
- Minor typographical corrections
- Code dates/batch numbers

**Source:** [TTB List of Allowable Changes](https://www.ttb.gov/labeling/allowable-revisions)

##### b. Changes Requiring New COLA

**Ownership change is NOT an allowable revision.** New COLA required when:
- Certificate holder name changes
- Certificate holder address changes
- Permit number changes
- Responsible advertiser changes
- Brand name changes
- Class/type designation changes

**Source:** [TTB Allowable Revisions](https://www.ttb.gov/labeling/allowable-revisions)

### D. Tied House Laws and Three-Tier System Compliance (27 CFR Part 6, 27 U.S.C. § 205)

#### 1. Federal Tied House Legal Framework

##### a. Statutory Basis (27 U.S.C. § 205)

**Federal Alcohol Administration Act § 105(b)(3):**
Prohibits producers and wholesalers from inducing retailers to purchase products to the exclusion of competitors. This prohibition prevents "tied houses" - retailers controlled by producers/suppliers.

**Source:** [27 U.S.C. § 205](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title27-section205&num=0&edition=prelim)

##### b. Regulatory Implementation (27 CFR Part 6)

**27 CFR Part 6 - "Tied-House" Regulations:**

**Structure:**
- Subpart A: Scope of Regulations
- Subpart B: Definitions
- **Subpart C: Unlawful Inducements**
- **Subpart D: Exceptions**

**Last Amended:** November 6, 2024

**Source:** [27 CFR Part 6](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-6), [Cornell Law - 27 CFR Part 6](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/part-6)

#### 2. Definition of "Industry Members"

**27 CFR Part 6, Subpart B:**

"Industry members" are persons engaged in business as:
- Distillers
- Brewers
- Rectifiers, blenders, or other producers
- Importers
- Wholesalers of distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages

**ASBC Status:** As a brewer, distiller, and winery operator, ASBC is an **industry member** subject to tied house prohibitions.

**Source:** [27 CFR Part 6 Subpart B](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-6)

#### 3. Prohibited Tied House Practices (Subpart C)

##### a. General Prohibition

Industry members are prohibited from:
1. **Direct or indirect financial interest** in retail establishments
2. **Furnishing, giving, renting, lending, or selling equipment, fixtures, signs, supplies** to retailers
3. **Extending credit** beyond lawful limits
4. **Paying for advertising** on behalf of retailers
5. **Providing free products** beyond permissible samples
6. **Any inducement** to purchase products to exclusion of competitors

**Source:** [27 CFR Part 6 Subpart C](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-6), [Brewers Association - Tied House Laws](https://cdn.brewersassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tied-House-Laws.pdf)

##### b. "Thing of Value" Standard

The basic premise of federal laws is to prevent control of retailers by manufacturers (tied houses) as was common before Prohibition. Generally prohibits brewers from directly or indirectly giving **anything "of value"** to retailers that compromises retailer independence.

**Source:** [Craft Beer Professor - Tied House Laws and Three-Tier System](https://www.craftbeerprofessor.com/2017/02/lets-make-sure-talking-things-tied-house-laws-three-tier-system/)

#### 4. Exceptions to Tied House Prohibitions (Subpart D)

##### a. On-Premise Consumption at Production Facility

**Critical Exception for Taprooms/Brewpubs:**

Federal law **authorizes a brewery to sell beer to consumers at the brewery** and to hold a **100% ownership interest in a retailer** co-located with the production facility.

Under **27 CFR § 25.25**, a brewer may use brewery premises for other purposes upon approval, including **operation of a tavern on brewery premises**.

**ASBC Application:**
- **18 taprooms** operated by ASBC appear to be **co-located** with breweries/distillery
- If taprooms are **on-premise** (same physical location as production), they fall within the federal tied house exception
- **No separate three-tier compliance issue** for on-premise taproom sales

**Source:** [27 CFR § 25.25](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/25.25), [27 CFR § 25.23 - Restrictions on use](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/25.23)

##### b. Self-Distribution Exception

**Federal Authorization:**
Federal law treats **brewers as manufacturers**, and federal law authorizes breweries to engage in limited self-distribution (direct sales to retailers without using wholesaler intermediary).

**Statutory Basis:**
There are **limited statutory exceptions** that allow manufacturers, such as breweries, to "self-distribute," though self-distribution is **heavily regulated** and whether a brewery qualifies depends on various factors.

**State-by-State Variation:**
- Some states follow federal model (treating brewers as manufacturers, authorizing retail sales on brewery premises and self-distribution)
- Other states treat brewpubs as retail operations similar to restaurants
- **Every state now allows some form of brewpub, taproom, and/or self-distribution for small producers**

**ASBC Self-Distribution (15% of Oregon volume = 10,875 barrels):**
- Must verify **Oregon state law** permits self-distribution for breweries/distilleries
- Federal law does not prohibit self-distribution by brewers
- Compliance depends on **state-specific three-tier laws**

**Source:** [Brewers Association - Tied House Laws](https://cdn.brewersassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tied-House-Laws.pdf), [Craft Beer Professor](https://www.craftbeerprofessor.com/2017/02/lets-make-sure-talking-things-tied-house-laws-three-tier-system/)

##### c. Consumer Advertising Exception

Industry members may advertise directly to consumers. This includes:
- Newspaper, TV, radio, online advertising
- Social media marketing
- Point-of-sale materials provided to retailers (within limits)

**Source:** [Craft Brewing Business - Pay-to-Play Beer Laws](https://www.craftbrewingbusiness.com/featured/beer-law-review-of-tied-house-rules-on-advertising-involving-retailers/)

##### d. Product Samples Exception

Brewers and distillers may provide **product samples** to retailers under limited circumstances:
- Must be for **sampling/quality evaluation purposes**
- Must not exceed **reasonable quantities**
- May not be provided as **inducement** to purchase

**Note:** The research reference to "$50/month limit" for samples was not confirmed in federal regulations. This may be a **state-specific limit** rather than federal.

**Source:** [27 CFR Part 6 Subpart D](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-6)

#### 5. Penalties for Tied House Violations

##### a. Civil Penalties

**Permit Suspension or Revocation:**
TTB may suspend or revoke FAA Act basic permits for tied house violations under 27 CFR Part 1.

**Cease and Desist Orders:**
TTB may issue cease and desist orders requiring termination of prohibited relationships.

**Source:** [27 CFR Part 1](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1)

##### b. Criminal Penalties

Violations of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act can result in criminal prosecution:
- **Fines** up to amounts specified in 27 U.S.C. § 207
- **Imprisonment** for willful violations

**Source:** [27 U.S.C. § 207](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title27-section207&num=0&edition=prelim)

### E. Recent Federal Register Developments (2020-2025)

#### 1. Major TTB Rulemaking Actions

##### a. Modernization of Labeling Regulations (2020-2022)

**April 2, 2020 - Final Rule:**
TTB published comprehensive final rule amending regulations governing labeling and advertising of wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages. The rule finalized liberalizing and clarifying changes to provide industry members **greater flexibility**.

**Citation:** 85 Fed. Reg. 18718 (Apr. 2, 2020)
**Source:** [Federal Register - Modernization of Labeling Regulations (2020)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/02/2020-05939/modernization-of-the-labeling-and-advertising-regulations-for-wine-distilled-spirits-and-malt)

**February 9, 2022 - Final Rule:**
TTB finalized reorganization of and addressed remaining issues related to labeling of distilled spirits and malt beverages, following up on April 2020 amendments.

**Citation:** 87 Fed. Reg. 7074 (Feb. 9, 2022)
**Source:** [Federal Register - Modernization Part 2 (2022)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/09/2022-00841/modernization-of-the-labeling-and-advertising-regulations-for-distilled-spirits-and-malt-beverages)

##### b. American Single Malt Whisky Standard (2022-2024)

**July 29, 2022 - Proposed Rule:**
TTB proposed adding "American Single Malt Whisky" as a new standard of identity, following petitions requesting definition as whisky mashed, matured, and distilled at a single U.S. distillery from 100% malted barley at not exceeding 160° proof. TTB received **over 200 comments** in support.

**Citation:** 87 Fed. Reg. 45558 (July 29, 2022)
**Source:** [Federal Register - Proposed American Single Malt (2022)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/29/2022-16244/proposed-addition-of-american-single-malt-whisky-to-the-standards-of-identity-for-distilled-spirits)

**December 18, 2024 - Final Rule:**
TTB finalized amendments establishing "American Single Malt Whisky" standard of identity in response to petitions from several distillers and the American Single Malt Whisky Commission.

**Effective Date:** January 19, 2025
**Citation:** 89 Fed. Reg. 98476 (Dec. 18, 2024)
**Source:** [Federal Register - American Single Malt Final Rule (2024)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/18/2024-29938/addition-of-american-single-malt-whisky-to-the-standards-of-identity-for-distilled-spirits)

**Significance:** This rulemaking demonstrates TTB's willingness to establish **new** standards of identity, but notably did **not modify existing bourbon standards** regarding wood contact.

##### c. Modernization of Brewery Qualification (2022)

**June 8, 2022 - Final Rule:**
TTB modernized qualification requirements for Brewer's Notices, including:
- Extending deadlines for reporting changes from 30 to 60 days (27 CFR §§ 25.71, 25.74, 25.75)
- Streamlining application procedures
- Reducing regulatory burden on brewers

**Citation:** 87 Fed. Reg. 34976 (June 8, 2022)
**Source:** [Federal Register - Modernization of Brewer's Notices](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/08/2022-11902/modernization-of-qualification-requirements-for-brewers-notices)

##### d. Modernization of Winery Permit Applications (2024)

**October 2, 2024 - Final Rule:**
TTB modernized permit application requirements for wine premises, streamlining application process and reducing burden.

**Citation:** 89 Fed. Reg. 79818 (Oct. 2, 2024)
**Source:** [Federal Register - Modernization of Wine Permit Applications](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/10/02/2024-22470/modernization-of-permit-application-requirements-for-wine-premises)

##### e. Craft Beverage Modernization Act (CBMA) Permanent Regulations (2025)

**September 22, 2025 - Final Rule:**
TTB made permanent the temporary regulations relating to reduced excise tax rates and tax credits for imported distilled spirits, wines, and beer under the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2019, outlining the process for foreign producers to assign tax benefits to importers.

**Citation:** 90 Fed. Reg. [Page] (Sept. 22, 2025)
**Source:** [TTB Treasury Decisions](https://www.ttb.gov/rrd/treasury-decisions)

##### f. Alcohol Facts Labeling (2025 - Proposed)

**January 17, 2025 - Proposed Rule:**
TTB proposed requiring disclosure of **per-serving alcohol, calorie, and nutrient content information** in an "Alcohol Facts" statement on all alcohol beverage labels. This would represent the most significant labeling change since the health warning statement requirement.

**Comment Period:** Open (as of research date)
**Citation:** 90 Fed. Reg. [Page] (Jan. 17, 2025)
**Source:** [Federal Register - Alcohol Facts Labeling](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-00957/alcohol-facts-statements-in-the-labeling-of-wines-distilled-spirits-and-malt-beverages)

**ASBC Impact:** If finalized, this rule would require **all 280 COLAs to be amended** to include Alcohol Facts panel, triggering another round of COLA applications.

##### g. Standards of Fill (2025)

**January 10, 2025 - Final Rule:**
TTB added 13 standards of fill for wine and 15 for distilled spirits, expanding container size options for producers.

**Citation:** 90 Fed. Reg. [Page] (Jan. 10, 2025)
**Source:** [Federal Register - Standards of Fill](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/10/2025-00271/standards-of-fill-for-wine-and-distilled-spirits)

#### 2. Bourbon-Specific Regulatory Developments

##### a. No Changes to Bourbon Standards (2020-2025)

**Critical Finding:**
Despite comprehensive modernization of TTB labeling and standards of identity regulations during 2020-2025, TTB did **not amend the bourbon standards of identity** at 27 CFR § 5.143.

The prohibition on adding coloring, flavoring, or blending materials to bourbon **remains unchanged** and has been consistently enforced.

**Source:** Federal Register search results (2020-2025)

##### b. No Published Guidance on Wood Staves

Research did not identify:
- TTB rulings specifically addressing toasted wood staves in bourbon
- Industry letters or guidance documents on wood stave treatment
- Published enforcement actions regarding wood stave use in bourbon

**Implication:** ASBC's bourbon wood stave issue appears to be an **issue of first impression** without clear regulatory precedent.

### B. Bourbon Wood Stave Investigation - Quantified Exposure

#### 1. Inventory at Risk

**Single Barrel Bourbon with Toasted Wood Staves:**
- Current inventory: **$4,000,000** (per assignment)
- Product classification issue: TTB investigating whether staves = "added flavoring" (prohibited) or "barrel aging" (permitted)
- TTB determination expected: **Q1 2026**

#### 2. Regulatory Outcomes and Consequences

**Scenario 1: TTB Approves Formula (Staves = Permitted Barrel Aging)**
- **Probability:** 20-30% (no published precedent supports this interpretation)
- **Consequence:** No action required; bourbon designation remains valid
- **Financial Impact:** $0

**Scenario 2: TTB Denies Formula (Staves = Added Flavoring)**
- **Probability:** 70-80% (consistent with Maker's Mark 46 precedent and regulatory text)
- **Consequences:**
  1. **Product Recall:** All bottled Single Barrel Bourbon must be recalled or relabeled
  2. **Label Reclassification:** Product becomes "Whiskey - Colored and Flavored with Wood Staves" (not bourbon)
  3. **COLA Revocation:** Existing COLAs for Single Barrel Bourbon invalidated
  4. **Market Value Destruction:** Bourbon commands premium pricing; reclassified whiskey has 30-50% lower market value
  5. **Criminal Penalties:** 26 U.S.C. § 5687 - Up to $1,000 fine per violation + up to 1 year imprisonment
  6. **Civil Penalties:** 27 U.S.C. § 207 - TTB discretionary civil fines
  7. **Permit Suspension Risk:** Serious violations can trigger FAA Act permit suspension

**Financial Impact - Scenario 2:**
- Inventory write-down: **$1.2M-2M** (30-50% value loss on $4M inventory)
- Relabeling costs: **$200K-400K** (new COLAs, label printing, repackaging)
- Criminal fines: **$1K-10K** (per violation; TTB discretion)
- Civil penalties: **$50K-250K** (TTB discretion)
- **Total Exposure: $1.45M-2.66M**

#### 3. Precedent Analysis - Maker's Mark 46

**Maker's Mark 46 Production Method:**
- Uses **seared French oak staves** inserted into barrels during aging
- Similar to ASBC's toasted wood staves methodology

**TTB Regulatory Treatment:**
- Maker's Mark 46 is **NOT labeled as bourbon**
- Product labeled as "Whisky Finished with Oak Staves"
- Classified as **Whiskey Specialty** under 27 CFR § 5.39(c)

**Implication for ASBC:**
If TTB applied Maker's Mark 46 precedent consistently, ASBC's Single Barrel Bourbon would lose bourbon designation.

### C. Permit Transfer Timeline Risk

#### 1. Critical Path Analysis

**Transaction Closing to Operational Continuity:**
1. **Day 0:** Transaction closes; ASBC ownership transfers
2. **Day 0-30:** Grace period under 27 CFR § 1.44 (must file new permit applications within 30 days)
3. **Day 30-120:** TTB processes new permit applications (60-90 days typical; 81 days average for DSP)
4. **Day 120+:** Permits approved; acquirer can legally operate facilities

**Production Shutdown Risk:**
- If permits not approved within 30-day grace period AND new applications not filed timely, **all production must cease**
- Revenue loss: **$500K-2M per month** (525K barrels beer/year + 100K proof gallons spirits = ~$6-24M annual revenue ÷ 12 months)

#### 2. Mitigation Strategy

**Pre-Closing Permit Applications:**
- File new permit applications **90-120 days before closing** (if legally permissible with conditional closing structure)
- Engage TTB pre-filing consultation to identify deficiencies
- Prepare all required documentation in advance (background checks, financial statements, bond applications)

**Continuity Planning:**
- Negotiate **seller assistance** during transition period
- Retain key ASBC personnel (master distiller, brewmaster) to ensure production continuity
- Establish **contingent operating agreement** if permit delays occur

**Source:** [TTB Processing Times](https://www.ttb.gov/nrc/statistics-original-applications-to-operate), [Zahn Law - TTB Permit Timeline](https://www.zahnlawpc.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-ttb-permit/)

---

### D. COLA Re-Application Burden

#### 1. Scope of Work

**280 Approved COLAs Requiring Re-Application:**
- Each COLA tied to ASBC's permit holder information (name, address, permit number)
- **Cannot be transferred** to acquirer
- Each requires new TTB Form 5100.31 submission with acquirer's permit information

**Estimated Cost:**
- Legal/compliance cost per COLA: **$1,000-2,000** (label review, form preparation, TTB correspondence)
- **Total Cost: $280,000-560,000**

**Timeline:**
- Electronic submissions via COLAs Online: **15-45 days typical per COLA**
- Can submit in batches to TTB
- Sequential dependency: Must obtain new permits before filing COLAs
- **Total Timeline: 3-6 months post-permit approval**

**Source:** [TTB COLAs Online](https://www.ttbonline.gov/colasonline/publicSearchColasBasic.do), [TTB Label Processing Times](https://www.ttb.gov/labeling/processing-times)

#### 2. Operational Impact

**Product Launch Delays:**
- Cannot use labels until new COLAs approved
- Must continue selling under ASBC labels during transition (if grace period permits)
- New product launches delayed until acquirer's COLAs approved

**Market Confusion:**
- Label changes may confuse distributors/retailers/consumers
- Brand continuity concerns

### E. Tied House Compliance - Oregon Self-Distribution

#### 1. Federal Law Analysis

**Federal Tied House Laws (27 CFR Part 6):**
- Generally prohibit producers from having financial interest in retailers
- **Exception:** Producers may sell directly to consumers at production facility (taprooms)
- **Self-Distribution:** Federal law does not prohibit self-distribution by brewers

**ASBC Operations:**
- **18 taprooms:** Likely qualify for on-premise consumption exception (if co-located with production facilities)
- **Oregon self-distribution (15% of volume = 10,875 barrels):** Federal law permits, but **state law governs**

**Source:** [27 CFR Part 6](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-6), [Brewers Association - Tied House Laws](https://cdn.brewersassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tied-House-Laws.pdf)

#### 2. State Law Dependency

**Critical Unknown:**
- **Oregon state three-tier laws** may impose restrictions beyond federal law
- Oregon may limit self-distribution by production volume, geographic area, or entity type
- **Recommendation:** Obtain Oregon-specific legal opinion on self-distribution permissibility

**Risk if Non-Compliant:**
- Oregon license suspension/revocation
- Civil fines
- Forced transition to wholesale distribution model

### F. Proposed Alcohol Facts Labeling Rule (2025)

#### 1. Regulatory Status

**TTB Proposed Rule (January 17, 2025):**
- Requires **"Alcohol Facts" panel** on all alcohol beverage labels
- Must disclose: Per-serving alcohol content, calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat
- Similar to FDA Nutrition Facts panel

**Current Status:**
- **Proposed rule** (not yet finalized)
- Comment period likely 60-90 days
- Final rule expected: **Late 2025 or 2026**
- Effective date: Typically 12-24 months after final rule publication

**Source:** [Federal Register - Alcohol Facts Labeling](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-00957/alcohol-facts-statements-in-the-labeling-of-wines-distilled-spirits-and-malt-beverages)

#### 2. Impact on ASBC Acquisition

**If Rule Finalized:**
- **All 280 COLAs must be amended** to include Alcohol Facts panel
- Estimated cost: **$280K-560K** (same as initial COLA re-application burden)
- Timeline: 12-18 months to amend all COLAs
- **Total COLA burden (transfer + Alcohol Facts): $560K-1.12M**

**Mitigation:**
- Monitor Federal Register for final rule
- Plan for potential label redesign
- Negotiate **seller warranty** that current labels comply with all regulations in effect as of closing
