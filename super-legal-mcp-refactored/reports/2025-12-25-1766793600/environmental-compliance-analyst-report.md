## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This memorandum assesses environmental regulatory compliance for Artisan Spirits Brewing Company (ASBC), which operates **3 breweries** (Portland OR 350K barrels, Denver CO 100K barrels, Asheville NC 75K barrels), **1 distillery** (Portland OR 100K proof gallons), and **1 meadery** (Hood River OR 12K cases). The analysis examines compliance with the **Clean Water Act** (brewery wastewater pretreatment), **Clean Air Act** (boiler emissions), **RCRA** (hazardous waste), and **CERCLA** (successor liability for contamination).

**Overall Risk Assessment: MEDIUM** — No federal enforcement actions found in EPA ECHO database, but critical gaps identified in environmental due diligence (absence of Phase I Environmental Site Assessments) and documentation (distillery stillage disposal verification required).

### Key Findings

#### 1. Clean Water Act — Brewery Wastewater Pretreatment (MODERATE RISK)

All three ASBC breweries generate **high-strength wastewater** (BOD 1,200-2,000 mg/L, 4-10x higher than municipal wastewater) requiring industrial pretreatment permits before discharge to POTWs:

- **Portland Brewery (350,000 barrels/year):** Generates 5.7M gallons/year wastewater with 57,000-95,000 lbs/year BOD load. Regulated by Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) under federal pretreatment standards (40 CFR Part 403). Requires pH control (5.0-11.5 standard units), monitoring access structure, and pays extra-strength charges for high-BOD discharge. **Annual extra-strength charges estimated: $50,000-$150,000.**

- **Denver Brewery (100,000 barrels/year):** 1.6M gallons/year wastewater, 16,000-27,000 lbs/year BOD. Regulated by Metro Water Recovery (formerly Metro Wastewater Reclamation District) with EPA-approved pretreatment program. Individual permit likely required.

- **Asheville Brewery (75,000 barrels/year):** 1.2M gallons/year (~3,288 GPD). Regulated by Metropolitan Sewerage District of Buncombe County. Production volume **below 25,000 GPD threshold** for mandatory permit; may operate under general authorization or best management practices.

**No EPA ECHO enforcement records** found for ASBC facilities, suggesting compliance or absence of federal-level violations. However, pretreatment permit compliance must be verified through state/local POTW records (Portland BES, Metro Water Recovery, MSD Buncombe County).

**Due Diligence Action:** Request industrial pretreatment permits, self-monitoring reports (past 2 years showing BOD/TSS/pH test results), and compliance correspondence. Review Portland BES extra-strength charge invoices to quantify wastewater treatment costs.

**Penalty Exposure (if violations exist):** Clean Water Act § 309(d) authorizes civil penalties up to **$59,950 per day per violation** (2024-adjusted). Realistic first-time violation settlement: $10,000-$50,000 for minor BOD exceedances or pH violations with prompt corrective action.

#### 2. Distillery Stillage Disposal (HIGH RISK — Documentation Gap)

Portland distillery generates **530,000-795,000 gallons/year** of stillage (spent mash), a high-strength organic waste with BOD 30,000-60,000 mg/L (100-300x higher than brewery wastewater). Stillage **cannot be discharged to sewer** without prohibitively expensive multi-stage pretreatment (cost would exceed distillery operating margins).

**Oregon Agricultural Use Exclusion (OAR 340-093-0030):** Oregon DEQ exempts "industrial food processing wastes and spent brewery grains fed to livestock" from solid waste regulation when used in agricultural operations at **agronomic application rates** (nutrient uptake capacity of crops/livestock). Distillery stillage qualifies for beneficial reuse as livestock feed (high protein content 20-30% dry basis, valuable for dairy/beef cattle).

**Disposal Options Analysis:**

| Option | Regulatory Status | Annual Cost | Risk Level |
|--------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Beneficial reuse (livestock feed)** | No DEQ permit required (Agricultural Use Exclusion) | $26,500-$79,500 (transportation only) | **LOW** (if documented) |
| **Land application (fertilizer)** | DEQ permit may be required if exceeding agronomic rates | $97,500-$238,500 (permit + transportation + spreading) | **MODERATE** |
| **Waste hauler disposal** | Commercial disposal contract | $53,000-$238,500 (hauling + treatment) | **LOW** (compliant but expensive) |
| **On-site treatment (anaerobic digestion, evaporation)** | Capital intensive ($500K-$1.5M) | $50K-$150K/year operating | Not economical at 100K proof gallon scale |

**CRITICAL FINDING:** No documentation located regarding ASBC's current stillage disposal method. This represents a **material environmental compliance risk** — if ASBC is disposing stillage improperly (e.g., discharge to stormwater, unpermitted land dumping), Oregon DEQ enforcement could result in penalties and mandated remediation.

**Due Diligence Action (TIER 1 — PRE-CLOSING):** Request from ASBC:
1. Current stillage disposal contracts (beneficial reuse farms or waste haulers)
2. Transportation arrangements and volume records
3. Oregon DEQ correspondence regarding Agricultural Use Exclusion applicability
4. If land application: Nutrient management plans demonstrating agronomic rates

**Penalty Exposure:** Oregon DEQ solid waste violations: Administrative penalties up to $10,000/day. Federal Clean Water Act (if discharge to waters): $59,950/day.

#### 3. Clean Air Act — Boiler Emissions (LOW-MODERATE RISK)

All ASBC facilities operate **natural gas boilers** (10-50 MMBtu/hr capacity) for brewing/distilling steam. Natural gas is cleanest-burning fossil fuel with low criteria pollutant emissions.

**Emission Estimates (Typical 30 MMBtu/hr Boiler, 4,000 hrs/year):**
- NOx: 6.0 tons/year
- CO: 2.4 tons/year
- PM: 0.45 tons/year
- SO2: 0.036 tons/year
- VOC: 0.32 tons/year

**All criteria pollutants <100 tons/year** → Facilities are **NOT major sources** under Clean Air Act Title V.

**State Air Permit Requirements:**

- **Oregon (Portland brewery/distillery, Hood River meadery):** Eligible for Oregon DEQ **Basic Permit 04** for natural gas boilers 10-30 MMBtu/hr constructed after June 9, 1989. NSPS Subpart Dc (boiler standards) compliance required. **CRITICAL:** Portland facilities' combined CO2 emissions (~7,200 metric tons/year from boilers + process) likely **exceed 2,500 metric ton GHG reporting threshold** — verify annual GHG reports submitted to Oregon DEQ.

- **Colorado (Denver brewery):** Must file **Air Pollutant Emission Notice (APEN)** with CDPHE Air Pollution Control Division. Boilers subject to NESHAP Subpart JJJJJJ (Area Source Boiler Rule) — **initial notification required** to EPA CEDRI and Colorado APCD. New 2024 requirement: Modeling determination (Form APCD-114) for NOx/SO2/PM/CO emissions.

- **North Carolina (Asheville brewery):** **Local jurisdiction** — Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency issues permits (not NC DAQ). Small boiler (<20 MMBtu/hr for 75K barrel brewery) may be **permit-exempt** depending on local thresholds.

**Fermentation CO2:** Not regulated (biogenic source, not fossil fuel combustion). Portland brewery fermentation generates ~1,550 tons CO2/year; combined ASBC brewing ~2,100 tons/year fermentation CO2 — **not counted toward air quality permit thresholds**.

**Distillery Ethanol Vapors:** VOC emissions from distillation, barrel filling, barrel aging ("angel's share"). Estimated 6.6 tons/year VOC for Portland distillery (100K proof gallons) — **below 10 tons/year minor source threshold**, no VOC permit required.

**Due Diligence Action:** Request Oregon DEQ air permits, Colorado APEN filings, Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency permits, NESHAP initial notifications, and **Oregon GHG emission reports** (critical for Portland facilities).

**Penalty Exposure:** Clean Air Act § 113(b) authorizes civil penalties up to **$59,950 per day per violation** (2024-adjusted). Realistic settlement for late APEN/NESHAP notifications: $5,000-$25,000.

#### 4. RCRA Hazardous Waste Compliance (LOW-MODERATE RISK)

Brewery/distillery hazardous wastes include:
- Spent cleaning solvents (F001-F005: halogenated/non-halogenated solvents)
- Caustic/acid solutions (D002: corrosive, pH ≤2 or ≥12.5)
- Universal wastes (fluorescent bulbs, batteries, used oil)

**Generator Status Estimates:**

| Facility | Est. Hazardous Waste Generation | Generator Category | Regulatory Requirements |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Portland brewery/distillery** | 503 kg/month | **SQG** (Small Quantity Generator) | EPA ID required, manifests, 180-day accumulation limit, training |
| **Denver brewery** | 170 kg/month | **SQG** | Same as above |
| **Asheville brewery** | 80 kg/month | **VSQG** (Very Small Quantity Generator) | Simplified (no EPA ID, no manifests, 1,000 kg accumulation limit) |
| **Hood River meadery** | 10 kg/month | **VSQG** | Same as above |

**SQG Requirements (Portland, Denver):** EPA ID number from state agency, hazardous waste manifests for off-site shipment, personnel training (annual), contingency plan, weekly inspections, 180-day (or 270-day if >200 miles to TSDF) accumulation time limit, 6,000 kg on-site accumulation limit.

**Typical Disposal Costs:**
- Caustic/acid waste: $2-$5/gallon
- Spent solvents: $5-$15/gallon
- Universal wastes: $1-$3 per bulb/battery
- **Annual disposal (SQG): $10,000-$30,000**

**Due Diligence Action:** Request EPA ID numbers, hazardous waste manifests (past 3 years), training records, disposal contracts with licensed TSDFs, inspection logs.

**Penalty Exposure:** RCRA § 3008(g) authorizes civil penalties up to **$78,376 per day per violation** (2024-adjusted, 42 U.S.C. § 6928(g)). Realistic settlement for manifest violations: $10,000-$30,000.

#### 5. CERCLA Successor Liability (CRITICAL RISK — Phase I ESAs Missing)

**Most critical environmental risk identified:** No evidence that ASBC has conducted **Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs)** at any of its 5 facilities. Under CERCLA § 107(a)(1), current property owners are **strictly, jointly, and severally liable** for environmental contamination regardless of fault. Asset purchasers inherit this liability under **federal common law successor liability doctrine** applied by most federal circuits.

**Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser (BFPP) Defense (CERCLA § 107(r)):**
Acquirer can avoid CERCLA liability if:
1. **All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) conducted** — Phase I ESA per ASTM E1527-21 standard (effective Feb. 13, 2024)
2. Purchaser **not affiliated** with any potentially responsible party (PRP)
3. Appropriate care exercised, precautions taken against releases
4. Full cooperation with response actions, compliance with institutional controls

**WITHOUT PHASE I ESAs: BFPP DEFENSE UNAVAILABLE.** Acquirer assumes unlimited, joint and several liability for pre-existing contamination, including:
- Underground storage tank (UST) leaks (petroleum hydrocarbons)
- Historical solvent disposal (chlorinated solvents, VOCs)
- Metals contamination (lead, arsenic, chromium)
- Off-site disposal liability (Superfund contribution claims from other PRPs)

**Brewery/Distillery Contamination Concerns (Lower-Risk Profile):**
- Modern craft facilities (post-2000) have minimal contamination risk compared to heavy manufacturing
- Primary wastes are organic (spent grains, yeast, stillage) — non-hazardous
- Natural gas fuel (no fuel oil USTs)
- Smaller chemical inventories

**However:** Historical uses of property (pre-brewery/distillery), neighboring contamination, or legacy USTs could result in significant liability. **Phase I ESA is only method to identify these risks before acquisition.**

**Mandatory Pre-Closing Action:**
Commission **Phase I ESAs for all 5 ASBC facilities** (Portland brewery, Portland distillery, Denver brewery, Asheville brewery, Hood River meadery).

**Cost & Timeline:**
- Phase I ESA: $3,000-$6,000 per facility
- **Total Phase I budget: $15,000-$30,000 (5 facilities)**
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks per facility (can be conducted in parallel)
- **If RECs (Recognized Environmental Conditions) identified:** Phase II ESA required (soil/groundwater sampling, $10,000-$50,000 per site)

**Penalty/Liability Exposure:** CERCLA cleanup costs can range from $100,000 (minor petroleum release) to $10M+ (Superfund site). **Unlimited joint and several liability** for contamination — any PRP can be liable for entire cleanup cost. Phase I ESA investment ($15K-$30K) is de minimis compared to potential CERCLA exposure.

### Risk Quantification Summary

**Maximum Statutory Penalty Exposure (Worst-Case, Unlikely):**
- CWA pretreatment violations: $1,798,500 (30 days × $59,950/day)
- CAA air permit violations: $10,791,000 (180 days × $59,950/day)
- RCRA hazardous waste violations: $7,053,840 (90 days × $78,376/day)
- **Total maximum: $19,643,340**

**Realistic Penalty Exposure (First-Time Violations, Cooperation):**
- CWA pretreatment: $10,000-$50,000
- CAA air permits: $5,000-$25,000
- RCRA hazardous waste: $10,000-$30,000
- **Total realistic: $25,000-$105,000**

**Mitigation Factors:**
- No EPA ECHO enforcement actions (suggests current compliance)
- Craft beverage industry cooperative with regulators
- Economic benefit from non-compliance typically low

**CERCLA Liability Exposure:** Potentially unlimited (strict, joint and several liability). **Phase I ESAs mandatory to preserve BFPP defense.**

### Critical Pre-Closing Actions (Tier 1)

**These actions MUST be completed before closing to mitigate material environmental risks:**

1. **Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (All 5 Facilities)** — Cost: $15,000-$30,000; Timeline: 2-4 weeks (parallel). **Purpose:** Preserve BFPP defense, identify contamination liabilities. **Legal Standard:** ASTM E1527-21 (AAI requirement for CERCLA § 107(r) defense).

2. **Distillery Stillage Disposal Verification (Portland)** — Request disposal contracts, transportation records, Oregon DEQ correspondence. **Risk:** 530,000-795,000 gal/year waste with limited disposal options; improper disposal could trigger enforcement.

3. **Wastewater Pretreatment Permit Compliance Review (All Breweries)** — Request permits, self-monitoring reports (2 years), extra-strength charge invoices. **Risk:** BOD exceedances, pH violations expose acquirer to CWA penalties and ongoing compliance costs.

4. **Air Permit Status Verification (All Boiler Facilities)** — Request Oregon DEQ permits, Colorado APEN, North Carolina permits, NESHAP notifications, **Oregon GHG reports**. **Risk:** Missing permits/notifications trigger enforcement; GHG reporting non-compliance (Portland).

5. **RCRA Hazardous Waste Compliance Review (Portland, Denver SQG Facilities)** — Request EPA ID numbers, manifests (3 years), training records, disposal contracts. **Risk:** Manifest violations, missing EPA IDs expose acquirer to RCRA penalties.

### Annual Environmental Compliance Budget (Post-Acquisition)

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Wastewater extra-strength charges (Portland brewery): $50,000-$150,000/year
- Distillery stillage disposal (transportation): $26,500-$79,500/year
- Hazardous waste disposal (all facilities): $20,000-$50,000/year
- Air permit compliance (fees, testing, reporting): $10,000-$25,000/year
- Environmental audits/consulting: $30,000-$60,000/year
- **Total annual environmental compliance budget: $136,500-$364,500**

### Acquisition Structure Recommendations

**Asset Purchase (Recommended):**
- Advantage: Seller retains pre-closing environmental liabilities (state law)
- Caveat: CERCLA successor liability applies regardless (federal common law in most circuits)
- Mitigation: Phase I ESAs + BFPP compliance preserves defenses

**Indemnification/Escrow:**
- Environmental holdback: 10-20% of purchase price for 2-3 years
- Indemnification cap: Unlimited for environmental contamination (willful misrepresentation)
- Survival period: 5-10 years for environmental representations (contamination discovery latency)

**Environmental Liability Insurance:**
- Coverage: $5M-$20M for known and unknown contamination
- Cost: 3-7% of coverage limit annually ($150K-$1.4M for $5M-$20M policy)
- Recommended for acquisitions with identified Phase I RECs or absent Phase I ESAs

### Conclusion

ASBC's environmental compliance risk is **MEDIUM** — no federal enforcement history, but critical documentation gaps (Phase I ESAs, stillage disposal verification) create material risks. **The absence of Phase I ESAs is the most significant deficiency**, potentially exposing acquirer to unlimited CERCLA liability for pre-existing contamination.

**Immediate commissioning of Phase I ESAs for all 5 facilities** (cost: $15,000-$30,000; timeline: 2-4 weeks) is **mandatory** to preserve BFPP defense and enable informed acquisition decision. Distillery stillage disposal verification (Portland) is second-highest priority due to high waste volume and regulatory ambiguity.

With completion of Tier 1 due diligence actions and confirmation of operational compliance (wastewater permits, air permits, RCRA), environmental risk is manageable through standard acquisition protections (indemnification, escrow, seller warranties). Ongoing environmental compliance costs ($136,500-$364,500/year) should be incorporated into acquisition valuation and post-closing operating budget.

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed
1. **Clean Water Act Compliance:** Do ASBC's breweries have required industrial pretreatment permits for high-BOD wastewater discharge to POTWs?
2. **Distillery Waste Management:** How does ASBC dispose of stillage (530K-795K gallons/year) from distillery operations?
3. **Air Emissions Permits:** Are boilers, fermentation CO2, and distillery ethanol vapors properly permitted under Clean Air Act?
4. **RCRA Hazardous Waste:** What is ASBC's hazardous waste generator status and compliance record?
5. **Successor Liability:** What environmental contamination risks could transfer to acquirer under CERCLA?

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted
- EPA ECHO (Enforcement and Compliance History Online)
- EPA Facility Registry System (FRS)
- State environmental agencies: Oregon DEQ, Colorado APCD, North Carolina DAQ
- NPDES/Pretreatment permit databases
- Federal Register (air quality/water quality regulations)

### C. Limitations and Caveats
- Facility searches dependent on accurate company name registration in EPA databases
- Small craft breweries/distilleries may not be captured in federal databases if regulated solely at state/local level
- Industrial pretreatment permits often issued by local POTWs, not directly searchable in EPA ECHO
- Stillage disposal methods may not be documented in public databases

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. ASBC Operations Summary

| Facility | Location | Capacity | Wastewater Generation | BOD Load (est.) |
|----------|----------|----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Portland Brewery** | Portland, OR | 350,000 bbl/year | 5.7M gallons/year | 57,000-95,000 lbs/year |
| **Denver Brewery** | Denver, CO | 100,000 bbl/year | 1.6M gallons/year | 16,000-27,000 lbs/year |
| **Asheville Brewery** | Asheville, NC | 75,000 bbl/year | 1.2M gallons/year | 12,000-20,000 lbs/year |
| **Portland Distillery** | Portland, OR | 100,000 proof gal/year | 530K-795K gal stillage/year | Extremely high BOD (30K-60K mg/L) |
| **Hood River Meadery** | Hood River, OR | 12,000 cases/year | Minimal wastewater | Low environmental impact |

### B. Key Environmental Regulatory Concerns

#### 1. Brewery Wastewater Characteristics
Brewing generates high-strength wastewater from:
- **Mashing/lautering:** Grain residues, sugars (BOD 1,200-2,000 mg/L)
- **Fermentation vessel cleaning:** Yeast solids, residual beer
- **CIP (Clean-in-Place) systems:** Hot water, caustic solutions, acids
- **Packaging line wash:** Label adhesives, lubricants

Typical municipal wastewater: 200-300 mg/L BOD
Brewery wastewater: **1,200-2,000 mg/L BOD** (4-10x higher) → Requires pretreatment before discharge to POTW

#### 2. Distillery Stillage (Spent Mash)
- Volume: 10-15 gallons stillage per gallon spirits produced
- Portland distillery: 530,000-795,000 gallons/year
- **BOD: 30,000-60,000 mg/L** (100-300x higher than municipal wastewater)
- Cannot discharge to sewer without extensive (cost-prohibitive) treatment
- Disposal options: Livestock feed, land application, composting, waste hauler

#### 3. Air Emissions Sources
- **Boilers:** Natural gas combustion for brewing/distilling (NOx, CO, PM emissions)
- **Fermentation CO2:** Biogenic (not regulated under CAA)
- **Distillery ethanol vapors:** VOC emissions from distillation, barrel aging ("angel's share")

### C. DISTILLERY STILLAGE DISPOSAL

#### 1. Stillage Characteristics and Regulatory Status

**Portland Distillery Operations (100,000 proof gallons/year):**

**Stillage Generation:**
- Volume: 10-15 gallons stillage per gallon spirits produced
- Annual production: **530,000-795,000 gallons/year** stillage
- Characteristics:
  - BOD: 30,000-60,000 mg/L (100-300x higher than brewery wastewater)
  - High solids content (spent grains, yeast)
  - pH: 3.5-4.5 (acidic)
  - Temperature: 80-95°C when discharged from still

**Why Stillage Cannot Be Sewered:**
- BOD load would overwhelm POTW treatment capacity
- Example: 650,000 gallons stillage at 45,000 mg/L BOD = 244,000 lbs BOD/year
- Equivalent to wastewater from population of 11,000 people
- Would require extensive (cost-prohibitive) pretreatment: multi-stage anaerobic/aerobic digestion, evaporation

#### 2. Oregon Beneficial Reuse Regulations

**Agricultural Use Exclusion (OAR 340-093-0030):**

Oregon DEQ exempts "industrial food processing wastes and spent brewery grains fed to livestock" from solid waste regulation when:
- Materials used "on land in agricultural operations and the growing or harvesting of crops and the raising of fowls or animals"
- Application at or below **agronomic rates** (nutrient uptake capacity of crops/pasture)¹²

**Regulatory Coordination:**
- Oregon DEQ and Oregon Department of Agriculture signed Memorandum of Understanding (May 2017) for coordinating agricultural material use oversight¹³
- No solid waste permit required for qualifying beneficial reuse
- No volumetric caps specified in regulations

**Applicability to Distillery Stillage:**
- Stillage not explicitly named in Agricultural Use Exclusion (unlike "spent brewery grains")
- High organic content (protein, minerals) valuable for livestock nutrition
- Industry practice: Distillery stillage widely used as cattle feed supplement (dairy and beef operations)

#### 3. Disposal/Beneficial Reuse Options

**Option A: Livestock Feed (Recommended for Cost and Compliance):**

**Advantages:**
- **No disposal cost** (farmers typically accept free or pay nominal fee)
- Qualifies for Oregon Agricultural Use Exclusion (no DEQ permit)
- Stillage contains 20-30% protein (dry basis), valuable for dairy cattle
- Reduces farmer feed costs ($0.10-$0.15/gallon equivalent feed value)

**Requirements:**
- Farm must have adequate land for agronomic application (nutrient management)
- Transportation logistics: Tanker truck delivery 2-3x per week
- Storage at farm: Concrete bunker or lagoon (stillage ferments/degrades if stored >5 days)

**Estimated Costs:**
- Transportation: $0.05-$0.10/gallon (100 miles radius) = $26,500-$79,500/year
- No disposal fee (beneficial reuse)

**Option B: Land Application (Agricultural Fertilizer):**

**Regulatory Requirements:**
- Oregon DEQ Land Application Permit may be required (depends on application rate, site characteristics)
- Agronomic rates: Typically 5,000-15,000 gallons/acre/year (based on nitrogen loading)
- For 650,000 gallons: Requires 43-130 acres application area

**Costs:**
- Permit: $5,000-$10,000 initial, $2,000-$5,000 annual
- Transportation + spreading: $0.15-$0.30/gallon = $97,500-$238,500/year

**Option C: Waste Hauler (Least Preferred — Expensive):**

**Process:**
- Contract liquid waste hauler to pump and transport stillage to wastewater treatment facility or composting operation

**Costs:**
- Typical rates: $0.10-$0.30/gallon including hauling and disposal
- Annual cost: $53,000-$238,500 for 530,000-795,000 gallons

**Option D: On-Site Treatment (Capital Intensive):**

**Technologies:**
- Anaerobic digestion with biogas recovery: $500K-$1.5M capital, $50K-$100K annual operating
- Evaporation system: $300K-$800K capital, high energy costs ($80K-$150K/year natural gas/electricity)

**Payback:**
- Biogas energy recovery: 15-25 years (not economical at 100K proof gallon scale)
- Only viable for distilleries >500,000 proof gallons/year

#### 4. Due Diligence Recommendations for Stillage Management

**Documentation to Request from ASBC:**
1. Current stillage disposal contracts (if any)
2. Transportation arrangements (hauler agreements)
3. Receiving farm locations and nutrient management plans (if land application)
4. Oregon DEQ correspondence regarding Agricultural Use Exclusion applicability
5. Cost records: Disposal fees, transportation, handling

**Risk Assessment:**
- **LOW RISK** if current disposal is beneficial reuse to farms (complies with Agricultural Use Exclusion)
- **MODERATE RISK** if land application without permit or exceeding agronomic rates (potential DEQ enforcement)
- **HIGH RISK** if illegal disposal (discharge to stormwater, unpermitted land dumping)

### D. CLEAN AIR ACT COMPLIANCE — BOILER AND PROCESS EMISSIONS

#### 1. Regulatory Framework

**Federal Clean Air Act:**
- Title V Operating Permits: Major sources ≥100 tons/year any criteria pollutant (42 U.S.C. § 7661a)
- New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) Subpart Dc: Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units (40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Dc)
- National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) Subpart JJJJJJ: Area Source Boilers (40 CFR Part 63, Subpart JJJJJJ)

**State Implementation:**
- Oregon: Oregon DEQ Air Contaminant Discharge Permits (ACDP)
- Colorado: CDPHE Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) Air Pollutant Emission Notices (APEN)
- North Carolina: NC DAQ Air Quality Permits (Asheville-Buncombe County Air Quality Agency for Buncombe County)

#### 2. Boiler Emissions Analysis — All Facilities

**Typical Brewery/Distillery Boiler Specifications:**
- Fuel: Natural gas (cleanest burning fossil fuel)
- Capacity: 10-50 MMBtu/hr heat input (million BTU per hour)
- Usage: Steam for brewing kettles, mash tuns, distillation stills, CIP hot water, space heating
- Operating schedule: 12-16 hours/day, 250-300 days/year

**Emission Estimates (Natural Gas Boiler, 30 MMBtu/hr, 4,000 hours/year):**

| Pollutant | Emission Factor (lb/MMBtu) | Annual Emissions (tons/year) |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| NOx (nitrogen oxides) | 0.1 | 6.0 |
| CO (carbon monoxide) | 0.04 | 2.4 |
| PM (particulate matter) | 0.0075 | 0.45 |
| SO2 (sulfur dioxide) | 0.0006 | 0.036 |
| VOC (volatile organics) | 0.0054 | 0.32 |

**Conclusion:** Brewery/distillery boilers at ASBC scale are **NOT major sources** under Title V (all criteria pollutants <100 tons/year).

#### 3. State Air Permit Requirements

**Oregon (Portland Brewery/Distillery, Hood River Meadery):**

**Oregon DEQ Basic Permit 04:**
- Natural gas boilers 10-30 MMBtu/hr heat input constructed after June 9, 1989 eligible for Basic Permit¹⁴
- NSPS Subpart Dc compliance required (fuel analysis, NOx emission limits)
- Basic Permit costs less and processes faster than source-specific permit
- **Greenhouse Gas Reporting:** Required if facility emits ≥2,500 metric tons CO2e/year¹⁵

**Estimated Portland Facility Emissions:**
- Brewery boiler (40 MMBtu/hr) + Distillery boiler (20 MMBtu/hr) = 60 MMBtu/hr combined
- Annual CO2: ~7,200 metric tons/year → **GHG reporting required**

**Colorado (Denver Brewery):**

**CDPHE Air Pollutant Emission Notice (APEN):**
- All businesses emitting air pollution must submit APEN (Form APCD-100)¹⁶
- Boilers subject to NESHAP JJJJJJ (Area Source Boiler Rule): Initial notification required to EPA CEDRI and Colorado APCD¹⁷
- **New requirement (2024):** Sources with NOx, SO2, PM, or CO emissions must include modeling determination (Form APCD-114)¹⁸

**Permit Likelihood:** Denver brewery (100,000 bbls) with ~20 MMBtu/hr boiler → **APEN required**, general permit or registration

**North Carolina (Asheville Brewery):**

**Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency Jurisdiction:**
- Buncombe County has **local air program** separate from NC DAQ¹⁹
- Air permits for Asheville facilities issued by Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency, not state DAQ
- Small boilers (<10 MMBtu/hr or natural gas <50 MMBtu/hr) may be exempt from permitting

**Asheville Brewery (75,000 bbls):** Small-scale operation likely has boiler <20 MMBtu/hr → **May be permit-exempt**, but must verify with local agency

#### 4. Fermentation CO2 Emissions (Not Regulated)

**Biological CO2 from Fermentation:**
- Yeast converts sugars to ethanol + CO2: C6H12O6 → 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2
- Portland brewery (350,000 bbls): ~1,550 tons CO2/year from fermentation
- Combined ASBC brewing operations: ~2,100 tons CO2/year fermentation

**Regulatory Status:**
- Fermentation CO2 is **biogenic** (not fossil fuel combustion)
- **Not regulated** under Clean Air Act Title V or state air quality programs
- **Not counted** toward GHG reporting thresholds (only combustion/process CO2 counted)

#### 5. Distillery Ethanol Vapor Emissions

**Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Sources:**
- Distillation process: Ethanol vapors from still condensers
- Barrel filling operations: Evaporative losses during transfer
- Barrel aging: "Angel's share" (2-4% volume loss/year from evaporation through barrel staves)

**Emission Estimate (Portland Distillery, 100,000 proof gallons/year):**
- Production losses: 2% of production = 2,000 proof gallons ethanol vapor
- Ethanol vapor: 2,000 gallons × 6.6 lbs/gallon = 13,200 lbs = **6.6 tons/year VOC**

**Regulatory Threshold:**
- Minor source VOC threshold: 10 tons/year (varies by state attainment status)
- Portland distillery: **6.6 tons/year VOC → Below permit threshold ✓**

**Control Technologies (if permit required):**
- Thermal oxidizers (burn ethanol vapors)
- Refrigerated condensers (capture ethanol vapors, recover product)
- Carbon adsorption (activated carbon filters)

### E. RCRA HAZARDOUS WASTE COMPLIANCE

#### 1. Regulatory Framework

**Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA):**
- Subtitle C: Hazardous waste management (42 U.S.C. § 6921-6939)
- Generator categories: VSQG, SQG, LQG based on monthly generation (40 CFR Part 262)
- Hazardous waste identification: Listed wastes (F, K, P, U) and characteristic wastes (D001-D043)

#### 2. Brewery/Distillery Hazardous Waste Streams

**Typical Waste Types:**

| Waste Stream | RCRA Classification | Typical Volume | Generator Impact |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Spent cleaning solvents | F001-F005 (halogenated/non-halogenated solvents) | 10-50 gallons/month | Potential SQG |
| Caustic/acid solutions | D002 (corrosive, pH ≤2 or ≥12.5) | 50-200 gallons/month | Potential SQG |
| Spent lubricating oils | D018 (benzene), may be non-hazardous used oil | 20-50 gallons/month | Universal waste |
| Fluorescent bulbs | Universal waste (mercury) | 50-100 bulbs/month | Universal waste |
| Batteries | Universal waste (lead-acid) | 10-20 batteries/year | Universal waste |

**Non-Hazardous Brewery/Distillery Wastes:**
- Spent grains (animal feed, composting)
- Spent yeast (animal feed, yeast extract production)
- Diatomaceous earth filter media (landfill)
- Cardboard, glass, plastic packaging (recycling)

#### 3. Generator Category Analysis

**Hazardous Waste Generation Estimate (Portland Brewery/Distillery):**
- Cleaning solvents: 30 gallons/month × 7 lbs/gallon = 210 lbs = **95 kg/month**
- Caustic/acid waste: 100 gallons/month × 9 lbs/gallon = 900 lbs = **408 kg/month**
- **Total: 503 kg/month → Small Quantity Generator (SQG)**

**SQG Requirements (100-1,000 kg/month):**²⁰
- EPA ID number required (obtained from state environmental agency)
- Hazardous waste manifests for off-site shipment
- Accumulation time limit: 180 days (or 270 days if disposal facility >200 miles)
- Accumulation quantity limit: 6,000 kg on-site at any time
- Personnel training: Annual hazardous waste training for handlers
- Contingency plan: Emergency procedures for spills
- Biennial report: **Not required for SQG** (only LQGs submit biennial reports)

**VSQG Status (Most Likely for Smaller Breweries):**
- Denver brewery (100,000 bbls): ~170 kg/month → **Likely SQG**
- Asheville brewery (75,000 bbls): ~80 kg/month → **Likely VSQG**
- Hood River meadery (12,000 cases): ~10 kg/month → **VSQG**

**VSQG Requirements (<100 kg/month):**²¹
- No EPA ID number required
- No manifests required (basic waste tracking only)
- Accumulation limit: 1,000 kg on-site
- Simplified compliance (minimal training, no contingency plan)

#### 4. Compliance Verification and Due Diligence

**Documentation to Request from ASBC:**
1. **EPA ID numbers** for each facility (indicates SQG or LQG status)
2. **Hazardous waste manifests** (past 3 years) showing waste types, quantities, disposal facilities
3. **Personnel training records** (annual hazardous waste handler training)
4. **Waste accumulation logs** (on-site storage quantities and dates)
5. **Disposal contracts** with licensed hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs)
6. **Inspection records** (weekly SQG inspections, or state inspection reports)

**Typical Disposal Costs:**

### F. CERCLA SUCCESSOR LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SITE ASSESSMENTS

#### 1. CERCLA Successor Liability Doctrine

**Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. § 9607):**

**Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) Categories:**
- Current owners and operators (§ 9607(a)(1))
- Past owners/operators at time of disposal (§ 9607(a)(2))
- Arrangers for disposal (§ 9607(a)(3))
- Transporters (§ 9607(a)(4))

**Liability Characteristics:**
- **Strict liability:** No proof of negligence required
- **Joint and several liability:** Any PRP can be liable for entire cleanup cost
- **Retroactive liability:** Applies to contamination predating CERCLA enactment (1980)

**Successor Liability in Asset Acquisitions:**

Most federal circuits apply **federal common law** for successor liability under CERCLA, holding that buyers inherit liability despite state corporate law protections.²³ Key principle: CERCLA's remedial purposes override state laws that allow liability avoidance through mergers or asset sales.

**Exceptions (Defenses to CERCLA Liability):**

**Innocent Landowner Defense (§ 9607(b)(3)):**
- Contamination caused solely by third party (not employee/agent)
- Defendant exercised due care
- Defendant took precautions against foreseeable acts
- **Requires "all appropriate inquiry" (AAI) at time of acquisition**

**Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser (BFPP) Defense (§ 9607(r)):**²⁴
- All disposal occurred **before acquisition**
- Purchaser conducted **All Appropriate Inquiries** (Phase I ESA per ASTM E1527-21 standard, effective Feb. 13, 2024)
- Purchaser not **affiliated** with any PRP (no familial, commercial, or financial relationship)
- Purchaser exercises appropriate care and takes precautions against release
- Provides full cooperation with response actions
- Complies with land use restrictions and institutional controls

#### 2. Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) Requirements

**ASTM E1527-21 Standard (Current as of 2024):**²⁵

Phase I ESA components:
1. **Records review:** Federal, state, tribal, local environmental databases
   - EPA CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL/Superfund sites)
   - RCRA Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facilities (TSDFs)
   - RCRA Corrective Action sites (CORRACTS)
   - Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUST)
   - Voluntary cleanup/brownfields sites
   - Historical uses (Sanborn fire insurance maps, aerial photographs, city directories)

2. **Site reconnaissance:** Physical inspection for:
   - Underground/aboveground storage tanks (USTs/ASTs)
   - Stained soil, stressed vegetation
   - Drums, containers of chemicals/waste
   - Electrical transformers (potential PCBs)
   - Asbestos-containing materials
   - Lead-based paint

3. **Interviews:** Current owner, facility manager, neighbors, local officials

4. **Report:** Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) identified, recommendations for Phase II

**Phase II ESA (If RECs Identified):**
- Soil sampling (VOCs, TPH, metals)
- Groundwater sampling (monitoring wells)
- Soil vapor sampling (if VOC contamination suspected)
- Laboratory analysis, risk assessment

#### 3. Brewery/Distillery-Specific Environmental Concerns

**Common Contamination Issues at Beverage Production Facilities:**

| Contaminant Source | Pollutants of Concern | Phase II Sampling Focus |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Underground storage tanks (heating oil, gasoline) | Petroleum hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes — BTEX) | Soil borings near former/current UST locations |
| Solvent storage/disposal | Chlorinated solvents (TCE, PCE), acetone, methanol | Soil/groundwater downgradient of storage areas |
| Equipment maintenance (degreasers) | Petroleum hydrocarbons, VOCs | Floor drains, maintenance shop areas |
| Historical waste disposal | Metals, solvents, spent process chemicals | Former disposal areas, fill material |
| Refrigeration equipment (pre-1980s) | Freon, ammonia | Equipment rooms, soil beneath compressors |

**Lower-Risk Profile for Craft Breweries/Distilleries:**
- Modern facilities (post-2000) typically have minimal contamination risk
- Primary wastes are organic (spent grains, yeast) — non-hazardous
- Smaller chemical inventories than heavy manufacturing
- Natural gas fuel (no fuel oil USTs)

#### 4. Due Diligence Recommendations

**Required for All 5 ASBC Facilities:**
1. **Phase I ESAs** for Portland brewery, Portland distillery, Denver brewery, Asheville brewery, Hood River meadery
2. **Review historical operations** (facility age, prior uses of property, UST history)
3. **Phase II ESAs if any RECs identified** in Phase I reports

**Cost Estimates:**
- Phase I ESA: $3,000-$6,000 per facility
- Phase II ESA (if needed): $10,000-$50,000 depending on scope
- **Total Phase I budget: $15,000-$30,000 for 5 facilities**

**Timeline:**
- Phase I ESA: 2-4 weeks per facility
- Phase II ESA: 4-8 weeks (sampling, lab analysis, report)

**CERCLA Affiliation Risk:**
- Acquirer must not be **affiliated** with ASBC or any PRP at contaminated sites
- Review ASBC ownership structure, parent companies, shared management
- If affiliation exists: BFPP defense unavailable, full CERCLA liability attaches

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Environmental Compliance Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Facilities Affected | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Wastewater pretreatment permit violations** (BOD exceedances, pH violations) | Medium-High | Moderate | Portland, Denver (high-volume facilities) | Verify permit compliance records, inspect pretreatment systems, review self-monitoring reports |
| **Distillery stillage disposal** (lack of documentation, unpermitted land application) | High | Low-Moderate | Portland distillery | Request stillage disposal contracts, verify Agricultural Use Exclusion compliance |
| **Air permit non-compliance** (missing permits, NESHAP notifications) | Medium | Low | All facilities with boilers | Verify air permit status with OR DEQ, CO APCD, Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency |
| **RCRA hazardous waste violations** (missing EPA ID, improper manifests) | Medium | Low-Moderate | Portland, Denver (SQG facilities) | Review EPA ID numbers, hazardous waste manifests, disposal contracts |
| **Successor liability for pre-existing contamination** | High | Unknown | All facilities (pending Phase I ESAs) | Conduct Phase I ESAs immediately; Phase II if RECs identified |
| **Lack of Phase I ESAs** (loss of BFPP defense) | **CRITICAL** | High | **All 5 facilities** | **Mandatory: Conduct Phase I ESAs before closing to preserve CERCLA defenses** |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Immediate Investigation

1. **Portland Distillery Stillage Disposal:** 530,000-795,000 gallons/year of high-BOD stillage requires documented disposal method. **Action:** Request contracts with farmers, waste haulers, or proof of Agricultural Use Exclusion compliance.

2. **Oregon GHG Reporting:** Portland brewery/distillery combined CO2 emissions (~7,200 metric tons/year) likely exceed 2,500 metric ton reporting threshold. **Action:** Verify GHG reports submitted to Oregon DEQ.

3. **Colorado APEN/Air Permit:** Denver brewery must have filed Air Pollutant Emission Notice (APEN) with CDPHE. **Action:** Obtain APEN documentation and any air permits or registrations.

4. **Portland Brewery BOD Extra-Strength Charges:** 5.7M gallons/year wastewater at 1,200-2,000 mg/L BOD generates significant surcharges. **Action:** Review past 2 years of Portland BES invoices for extra-strength charges (may indicate financial burden or past violations).

5. **Phase I ESAs:** No evidence of environmental site assessments at any facility. **Action:** Commission Phase I ESAs immediately to preserve BFPP defense and identify contamination liabilities.

### C. Quantified Penalty Exposure

**Maximum Civil Penalty Scenarios (Unlikely but Worst-Case):**

| Violation Type | Statutory Maximum (2024) | Exposure Period | Maximum Penalty |
|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| CWA pretreatment violation (BOD exceedance) | $59,950/day | 30 days typical notice/cure | $1,798,500 |
| CAA air permit violation (unpermitted source) | $59,950/day | 180 days (6 months operation) | $10,791,000 |
| RCRA hazardous waste (missing EPA ID, improper manifesting) | $78,376/day | 90 days typical enforcement | $7,053,840 |
| **Combined Maximum Exposure** | — | — | **$19,643,340** |

**Realistic Penalty Scenario (First-Time Violations, Good Faith Cooperation):**
- CWA pretreatment: $10,000-$50,000 settlement (minor exceedances, prompt corrective action)
- CAA air permit: $5,000-$25,000 (late APEN filing, NESHAP notification)
- RCRA hazardous waste: $10,000-$30,000 (missing manifests, corrected upon notice)
- **Total Realistic Exposure: $25,000-$105,000**

**Mitigation Factors:**
- No enforcement actions in EPA ECHO (suggests current compliance or low visibility)
- Craft beverage industry typically cooperative with regulators
- Economic benefit calculation (savings from non-compliance) likely low

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Findings

**1. Clean Water Act Compliance (Brewery Wastewater Pretreatment):**
- All three breweries discharge to POTWs and require industrial pretreatment permits or alternative discharge control mechanisms
- Portland BES, Metro Water Recovery (Denver), and MSD Buncombe County (Asheville) have EPA-approved pretreatment programs
- **Portland brewery** (5.7M gal/year wastewater): Industrial permit required, extra-strength BOD charges apply
- **Denver brewery** (1.6M gal/year): Individual permit likely required
- **Asheville brewery** (1.2M gal/year, ~3,288 GPD): Likely below 25,000 GPD permit threshold, may operate under general authorization
- **No EPA ECHO enforcement records found** for ASBC facilities (indicates compliance or minimal federal enforcement activity)

**2. Distillery Stillage Disposal (Critical Issue):**
- Portland distillery generates **530,000-795,000 gallons/year** stillage with extreme BOD (30,000-60,000 mg/L)
- Cannot discharge to sewer without prohibitively expensive pretreatment
- Oregon Agricultural Use Exclusion (OAR 340-093-0030) allows beneficial reuse as livestock feed **without solid waste permit** if applied at agronomic rates
- **Recommended disposal:** Beneficial reuse contracts with dairy/beef farms (low-cost: $26,500-$79,500/year transportation)
- **Alternative:** Waste hauler disposal ($53,000-$238,500/year, less desirable)
- **Due diligence action:** Request documentation of current stillage disposal method and contracts

**3. Clean Air Act Compliance (Boiler Emissions):**
- All facilities operate natural gas boilers for brewing/distilling steam
- **Emissions below Title V major source thresholds** (all criteria pollutants <100 tons/year)
- **Oregon facilities:** Eligible for Oregon DEQ Basic Permit 04 (boilers 10-30 MMBtu/hr)
- **Portland GHG reporting:** Combined brewery/distillery CO2 emissions (~7,200 metric tons/year) **exceed 2,500 metric ton reporting threshold** — verify compliance
- **Colorado (Denver):** APEN filing required, NESHAP JJJJJJ (Boiler Rule) initial notification required
- **North Carolina (Asheville):** Local air quality agency jurisdiction (Asheville-Buncombe), small boiler may be permit-exempt
- **Fermentation CO2:** Not regulated (biogenic source)
- **Distillery ethanol vapors:** 6.6 tons/year VOC, **below 10 tons/year permit threshold**

**4. RCRA Hazardous Waste Compliance:**
- **Portland brewery/distillery:** Estimated 503 kg/month hazardous waste → **Small Quantity Generator (SQG)**
- **Denver brewery:** ~170 kg/month → **Likely SQG**
- **Asheville brewery:** ~80 kg/month → **Likely VSQG** (Very Small Quantity Generator)
- **Hood River meadery:** ~10 kg/month → **VSQG**
- SQG facilities require EPA ID numbers, hazardous waste manifests, 180-day accumulation limit, personnel training
- VSQG facilities have simplified compliance (no EPA ID, no manifests, 1,000 kg accumulation limit)
- **Due diligence action:** Obtain EPA ID numbers, review hazardous waste manifests for past 3 years, verify disposal contracts with licensed TSDFs

**5. CERCLA Successor Liability (Critical Issue):**
- Asset purchaser inherits environmental contamination liability under federal common law successor liability doctrine
- **Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser (BFPP) defense** requires:
  - Phase I Environmental Site Assessment per ASTM E1527-21 standard (AAI requirement)
  - No affiliation with any potentially responsible party (PRP)
  - Appropriate care and precautions against releases
- **Without Phase I ESAs: BFPP defense unavailable, acquirer assumes strict, joint and several liability** for pre-existing contamination
- **Mandatory action:** Commission Phase I ESAs for all 5 facilities ($15,000-$30,000 total cost) **before closing**
- Phase II ESAs required if Phase I identifies Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs)

### B. Overall Risk Assessment

**Environmental Compliance Risk Level: MEDIUM**

**Rationale:**
- No federal enforcement actions in EPA ECHO database (positive indicator)
- Brewing/distilling operations have relatively low environmental risk profile compared to heavy manufacturing
- Primary wastes are organic (spent grains, yeast, stillage) with established beneficial reuse markets
- Natural gas fuel eliminates underground storage tank contamination risks
- Modern craft beverage facilities (post-2000) typically have good environmental controls

**Elevated Risks:**
1. **Distillery stillage disposal documentation gap** (high-volume waste stream requiring verification)
2. **Phase I ESAs not conducted** (loss of BFPP defense, potential hidden contamination liabilities)
3. **Greenhouse gas reporting threshold** (Portland facilities may be out of compliance if not reporting)

### C. Recommended Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing Due Diligence)

**TIER 1 — CRITICAL (Complete Before Closing):**

1. **Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (All 5 Facilities)**
   - **Purpose:** Preserve BFPP defense under CERCLA § 107(r), identify contamination liabilities
   - **Standard:** ASTM E1527-21 (AAI requirement for BFPP)
   - **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks per facility (can be conducted in parallel)
   - **Cost:** $15,000-$30,000 total (5 facilities × $3,000-$6,000)
   - **Deliverable:** Phase I ESA reports identifying RECs, recommendations for Phase II sampling

2. **Distillery Stillage Disposal Verification (Portland Distillery)**
   - **Request from ASBC:**
     - Current disposal contracts (beneficial reuse farms, waste haulers, or land application)
     - Transportation arrangements and costs
     - Oregon DEQ correspondence regarding Agricultural Use Exclusion
     - Volume records (gallons/month, destination)
   - **Risk:** High-volume waste (530K-795K gal/year) with limited disposal options; improper disposal could result in DEQ enforcement
   - **Mitigation:** Verify compliance with Agricultural Use Exclusion or obtain DEQ permits if land application exceeds agronomic rates

3. **Wastewater Pretreatment Permit Compliance Review**
   - **Request from ASBC:**
     - Industrial pretreatment permits for Portland, Denver, Asheville breweries
     - Self-monitoring reports (past 2 years): BOD, TSS, pH test results
     - Compliance correspondence with POTWs (Portland BES, Metro Water Recovery, MSD Buncombe County)
     - Extra-strength charge invoices (Portland brewery — indicates BOD loading and costs)
   - **Red flags:** Missing permits, repeated BOD exceedances, pH violations, enforcement notices
   - **Cost exposure:** $59,950/day CWA penalties (realistic settlement $10K-$50K for first-time violations)

**TIER 2 — HIGH PRIORITY (Complete Within 30 Days of Closing):**

4. **Air Permit Status Verification (All Boiler-Equipped Facilities)**
   - **Request from ASBC:**
     - Oregon DEQ air permits (Portland brewery/distillery, Hood River meadery)
     - Colorado APCD APEN filings and air permits (Denver brewery)
     - Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency permits (Asheville brewery)
     - NESHAP Subpart JJJJJJ (Boiler Rule) initial notifications
     - Greenhouse gas emission reports (Portland facilities if >2,500 metric tons CO2/year)
   - **Action if missing:** File APEN or permit applications immediately, submit late NESHAP notifications (with explanation for delay)
   - **Cost exposure:** $59,950/day CAA penalties (realistic settlement $5K-$25K for late notifications)

5. **RCRA Hazardous Waste Compliance Review**
   - **Request from ASBC:**
     - EPA ID numbers (SQG facilities: Portland, Denver)
     - Hazardous waste manifests (past 3 years)
     - Personnel training records (annual hazardous waste handler training)
     - Disposal contracts with licensed TSDFs
     - Weekly inspection logs (SQG requirement)
   - **Red flags:** Missing EPA IDs, incomplete manifests, expired disposal contracts, use of unlicensed haulers
   - **Cost exposure:** $78,376/day RCRA penalties (realistic settlement $10K-$30K for manifest violations)

**TIER 3 — MODERATE PRIORITY (Complete Within 90 Days of Closing):**

6. **Underground Storage Tank (UST) Investigation**
   - **Action:** Review Phase I ESA reports for current or historical USTs
   - **If USTs present:** Verify registration with state fire marshal, leak detection systems, financial assurance, closure documentation (if removed)
   - **If historical USTs:** Conduct Phase II soil sampling near former tank locations (petroleum hydrocarbon contamination risk)

7. **Stormwater Permit Verification (If Applicable)**
   - **Industrial facilities:** May require Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP) for stormwater discharge if >1 acre disturbed land
   - **Request:** Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans (SWPPP), MSGP coverage documentation
   - **Brewery/distillery stormwater concerns:** Loading dock runoff, tank farm secondary containment, vehicle washing areas

### D. Long-Term Compliance Recommendations (Post-Acquisition)

**Operational Improvements:**
1. **Brewery wastewater pretreatment optimization:**
   - Install or upgrade anaerobic digestion systems (reduce BOD 70-90%, generate biogas for energy recovery)
   - Implement water conservation (reduce wastewater volume and extra-strength charges)
   - Quarterly pretreatment system inspections

2. **Distillery stillage management:**
   - Formalize beneficial reuse contracts with farms (document agronomic rates, nutrient management)
   - Consider stillage evaporation/concentration (reduce transportation costs)
   - Explore value-added markets: Distiller's grains for human consumption (protein supplements), biogas production

3. **Centralized environmental compliance management:**
   - Designated Environmental Compliance Manager for ASBC operations
   - Annual environmental audits (third-party consultant)
   - Compliance calendar (permit renewals, reporting deadlines, training schedules)
   - Environmental management system (ISO 14001 or equivalent)

**Budget Allocations (Annual):**
- Wastewater extra-strength charges (Portland): $50,000-$150,000/year (BOD-dependent)
- Hazardous waste disposal (all facilities): $20,000-$50,000/year
- Air permit compliance (permit fees, testing, reporting): $10,000-$25,000/year
- Environmental audits and consulting: $30,000-$60,000/year
- **Total environmental compliance budget: $110,000-$285,000/year**

### E. Acquisition Structure Considerations

**Asset Purchase vs. Stock Acquisition:**

**Asset Purchase (Recommended for Environmental Risk Mitigation):**
- **Advantage:** Seller retains pre-closing environmental liabilities (not automatic successor liability)
- **Caveat:** CERCLA successor liability applies under federal common law regardless of transaction structure in most circuits
- **Mitigation:** Phase I ESAs + BFPP compliance preserves defenses even in asset purchase
- **Seller representation:** Require warranty that no environmental liabilities exist, backed by escrow or indemnification

**Stock Acquisition:**
- **Disadvantage:** Buyer inherits all corporate liabilities including environmental
- **Mitigation:** Same as asset purchase (Phase I ESAs mandatory), plus more extensive seller representations/warranties
- **Insurance:** Environmental liability insurance (ELI) policy covering known and unknown contamination ($5M-$20M coverage typical)

**Escrow/Indemnification:**
- **Holdback amount:** 10-20% of purchase price for 2-3 years (covers environmental claims)
- **Indemnification cap:** Negotiate seller indemnification for pre-closing environmental conditions (unlimited for willful misrepresentation)
- **Survival period:** Environmental representations should survive 5-10 years (contamination discovery latency)

### F. Outstanding Questions for ASBC Management

1. Has ASBC conducted any environmental site assessments (Phase I or II) at any facility? If so, provide reports.
2. What is the current disposal method for distillery stillage? Provide contracts with receiving farms or waste haulers.
3. Has ASBC received any environmental enforcement notices, warning letters, or penalties from EPA, state agencies, or local agencies in past 5 years?
4. Are there any ongoing environmental investigations, remediation projects, or contamination claims at any facility?
5. Does Portland brewery/distillery submit annual greenhouse gas emission reports to Oregon DEQ?
6. Have any facilities undergone expansion or process changes triggering new permit requirements in past 3 years?
7. Are there any underground storage tanks (current or historical) at any facility? If removed, provide closure documentation.
8. Does ASBC maintain environmental liability insurance? If so, provide policy details (coverage, limits, exclusions).
9. Have any adjacent properties reported contamination complaints potentially related to ASBC operations (odors, wastewater, soil/groundwater)?
10. What is ASBC's annual environmental compliance budget (permits, disposal, monitoring, testing)?

## X. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)
✓ All relevant regulatory frameworks researched (CWA, CAA, RCRA, CERCLA)
✓ State-specific requirements identified for Oregon, Colorado, North Carolina
✓ Multiple search strategies employed (EPA ECHO, state agencies, local POTWs)
✓ Cross-referenced federal and state/local regulations
✓ Industry-specific guidance obtained (craft beverage regulations)
✓ Identified gaps clearly documented (ASBC-specific permits not publicly available)

### Confidence Levels
| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **CWA pretreatment permit requirements** | **High** | Federal regulations (40 CFR Part 403) and state/local POTW programs confirmed through official agency websites |
| **Distillery stillage disposal (Agricultural Use Exclusion)** | **High** | Oregon DEQ regulations (OAR 340-093-0030) directly accessed, industry practice confirmed |
| **Air emissions below Title V thresholds** | **High** | EPA emission factors for natural gas boilers, standard brewery/distillery boiler capacities |
| **RCRA generator status estimates** | **Medium** | Estimated based on typical brewery/distillery chemical usage; actual status requires facility-specific data |
| **ASBC-specific compliance status** | **Low** | No facility-specific permits or enforcement records located in public databases; requires company documentation |
| **Phase I ESA necessity** | **High** | CERCLA BFPP defense requirements under § 107(r), ASTM E1527-21 standard confirmed |

### Known Limitations
1. **ASBC-specific permits not publicly searchable:** Industrial pretreatment permits, air permits, and EPA ID numbers issued to specific companies are not accessible through online databases. Compliance status must be verified through direct requests to ASBC and regulatory agencies.

2. **EPA ECHO database limitations:** Small craft breweries/distilleries often do not appear in EPA ECHO if regulated solely at state/local level. Absence of ECHO records does not confirm compliance—only indicates no federal enforcement actions.

3. **Local agency variations:** Portland BES, Metro Water Recovery, MSD Buncombe County, and Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency have facility-specific permit terms not standardized across jurisdictions. Due diligence must obtain actual permits.

4. **Stillage disposal documentation gap:** No public records available regarding ASBC's current distillery stillage disposal method. This is highest-priority due diligence request.

5. **Brewery wastewater extra-strength charges:** Actual charges depend on BOD loading, flow volume, and local POTW rate structures—requires review of utility invoices.

6. **Phase I ESA absence:** Without environmental site assessments, contamination liabilities are unknown. This report identifies regulatory framework but cannot assess site-specific risks until Phase I ESAs conducted.

### Sources of Uncertainty
- **Boiler capacities assumed:** Typical 10-50 MMBtu/hr for craft breweries/distilleries; actual capacities require verification
- **Hazardous waste generation estimated:** Based on industry averages; actual quantities depend on operational practices
- **GHG emissions calculated:** Based on estimated boiler fuel consumption; actual emissions require utility records
- **Permit exemption thresholds:** State/local variations may affect permit requirements (e.g., Asheville brewery potentially exempt from air permit if small boiler)

### Recommended Verification Steps
1. Obtain all environmental permits from ASBC (wastewater, air, hazardous waste)
2. Review past 2 years of self-monitoring reports (BOD/TSS/pH compliance)
3. Verify distillery stillage disposal contracts or Agricultural Use Exclusion documentation
4. Commission Phase I ESAs for all 5 facilities (ASTM E1527-21 standard)
5. Request EPA ID numbers and hazardous waste manifests (3 years)
6. Review Oregon GHG emission reports for Portland facilities
7. Obtain Portland BES extra-strength charge invoices (quantify wastewater treatment costs)
