## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive case law research memorandum analyzes legal precedent affecting the $1.2 billion acquisition of ASBC (American Small Batch Craft Beverages), focusing on distributor franchise laws across 25 states, pending litigation in Texas and Oregon, TTB bourbon standards of identity compliance, and state ABC licensing requirements for 305 distributor licenses across 50 states.

### Key Findings Summary

#### 1. Distributor Franchise Law Creates Substantial Exit Barriers and Valuation Exposure

**Critical Insight:** The 25 franchise law states create **perpetual territory rights** for distributors with mandatory compensation even upon termination for cause. This is not a theoretical protection—case law demonstrates distributors retain rights even after **13-18 years of non-performance** without compensation (*Amtec Int'l v. Polish Folklore*, New Jersey).

**Valuation Standards by Jurisdiction:**

| State | Protection Level | Typical Compensation Range | Key Statutory Feature |
|-------|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| **Wisconsin** | Highest | 5-7× annual gross profit | Perpetual rights; fair market value required even with cause |
| **New Jersey** | Highest | 2× pre-tax net income (statutory minimum for >20% revenue brands) | Perpetual rights; compensation required even with cause |
| **Texas** | High | 2-7× gross profit (no case law guidance) | 90-day notice and cure; fair market value includes goodwill |
| **Florida** | High | 4-5× gross profit (recent); 7× contractual | Five-element "good cause" test; mandatory arbitration |
| **California** | Medium | 4-7× gross profit | No "good cause" requirement but compensation mandatory |

**National Precedent:** Federal courts increasingly endorse **discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis** over simple gross profit multiples. *Tri County Wholesale Distributors v. Labatt USA Operating Co.*, 830 F.3d 496 (6th Cir. 2016), established DCF as the preferred valuation methodology, achieving results of 3.25-3.47× gross profits. However, DCF creates expert witness battles over discount rates and revenue projections, with valuation disputes ranging from $86,000 to $325,345 for the same distribution rights (*Ste. Michelle Wine Estates*).

**"Good Cause" Standards Are Narrow and Fact-Intensive:**

- **Texas (Tex. Alc. Bev. Code § 102.74):** "Good cause" requires distributor's failure to "substantially comply" with an "essential, reasonable, and commercially acceptable" requirement. Market conditions, supplier's inadequate marketing support, and external factors may excuse distributor underperformance.

- **Florida (Fla. Stat. § 563.022):** Five-element test requires (1) failure to comply with reasonable and materially significant term; (2) supplier knowledge within 18 months; (3) written notice; (4) reasonable opportunity for good faith compliance; (5) 30 days for corrective action plan + 90 days to cure or sell franchise. *Micro Man Distributors v. Louis Glunz Beer* (M.D. Fla. 2014) demonstrates courts deny summary judgment due to fact-intensive nature of "good cause."

- **New Jersey (N.J. Stat. § 33:1-93.16):** Even with good cause termination, brewer must pay fair market value or statutory liquidated damages (2× pre-tax net income for brands >20% of distributor revenue). 120-day notice and cure period required.

**Change of Control Risk:** ASBC's acquisition constitutes a change of control that may trigger distributor termination rights or renegotiation opportunities under franchise laws. Wisconsin and New Jersey statutes require compensation to existing distributors even when successor brewer selects different distributors.

#### 2. Texas Lone Star Beverages Litigation: $2.8M-$4M Exposure, Settlement Recommended at $2M-$2.5M

**Case Background:** ASBC terminated Lone Star Beverages (April 2024) for poor performance:
- Declining sales
- On-time delivery: 88% vs. 95% contractual requirement
- Understaffing issues
- LSB claims: $2.8M brand value + $1.2M lost profits = $4M total

**Legal Analysis:**

**ASBC's Favorable Factors:**
- Objective performance metrics (delivery failures, staffing deficiencies)
- 90-day notice with opportunity to cure (if properly documented)
- "Substantial" failure to comply with "essential" requirements (delivery standard)

**ASBC's Unfavorable Factors:**
- **Market conditions defense:** LSB will argue declining sales resulted from market conditions beyond its control, not LSB's fault
- **Supplier marketing support:** Texas law permits defense that ASBC's inadequate marketing support contributed to LSB's underperformance
- **Valuation uncertainty:** No published Texas case law establishes brand value calculation methodology. Industry practice suggests 2-7× gross profit, but absence of judicial guidance creates arbitration risk.

**Procedural Status:** If settlement fails, case proceeds to arbitration (as provided in Tex. Alc. Bev. Code § 102.75). Arbitration costs, expert witness fees, and uncertain outcome make litigation expensive and time-consuming.

**Settlement Recommendation:** $2M-$2.5M settlement range is strategically sound to:
- Avoid arbitration costs ($250K-$500K)
- Eliminate valuation uncertainty (2×-7× gross profit range = $1.4M-$4.9M potential exposure)
- Preserve relationships with remaining Texas distributors (signaling that ASBC resolves disputes fairly)
- Allow focus on integration rather than protracted litigation

#### 3. Oregon Dram Shop Liability: $1.85M-$3.85M Exposure, Settlement Recommended at $1.5M-$2M

**Case Background:** *Smith v. ASBC* (Multnomah County, July 2024)
- Drunk driver (Jones) consumed 5 beers at ASBC taproom
- Departed, caused accident 30 minutes later
- BAC 0.12% (50% above legal limit)
- Plaintiff injuries: $850K medical + $1M-$3M pain/suffering claimed

**Oregon's "Clear and Convincing Evidence" Standard (ORS 471.565):**

Plaintiff must prove by **clear and convincing evidence** (higher than typical civil "preponderance" standard):
1. ASBC served Jones **while visibly intoxicated** (slurred speech, unsteady gait, bloodshot eyes, lack of coordination)
2. Plaintiff **did not substantially contribute** to Jones's intoxication

**Leading Precedent:** *Sager v. McClenden*, 296 Or. 33, 672 P.2d 697 (1983) — Oregon Supreme Court held that "visibly intoxicated" is **not the same as** "under the influence" (legal standard for DUI). The standard is whether a reasonable person would **observe outward signs** of intoxication, not BAC level.

**Critical Factual Questions:**

1. **Time period of consumption:** 5 beers over how many hours? (Critical to visible intoxication determination)
2. **Server observations:** Did ASBC servers witness slurred speech, unsteady gait, bloodshot eyes, or other visible signs?
3. **Post-departure consumption:** Did Jones consume additional alcohol elsewhere during the 30-minute gap before accident? (Breaks causal chain)

**Oregon Alcohol Server Training Defense:**

Oregon Alcohol Server Education completion **does not provide immunity** but may:
- Demonstrate reasonable care
- Support defense that server could not reasonably observe intoxication
- Mitigate punitive damages (*Decard v. Bunch*, 274 Or. App. 799 (2015) — statute provides "shield" but not absolute defense)

**No Damages Cap — Catastrophic Verdict Risk:**

Oregon's $500,000 noneconomic damages cap under ORS 31.710(1) has been struck down as unconstitutional. **No effective cap exists** on pain and suffering damages. Recent verdict: **$77.5 million** in *M.M. & N.S. v. Nicolopoulos* (2023) for drunk driving/dram shop case involving amputation—**largest personal injury verdict in Oregon history**.

**Punitive Damages Availability:**

Oregon law permits punitive damages against both drunk drivers and establishments that serve visibly intoxicated persons (gross negligence). Punitive damages typically 1-2× compensatory damages.

**Joint and Several Liability (Modified System):**
- If ASBC found **>15% at fault:** Full liability for all damages (economic + noneconomic)
- If ASBC found **<15% at fault:** Proportionate liability only

This creates strong incentive for ASBC to argue drunk driver's fault predominates and ASBC's contribution <15%.

**Settlement Dynamics:**

Most Oregon dram shop cases **settle rather than go to trial** due to:
- High evidentiary burden (clear and convincing evidence) creates defense leverage
- Catastrophic verdict risk ($77.5M precedent) creates settlement pressure
- Insurance coverage considerations

**Settlement Range Analysis:**
- **Strong visible intoxication evidence (multiple witnesses, video):** $2M-$3M
- **Weak visible intoxication evidence (no witnesses, no video):** $800K-$1.5M
- **Moderate evidence (server testimony unclear, no video):** $1.5M-$2M

**Recommendation:** Settle for $1.5M-$2M to avoid trial risk. Immediately obtain:
- All server statements regarding Jones's behavior/appearance
- Security footage from taproom (if exists)
- Patron witness statements
- BAC retrograde analysis (expert testimony on intoxication level at time of service vs. at time of accident)

#### 4. TTB Bourbon Standards of Identity: Wood Staves Create Labeling Issue, Not Criminal Exposure

**Regulatory Issue:** ASBC bourbon product uses wood staves during barrel aging. TTB is investigating whether this violates **"new charred oak containers"** requirement under 27 C.F.R. § 5.22(b)(1)(i).

**Standards of Identity Analysis:**

**Federal Bourbon Requirements:**
1. Produced from fermented mash of ≥51% corn
2. Distilled at ≤160 proof
3. Stored at ≤125 proof
4. **Stored in new, charred oak containers** (critical element)
5. Produced in the United States

**Wood Staves Regulatory Treatment:**

- **If staves added DURING initial barrel aging:** Likely complies with "new charred oak container" requirement (barrel itself is new and charred), but TTB may require label disclosure

- **If staves added AFTER initial barrel aging (secondary finishing):** Product **cannot be labeled "straight bourbon"** — must be labeled **"bourbon finished with oak staves"** or **"Distilled Spirit Specialty"**

**Regulatory Precedent:** TTB guidance (Industry Circular 17-4) and Federal Register modernization rule (April 2, 2020) indicate that secondary finishing processes must be disclosed on labels. TTB traditionally interprets "new oak container" as standard 50-gallon barrels.

**Enforcement Philosophy — Voluntary Compliance, Not Criminal Prosecution:**

TTB lacks **mandatory recall authority** but will seek voluntary recall of mislabeled products. Typical enforcement sequence:
1. Formula denial or label rejection
2. Request for voluntary recall (if already in commerce)
3. Corrective action options: (a) relabel product, (b) destroy mislabeled product, or (c) negotiate alternative compliance
4. Civil penalties only for non-compliance with corrective action

**Financial Exposure:**

- **Recall/relabeling costs:** $50K-$500K depending on volume of affected product
- **Lost sales during compliance period:** Variable
- **Civil penalties:** Low to moderate (case-by-case determination; no published penalty schedule)
- **Criminal prosecution risk:** **Very low** (reserved for willful, repeated violations)
- **Brand reputation damage:** **High** — consumer perception of "bourbon" brand quality diminished if product must be relabeled as "Distilled Spirit Specialty"

**Recommendation:** Engage TTB immediately to:
1. Clarify exact timing of wood stave addition (during vs. after barrel aging)
2. Submit formula with full disclosure
3. Prepare alternative label options ("bourbon finished with oak staves")
4. Quantify inventory of affected product for cost-benefit analysis (recall vs. relabel vs. destroy)

#### 5. State ABC Licensing: 50-State Approval Process Creates Timeline Risk (3-12 Months), Not Deal-Breaker Risk

**Transaction Scope:** 305 distributor licenses across 50 states require 50 separate ABC agency approvals.

**Background Check Requirements (All States):**

- **Fingerprinting** and criminal history review
- **Financial stability** review (tax compliance, bankruptcy history, insolvency)
- **Prior regulatory compliance** review (ABC violations, enforcement actions)
- **Moral character** assessment

**Disqualifying Factors (Common Across Jurisdictions):**

1. **Felony convictions** — particularly:
   - Crimes of moral turpitude (fraud, theft, perjury)
   - Violent crimes
   - Alcohol/drug-related offenses

2. **Prior ABC violations** — license suspensions, fines, enforcement actions

3. **Tax delinquencies** — unpaid federal or state taxes

4. **Multiple DUI convictions** — single DUI may not be disqualifying, but pattern raises concerns

5. **Financial insolvency** — bankruptcy, inability to meet financial obligations

6. **Dishonesty in application** — **automatic denial in most states** (failure to disclose felonies, violations, etc.)

**Rehabilitation Consideration:**

Most states permit **case-by-case rehabilitation showing** for felons, considering:
- Time elapsed since conviction
- Completion of sentence, parole, probation
- Evidence of good character (employment, community involvement)
- Nature and severity of original offense

California, New Jersey, and most other states follow this framework, though standards vary.

**Timeline Analysis:**

| State Category | Approval Timeline | Key Factors |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Fast-track (CA, TX)** | 3-6 months | Streamlined online systems, efficient background checks |
| **Standard states** | 6-9 months | Traditional paper-based processes |
| **Slow-approval (NY, NJ)** | 9-12 months | Extensive background checks, detailed financial review |
| **If rehabilitation required** | Add 3-6 months | Evidentiary hearing, character witnesses, compliance history |

**Critical Requirement: Full Disclosure**

If an applicant **denies felony convictions** and the state later discovers the falsehood, denial is **nearly automatic** due to dishonesty. ABC agencies universally prioritize truthfulness over rehabilitation potential.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Pre-acquisition due diligence:** Background checks on all principals, officers, key managers of ASBC purchaser
2. **50-state ABC compliance audit:** Identify state-specific disqualifying factors
3. **Early filing strategy:** Submit license transfer applications in all 50 states **simultaneously** upon deal signing to minimize cumulative delay
4. **Full disclosure:** Disclose all criminal history, ABC violations, tax issues, financial problems — agencies favor honest applicants with rehabilitation over applicants who conceal disqualifying information

### Aggregate Risk Assessment

**Total Pending Litigation Exposure:** $4.65M - $7.85M

| Case | Type | Exposure Range | Recommended Settlement | Probability of Adverse Outcome |
|------|------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Lone Star Beverages v. ASBC** | TX Distributor Franchise | $2.8M-$4M | $2M-$2.5M | 40-60% (fact-intensive) |
| **Smith v. ASBC** | OR Dram Shop Liability | $1.85M-$3.85M | $1.5M-$2M | 30-50% (depends on visible intoxication evidence) |
| **Total** | | **$4.65M-$7.85M** | **$3.5M-$4.5M** | |

**Recommended Settlement Budget:** $3.5M - $4.5M (avoids trial risk, arbitration costs, and preserves business relationships)

### Strategic Implications for Acquisition

**1. Distributor Network Optimization:**

ASBC's 305 distributors across 50 states include underperforming distributors in the 25 franchise law states. **Exit barriers are substantial:**
- Wisconsin/New Jersey: 5-7× gross profit compensation even with cause
- Texas/Florida: Fact-intensive "good cause" requirements, mandatory arbitration
- California: No "good cause" required but 4-7× gross profit compensation mandatory

**Recommendation:** Conduct pre-acquisition distributor audit to identify:
- Which distributors are in franchise law states (highest exit cost)
- Gross profit levels for each distributor (valuation calculation)
- Performance issues that might support "good cause" termination (document early for notice and cure)

**2. Dram Shop Liability Risk Management:**

Oregon's unlimited damages exposure ($77.5M verdict precedent) and punitive damages availability create catastrophic risk for ASBC's taprooms and tasting rooms.

**Immediate Actions:**
- Audit Oregon Alcohol Server Education completion rates
- Implement enhanced visible intoxication training (behavioral recognition, service refusal protocols)
- Review dram shop insurance policy limits and exclusions
- Consider increasing coverage limits or umbrella/excess liability policies

**3. TTB Compliance Program:**

ASBC's bourbon standards of identity issue signals broader need for regulatory compliance infrastructure.

**Recommended Program Elements:**
- Retain TTB regulatory counsel
- Audit all distilled spirits formulas and labels for compliance
- Implement pre-market formula approval procedures
- Train production staff on standards of identity requirements

**4. ABC License Transfer Timeline:**

50-state approval process (3-12 months per state) creates deal closure risk. Filing simultaneously in all 50 states minimizes cumulative delay, but some slow-approval states (NY, NJ) may extend timeline.

**Mitigation:** Build 9-12 month regulatory approval period into acquisition timeline. Conduct background checks on all principals immediately to identify and address any disqualifying factors before filing.

### Critical Success Factors

**1. Settlement of Pending Litigation ($3.5M-$4.5M budget):** Resolves known exposure and allows focus on integration rather than protracted litigation.

**2. Distributor Audit and Buyout Strategy:** Calculate exit costs for underperforming distributors in franchise law states (5-7× gross profit range). Budget for potential buyouts.

**3. Enhanced Risk Management:** Implement comprehensive dram shop training, TTB compliance program, and ABC licensing due diligence to prevent future regulatory and litigation exposure.

**4. Proactive TTB Engagement:** Resolve bourbon wood staves issue immediately through formula submission and label approval process before product recall required.

**5. Full Disclosure to ABC Agencies:** Candid disclosure of any criminal history, ABC violations, or financial issues by acquiring principals maximizes rehabilitation consideration and minimizes automatic denial risk.

### Conclusion

The $1.2 billion ASBC acquisition faces $4.65M-$7.85M in pending litigation exposure, substantial distributor franchise exit barriers in 25 states (5-7× gross profit compensation even with cause), and 50-state ABC licensing approvals (3-12 months timeline). However, these risks are **manageable through strategic settlements, proactive regulatory engagement, and enhanced compliance programs**.

**Recommended immediate actions:** (1) Settle Lone Star litigation for $2M-$2.5M, (2) Settle Smith v. ASBC for $1.5M-$2M, (3) Engage TTB on bourbon formula approval, (4) File 50-state ABC license transfer applications with full disclosure, and (5) Conduct distributor audit to quantify exit costs in franchise law states.

**Risk Rating:** MEDIUM-HIGH — Litigation and regulatory exposure is substantial but quantifiable. Settlement and compliance strategies significantly reduce downside risk.

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. DISTRIBUTOR FRANCHISE LAW — MULTI-STATE PRECEDENT ANALYSIS

#### 1. Texas Beer Franchise Law (Tex. Alc. Bev. Code § 102.74-102.75)

**Statutory Framework:**

Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code Section 102.74 prohibits a malt beverage brewer or distributor from canceling, failing to renew, or terminating an agreement unless the party has "good cause" and furnishes 90 days' prior written notice to allow the affected party to eliminate the reasons for cancellation.

**"Good Cause" Definition:**

"Good cause" is defined as the failure by any party to an agreement, without reasonable excuse or justification, to comply substantially with an essential, reasonable, and commercially acceptable requirement imposed by the other party under the terms of an agreement. (Tex. Alc. Bev. Code § 102.71(1))

**Compensation Requirements:**

Under Section 102.75, any brewer who, without good cause, cancels, terminates, or fails to renew any agreement shall pay the distributor the fair market value of the distributor's business with relation to the affected brand or brands, with consideration given to all elements of value, including goodwill and going concern value.

**Case Law Limitations:**

Research revealed limited published Texas case law from 2020-2025 specifically addressing wrongful termination disputes under Section 102.74-102.75. The most notable Texas beer franchise case from recent years is *Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission v. Live Oak Brewing Co.* (3d Dist. 2017), which addressed Section 102.75(a)(7) regarding distribution rights sales but did not involve termination disputes.

The lack of recent published case law suggests that disputes in this area are often resolved through arbitration (as provided in the statute) or settled privately rather than resulting in published court opinions.

**Application to Lone Star Beverages Litigation:**

For ASBC's pending Texas litigation, the key analysis will focus on whether:
- ASBC provided 90 days' notice with opportunity to cure
- The alleged performance failures (declining sales, 88% on-time delivery vs. 95% requirement, understaffing) constitute "substantial" failure to comply with "essential, reasonable, and commercially acceptable" requirements
- Market conditions excuse the distributor's performance failures
- ASBC's alleged inadequate marketing support contributed to performance decline

**Brand Value Calculation in Texas:**

While Texas statute requires payment of "fair market value" including "goodwill and going concern value," the statute does not specify a calculation methodology. Industry practice suggests 2-7× gross profit multiples, but Texas courts have not established a definitive formula.

#### 2. Wisconsin Distributor Perpetual Rights (Wis. Stat. § 135.02)

**Statutory Framework:**

Wisconsin's Fair Dealership Law (Wis. Stat. Ch. 135) and beer-specific statutes create some of the strongest distributor protections in the United States. When a beer wholesaler's distribution agreement is terminated, the successor beer wholesaler chosen by the brewer must pay the terminated beer wholesaler the fair market value of the distribution rights for the brand in the same sales territory.

**Perpetual Rights Nature:**

Wisconsin law effectively grants perpetual territory rights to distributors. The terminated and successor beer wholesalers must agree upon the fair market value of the beer brand's distribution rights for a particular territory or enter into arbitration.

**Valuation Methodology:**

The Wisconsin statutes do not specify how to calculate fair market value. The statute "fails to state how, or under what analysis, there's a fair value or how that should be calculated." In practice, parties utilize certified business evaluators, and typical distribution rights values fall between **five times and seven times the gross profit** (5-7× annual gross profit).

**Relationship to Fair Dealership Law:**

Wisconsin's Brand Compensation Law does not apply if the terminated beer wholesaler is a dealer under Wisconsin's Fair Dealership Law (Ch. 135) whose business relationship to any discontinued brand constitutes a dealership, as determined by a court. Under Wis. Stat. 135.02(1), "Community of interest" means a continuing financial interest between the grantor and grantee in either the operation of the dealership business or the marketing of such goods or services.

**Case Law:**

Wisconsin courts have held that the forum question (arbitration vs. litigation) should be answered first, and have ordered matters to arbitration, stating that the arbitrator should decide whether compensation claims were timely submitted. Specific case: Wisconsin court ruled that beer distributors must arbitrate each other over fair value of distribution rights even when they don't timely file. (2018)

#### 3. New Jersey Perpetual Rights (N.J. Stat. § 33:1-93.12 to 33:1-93.20)

**Statutory Framework:**

The New Jersey Malt Alcoholic Beverages Protection Act (N.J. Rev. Stat. §§ 33:1-93.12 to 33:1-93.20) provides comprehensive distributor protections similar to Wisconsin. Section 33:1-93.13 contains findings and declarations relative to malt alcoholic beverages.

**Perpetual Rights:**

State distributor-protection laws typically render distribution rights **perpetual**, despite what a contract might say. The statute enables retroactive application for contracts, agreements, and relationships that existed prior to the effective date of the act, but that are continuing in nature.

**Exclusive Territory Requirements:**

Exclusive territories are required unless "dualing" occurred prior to March 1, 2006. Brewers who use wholesalers must enter into a written distribution agreement that provides an exclusive territory for the brands they are authorized to distribute.

**"Good Cause" and "Good Faith" Requirements:**

The MBPA prohibits a brewer from terminating any "contract, agreement or relationship with a wholesaler" unless the brewer establishes that it has "good cause" and acted in "good faith." Good cause is limited to a failure to substantially comply with reasonable terms contained in a contract or agreement between a brewer and wholesaler.

**Notice and Cure Period:**

A brewer must send the wholesaler a notice of its intent to terminate or not renew the agreement and allow the wholesaler **120 days** to correct the problem.

**Compensation Requirements:**

**Even with Good Cause:** Even if a brewer terminates with good cause, the brewer still owes the wholesaler reasonable compensation.

**Fair Market Value Standard:** A successor brewer may terminate distribution rights provided that the successor brewer or the second wholesaler or wholesalers first pays to the first wholesaler the fair market value of the first wholesaler's business with respect to the terminated brand or brands.

**Liquidated Damages Formula (For >20% of Revenue):** Payment for inventory and other tangible assets owned and used by the wholesaler in its operation, plus a payment determined by **multiplying by two (2×) the wholesaler's pre-tax net income** attributable to the sale of the brewer's brand or brands for the wholesaler's most recently completed fiscal year preceding the year in which the termination occurs, is deemed to be a reasonable liquidated damages provision for termination of brands representing more than 20% of the wholesaler's revenues. (N.J. Stat. § 33:1-93.16)

**Case Law:**

*Amtec Int'l of N.Y. Corp. v. Polish Folklore Imp. Co.* – This case involved an imported beer brand's dispute with a distributor that it hadn't shipped beer to in 18 years. The court found that **leaving a territory for 13 years might not be enough to accomplish termination** of a beer distribution agreement under New Jersey franchise law, demonstrating the strength of perpetual rights protections.

#### 4. California Beer Franchise Law (Bus. & Prof. Code § 25000.2)

**Statutory Framework:**

California Business and Professions Code Section 25000.2 was added under Senate Bill 574 and compels a successor beer manufacturer to compensate a beer wholesaler if the distribution relationship is terminated. The statute provides that when a brewer who acquires the right to manufacture beer "cancels any of [an] existing beer wholesaler's rights to distribute [a] product," that successor brewer's designated replacement distributor must negotiate in good faith – and, failing that, arbitrate – with the existing distributor "to determine the fair market value of the affected distribution rights."

**Key Distinction: No "Good Cause" Requirement:**

**Importantly, California's franchise laws do not restrict brewers to only "good cause" terminations** (though distributors may negotiate for good-cause requirements in contracts). This distinguishes California from Texas, Wisconsin, New Jersey, and most other franchise law states.

**Compensation Process:**

The statute focuses on compensation for terminated distributors rather than restricting the grounds for termination itself. Successor brewers must either negotiate fair market value or proceed to arbitration.

**Case Law:**

**1. Mission v. Pabst Brewing Company (2015)** - Mission sued Pabst for breach of contract, arguing that Section 25000.2 did not provide an independent right to terminate and consequently that there was not a valid termination of the agreement.

**2. Maita Distributors (MillerCoors merger, 2008)** - When Miller and Coors merged into MillerCoors in 2008, MillerCoors replaced existing wholesalers. Maita reluctantly participated in mandatory arbitration after an unsuccessful attempt to enjoin it, challenging the idea that arbitration could provide the sole remedy for termination.

**Practical Issues:**

Without a concrete statutory statement that Section 25000.2 is the sole remedy for a brand transfer, the statute has been considered "a perfect failure of the stated legislative intent." At present, Section 25000.2 multiplies proceedings, as initiating a brand transfer potentially results in two pieces of litigation—a lawsuit and a statutory arbitration.

#### 5. Florida Beer Franchise Law (Fla. Stat. § 563.022)

**Statutory Framework:**

Florida Statute 563.022 regulates business relations between beer distributors and manufacturers to promote fair, efficient, and competitive distribution of malt beverage products. A "franchise" is defined as a contract or agreement, either expressed or implied, whether oral or written, for a definite or indefinite period of time in which a manufacturer grants to a beer distributor the right to purchase, resell, and distribute any brand or brands offered by the manufacturer.

**Termination Requirements:**

It is **unlawful to terminate, cancel, fail to renew, or refuse to continue the franchise or selling agreement of any distributor without good cause**, and the nonrenewal of a franchise or selling agreement without good cause shall constitute an unfair termination or cancellation regardless of the specified time period.

**"Good Cause" Elements (Five-Part Test):**

Florida's Beer Franchise Law requires that "good cause" for purposes of terminating an exclusive distribution franchise requires five elements:

1. The distributor **failed to comply with a term of its agreement** with the supplier that is **reasonable and materially significant**;
2. The supplier first acquired knowledge of the failure **not more than 18 months** before it officially notified the distributor;
3. The distributor was given **written notice** by the supplier in the manner required by the Franchise Law;
4. The distributor was given a **reasonable opportunity to provide good faith efforts to comply** with the contract provision; and
5. The distributor was given **30 days to submit a plan of corrective action** and an **additional 90 days to correct the failure or sell the franchise**.

**Reasonable Compensation:**

When a manufacturer terminates without good cause, the amount payable is "reasonable compensation for the diminished value of the distributor's business or of any ancillary business or both which has been negatively affected by the act of the manufacturer." The value of the distributor's business or ancillary business shall include, but not be limited to, its **goodwill**.

**Valuation Formulas in Practice:**

In practice, some Florida distribution agreements define "reasonable compensation" as:
- **"Thirty (30) times the case equivalents"** of Products sold during the 12 month period immediately prior to the buy-out date, or
- **"Seven (7) times the Gross Profit dollars"** generated in the preceding calendar year

Industry sources indicate that several years ago, distributors commonly cited 2-3× Gross Profits, but more recently (as of 2022), Florida distributors have cited **4-5× Gross Profits**.

**Arbitration Process:**

If the supplier and the distributor cannot mutually agree on the amount of reasonable compensation, they are required to submit to **binding arbitration** by a neutral arbitrator according to the American Arbitration Association's rules, with each party paying one-half the arbitration cost. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding on the parties.

**Key Case Law:**

**Micro Man Distributors, Inc. v. Louis Glunz Beer, Inc.**, U.S. Dist. Ct. M.D. Fla. (2014) – One of the few written case opinions addressing a supplier's attempt to terminate a Florida distributor's franchise. Key takeaways:
- A distributor has an **obligation to devote commercially reasonable efforts and resources** to the distribution of beer, even if there is no written agreement.
- The court could not grant summary judgment for either party, indicating that "good cause" determination is highly fact-intensive.
- Performance standards must be "reasonable and materially significant" to support termination.

#### 6. BRAND VALUE COMPENSATION FORMULAS — NATIONAL PRECEDENT

**Valuation Methodology: Gross Profit Multiples vs. Discounted Cash Flow**

**Gross Profit Multiple Range:**

Gross profit multiples have been observed ranging from a **low of 2× gross profit to a high of 10× or above**. Based on market conditions, typical distribution rights values fall between **five times and seven times the gross profit (5-7× annual gross profit)**.

**Recent Trends:**
- **Pre-2020:** 2-3× gross profit multiples were common
- **2020-2025:** 4-7× gross profit multiples more typical
- **High-value brands:** 8-10× gross profit multiples in some cases

**Federal Case Law: Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Endorsed**

**Tri County Wholesale Distributors v. Labatt USA Operating Co.**, 830 F.3d 496 (6th Cir. 2016) – **Leading federal precedent on beer distributor franchise valuation**

**Parties:** Tri County Wholesale Distributors and The Bellas Company (distributors) v. Labatt USA Operating Co., LLC (brewer)

**Court:** U.S. Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit

**Key Holdings:**

1. **DCF Analysis Endorsed:** The Sixth Circuit endorsed the **discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis** for calculating the diminished value of a beer distributor's business after franchise termination. The court stated that DCF "measures the present-day value of an asset based on the income it is expected to generate in the future."

2. **Rejection of Simple Gross Profit Multiples:** The court noted that no issues were decided based on a "multiplier" of simple gross profits, characterizing such multipliers as lacking "economic rigor" and failing to meet federal evidentiary standards.

3. **"Hybrid" Valuation Approach:** The court used a "hybrid" approach to determine diminished value: determining the fair market value of the franchise contracts using a DCF analysis and adding on any loss in the fair market value of other tangible or intangible components.

4. **No Double Recovery:** Distributors are **not entitled to any additional award of damages for lost future income in addition to fair market value**, as the Sixth Circuit characterized this as "asking for a double recovery" because future profits are directly included in the calculation of fair market value.

5. **Offset for Profits During Litigation:** Distributors' fair market value award **should be reduced by the amount of profits they earned on selling the brand during the time spent litigating**, which may substantially reduce the incentive of distributors to challenge successor terminations.

**DCF Results Compared to Gross Profit Multiples:**

In the *Tri County* case, the DCF analysis achieved outcomes that were approximately **3.25× gross profits for the first plaintiff** and **3.47× gross profits for the second plaintiff**, demonstrating that DCF can result in similar ranges to traditional multiples but with greater economic justification.

**Other Recent Case Law:**

**Ste. Michelle Wine Estates v. Tri County Wholesale Distributors** (District Court) – Both expert witnesses employed DCF methodology:
- Winery's expert valuation: **$86,000**
- Distributor's expert valuation: **$325,345**
- The significant disparity reflects differing assumptions about future cash flows and discount rates

**Constellation Case (Washington State)** – Constellation offered roughly **$70 million**, stated as a **7× multiple** of the plaintiff beer wholesaler's trailing 12-month gross profits from the sale of Constellation products.

**Valuation Framework Summary:**

| Jurisdiction | Typical Multiple Range | Statutory Standard | Key Factors |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Texas** | 2-7× gross profit | Fair market value (goodwill + going concern) | No case law guidance |
| **Wisconsin** | 5-7× gross profit | Fair market value | Certified business evaluators common |
| **New Jersey** | 2× pre-tax net income (statutory liquidated damages >20% revenue) | Fair market value or statutory formula | Perpetual rights |
| **California** | 4-7× gross profit (recent) | Fair market value | No good cause requirement |
| **Florida** | 4-5× gross profit (2020-2025); 7× gross profit (contractual) | Reasonable compensation (goodwill included) | Five-element "good cause" test |
| **Federal (DCF)** | 3.25-3.47× (Tri County) | Discounted cash flow analysis preferred | Economically rigorous methodology |

### B. OREGON DRAM SHOP LIABILITY — ORS 471.565 ANALYSIS

#### 1. Oregon Dram Shop Statute (ORS 471.565)

**Statutory Framework:**

ORS 471.565 is Oregon's dram shop statute, which applies to both bars and other establishments licensed to serve alcohol, as well as to social hosts. The statute creates liability for providing or serving alcoholic beverages to visibly intoxicated persons.

**Burden of Proof — "Clear and Convincing Evidence" Standard:**

Under the statute, a licensed establishment or social host is **not liable** unless the injured plaintiff proves by **"clear and convincing" evidence** that:
(a) The licensee, permittee, or social host **served or provided alcoholic beverages to the patron or guest while the patron or guest was visibly intoxicated**; and
(b) The plaintiff **did not substantially contribute** to the intoxication of the patron or guest.

This is a higher evidentiary standard than the typical "preponderance of the evidence" standard in civil cases.

**"Visible Intoxication" Standard:**

Visible signs of intoxication may include:
- Slurred speech
- Bloodshot eyes
- Lack of coordination
- Slowed or delayed reaction time
- Aggression
- Being loud
- Other outward symptoms that can be seen or heard

The standard is whether a reasonable person would observe these signs, not whether the patron was legally "under the influence."

#### 2. Key Oregon Dram Shop Case Law

**Sager v. McClenden, 296 Or. 33, 672 P.2d 697 (1983)** – **Leading Oregon Supreme Court precedent**

**Key Holdings:**

1. **Third-Party Liability Standard:** The court held that ORS 471.565 does not create a claim in favor of **intoxicated patrons injured off premises as a result of their own intoxication** against OLCC licensees who serve them when visibly intoxicated. The section sets the standard for civil liability to **third parties** as being "visibly intoxicated."

2. **"Visibly Intoxicated" ≠ "Under the Influence":** The court emphasized that "visibly intoxicated" is **not necessarily the same as** being "under the influence of intoxicating liquor."

3. **Legislative Intent to Limit Liability:** The legislative history of ORS 30.950 indicates that its purpose was to **limit the liability** of liquor licensees and permittees to third parties, not to create broad liability.

4. **Tavern Keeper Liability to Third Parties:** A tavern keeper is liable to third parties who are injured in an automobile accident that results from serving a visibly intoxicated customer.

**Decard v. Bunch, 274 Or. App. 799 (2015)** – **Oregon Court of Appeals clarification**

**Key Holdings:**

1. **No Independent Cause of Action:** After analysis of the statute, the Court concluded that the statute **does not provide a separate independent cause of action**. Rather, the statute provides a **shield for defendants**.

2. **Negligence Theory Required:** While licensed establishments or social hosts may be liable under a **negligence theory**, they are only liable if the plaintiff establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the bar or host served the patron when the patron was visibly intoxicated, and that the plaintiff did not substantially contribute to the intoxication of the guest.

**Bonner v. American Golf Corp. of California** – **Constitutional limits on dram shop liability**

**Key Holding:**

The court addressed the constitutionality of ORS 471.565(1) and held that the statute would be deemed **unconstitutional if a server "serves alcohol to a 'visibly intoxicated' person who has reached the point at which further consumption is involuntary because the person has lost the sense of reason and volition."**

This creates a narrow exception to dram shop liability for extreme intoxication where the patron has lost all voluntary control.

**Baker v. Tyler Gregory Smith, 281 Or. App. 174 (2016)** – **"Served or Provided" definition**

**Key Holding:**

The Court of Appeals concluded that the phrase **"served or provided,"** as used in ORS 471.565(2), turns on whether the social host or establishment has **"control" over the alcohol** that was supplied to the visibly intoxicated person. If the defendant had control over the alcohol supply from which the visibly intoxicated guest consumed alcohol, the defendant had "served or provided" the guest with alcohol.

#### 3. Procedural Requirements

**180-Day Notice Requirement:**

The statute of limitations requires anyone filing a **"Dram Shop Notice"** to do so within **180 days of the accident**. Failure to file timely notice is a complete bar to recovery.

**Causation Requirement:**

The plaintiff must prove that the service of alcohol to the visibly intoxicated patron was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injuries. Intervening consumption of alcohol elsewhere may break the causal chain.

#### 4. Defenses Available to Establishments

**Training Defense:**

The statute does not provide explicit immunity for completion of Oregon Alcohol Server Education (OLCC-approved training). However, evidence of server training may be relevant to:
- Whether the server should have recognized visible intoxication
- Whether the establishment exercised reasonable care
- Mitigation of punitive damages

**Plaintiff Contribution Defense:**

If the plaintiff "substantially contribute[d] to the intoxication of the patron or guest," the establishment is not liable. This defense is particularly relevant when:
- The plaintiff purchased drinks for the patron
- The plaintiff encouraged drinking
- The plaintiff was a social host who provided alcohol before the patron arrived at the commercial establishment

**Post-Departure Consumption Defense:**

If the patron consumed additional alcohol after leaving the establishment but before causing the accident, this may break the causal chain. However, this is highly fact-specific and depends on:
- Time elapsed between departure and accident (30 minutes in Smith v. ASBC)
- Amount of alcohol consumed post-departure
- Whether the patron was already visibly intoxicated at the establishment

#### 5. Damages in Oregon Dram Shop Cases

**No Statutory Cap on Noneconomic Damages:**

Oregon previously had a $500,000 cap on noneconomic damages under ORS 31.710(1), but this cap has been challenged and struck down as unconstitutional in several cases. As of 2025, **there is no effective cap on pain and suffering damages** in Oregon dram shop cases.

**Recent Jury Verdict Ranges:**

**M.M. & N.S. v. Nicolopoulos (2023)** – **$77.5 million verdict** (largest personal injury verdict in Oregon history)
- **Case Type:** Drunk driving and dram shop liability
- **Injuries:** Amputation of one plaintiff's leg, severe PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder of another plaintiff
- **Jury Award:** $77,523,748.93 in compensatory damages
- **Significance:** Highest below-the-knee amputation verdict in US history in a drunk driving and dram shop case

**Noneconomic Damages Example:**

In one Oregon case, a jury awarded **$10.5 million for noneconomic damages** (pain, suffering, loss of enjoyment of life), though the trial court initially applied a $500,000 cap pursuant to ORS 31.710(1), resulting in a $10 million reduction. This cap has since been challenged.

**Typical Settlement Ranges:**

- **Moderate injuries (no permanent disability):** $100,000 - $500,000
- **Serious injuries (permanent disability):** $500,000 - $3,000,000
- **Catastrophic injuries (amputation, brain injury):** $5,000,000 - $77,500,000+

**Settlement Example:**

A **$400,000 settlement** was obtained for the victim of a drunken driver car accident where the drunk driver had been served alcohol at a local bar while he was visibly intoxicated.

**Punitive Damages Availability:**

Victims of drunk drivers can legally pursue **punitive damages** against:
- The drunk driver (because the driver's conduct is grossly negligent and reckless)
- Bars, taverns and other providers of alcohol (because service to a visibly intoxicated person is grossly negligent)

Punitive damages typically make drunken driving car accident verdicts and settlements higher than normal Oregon car accident injury cases.

**Joint and Several Liability:**

Oregon applies a **modified joint and several liability system**:
- If defendant is found **>15% at fault**: Full liability for all economic and noneconomic damages
- If defendant is found **<15% at fault**: Proportionate liability only

This creates strong incentive for defendants to argue comparative fault allocation below 15%.

#### 6. Application to Smith v. ASBC Case

**Facts:**
- Jones consumed 5 beers at ASBC taproom
- Caused accident 30 minutes after departure
- BAC 0.12% (well above 0.08% legal limit)
- Plaintiff injuries: $850K medical + $1M-$3M pain/suffering claimed

**Liability Analysis:**

**Plaintiff's Burden (Clear and Convincing Evidence):**
1. **Visible intoxication at time of service?** Key factual question requiring witness testimony (servers, other patrons)
2. **Did plaintiff contribute to intoxication?** No indication plaintiff knew Jones or contributed

**ASBC's Defenses:**
1. **Not visibly intoxicated:** 5 beers over what time period? Did Jones exhibit slurred speech, unsteady gait, bloodshot eyes?
2. **Post-departure consumption:** Did Jones consume additional alcohol elsewhere in the 30 minutes before accident?
3. **Causation:** Was visible intoxication at ASBC a substantial factor in causing the accident?

**Training Defense:**

If ASBC's servers completed Oregon Alcohol Server Education, this may demonstrate reasonable care but does not provide immunity. Evidence of training may mitigate punitive damages.

**Damages Exposure:**

Based on Oregon precedent:
- **Medical expenses:** $850K (stipulated)
- **Pain/suffering (moderate-to-serious permanent injury):** $1M-$3M (reasonable range)
- **Punitive damages:** Possible if gross negligence shown (service to obviously intoxicated patron)
- **Total range:** $1.85M-$3.85M (consistent with case parameters)

**Settlement Likelihood:**

Most dram shop cases settle rather than go to trial. Settlement range likely $1.5M-$2.5M depending on strength of visible intoxication evidence.

### C. TTB STANDARDS OF IDENTITY — BOURBON WHISKEY COMPLIANCE

#### 1. Federal Bourbon Standards (27 CFR 5.22(b)(1)(i))

**Statutory Definition of Bourbon Whiskey:**

Under 27 CFR 5.22(b)(1)(i), bourbon whiskey must meet the following requirements:

1. **Mash bill:** Produced from a fermented mash of not less than 51% corn
2. **Proof:** Distilled at not more than 160 proof (80% ABV)
3. **Barrel entry proof:** Stored at not more than 125 proof (62.5% ABV)
4. **Aging containers:** **Stored in new, charred oak containers**
5. **Location:** Produced in the United States

**Key Regulation — "New Charred Oak Containers" Requirement:**

The phrase "new, charred oak containers" is the critical standard of identity element. Federal law prevents any whiskey not produced according to TTB standards from being labeled as Bourbon in the U.S. market.

#### 2. TTB Historical Interpretation of "New Oak Container"

**Traditional Barrel Size:**

TTB and its predecessor agencies have traditionally considered a **"new oak container,"** as used in the current regulations, to refer to a **standard whiskey barrel of approximately 50 gallons capacity**.

**TTB Notice No. 176:**

In Notice No. 176, TTB proposed to define an **oak barrel** as a **"cylindrical oak drum of approximately 50 gallons capacity used to age bulk spirits."**

#### 3. Wood Staves and Standards of Identity Compliance

**Critical Issue: Do Wood Staves = "Added Flavoring"?**

**Regulatory Treatment:**

If **staves are added to the aging barrel**, the product **can no longer be labeled as "straight bourbon" or "straight whiskey"** because this process is considered a **secondary alteration**. Instead, it must be labeled more specifically to indicate the process, such as **"bourbon finished with oak staves"**.

**Standards of Identity Analysis:**

- **Bourbon requirement:** Must be aged in **new charred oak containers** (traditionally barrels)
- **Additional staves inside barrel:** Does not negate the "new charred oak container" requirement if the barrel itself is new and charred
- **Labeling consequence:** Product must be labeled to disclose the finishing process

**TTB Position:**

The use of additional staves inside the barrel does not negate the requirement that bourbon must be aged in new charred oak containers. However, the addition of staves after initial barrel aging constitutes a secondary process that requires disclosure on the label.

#### 4. TTB Formula Approval Process

**When Formula Approval Required:**

TTB may require, on a case-by-case basis, information about the formulation and ingredients of any distilled spirits product:
- At any time during the label review process
- Whenever necessary to enforce TTB regulations

**Formula Denial Consequences:**

1. **No Pre-Market Approval:** Product cannot be legally sold in interstate commerce without approved formula and label
2. **Voluntary Recall:** TTB does not have authority to require a mandatory recall, but will seek a voluntary recall of products in violation of TTB regulations
3. **FDA Consultation:** Upon receipt of FDA's opinion regarding the regulatory status of a substance (if health/safety concern), TTB will take appropriate action, which may include seeking a voluntary recall
4. **Corrective Action Options:**
   - Destroy the product
   - Re-label it with corrected, approved labels before placing it back into interstate commerce
   - Take other appropriate corrective action

**No Published Penalty Schedule:**

Research did not identify a published TTB penalty schedule for bourbon standards of identity violations. TTB primarily relies on:
- Voluntary compliance
- Voluntary recalls
- Corrective labeling
- Case-by-case enforcement

#### 5. Criminal vs. Civil Penalties

**Federal Alcohol Administration Act Violations:**

TTB maintains authority to investigate violations of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act). Potential penalties include:
- **Civil penalties:** Administrative fines (amounts determined case-by-case)
- **Criminal penalties:** For willful violations of FAA Act
- **License suspension/revocation:** For serious or repeated violations

**Enforcement Philosophy:**

TTB's enforcement approach emphasizes:
- Voluntary compliance
- Industry education (Industry Circulars, rulings)
- Corrective action before punitive measures
- Cooperation with FDA on health/safety issues

#### 6. Precedent on Standards of Identity Enforcement

**Limited Published Case Law:**

Research identified limited published case law specifically addressing TTB enforcement actions for bourbon standards of identity violations involving wood staves or barrel finishing.

**Relevant TTB Guidance:**

**Industry Circular 17-4** and other TTB rulings provide guidance on:
- When formula approval is required
- How to label finished whiskey products
- Standards of identity compliance

**TTB Modernization (2020):**

The Federal Register published a final rule on April 2, 2020, titled **"Modernization of the Labeling and Advertising Regulations for Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages"**, which updated standards of identity and labeling requirements.

#### 7. Application to ASBC Bourbon Investigation

**Issue:** ASBC bourbon product uses wood staves during barrel aging. TTB is investigating whether this violates "new charred oak barrels" requirement.

**Analysis:**

1. **Standards of Identity Compliance:**
   - If wood staves were added **during** barrel aging (not as secondary finishing), and the barrel itself is new and charred, this likely complies with the basic bourbon standard.
   - However, TTB may still require disclosure on the label.

2. **Formula Denial Risk:**
   - If TTB denies the formula, ASBC cannot sell the product as "bourbon"
   - Product must be relabeled as "Distilled Spirit Specialty" or "bourbon finished with oak staves"

3. **Recall Risk:**
   - If product was already sold as "bourbon" without proper labeling, TTB may seek voluntary recall
   - ASBC would need to:
     - Re-label inventory
     - Destroy mislabeled product, or
     - Negotiate corrective action with TTB

4. **Penalty Exposure:**
   - **Low criminal risk:** Unlikely to be criminal prosecution absent willful, repeated violations
   - **Civil penalty risk:** Moderate — TTB may impose administrative fines (amount uncertain)
   - **Reputational risk:** High — "bourbon" brand reputation damaged if product must be relabeled

5. **Financial Exposure:**
   - Recall costs (retrieval, destruction, relabeling)
   - Lost sales during compliance period
   - Rebranding costs
   - Civil penalties (if any)
   - **Estimated range:** $50K-$500K depending on volume of affected product

### D. STATE ABC LICENSING — CHANGE OF CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

#### 1. General ABC License Transfer Requirements

**Dual Background Check:**

Both parties (transferor and transferee) must be qualified to hold a liquor license, with **no disqualifying background issues**, such as:
- Felony convictions
- Financial insolvency
- Prior ABC violations

**Transfer Process Treated as New Application:**

ABC agencies proceed as they would on a **new application** and may **deny the transfer** if the transferee-applicant is not qualified for a license.

**Thorough Background Check:**

The ABC conducts thorough background checks that include:
- **Fingerprinting**
- **Criminal history review**
- **Financial stability review**
- **Prior regulatory compliance review**

#### 2. Disqualifying Factors for License Transfer

**Criminal Convictions:**

ABC may **refuse to issue a license** to any person who has:
- A disqualifying criminal record
- Violated the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act
- Felony convictions (particularly crimes of moral turpitude)

**Felony Severity Factors:**

The **nature and severity of the felony** play a significant role in the ABC's decision:
- **More unfavorable:** Felonies involving moral turpitude, violent crimes, or offenses related to alcohol and drug abuse
- **Less unfavorable:** Non-violent felonies unrelated to alcohol, especially if significant time has passed

**Time Elapsed Since Conviction:**

The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control considers:
- The **time elapsed since the conviction**
- Evidence of **rehabilitation**
- Compliance with terms of **parole or probation**

**Rehabilitation Standard:**

ABC may **grant a license to a convicted felon who is rehabilitated**. The decision is made on a **case-by-case basis**, considering:
- Completion of sentence, parole, or probation
- No subsequent criminal activity
- Evidence of good character (employment history, community involvement)
- Nature and severity of original offense

#### 3. Importance of Disclosure

**Critical Requirement:**

If an applicant **denies that they have a felony conviction** and the state later finds out that they were **not truthful**, that is an **almost automatic denial of license** due to the element of **dishonesty**.

**Full Disclosure Best Practice:**

During the transfer application process, the ABC conducts a thorough background check on the buyer. **Failing to disclose relevant information**, such as past felony convictions, can lead to the **denial of the transfer request**.

#### 4. Other Disqualifying Factors

**Tax Delinquencies:**

Unpaid federal or state taxes may disqualify license transfer.

**Prior ABC Violations:**

Previous violations of alcoholic beverage laws, even if not criminal, may be disqualifying.

**DUI Convictions:**

While a single DUI may not be disqualifying, **multiple DUI convictions** or a recent DUI may raise concerns about suitability to hold a liquor license.

**Financial Insolvency:**

Evidence of financial instability, bankruptcy, or inability to meet financial obligations may disqualify transfer.

**Moral Character:**

ABC agencies assess the "moral character" of applicants. Evidence of dishonesty, fraud, or untrustworthiness is disqualifying.

#### 5. Jurisdiction-Specific Variations

**California ABC:**

California ABC maintains detailed regulations at Business and Professions Code Division 9 and has published extensive FAQs and guidance on license transfers. California permits rehabilitation consideration for felons on a case-by-case basis.

**New Jersey ABC:**

New Jersey has specific provisions for "Criminally Disqualified Licensees" with detailed procedures for challenging disqualification determinations.

**State-Specific Research Required:**

Each of the 50 states has its own ABC agency with jurisdiction-specific rules for:
- Disqualifying offenses
- Rehabilitation standards
- Transfer procedures
- Background check requirements

#### 6. Application to ASBC Acquisition

**305 Distributor Licenses Across 50 States:**

The acquisition involves transfer or approval of 305 distributor licenses across all 50 states, requiring:
- 50 separate ABC agency approvals
- Background checks on acquiring entity (ASBC purchaser)
- Review of any criminal history, regulatory violations, or financial issues

**Due Diligence Requirements:**

Purchaser must conduct thorough due diligence on:
- Any criminal convictions of principals or officers
- Prior ABC violations by target company
- Financial stability of target and acquirer
- Compliance with state-specific transfer requirements

**Timeline Implications:**

ABC license transfer approvals can take:
- **3-6 months** in most states
- **6-12 months** in states with extensive background check requirements
- **Longer** if any disqualifying factors require rehabilitation showing

**Risk Factors:**

- Undisclosed criminal convictions
- Prior ABC violations by ASBC or target
- Financial instability
- Incomplete disclosure in transfer applications

---

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Distributor Franchise Law Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Exposure |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Texas Lone Star Litigation** | High | Probable | $2.8M-$4M |
| **Wisconsin Perpetual Rights Claims** | High | Possible | 5-7× gross profit per distributor |
| **New Jersey Compensation (Even with Cause)** | Medium-High | Probable | 2× pre-tax net income minimum |
| **California Brand Transfer Disputes** | Medium | Possible | 4-7× gross profit |
| **Change of Control Termination Rights** | Medium | Possible | Varies by state |

**Critical Finding:**

Even in "good cause" termination states (Texas, New Jersey, Florida), ASBC must still pay **fair market value compensation** to terminated distributors. The **only exception is California**, which does not require "good cause" for termination but still requires compensation.

**Perpetual Rights Impact:**

Wisconsin and New Jersey effectively grant **perpetual territory rights** to distributors. Case law demonstrates that even **13-18 years of non-performance may not terminate these rights** without compensation. (*Amtec Int'l v. Polish Folklore*)

**Valuation Uncertainty:**

Most states do not specify valuation methodology, creating risk of:
- Costly arbitration (required in most states)
- Significant valuation disputes (e.g., $86K vs. $325K in *Ste. Michelle*)
- Expert witness battles over DCF assumptions

**Recommended Mitigation:**

1. **Pre-acquisition distributor audit:** Identify underperforming distributors in franchise law states
2. **Valuation analysis:** Calculate potential buyout costs using 5-7× gross profit for high-protection states
3. **Notice and cure compliance:** Ensure any terminations follow statutory procedures (90-120 days notice, opportunity to cure)
4. **Arbitration preparation:** Budget for mandatory arbitration in Wisconsin, Florida, California

### B. Oregon Dram Shop Liability Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Exposure |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Smith v. ASBC Verdict Risk** | Medium-High | Possible | $1.85M-$3.85M |
| **Punitive Damages Exposure** | Medium | Possible | Additional 1-2× compensatory |
| **No Damages Cap** | High | N/A | Unlimited exposure |
| **Joint & Several Liability** | Medium | Possible | 100% liability if >15% fault |

**Critical Finding:**

Oregon's **"clear and convincing evidence"** standard is **defendant-favorable** but not insurmountable. Plaintiff must prove:
1. Visible intoxication at time of service (slurred speech, unsteady gait, bloodshot eyes)
2. Plaintiff did not contribute to intoxication

**Key Factual Questions in Smith v. ASBC:**

- **Time period:** 5 beers over what duration? (Critical to visible intoxication analysis)
- **Server observations:** Did servers witness signs of intoxication?
- **Post-departure consumption:** Did Jones drink elsewhere in the 30 minutes before accident?

**No Training Immunity:**

Oregon Alcohol Server Education **does not provide immunity** but may:
- Demonstrate reasonable care
- Mitigate punitive damages
- Support defense that server could not reasonably observe intoxication

**Settlement Dynamics:**

Most dram shop cases **settle rather than go to trial**. Based on Oregon precedent:
- **Strong visible intoxication evidence:** $2M-$3M settlement range
- **Weak visible intoxication evidence:** $800K-$1.5M settlement range
- **Trial risk:** Catastrophic verdicts possible (e.g., $77.5M in *M.M. & N.S.*)

**Recommended Mitigation:**

1. **Document review:** Obtain all server statements, security footage, patron witness statements
2. **Expert retention:** BAC retrograde analysis to determine intoxication level at time of service
3. **Early settlement evaluation:** Assess strength of visible intoxication evidence
4. **Insurance coverage review:** Confirm dram shop policy limits and exclusions

### C. TTB Standards of Identity Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Exposure |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Formula Denial** | Medium | Probable | $50K-$500K (recall/relabeling) |
| **Voluntary Recall Required** | Medium | Probable | Product retrieval costs |
| **Civil Penalties** | Low-Medium | Possible | Undetermined (case-by-case) |
| **Criminal Prosecution** | Low | Unlikely | Only for willful violations |
| **Brand Reputation Damage** | High | Probable | Lost sales, rebranding costs |

**Critical Finding:**

TTB **does not have mandatory recall authority** but can seek voluntary recall. ASBC's options:
1. **Relabel as "bourbon finished with oak staves"** (if staves added as secondary process)
2. **Relabel as "Distilled Spirit Specialty"** (if TTB denies bourbon classification)
3. **Destroy mislabeled product**

**Wood Staves Analysis:**

- **If staves added DURING barrel aging:** Likely complies with "new charred oak container" requirement but requires label disclosure
- **If staves added AFTER barrel aging:** Constitutes secondary finishing; cannot be labeled "straight bourbon"

**Enforcement Philosophy:**

TTB emphasizes **voluntary compliance** rather than punitive enforcement. Typical enforcement sequence:
1. Formula denial or label rejection
2. Request for voluntary recall (if already in commerce)
3. Corrective action options (relabel, destroy, or negotiate)
4. Civil penalties only for non-compliance

**Recommended Mitigation:**

1. **Immediate TTB consultation:** Clarify timing of stave addition (during vs. after aging)
2. **Labeling review:** Prepare alternative labels ("bourbon finished with oak staves")
3. **Inventory assessment:** Quantify volume of affected product
4. **Cost-benefit analysis:** Compare recall costs vs. relabeling costs

### D. ABC Licensing Change of Control Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Exposure |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **License Transfer Delays** | Medium | Probable | 3-12 month approval timeline |
| **Background Check Issues** | Medium | Possible | Deal closure delays |
| **Undisclosed Criminal History** | High | Unlikely | Automatic denial |
| **Prior ABC Violations** | Medium | Possible | Case-by-case review |

**Critical Finding:**

**305 distributor licenses across 50 states** require 50 separate ABC approvals. Each state has unique:
- Background check requirements
- Disqualifying factors
- Rehabilitation standards
- Approval timelines

**Disqualifying Factors (Common Across States):**

1. **Felony convictions** (particularly moral turpitude, violent crimes, alcohol/drug offenses)
2. **Prior ABC violations**
3. **Tax delinquencies**
4. **Multiple DUI convictions**
5. **Financial insolvency**
6. **Dishonesty in application** (automatic denial in most states)

**Rehabilitation Consideration:**

Most states permit **case-by-case rehabilitation showing** for felons, considering:
- Time elapsed since conviction
- Completion of parole/probation
- Evidence of good character
- Nature and severity of original offense

**Timeline Implications:**

- **Fast-track states (CA, TX):** 3-6 months
- **Standard states:** 6-9 months
- **Slow-approval states (NY, NJ):** 9-12 months
- **If rehabilitation required:** Add 3-6 months

**Recommended Mitigation:**

1. **Pre-acquisition due diligence:** Background checks on all principals, officers, key managers
2. **50-state ABC compliance review:** Identify state-specific disqualifying factors
3. **Early filing:** Submit license transfer applications immediately upon deal signing
4. **Disclosure strategy:** Full disclosure of all criminal history, ABC violations, financial issues
5. **Parallel processing:** File in all 50 states simultaneously to minimize cumulative delay

### E. Aggregate Litigation Exposure

**Pending Litigation Summary:**

| Case | Jurisdiction | Type | Exposure Range | Probability of Adverse Outcome |
|------|--------------|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Lone Star Beverages v. ASBC** | TX | Distributor Franchise | $2.8M-$4M | 40-60% (fact-intensive "good cause" analysis) |
| **Smith v. ASBC** | OR | Dram Shop Liability | $1.85M-$3.85M | 30-50% (depends on visible intoxication evidence) |

**Total Litigation Exposure:** $4.65M - $7.85M

**Settlement Recommendation:**

Given the fact-intensive nature of both cases and the cost/risk of trial:
- **Lone Star:** Settle for $2M-$2.5M (avoid arbitration, preserve distributor relationships)
- **Smith v. ASBC:** Settle for $1.5M-$2M (avoid catastrophic jury verdict risk)

**Total Recommended Settlement Budget:** $3.5M - $4.5M

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Distributor Franchise Law — Strong Protections Create Significant Exit Barriers**

The 25 franchise law states create substantial barriers to distributor termination and change of control. Key findings:

- **Perpetual rights are real:** Wisconsin and New Jersey case law demonstrates that distributors can retain territory rights even after 13-18 years of non-performance without compensation.
- **"Good cause" standards are narrow:** Texas, Florida, and New Jersey require proof that distributor failed to comply with "essential, reasonable, and materially significant" requirements. Market conditions, supplier marketing failures, and other external factors may excuse distributor underperformance.
- **Compensation is mandatory even with good cause:** Only Texas potentially allows termination with cause without compensation; all other states require payment even when good cause exists.
- **Valuation is contentious:** Gross profit multiples range from 2× to 10×, with 5-7× being most common. DCF analysis is gaining favor in federal courts but creates expert witness battles over discount rates and projections.

**2. Texas Lone Star Litigation — ASBC's "Good Cause" Defense is Fact-Intensive**

ASBC's termination of Lone Star Beverages for poor performance (declining sales, 88% on-time delivery vs. 95% requirement, understaffing) presents a close case:

- **Favorable factors:** Objective performance metrics (delivery failure, understaffing), 90-day notice and cure opportunity (if provided)
- **Unfavorable factors:** Market conditions may excuse performance decline, ASBC's marketing support obligations may have contributed to underperformance
- **Valuation uncertainty:** No Texas case law establishes clear brand value calculation methodology. Industry practice suggests 2-7× gross profit range, but ASBC may face arbitration if settlement fails.

**Recommendation:** Settle for $2M-$2.5M to avoid arbitration costs and preserve relationships with remaining Texas distributors.

**3. Oregon Dram Shop Liability — "Clear and Convincing Evidence" Standard Provides Defense but Not Immunity**

The Smith v. ASBC case hinges on whether plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing evidence that Jones was "visibly intoxicated" when served 5 beers at ASBC taproom:

- **Critical factual questions:** Time period of consumption, server observations, presence of slurred speech/unsteady gait/bloodshot eyes
- **Favorable defense:** 30-minute gap between departure and accident creates opportunity for post-departure consumption defense
- **Unfavorable factor:** BAC 0.12% suggests significant intoxication, though timing of consumption is key
- **No damages cap:** Oregon's $500,000 noneconomic damages cap has been struck down; catastrophic verdicts are possible (e.g., $77.5M in *M.M. & N.S.*)

**Recommendation:** Settle for $1.5M-$2M to avoid trial risk. Obtain all server statements, security footage, and BAC retrograde analysis to support settlement negotiations.

**4. TTB Bourbon Standards — Wood Staves Create Labeling Issue, Not Criminal Exposure**

ASBC's use of wood staves in bourbon production creates a labeling compliance issue but low risk of criminal prosecution:

- **Standards of identity:** If staves added during barrel aging (not as secondary finishing), product likely complies with "new charred oak container" requirement
- **Labeling requirement:** TTB will likely require disclosure ("bourbon finished with oak staves" or "Distilled Spirit Specialty")
- **Enforcement philosophy:** TTB emphasizes voluntary compliance; formula denial leads to relabeling or recall, not criminal prosecution
- **Financial exposure:** $50K-$500K for recall/relabeling costs, depending on volume of affected product

**Recommendation:** Engage TTB immediately to clarify stave addition timing and obtain approved formula/label. Prepare alternative labels and assess recall vs. relabeling costs.

**5. ABC Licensing — 50-State Approval Process Creates Timeline Risk, Not Deal-Breaker Risk**

The acquisition of 305 distributor licenses across 50 states requires 50 separate ABC approvals, creating:

- **Timeline risk:** 3-12 months per state for background checks and approvals
- **Disclosure requirements:** Full disclosure of criminal history, ABC violations, financial issues required
- **Disqualifying factors:** Felonies (especially moral turpitude, violent crimes), tax delinquencies, DUI, prior ABC violations
- **Rehabilitation opportunity:** Most states permit case-by-case rehabilitation showing for disqualifying factors

**Recommendation:** File license transfer applications in all 50 states immediately upon deal signing. Conduct thorough background checks on all principals and officers. Full disclosure strategy minimizes automatic denial risk.
