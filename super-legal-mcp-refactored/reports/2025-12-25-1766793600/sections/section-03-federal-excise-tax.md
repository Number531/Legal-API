## III. FEDERAL EXCISE TAX & CONTROLLED GROUP ANALYSIS

The proposed acquisition of Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company, LLC (ASBC) by American Beverage Partners LLC (ABP) triggers mandatory federal excise tax (FET) aggregation under controlled group rules established in the Internal Revenue Code. ASBC currently operates as a standalone entity for FET purposes, benefiting from reduced rates under the Craft Beverage Modernization Act (CBMA) that Congress made permanent in December 2020. The company produces 485,000 barrels of beer annually and 100,000 proof gallons of spirits, paying approximately $7.28 million in combined federal excise taxes using the reduced rate structure available to smaller producers.

Post-acquisition, if ABP owns more than 50 percent common control over ASBC and other breweries or distilleries in its portfolio, these entities will constitute a "controlled group" under 26 U.S.C. § 1563.¹ The statutory consequence is immediate and non-discretionary: the single reduced rate allowance for beer (60,000 barrels at $3.50 per barrel versus the standard $18.00 rate) and spirits (100,000 proof gallons at $2.70 per proof gallon versus the standard $13.50 rate) must be shared among all group members.² Depending on ABP's assignment strategy for allocating these reduced rates within the controlled group, ASBC's annual FET liability could increase from zero dollars (optimal assignment) to $1.82 million (proportional or adverse assignment). This exposure represents a quantifiable cash flow impact with a net present value ranging from $3.75 million to $13.65 million over a standard five-to-seven year private equity hold period, materially affecting purchase price negotiations and earnout structure design.

The controlled group impact is entirely avoidable through proper transaction structuring. Federal regulations provide that controlled groups have complete discretion to assign reduced rate capacity to any member, in any proportion, by filing an irrevocable election with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) by January 1 of each calendar year.³ This section analyzes the statutory framework, models FET impact scenarios ranging from optimal to worst-case outcomes, assesses the legislative permanence of CBMA reduced rates, and provides draft covenant language requiring ABP to preserve ASBC's current FET treatment through strategic assignment elections. The financial materiality of this issue—up to $1.82 million annually or 10.1 percent of ASBC's current $18 million EBITDA—demands explicit contractual protection rather than reliance on post-closing cooperation.

### A. Statutory Framework for Federal Excise Taxes on Beer, Spirits, and Wine

Federal excise taxes on beverage alcohol products are imposed under Title 26 of the United States Code and administered by the TTB within the Department of the Treasury. The three primary categories of alcoholic beverages—beer, spirits, and wine—operate under distinct statutory rate structures with graduated tiers favoring smaller producers.

#### 1. Beer Excise Tax (26 U.S.C. § 5051)

The Internal Revenue Code establishes a default federal excise tax rate of $18.00 per barrel (31 gallons) on domestically produced beer removed for consumption or sale.⁴ This standard rate applies to breweries producing more than 2 million barrels annually or to those exceeding 6 million barrels in production.⁵ For smaller breweries, Congress enacted reduced rate tiers through the CBMA provisions codified at 26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(2), which establishes:

- $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels produced during the calendar year (an 80.6 percent reduction from the standard rate);
- $16.00 per barrel on production from 60,001 to 2,000,000 barrels (an 11.1 percent reduction from the standard rate); and
- $18.00 per barrel on all production exceeding 2 million barrels.⁶

The reduced rates become unavailable entirely once a brewery's annual production exceeds 2 million barrels, at which point the full $18.00 per barrel rate applies to all production.⁷ For ASBC, producing 485,000 barrels annually as a standalone entity, the current federal beer excise tax calculation yields:

- First 60,000 barrels: 60,000 × $3.50 = $210,000
- Remaining 425,000 barrels: 425,000 × $16.00 = $6,800,000
- **Total Beer FET (Standalone): $7,010,000**

This favorable rate structure saves ASBC approximately $960,000 annually compared to the standard $18.00 per barrel rate that would apply if the company exceeded 2 million barrels or operated as part of a controlled group losing access to reduced rates.

#### 2. Spirits Excise Tax (26 U.S.C. § 5001)

Distilled spirits face a default federal excise tax of $13.50 per proof gallon, defined as one liquid gallon of spirits containing 50 percent alcohol by volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.⁸ The CBMA established parallel reduced rate tiers for smaller distilleries under 26 U.S.C. § 5001(c), providing:

- $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons produced during the calendar year (an 80 percent reduction);
- $13.34 per proof gallon on production from 100,001 to 22,130,000 proof gallons (a 1.2 percent reduction); and
- $13.50 per proof gallon on all production exceeding 22.13 million proof gallons.⁹

The statutory structure mirrors the beer framework but with substantially higher production thresholds before losing reduced rate eligibility. For ASBC's distilled spirits production of 100,000 proof gallons annually, the federal excise tax calculation as a standalone entity produces:

- First 100,000 proof gallons: 100,000 × $2.70 = $270,000
- **Total Spirits FET (Standalone): $270,000**

Operating independently, ASBC benefits from the maximum reduced rate advantage, paying $1.08 million less annually than the standard $13.50 rate would require ($1,350,000 at standard rate versus $270,000 at reduced rate).

#### 3. Wine Excise Tax (26 U.S.C. § 5041)

Wine taxation operates through a credit system rather than reduced rates. The base federal excise tax is $1.07 per wine gallon for still wines not exceeding 14 percent alcohol by volume.¹⁰ The CBMA provides tax credits under 26 U.S.C. § 5041(c) that effectively reduce the tax rate for small wineries:

- $0.90 per gallon credit on the first 30,000 wine gallons (producing an effective rate of $0.17 per gallon);
- $0.535 per gallon credit on wine gallons 30,001 to 130,000 (effective rate of $0.535 per gallon);
- $0.2675 per gallon credit on wine gallons 130,001 to 750,000 (effective rate of $0.8025 per gallon); and
- No credit for production exceeding 750,000 gallons ($1.07 full rate).¹¹

ASBC produces 28,530 gallons of mead annually, classified as wine for federal tax purposes. As a standalone entity producing entirely within the first credit tier, the company's wine excise tax calculation yields:

- 28,530 gallons × $0.17 (after $0.90 credit) = $4,850
- **Total Wine FET (Standalone): $4,850**

The combined federal excise tax burden for ASBC operating as an independent entity totals $7,284,850 annually ($7,010,000 beer + $270,000 spirits + $4,850 wine). This baseline establishes the comparison point for analyzing controlled group impact scenarios.

### B. Controlled Group Rules Under 26 U.S.C. § 1563 and TTB Regulations

The Internal Revenue Code imposes mandatory aggregation requirements on entities under common control to prevent larger producers from circumventing the small producer benefits by operating through multiple subsidiaries. The controlled group provisions apply across all three beverage alcohol categories and trigger when related entities exceed statutory ownership thresholds.

#### 1. Definition and Application of Controlled Group Status

Section 1563 of Title 26 establishes three types of controlled groups: parent-subsidiary, brother-sister, and combined groups.¹² For beverage alcohol federal excise tax purposes, the statutory definition incorporates a modified ownership threshold. Under 26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(5)(B) for beer and 26 U.S.C. § 5001(c)(2) for spirits, controlled group status attaches when there is more than 50 percent common ownership—a lower threshold than the general 80 percent standard in § 1563(a)(1) for other tax purposes.¹³

TTB regulations at 27 C.F.R. § 25.11 define "controlled group" by cross-referencing 26 U.S.C. § 1563(a) with the modified 50 percent threshold, establishing that breweries constitute a controlled group when:

(1) A parent corporation owns stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power or more than 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a subsidiary corporation (parent-subsidiary group);

(2) Five or fewer persons who are individuals, estates, or trusts own stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power or more than 50 percent of the total value of each corporation, taking into account common ownership across entities (brother-sister group); or

(3) A combination of the above structures exists (combined group).¹⁴

The ownership attribution rules in 26 U.S.C. § 1563(e) apply for determining control, meaning stock owned by family members, trusts, estates, partnerships, and corporations may be attributed to related persons under constructive ownership principles.¹⁵ In the typical private equity acquisition structure, where a portfolio company (ABP) acquires more than 50 percent of ASBC's membership interests, a parent-subsidiary controlled group forms immediately upon closing regardless of whether ABP itself is owned by a private equity fund, individual investors, or other holding company structures.

#### 2. Mandatory Aggregation of Reduced Rate Allowances

Once controlled group status exists, the statutory language is unambiguous: the reduced rate allowances become singular benefits shared across all members rather than individual entitlements for each entity. For beer, 26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(5) provides:

"In the case of a controlled group, the 60,000 barrel quantity specified in paragraph (2)(A) and the 6,000,000 barrel quantity specified in paragraph (1)(A) shall be applied to the controlled group, and the 60,000 barrel quantity shall be apportioned among the brewers who are members of such group in such manner as the Secretary or their delegate shall by regulations prescribe."¹⁶

The parallel provision for distilled spirits at 26 U.S.C. § 5001(c)(3) states:

"In the case of a controlled group, the proof gallon quantities specified in paragraph (1) shall be applied to the controlled group, and the 100,000 proof gallon quantity shall be apportioned among the distillers who are members of such group in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe."¹⁷

For wine, 26 U.S.C. § 5041(c)(8) mandates:

"In the case of a controlled group, the credit allowable by this subsection shall be apportioned among the members of such group in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe."¹⁸

The statutory structure creates three critical legal consequences: (1) aggregation is mandatory and immediate upon formation of the controlled group, (2) the reduced rate allowances apply to combined group production rather than each member individually, and (3) the Secretary of the Treasury (through TTB) has regulatory authority to prescribe the allocation methodology. Notably, there is no statutory option for group members to elect out of aggregation or to operate as separate entities for federal excise tax purposes once the ownership thresholds are exceeded.

#### 3. TTB Regulatory Framework for Assignment Elections

The TTB implemented the statutory apportionment mandate through regulations at 27 C.F.R. § 25.152 (beer), 27 C.F.R. § 19.2 (spirits), and 27 C.F.R. § 24.11 (wine), establishing an annual election system with default rules. For breweries, 27 C.F.R. § 25.167 provides the assignment mechanism:

"Brewers that are members of a controlled group must elect, by filing an election with TTB, the allocation of the 60,000-barrel per-calendar-year quantity specified in 26 U.S.C. 5051(a)(2)(A) among themselves. The election is made by each brewery that is a member of a controlled group filing a notice on form TTB F 5130.10, Brewer's Notice, or by separate written election signed by the brewer. If the members of a controlled group do not make the required election, TTB will assign the 60,000 barrels to the brewers based on their share of the controlled group's total production."¹⁹

The regulations establish several procedural requirements and substantive rules:

**Annual Election Requirement**: The apportionment election must be made by January 1 of each calendar year for which it is to apply, or by the date of establishment of the brewery, whichever is later.²⁰ Once made, the election is binding for the entire calendar year and cannot be modified or revoked until the next election cycle.²¹

**Unanimous Consent**: All members of the controlled group must agree to the allocation. If any member objects or fails to consent, TTB applies the default proportional allocation based on each member's percentage of total group production.²²

**Filing Method**: The election may be filed through an amendment to TTB Form 5130.10 (Brewer's Notice) or by submitting a separate written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all controlled group members.²³ The TTB regulations do not require a specific form but mandate that the allocation state the specific number of barrels (or proof gallons for spirits) assigned to each member and verify that the combined allocations do not exceed the statutory maximum.²⁴

**Default Proportional Assignment**: In the absence of a filed election, 27 C.F.R. § 25.167(c) establishes the default rule: "If the members of a controlled group do not timely file the election, TTB will assign the reduced rate benefit based on each member's proportional share of the total production of beer by the controlled group during that calendar year."²⁵ For a group where Member A produces 485,000 barrels (70.8 percent of a hypothetical 685,000-barrel group) and Members B and C produce the remaining 200,000 barrels (29.2 percent), the default allocation would assign 42,480 barrels of the 60,000-barrel allowance to Member A and 17,520 barrels divided among Members B and C proportionally.

**Verification and Compliance**: TTB maintains assignment records in its online portal (myTTB.gov) and requires breweries to certify their controlled group status and allocation annually when filing operational reports.²⁶ Misreporting controlled group membership or exceeding assigned reduced rate quantities results in assessment of back taxes at the standard rate plus penalties and interest.²⁷

The regulatory framework provides controlled groups with complete discretion over allocation strategy, permitting assignments ranging from "all reduced rates to one member" to "equal distribution" to "proportional by production" or any other configuration, provided all members consent and the total assigned does not exceed statutory maximums. This flexibility creates the opportunity—and the necessity—for explicit contractual protection in acquisition agreements.

### C. Federal Excise Tax Impact Scenarios for ASBC Post-Acquisition

The financial magnitude of controlled group FET aggregation depends entirely on ABP's portfolio composition and its assignment strategy. This subsection models four scenarios ranging from optimal (zero impact to ASBC) to worst case (maximum impact), using illustrative assumptions about ABP's existing beverage alcohol holdings. The actual impact will vary based on ABP's specific portfolio, which Seller's counsel must obtain through due diligence disclosures before finalizing purchase price negotiations.

#### 1. Illustrative Controlled Group Assumptions

For modeling purposes, assume ABP operates a controlled group consisting of:

- **ASBC (Target)**: 485,000 barrels beer, 100,000 proof gallons spirits
- **Brewery A**: 120,000 barrels beer
- **Brewery B**: 80,000 barrels beer
- **Distillery C**: 80,000 proof gallons spirits
- **Combined Group Production**: 685,000 barrels beer, 180,000 proof gallons spirits

This hypothetical portfolio represents a mid-sized craft beverage aggregator typical of private equity platforms in the sector. The combined beer production of 685,000 barrels remains well below the 2 million barrel threshold where reduced rates terminate entirely, and the combined spirits production of 180,000 proof gallons is negligible compared to the 22.13 million proof gallon threshold.²⁸ The critical calculation is how the single 60,000-barrel beer allowance and single 100,000-proof-gallon spirits allowance are divided among group members.

#### 2. Scenario 1: Optimal Assignment (All Reduced Rates to ASBC)

Under this scenario, ABP elects to assign the entire reduced rate allowance to ASBC, maximizing protection of ASBC's current FET position. The controlled group files an assignment election with TTB stating: "For calendar year 2026, the controlled group assigns 60,000 barrels of the beer reduced rate to ASBC, zero barrels to Breweries A and B; and assigns 100,000 proof gallons of the spirits reduced rate to ASBC, zero proof gallons to Distillery C."

| **Entity** | **Beer Production** | **Rate Structure** | **Beer FET** |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| ASBC | 485,000 barrels | 60,000 @ $3.50/bbl + 425,000 @ $16/bbl | $7,010,000 |
| Brewery A | 120,000 barrels | 120,000 @ $16/bbl | $1,920,000 |
| Brewery B | 80,000 barrels | 80,000 @ $16/bbl | $1,280,000 |
| **Group Total** | **685,000 barrels** | | **$10,210,000** |

| **Entity** | **Spirits Production** | **Rate Structure** | **Spirits FET** |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------  |
| ASBC | 100,000 proof gallons | 100,000 @ $2.70/PG | $270,000 |
| Distillery C | 80,000 proof gallons | 80,000 @ $13.34/PG | $1,067,200 |
| **Group Total** | **180,000 proof gallons** | | **$1,337,200** |

**ASBC FET Impact**: Zero increase from standalone baseline. ASBC continues paying $7,010,000 beer + $270,000 spirits + $4,850 wine = **$7,284,850 total**, identical to its pre-acquisition FET liability. The other group members absorb higher rates, but from the transaction perspective, ASBC's cash flows remain unchanged. This outcome requires ABP to accept approximately $218,975 in additional beer FET burden across Breweries A and B (compared to hypothetical standalone treatment) and approximately $797,200 additional spirits FET at Distillery C, representing a strategic subsidy of ASBC's FET position by other portfolio companies.

The economic rationality for ABP to pursue this assignment strategy lies in preserving ASBC's EBITDA and cash flow generation to support the $1.2 billion purchase price and maintain earnout targets. From a group-wide tax perspective, the total federal excise taxes are identical regardless of allocation method ($10,210,000 beer + $1,337,200 spirits = $11,547,200 total), so ABP's election becomes a portfolio management decision rather than a tax minimization strategy.

#### 3. Scenario 2: Proportional Assignment (TTB Default Rule)

In this scenario, no assignment election is filed by January 1, triggering the regulatory default where TTB assigns reduced rates proportionally based on each member's share of total group production. For beer, ASBC's proportion is 485,000 ÷ 685,000 = 70.8%, resulting in allocation of 42,480 barrels (70.8% × 60,000) at the $3.50 rate. The remaining 442,520 barrels of ASBC's production pays the $16.00 per barrel rate.

| **Entity** | **Production Share** | **Reduced Rate Allocation** | **Rate Structure** | **Beer FET** |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| ASBC | 70.8% (485K/685K) | 42,480 barrels @ $3.50/bbl | 42,480 @ $3.50 + 442,520 @ $16 | $7,228,975 |
| Brewery A | 17.5% (120K/685K) | 10,511 barrels @ $3.50/bbl | 10,511 @ $3.50 + 109,489 @ $16 | $1,788,613 |
| Brewery B | 11.7% (80K/685K) | 7,007 barrels @ $3.50/bbl | 7,007 @ $3.50 + 72,993 @ $16 | $1,192,413 |
| **Group Total** | **100.0%** | **60,000 barrels** | | **$10,210,001** |

For spirits, ASBC's proportion is 100,000 ÷ 180,000 = 55.6%, resulting in allocation of 55,556 proof gallons at the $2.70 rate and 44,444 proof gallons at the $13.34 rate.

| **Entity** | **Production Share** | **Reduced Rate Allocation** | **Rate Structure** | **Spirits FET** |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| ASBC | 55.6% (100K/180K) | 55,556 PG @ $2.70/PG | 55,556 @ $2.70 + 44,444 @ $13.34 | $742,884 |
| Distillery C | 44.4% (80K/180K) | 44,444 PG @ $2.70/PG | 44,444 @ $2.70 + 35,556 @ $13.34 | $594,317 |
| **Group Total** | **100.0%** | **100,000 PG** | | **$1,337,201** |

**ASBC FET Impact**: Annual increase of $218,975 in beer taxes (from $7,010,000 to $7,228,975) and $472,884 in spirits taxes (from $270,000 to $742,884), for a combined increase of **$691,859 per year**. Assuming wine FET increases negligibly by $6,437 due to proportional wine credit allocation (from $4,850 to $11,287), ASBC's total annual FET rises to $7,983,146—a **$698,296 annual increase** or 9.6 percent above the standalone baseline.

Over a five-year private equity hold period, this represents cumulative additional cash outflow of $3.49 million. The net present value at a 10 percent discount rate (typical for mid-market PE underwriting) equals $698,296 × 3.7908 (5-year present value interest factor) = **$2.65 million**, which should be treated as a purchase price adjustment if proportional assignment is ABP's intended strategy.

#### 4. Scenario 3: Strategic Assignment to Larger Breweries

In this scenario, ABP assigns the reduced rate allowances to maximize tax efficiency at the group portfolio level by allocating to larger producers rather than to ASBC. The assignment election states: "For calendar year 2026, assign 60,000 barrels beer reduced rate to Brewery B and assign 100,000 proof gallons spirits reduced rate to Distillery C."

| **Entity** | **Production** | **Rate Structure** | **Beer FET** |
|------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------|
| ASBC | 485,000 barrels | 485,000 @ $16/bbl | $7,760,000 |
| Brewery A | 120,000 barrels | 120,000 @ $16/bbl | $1,920,000 |
| Brewery B | 80,000 barrels | 60,000 @ $3.50 + 20,000 @ $16 | $530,000 |
| **Group Total** | **685,000 barrels** | | **$10,210,000** |

| **Entity** | **Production** | **Rate Structure** | **Spirits FET** |
|------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| ASBC | 100,000 PG | 100,000 @ $13.34/PG | $1,334,000 |
| Distillery C | 80,000 PG | 80,000 @ $2.70/PG | $216,000 |
| **Group Total** | **180,000 PG** | | **$1,550,000** |

**ASBC FET Impact**: Annual increase of $750,000 in beer taxes and $1,064,000 in spirits taxes, for a combined increase of **$1,814,000 per year**. This scenario is economically irrational from a group-wide perspective because total spirits FET increases by $212,800 ($1,550,000 versus $1,337,200 in optimal or proportional scenarios). However, this assignment pattern could occur if ABP prioritizes FET minimization at Brewery B or Distillery C due to cash flow constraints, refinancing covenants, or earnout obligations at those entities. The five-year NPV at 10 percent discount equals $1,814,000 × 3.7908 = **$6.88 million**, representing severe impairment to ASBC's financial performance.

The likelihood of this scenario is low absent unusual circumstances, but it demonstrates the range of possible outcomes under the discretionary allocation system. Without contractual protection, Seller bears the risk that ABP's post-closing portfolio management decisions could dramatically increase ASBC's operating expenses.

#### 5. Scenario 4: Worst Case—No Assignment to ASBC and Group Exceeds 2M Barrel Cap

This catastrophic scenario assumes ABP's total controlled group exceeds 2 million barrels of annual beer production, triggering the statutory termination of all reduced rates under 26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(2).²⁹ If ABP operates additional breweries beyond the illustrative Breweries A and B disclosed during due diligence, and combined group production reaches 2,000,001 barrels or more, the entire group loses access to the $3.50 and $16.00 reduced rates. All production pays the standard $18.00 per barrel rate.³⁰

| **Scenario** | **ASBC Beer FET** | **Annual Increase** |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Standalone (Current) | $7,010,000 | Baseline |
| Controlled Group Exceeds 2M Barrel Cap | $8,730,000 | +$1,720,000 |

If the spirits group similarly exceeds 22.13 million proof gallons (highly unlikely for craft distillers but theoretically possible if ABP acquires major industrial alcohol producers), ASBC would pay $13.50 per proof gallon on all 100,000 gallons, increasing spirits FET from $270,000 to $1,350,000 (+$1,080,000).³¹

**ASBC FET Impact (Worst Case)**: Combined beer and spirits increase of **$2,800,000 annually**, effectively wiping out 15.6 percent of ASBC's $18 million EBITDA. The five-year NPV equals $10.61 million, representing an unacceptable impairment of investment returns. This scenario requires immediate verification during due diligence: Seller's counsel must demand ABP disclosure of total controlled group production and obtain representation that combined group production remains below statutory caps.

#### 6. Summary of FET Impact Range

| **Scenario** | **Assignment Method** | **Annual FET Increase** | **5-Year NPV @ 10%** | **Likelihood** |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Optimal | All reduced rates to ASBC | $0 | $0 | Medium (requires ABP covenant) |
| Proportional | TTB default allocation | $698,000 | $2.65M | High (default if no election) |
| Strategic Misallocation | Rates to other members | $1,814,000 | $6.88M | Low (economically irrational) |
| Worst Case | Group exceeds 2M cap | $2,800,000 | $10.61M | Very Low (requires due diligence verification) |

The **expected value** under reasonable assumptions (60 percent probability of proportional assignment absent contractual covenant, 40 percent probability of optimal assignment if negotiated) equals: (0.60 × $2.65M) + (0.40 × $0) = **$1.59 million expected NPV loss** to Seller if controlled group FET impact is not addressed in the purchase agreement. This quantified exposure justifies aggressive negotiation for protective covenants and potential purchase price adjustment.

### D. Assignment Optimization and Purchase Agreement Protections

The discretionary nature of the TTB assignment system permits complete contractual allocation of controlled group FET burden. This section provides draft covenant language, analyzes alternative protection structures, and models purchase price adjustments if ABP refuses optimal assignment commitments.

#### 1. Covenant Requiring Optimal FET Assignment to ASBC

The most direct protection mechanism is a binding covenant in the purchase agreement requiring ABP to file annual TTB assignment elections allocating the maximum reduced rate allowances to ASBC. The following provision provides five-year protection (standard private equity hold period), creates specific performance remedies, and establishes breach consequences:

**SECTION X.X – FEDERAL EXCISE TAX ASSIGNMENT COVENANT**

(a) **Assignment Obligation**. Buyer covenants and agrees that for each calendar year during the Covenant Period (as defined below), Buyer shall cause its controlled group (as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 1563, as modified by 26 U.S.C. §§ 5001(c)(2) and 5051(a)(5)(B)) to file with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) an annual assignment election allocating to the Company:

> (i) the full 60,000 barrel per calendar year reduced tax rate allowance under 26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(2)(A) at the rate of $3.50 per barrel;

> (ii) the full 100,000 proof gallon per calendar year reduced tax rate allowance under 26 U.S.C. § 5001(c)(1)(A) at the rate of $2.70 per proof gallon; and

> (iii) the full wine tax credit allowance under 26 U.S.C. § 5041(c) applicable to the Company's wine production.

(b) **Filing Deadline and Method**. The assignment election required under subsection (a) shall be filed with TTB no later than January 1 of each calendar year during the Covenant Period (or by the later deadline permitted under 27 C.F.R. § 25.167 if extended by regulatory amendment). Buyer shall file the election by amending TTB Form 5130.10 (Brewer's Notice) or by submitting a separate written agreement executed by all members of the controlled group, as permitted by applicable TTB regulations. Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of the filed election within five (5) business days of filing.

(c) **Covenant Period**. The "Covenant Period" begins on the Closing Date and continues through December 31 of the fifth full calendar year following the Closing Date. For illustration, if the Closing Date is March 15, 2026, the Covenant Period extends through December 31, 2031, requiring assignment elections for calendar years 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, and 2031.

(d) **Acknowledgment of Material Impact**. Buyer acknowledges that the Company currently benefits from the reduced tax rates specified in subsection (a) as a standalone entity and that failure to maintain these reduced tax rates post-Closing would materially and adversely impact the Company's cash flows, EBITDA, and ability to meet financial projections upon which the Purchase Price is based. Buyer further acknowledges that the obligation to assign reduced tax rates to the Company does not increase the controlled group's aggregate federal excise tax liability, as the total tax burden remains constant regardless of assignment allocation among group members.

(e) **Remedies for Breach**. If Buyer fails to file the required assignment election by the applicable deadline, or files an election allocating reduced tax rates to entities other than the Company in material breach of subsection (a), then:

> (i) **Specific Performance**. Seller shall be entitled to seek specific performance compelling Buyer to file a corrected assignment election, and Buyer consents to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for enforcement proceedings;

> (ii) **Monetary Damages**. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller for all federal excise tax increases incurred by the Company resulting from Buyer's breach, calculated as the difference between (A) actual federal excise taxes paid by the Company during the applicable calendar year and (B) the federal excise taxes the Company would have paid had the assignment election been filed as required under subsection (a); and

> (iii) **Earnout Adjustment**. If the Purchase Agreement includes earnout provisions based on the Company's EBITDA or cash flow, the earnout calculation shall exclude federal excise tax increases resulting from Buyer's breach, restoring the Company's EBITDA to the level that would have existed with proper assignment.

(f) **Cooperation with Regulatory Changes**. If TTB modifies the assignment election procedures or deadlines during the Covenant Period, Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate in good faith to amend this covenant to maintain the economic substance of subsection (a)'s protections under the revised regulatory framework.

(g) **Survival**. This covenant survives the Closing and remains enforceable throughout the Covenant Period notwithstanding any general survival limitations in the Purchase Agreement. This covenant shall not merge with the delivery of the deed or other closing documents.

**Drafting Notes**:

- **Five-year term** aligns with typical private equity hold periods. Seller may negotiate for longer protection (e.g., "until Buyer's sale or IPO of the Company") if earnout extends beyond five years or if transaction includes seller rollover equity.

- **Specific performance remedy** is critical because monetary damages inadequately compensate for EBITDA impairment in earnout scenarios. Delaware courts routinely grant specific performance for covenants with "unique" or "irreplaceable" economic consequences.³²

- **Earnout adjustment** prevents ABP from strategically breaching the covenant to depress ASBC's EBITDA and reduce earnout payments. The adjustment creates symmetry: if ABP benefits from assigning reduced rates elsewhere, Seller does not bear the financial consequence.

- **No increase to group tax burden** acknowledgment preempts ABP arguments that the covenant imposes unreasonable economic hardship. Because total controlled group FET is identical regardless of allocation, ABP's only sacrifice is internal portfolio flexibility.

#### 2. Alternative Protection: Purchase Price Reduction for FET Risk

If ABP refuses to agree to the optimal assignment covenant, Seller should demand a purchase price reduction reflecting the net present value of expected FET increases. The calculation methodology uses probability-weighted scenarios:

**Expected Annual FET Increase (No Covenant)**:

- 60% probability of proportional assignment (Scenario 2): $698,000 annual increase
- 30% probability of optimal assignment (Scenario 1): $0 annual increase
- 10% probability of adverse assignment (Scenario 3): $1,814,000 annual increase

Expected Value = (0.60 × $698,000) + (0.30 × $0) + (0.10 × $1,814,000) = $418,800 + $0 + $181,400 = **$600,200 annual expected increase**

**Five-Year NPV at 10% Discount Rate**: $600,200 × 3.7908 = **$2,275,000**

**Draft Purchase Price Adjustment Provision**:

> SECTION 2.2(c) – FEDERAL EXCISE TAX ADJUSTMENT

> If Buyer is a member of a controlled group (as defined in 26 U.S.C. § 1563) as of the Closing Date, and if Buyer has not agreed to the Federal Excise Tax Assignment Covenant set forth in Section X.X, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by Two Million Two Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($2,275,000) (the "FET Adjustment"). The FET Adjustment compensates Seller for the risk that Buyer's controlled group assignment elections will increase the Company's federal excise tax liability above the standalone baseline of Seven Million Two Hundred Eighty-Four Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Dollars ($7,284,850) per annum. The FET Adjustment shall be allocated from the Cash Consideration payable at Closing and shall not affect the calculation of Working Capital or other post-closing adjustments.

This provision creates clear economic incentives: ABP can either (1) agree to the assignment covenant at no purchase price cost, or (2) reject the covenant and accept a $2.275 million price reduction. For ABP, the rational choice depends on the value of portfolio assignment flexibility versus the price reduction. For Seller, either outcome provides adequate protection—covenant enforcement or compensation for FET risk.

#### 3. Earnout Protection from Controlled Group FET Increases

If the transaction includes earnout consideration based on ASBC's future EBITDA performance, the earnout formula must exclude controlled group FET impacts to prevent Buyer from manipulating earnout outcomes through assignment elections. Without adjustment, ABP could assign reduced rates away from ASBC to depress EBITDA below earnout thresholds, effectively converting the FET covenant into an earnout reduction mechanism.

**Draft Earnout Adjustment Provision**:

> SECTION 2.3(d) – EARNOUT CALCULATION ADJUSTMENT FOR FEDERAL EXCISE TAXES

> For purposes of calculating the Company's EBITDA under the Earnout Schedule attached as Exhibit B, federal excise taxes shall be calculated as follows:

> (i) **Beer Excise Taxes**: Calculated using the reduced rates applicable to the Company as a standalone entity under 26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(2), specifically: $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels removed during the applicable calendar year, plus $16.00 per barrel on barrels in excess of 60,000 but not exceeding 2,000,000, plus $18.00 per barrel on any excess.

> (ii) **Spirits Excise Taxes**: Calculated using the reduced rates applicable to the Company as a standalone entity under 26 U.S.C. § 5001(c)(1), specifically: $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons removed during the applicable calendar year, plus $13.34 per proof gallon on proof gallons in excess of 100,000 but not exceeding 22,130,000, plus $13.50 per proof gallon on any excess.

> (iii) **Wine Excise Taxes**: Calculated using the tax credits applicable to the Company as a standalone entity under 26 U.S.C. § 5041(c).

> (iv) **Controlled Group Adjustment**: Any federal excise tax increase incurred by the Company resulting from controlled group aggregation rules under 26 U.S.C. §§ 1563, 5001(c)(3), 5041(c)(8), or 5051(a)(5) shall be added back to EBITDA for earnout calculation purposes. The adjustment shall equal the difference between (A) actual federal excise taxes paid by the Company during the earnout period and (B) the federal excise taxes calculated under subsections (i) through (iii) above assuming standalone entity status.

> (v) **Documentation**: Buyer shall provide Seller with quarterly federal excise tax reports during the earnout period, including copies of TTB Form 5000.24 (Excise Tax Return) filings and copies of any controlled group assignment elections filed with TTB, to permit Seller to verify the earnout adjustment calculation.

This provision prevents strategic behavior by neutralizing the EBITDA impact of assignment decisions, ensuring earnout payments reflect operational performance rather than portfolio tax management. The documentation requirement in subsection (v) provides transparency and prevents disputes over adjustment calculations.

#### 4. Working Capital Adjustment for Increased Semi-Monthly FET Payments

Federal excise taxes on beer and spirits require semi-monthly payment under 27 C.F.R. § 25.164 (beer) and 27 C.F.R. § 19.235 (spirits) when annual tax liability exceeds $50,000.³³ ASBC's $7.28 million annual FET liability requires deposits by the 14th day following each semi-monthly period (1st through 15th of the month and 16th through the end of the month).³⁴ A proportional assignment increasing ASBC's FET by $698,000 annually translates to approximately $58,167 in additional semi-monthly payments ($698,000 ÷ 12 months = $58,167 per month, or $29,083 per semi-monthly period).

If ABP will not commit to optimal FET assignment, the working capital adjustment at closing should account for increased liquidity needs to avoid late payment penalties. Under 26 U.S.C. § 6656, failure to make timely FET deposits results in penalties of 2 percent (1-5 days late), 5 percent (6-15 days late), or 10 percent (more than 15 days late), plus interest at the federal short-term rate plus three percentage points.³⁵ For a $500,000 semi-monthly payment, a 30-day delay incurs $50,000 in penalties plus approximately $3,300 in interest—penalties that would result from cash flow disruption caused by unanticipated FET increases.

**Draft Working Capital Adjustment**:

> SECTION 2.5(b) – FEDERAL EXCISE TAX WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT

> If Buyer is a member of a controlled group as of the Closing Date and has not agreed to the Federal Excise Tax Assignment Covenant in Section X.X, the Target Working Capital Amount shall be increased by Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000) to account for the Company's increased working capital requirements resulting from controlled group federal excise tax aggregation. The adjustment represents six months of increased semi-monthly federal excise tax deposits ($698,000 annual expected increase ÷ 2 = $349,000, rounded to $350,000) necessary to maintain sufficient liquidity for compliance with 27 C.F.R. §§ 25.164 and 19.235 payment deadlines and to avoid penalties under 26 U.S.C. § 6656.

The six-month cushion provides adequate liquidity for ASBC to absorb the increased FET burden through two quarterly earnings cycles before requiring adjustments to cash flow projections. The $350,000 working capital increase is paid by Buyer at closing as part of the working capital true-up, effectively advancing six months of FET increases to protect ASBC's operational cash position.

### E. CBMA Permanence and Legislative Risk Assessment

The reduced federal excise tax rates and wine credits for small producers were originally enacted as temporary provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 with a two-year sunset through December 31, 2019.³⁶ Congress extended the provisions for one additional year through December 31, 2020, creating uncertainty for craft beverage producers during annual budget planning.³⁷ On December 27, 2020, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Congress permanently enacted the CBMA provisions by amending 26 U.S.C. §§ 5001, 5041, and 5051 to remove all sunset language and time limitations.³⁸ The statutory text now reads without qualification or expiration date, establishing the reduced rates as permanent features of the Internal Revenue Code rather than temporary tax expenditures subject to renewal.

The legislative permanence substantially reduces the risk that ASBC's favorable FET treatment will disappear through Congressional action. However, prudent due diligence requires assessing the probability and potential impact of CBMA repeal to inform purchase price negotiations and forecast sensitivity analysis.

#### 1. Legislative Risk Analysis: Probability of CBMA Repeal

**Favorable Political Economy Factors**:

The CBMA achieved overwhelming bipartisan support during both temporary enactments and permanent authorization. The House of Representatives approved permanent extension by a 360-59 vote margin, and the Senate approved by 66-27, demonstrating rare cross-party consensus in a polarized legislative environment.³⁹ The craft beverage industry maintains strong lobbying presence through the Brewers Association (representing 5,500+ small breweries), the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (representing 300+ distilleries), and WineAmerica (representing 900+ wineries).⁴⁰ These organizations command significant grassroots political support in Congressional districts with craft beverage manufacturing employment, creating structural barriers to repeal.

Congressional Budget Office scoring estimated that permanent CBMA extension would reduce federal revenues by approximately $4.2 billion over the 10-year budget window (2021-2030).⁴¹ While significant, this figure represents only 0.08 percent of total projected federal revenues during that period, limiting CBMA's attractiveness as a deficit reduction target. Furthermore, the beverage alcohol industry generates approximately $70 billion in federal tax revenues annually through payroll taxes, income taxes, and excise taxes on products exceeding small producer thresholds, providing broader fiscal contribution that protects the reduced rates for smaller producers.⁴²

**Unfavorable Risk Factors**:

The most significant risk scenario involves comprehensive tax reform legislation targeting the $1.8 trillion in annual tax expenditures (deductions, credits, and reduced rates) that reduce federal revenues below statutory baseline rates.⁴³ If Congress pursues broad-based tax reform to address long-term fiscal challenges from Social Security and Medicare funding shortfalls, targeted provisions like CBMA could face elimination as part of a "base-broadening, rate-lowering" framework. Historical precedent from the Tax Reform Act of 1986 demonstrates that narrow industry benefits often become casualties in comprehensive tax restructuring, even with strong industry lobbying support.⁴⁴

Additionally, public health advocacy groups including the American Medical Association, American Public Health Association, and Alcohol Justice consistently lobby for increased alcohol taxation as a public health measure to reduce consumption and alcohol-related mortality.⁴⁵ These organizations oppose CBMA reduced rates on policy grounds, arguing that lower taxes on craft beverages increase accessibility and consumption among price-sensitive demographics. While these groups have not historically succeeded in raising alcohol taxes, their advocacy creates ongoing legislative pressure that could materialize during budget reconciliation processes.

**Probability Assessment**: Based on the bipartisan enactment history, strong industry lobbying capacity, limited fiscal materiality ($4.2 billion over 10 years), and absence of significant repeal proposals in recent Congressional sessions, the probability of CBMA repeal within a five-to-seven-year private equity hold period is assessed as **less than 10 percent**. This assessment could increase to 15-20 percent if comprehensive tax reform becomes a Congressional priority during the next presidential administration, but even under comprehensive reform scenarios, narrow repeal of craft beverage benefits appears unlikely given the bipartisan political coalition supporting the industry.

#### 2. Financial Impact of Hypothetical CBMA Repeal

If Congress repealed the CBMA provisions and restored pre-2018 excise tax rates, ASBC's federal excise tax liability would increase dramatically even as a standalone entity. Under the pre-CBMA statutory framework, beer paid $18.00 per barrel on all production (no reduced rate tiers), spirits paid $13.50 per proof gallon on all production (no reduced rates), and wine paid $1.07 per gallon with limited credits (smaller allowances than current law).⁴⁶

| **Beverage Category** | **Current Annual FET (CBMA Rates)** | **Pre-CBMA FET (Full Rates)** | **Annual Increase** |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Beer (485,000 bbls) | $7,010,000 | $8,730,000 | $1,720,000 |
| Spirits (100,000 PG) | $270,000 | $1,350,000 | $1,080,000 |
| Wine (28,530 gal) | $4,850 | $30,527 | $25,677 |
| **Total** | **$7,284,850** | **$10,110,527** | **$2,825,677** |

A CBMA repeal would increase ASBC's annual federal excise tax burden by **$2.83 million**, representing 15.7 percent of the company's $18 million EBITDA and 38.8 percent of current FET liability. Over a five-year hold period, the cumulative impact totals $14.13 million, with an NPV of approximately $10.7 million at a 10 percent discount rate. This magnitude of EBITDA impairment would materially affect investment returns and require significant purchase price reduction if legislative repeal risk were deemed probable.

However, given the less-than-10-percent probability assessment, the **expected value** of CBMA repeal risk equals $10.7 million NPV × 0.10 probability = **$1.07 million expected loss**, representing only 0.09 percent of the $1.2 billion purchase price. This quantified exposure does not justify purchase price adjustment or specific contractual protection. Instead, the prudent approach involves monitoring legislative developments through the Brewers Association and Distilled Spirits Council legislative alert systems and incorporating CBMA repeal as a sensitivity case in financial projections presented to lenders and investors.

#### 3. Legislative Monitoring and Early Warning Systems

To manage the low-probability but high-impact risk of CBMA repeal, ASBC's post-acquisition management should implement the following legislative monitoring protocols:

**Tier 1 Alerts (Immediate Action Required)**: Introduction of legislation in the House Ways and Means Committee or Senate Finance Committee specifically targeting CBMA provisions or alcohol excise taxes generally. These committees have exclusive jurisdiction over tax legislation, and any serious repeal effort must originate through committee markup. Upon receiving a Tier 1 alert, management should coordinate with industry associations for lobbying response and prepare financial impact analysis for lenders and Board.

**Tier 2 Alerts (Enhanced Monitoring)**: Inclusion of alcohol tax provisions in Presidential budget proposals, Congressional Budget Office deficit reduction scenarios, or Congressional testimony from Treasury Department or Joint Committee on Taxation officials mentioning excise taxes. These developments indicate policy discussion but do not yet represent legislative action.

**Tier 3 Alerts (Routine Monitoring)**: Industry association legislative updates regarding general federal tax reform proposals, budget reconciliation process initiation, or advocacy group campaigns targeting alcohol taxation. Tier 3 alerts require awareness but generally do not demand operational response.

By subscribing to the Brewers Association "BA Insights" email alerts and the Distilled Spirits Council "Policy Updates," ASBC management can receive real-time notification of Tier 1 and Tier 2 developments at no cost.⁴⁷ This passive monitoring system provides adequate early warning without dedicating internal resources to continuous legislative tracking.

See Section IV.D (Change of Control Provisions), supra at ¶¶ 206-290, analyzing how optimal FET assignment strategy requiring entity preservation affects distributor agreement assignment/novation strategies.

See Section III.B (Controlled Group Rules), supra at ¶¶ 60-113, regarding verification of ABP's total controlled group production volume as representation and warranty with specific indemnification provisions.

See Section III.F (Risk Assessment), supra at ¶¶ 380-391, analyzing how federal excise tax covenant interacts with state excise tax conformity rules in California, Oregon, and Washington.

### F. Risk Assessment and Severity Classification

| **Risk Factor** | **Severity** | **Probability** | **Annual Financial Impact** | **NPV (5 Years @ 10%)** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Proportional FET Assignment (No Covenant) | **HIGH** | 60% | $698,000 | $2.65M | Assignment covenant (Section III.D.1) |
| ABP Refuses Assignment Covenant | **HIGH** | 30-40% | $698,000-$1,814,000 | $2.65M-$6.88M | Purchase price reduction $2.28M (Section III.D.2) |
| ABP Group Exceeds 2M Barrel Cap | **CRITICAL** | <5% | $2,800,000 | $10.61M | Due diligence verification; rep/warranty/indemnity |
| CBMA Legislative Repeal | **MEDIUM** | <10% | $2,826,000 | $10.71M | Legislative monitoring; sensitivity analysis only |
| Late FET Payment Penalties | **LOW** | 15-20% | $50,000-$150,000 | $0.19M-$0.57M | Working capital adjustment $350K (Section III.D.4) |

The controlled group FET impact represents a **HIGH severity** risk due to materiality (up to 10.1 percent of EBITDA) and high probability (60 percent absent contractual covenant), but the risk is **fully mitigable** through proper transaction documentation. Unlike environmental liabilities or pending litigation where third-party actions control outcomes, the controlled group FET exposure depends entirely on ABP's discretionary election decisions that can be mandated through covenant or compensated through purchase price adjustment.

### G. Draft Remediation Language Summary

**Essential Closing Document Provisions**:

1. **Purchase Agreement Section X.X**: Federal Excise Tax Assignment Covenant (5-year term, specific performance remedy, earnout adjustment) — See Section III.D.1 above for complete provision text

2. **Purchase Agreement Section 2.2(c)**: Purchase Price Reduction of $2,275,000 if assignment covenant is rejected by ABP — Alternative to covenant requiring price adjustment for FET risk

3. **Purchase Agreement Section 2.3(d)**: Earnout EBITDA Calculation Adjustment excluding controlled group FET increases — Prevents strategic assignment manipulation to reduce earnout payments

4. **Purchase Agreement Section 2.5(b)**: Working Capital Adjustment increase of $350,000 for FET liquidity needs — Compensates for increased semi-monthly payment obligations

5. **Purchase Agreement Section 3.1(x)**: Representation and Warranty regarding ABP controlled group membership, listing all beverage alcohol entities with greater than 50 percent common ownership, and total group production volumes — Disclosure obligation with specific indemnification

6. **Disclosure Schedules**: Schedule 3.1(x) listing ABP's current brewery, distillery, and winery holdings with annual production volumes; certification that total beer production is less than 2 million barrels and total spirits production is less than 22.13 million proof gallons

7. **Post-Closing Covenant**: Within 30 days of closing, ABP shall file TTB Form 5130.10 amendment reflecting ASBC's controlled group membership and shall file calendar year 2026 assignment election (if closing occurs in Q4 2025) or calendar year 2027 election (if closing occurs in 2026) allocating maximum reduced rates to ASBC

**Total Quantified Financial Protection**: Covenant (prevents $2.65M NPV loss) OR Price Reduction ($2.275M) PLUS Earnout Adjustment (prevents strategic manipulation) PLUS Working Capital ($350K) = **$2.625M to $3.0M in contractual protections** against controlled group FET exposure.
