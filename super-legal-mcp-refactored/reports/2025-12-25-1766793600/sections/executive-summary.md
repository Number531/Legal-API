**DATE:** December 25, 2025
**RE:** Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company — $1.2B Acquisition Due Diligence

---

## I. BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT (BLUF)

**PROCEED WITH ENHANCED PROTECTIONS.** The $1.2 billion acquisition of Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company (ASBC) presents manageable legal risks totaling $14.1M-$77.9M in probability-weighted exposure (1.2-6.5% of purchase price), but requires strategic transaction structure modifications to avoid catastrophic downside scenarios exceeding $150M. The primary basis for this recommendation is **distributor network complexity** requiring abandonment of immediate consolidation strategy (saving $153M-$415M) and **absence of Phase I Environmental Site Assessments** eliminating CERCLA liability protection. Recommended immediate actions: (1) commission Phase I ESAs for all 5 facilities within 5 days ($15K-$30K), (2) negotiate Federal Excise Tax assignment covenant (preventing $1.82M annual exposure), and (3) adopt "Grow Into" distributor strategy as mandatory integration policy (reducing exposure by 79-85%).

## II. AGGREGATE RISK SUMMARY

| Risk Category | Severity | Probability | Exposure Range | Mitigation Status |
|---------------|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **TTB Regulatory Compliance** | HIGH | 70-80% | $2.38M-$4.62M | Partial - Bourbon formula pending; COLA re-apps required |
| **Federal Excise Tax (Controlled Group)** | HIGH | 60% (if no covenant) | $0-$6.88M NPV | Available - Assignment covenant eliminates exposure |
| **Distributor Network** | CRITICAL | 30-50% (if consolidated) | $30M-$120M ("Grow Into") vs. $183M-$535M (immediate) | Available - "Grow Into" strategy reduces exposure 79-85% |
| **Employment & Labor** | HIGH | 40-60% | $2.1M-$4.3M | Partial - EEOC settlement pending; class cert risk remains |
| **FTC Investigation & Antitrust** | MEDIUM | 80-90% | $60K-$120K | Available - Consent order negotiation; compliance program |
| **Environmental Compliance** | CRITICAL | 20-40% (contamination); 100% (compliance) | $227K-$4.56M + $167K-$423K annual | None - Phase I ESAs mandatory; stillage disposal unverified |
| **Insurance Coverage Gaps** | MEDIUM | Varies | $3.9M-$9.4M | None - Uninsured exposures across multiple domains |
| **Franchise Litigation (Section II)** | PENDING | — | — | Analysis in progress |
| **AGGREGATE TOTAL** | — | — | **$41.7M-$150.5M+ gross** | **$14.1M-$77.9M probability-weighted** |

**Note:** Aggregate assumes adoption of "Grow Into" distributor strategy and FET assignment covenant. Failure to implement these mitigations increases exposure to $198M-$560M.

## III. KEY FINDINGS

### **Finding 1: Distributor Network Consolidation Infeasible — $153M-$415M Saved Through Strategic Pivot**

ASBC's 305 distributor relationships (180 beer, 125 spirits) spanning all 50 states create the transaction's largest financial exposure. The anticipated immediate consolidation strategy from 305 to 50 "strategic partners" would cost $183M-$535M in brand value compensation, litigation defense, and sales disruption over 2-3 years, producing an unacceptable 18-54 year payback period. In contrast, the "Grow Into" phased consolidation model—redirecting resources to 50 strategic partners while allowing natural market attrition over 5-10 years—reduces costs to $30M-$120M (34-78% reduction) while achieving comparable long-term outcomes. Twenty-five states enforce beer franchise laws imposing mandatory "good cause" termination requirements and brand value compensation calculated at 2.0x-4.0x three-year average gross profit, rendering contractual at-will termination provisions void regardless of agreement language. Change-of-control provisions in an estimated 183-244 distributor agreements (60-80% of total) require consent for ABP's acquisition, with Top 10 distributors controlling 72% of sales volume possessing unilateral termination rights if consent withheld. **Recommendation:** Abandon immediate consolidation strategy, adopt "Grow Into" model as official integration policy, and make Top 10 distributor consents mandatory closing condition precedent with $10M-$15M budget for consent procurement. See Section IV.E-H at ¶¶ 292-607.

### **Finding 2: Phase I Environmental Site Assessments Absent — Unlimited CERCLA Successor Liability Exposure**

No Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) have been conducted for any of ASBC's five production facilities (Portland brewery/distillery, Denver brewery, Asheville brewery, Hood River meadery), eliminating the Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser (BFPP) defense under CERCLA Section 107(r) and exposing the acquirer to unlimited strict, joint, and several liability for pre-existing contamination. Without Phase I ESAs conforming to ASTM E1527-21 standard conducted before acquisition, the buyer assumes current owner liability under 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(a)(1) for all historical contamination regardless of fault, potentially ranging from $100,000 for minor petroleum releases to $10,000,000+ for Superfund-eligible sites. Federal successor liability doctrine applies uniform federal common law overriding state corporate law protections that might otherwise limit asset purchaser liability. While craft beverage facilities present lower contamination risk profiles than heavy manufacturing (organic wastes, natural gas fuel, post-2000 construction), the absence of Phase I ESAs leaves contamination risk entirely unknown. Portland distillery generates 530,000-795,000 gallons annually of stillage (spent mash) with no documentation of disposal methods, creating potential Clean Water Act violation exposure of $10,000-$60,000 per day if unpermitted discharge occurs. **Recommendation:** Commission ASTM E1527-21 Phase I ESAs for all five facilities within 5 business days ($15K-$30K total), verify distillery stillage disposal compliance within 10 days, and establish $500K-$1M environmental escrow for 36 months covering Phase II investigations and remediation if Material Recognized Environmental Conditions identified. See Section VII.E-G at ¶¶ 454-710.

### **Finding 3: Federal Excise Tax Controlled Group Aggregation — $0-$1.82M Annual Operating Expense Increase**

ABP's acquisition triggers mandatory federal excise tax (FET) aggregation under 26 U.S.C. Section 1563 controlled group rules, requiring ASBC and all ABP-affiliated breweries/distilleries to share single reduced rate allowances rather than each entity qualifying independently. Post-acquisition, ABP's controlled group must allocate one 60,000-barrel beer allowance (at $3.50/barrel vs. standard $18/barrel) and one 100,000-proof-gallon spirits allowance (at $2.70/gallon vs. standard $13.50/gallon) among all group members. Without strategic intervention, TTB regulations impose default proportional assignment based on production volume, increasing ASBC's annual FET liability by approximately $698,000 (proportional scenario) to $1,814,000 (adverse assignment). Over a 5-year private equity hold period at 10% discount rate, proportional assignment produces $2.65M net present value cost, while adverse assignment reaches $6.88M NPV. However, controlled group regulations at 27 C.F.R. Section 25.167 provide complete discretion to assign reduced rates to any member in any proportion, permitting optimal assignment of entire allowances to ASBC at zero incremental cost. The FET covenant is economically neutral to ABP's controlled group (total tax unchanged regardless of allocation) but material to ASBC's EBITDA preservation. If ABP refuses the covenant, alternative protection through $2.275M purchase price reduction compensates for expected FET risk. **Recommendation:** Make FET assignment covenant non-negotiable closing condition with 5-year term, specific performance remedy, and earnout adjustment excluding controlled group FET increases from EBITDA calculations. If covenant refused, demand $2.275M purchase price reduction. See Section III.C-D at ¶¶ 114-320.

### **Finding 4: TTB Bourbon Formula Investigation — $1.45M-$2.66M Inventory Write-Off Risk Plus Regulatory Cascades**

TTB's investigation of ASBC's "Heritage Kentucky Bourbon" formula approval presents 70-80% probability of denial based on absence of Kentucky distillation despite "Kentucky Bourbon" brand name and ambiguous label representations. Formula denial triggers immediate regulatory cascades: (1) inventory write-off of $1.45M-$2.66M for 12,000-24,000 cases of bottled bourbon plus bulk inventory (520-1,200 barrels at $800-$1,000/barrel), (2) lost annual revenue of $380,000-$760,000 from discontinued flagship product, (3) mandatory withdrawal of 28 brand COLAs (Certificates of Label Approval) requiring re-application at $10,000-$20,000 per brand ($280,000-$560,000 total), and (4) 60-90 day federal permit transfer timeline potentially delaying production continuity and affecting distributor supply agreements. Section 5.42 of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act prohibits misleading geographic origin representations, with TTB regulatory precedent requiring actual distillation location to match geographic brand designations. ASBC's bourbon is distilled in Portland, Oregon and aged there before bottling, failing to satisfy Kentucky bourbon geographic authenticity standards despite technically meeting bourbon production requirements (51% corn mash, charred oak barrel aging, distillation proof limits). The 60-90 day permit transfer approval process for brewer's/distiller's permit applications under 27 C.F.R. Section 25.11 creates supply continuity risks if closing occurs mid-production cycle, potentially triggering distributor force majeure claims or performance relief demands. **Recommendation:** Negotiate bourbon formula resolution before closing if possible; if unresolved, establish $3M TTB regulatory escrow (18 months) covering inventory write-off, COLA re-applications, and lost revenue; retain key personnel for 90-180 days post-closing to support permit transfer applications and COLA re-submissions. See Section I.C-H at ¶¶ 33-195.

### **Finding 5: Employment Wage/Hour Class Action — $1.8M-$11.8M Exposure Depending on Certification and Opt-In Rates**

ASBC's 950 taproom employees across 18 locations face systemic wage/hour violations stemming from required but uncompensated prep/cleanup work (15-30 minutes per shift of stocking, garnish cutting, POS setup, and post-shift glassware washing). The July 2024 wage complaint filed by Maria Gonzalez, a Denver bartender, alleging unpaid overtime for these duties creates FLSA collective action exposure under 29 U.S.C. Section 216(b). All identified tasks satisfy the Supreme Court's "integral and indispensable" compensability test from Steiner v. Mitchell (1956), as employees cannot perform primary bartending duties without stocked supplies, operational POS systems, and clean glassware. Colorado's COMPS Order requires overtime at 1.5x minimum wage for hours exceeding 40/week, 12/day, or 12 consecutive hours, with 2024-2025 tipped minimum of $12.56/hour producing $18.84/hour overtime rate. Probability-weighted exposure analysis across opt-in scenarios: 30% opt-in (285 employees, base case) produces $1.8M-$3.6M total exposure; 50% opt-in (475 employees, downside case) reaches $3M-$6M; 70% opt-in (665 employees, severe case) totals $4.2M-$9M; 100% opt-in (950 employees, worst case) approaches $5.7M-$11.8M. All calculations include liquidated damages equal to unpaid wages (mandatory under FLSA Section 216(b) for willful violations) plus attorney's fees. Historical FLSA collective action opt-in rates average 5-25%, suggesting 30% base case is conservative but achievable with aggressive plaintiff outreach. EEOC charge filed by Gonzalez in October 2024 alleging national origin discrimination and retaliation (two-week temporal proximity between July wage complaint and August termination) presents strong prima facie case with $231K-$688K individual exposure (back pay, compensatory damages capped at $300K for 500+ employee company, front pay, attorney's fees). **Recommendation:** Settle Gonzalez EEOC charge pre-closing at $150K-$350K; commission comprehensive 50-state wage/hour audit within 30 days ($150K-$300K); implement corrective timekeeping policies immediately post-closing requiring clock-in before all prep work; establish $18M employment escrow (1.5% of purchase price) for 24 months with staggered release conditioned on class certification decision. See Section V.A-B at ¶¶ 18-301.

### **Finding 6: Multi-State Alcohol Server Training Compliance Gaps Undermining Dram Shop Defenses**

ASBC operates 18 taprooms across five states with divergent mandatory alcohol server training requirements, presenting both regulatory violation exposure and strategic litigation weakness. Oregon's March 31, 2025 regulatory change eliminated the 45-day grace period for temporary service permits, now requiring OLCC certification completion before new employees serve their first alcoholic beverage. This affects 380 Oregon employees (40% of taproom workforce) and creates criminal citation risk ($500 fines, 90 days imprisonment) for individual servers plus OLCC license suspension risk for ASBC. Washington MAST permit requirements (60-day new hire compliance deadline), California RBS training (60-day deadline with 2025 renewal wave for employees certified in 2022), Oregon OLCC recertification (5-year validity), and state-specific renewal tracking systems require centralized compliance infrastructure currently absent. Beyond regulatory penalties, expired or missing server certifications directly undermine ASBC's defense posture in pending Smith v. ASBC dram shop litigation (Oregon). While Oregon Revised Statute Section 471.565 provides no statutory safe harbor for training completion, certification evidence is highly relevant to comparative negligence analysis and jury assessment of reasonable care. Expired certifications at the taproom where service occurred provide plaintiff's counsel with negligence per se evidence demonstrating systemic compliance failures. Colorado and North Carolina offer voluntary training programs with significant benefits: Colorado's Responsible Vendor Program provides 25% liquor liability insurance premium discounts and regulatory mitigation for violations, while North Carolina's free RASP training (4-year certification validity) demonstrates reasonable care at zero cost. **Recommendation:** Implement Oregon/Washington/California mandatory training compliance immediately (all 522 employees in mandatory states, annual cost $10,520-$16,540); adopt Colorado RVP and North Carolina RASP voluntary programs for additional 332 employees ($5,700-$11,400 annually); establish centralized certification tracking database with 180-day, 90-day, and 30-day expiration alerts; implement mandatory incident documentation protocols (cut-off logs capturing patron description, intoxication signs, actions taken, manager signature) to create paper trail for dram shop defense. See Section V.C at ¶¶ 302-452.

### **Finding 7: FTC Health Claims Investigation — $60K-$120K Modest Exposure But Compliance Infrastructure Required**

FTC investigation of ASBC's March-April 2024 Instagram and Facebook posts claiming "health benefits of moderate beer consumption" and "hops support heart health" constitutes per se deceptive practices under FTC Act Section 5 and FTC's 1994 alcohol policy prohibiting health claims for alcoholic beverages. Both posts violated the three-part deception test (likely to mislead reasonable consumer, material to purchasing decision, unsubstantiated representation) as no competent and reliable scientific evidence establishes net health benefits from alcohol consumption given known carcinogenic effects (IARC Group 1 classification). ASBC deleted posts within 48 hours of FTC notification and implemented comprehensive corrective measures (social media policy prohibiting health claims, approval workflow, staff training, internal audit), substantially mitigating penalty exposure. Expected settlement outcome: $10K-$20K civil penalties (vs. $53,088 maximum per violation for 2025), $20K-$40K corrective social media advertising (2-3 posts reaching 50K-75K impressions matching original exposure), and $30K-$60K legal fees for consent order negotiation, totaling $60K-$120K. This represents 0.005-0.010% of purchase price and is categorized as MEDIUM severity due to definitive violations but modest financial impact. However, underlying BAC Code compliance gaps require systematic remediation: absence of age-gating on brand social media pages (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube) violates DISCUS 73.8% adult audience requirement; potential billboard placement violations of 500-foot proximity rules in seven states; happy hour advertising potentially violating prohibitions in nine states. Annual BAC Code compliance program costs $65K-$185K (age-gating implementation, state audits, compliance technology, annual external audit). **Recommendation:** Proactively negotiate FTC consent order settlement at $40K-$70K; implement Phase 1 immediate actions within 2 weeks (social media age-gating, prohibited content policy, pre-approval workflow); conduct state-by-state billboard and happy hour advertising audits within 60 days; establish Advertising Review Board with quarterly oversight and annual compliance certifications. See Section VI.A-G at ¶¶ 13-452.

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### A. Financial Integration Analysis

The aggregate quantified exposure of $41.7M-$150.5M+ gross (probability-weighted to $14.1M-$77.9M) across seven legal domains reveals critical financial interdependencies requiring unified transaction structure:

**Escrow Allocation Structure (8.2% of Purchase Price):**

The recommended $98.1M-$98.6M total escrow consolidates domain-specific reserves with coordinated release schedules matching claim resolution timelines:

| Escrow Category | Amount | Duration | Release Schedule | Rationale |
|-----------------|--------|----------|------------------|-----------|
| General Indemnity | $72M | 18 months | 50% at 12 mo, 50% at 18 mo | Standard reps/warranties coverage |
| TTB Regulatory | $3M | 18 months | 100% upon bourbon resolution + COLAs | Bourbon formula, COLA re-apps, permit delays |
| Employment | $18M | 24 months | 50% at 12 mo, 50% at 24 mo | Wage/hour class certification timeline |
| Environmental | $500K-$1M | 36 months | 30%/30%/40% staggered | Phase II investigations, long-tail remediation |
| Insurance Gaps | $4.5M | 24 months | Aligned with underlying claims | EPL absence, punitive damages risk |
| FTC/Regulatory | $100K | 18 months | From general indemnity | FTC settlement, minor regulatory matters |

This structure provides **first-dollar coverage** for high-frequency risks (environmental compliance violations, server training gaps) while maintaining adequate reserves for catastrophic scenarios (employment class $18M ceiling, distributor terminations up to $100M indemnity cap outside escrow). The 8.2% total escrow percentage falls within industry standards (5-15%) but reflects higher-than-average complexity spanning seven distinct legal domains with varying temporal resolution patterns.

**Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanisms:**

Four conditional price adjustments address scenarios where seller cooperation or buyer strategic decisions affect risk allocation:

1. **FET Assignment Covenant Alternative (-$2.275M):** If ABP refuses to execute Federal Excise Tax assignment covenant, purchase price reduction compensates for probability-weighted FET exposure over 5-year hold period. This creates clear economic incentive structure: ABP either agrees to zero-cost covenant or accepts $2.275M haircut.

2. **Environmental Severe Downside (-$1M to -$5M):** If Phase I ESAs identify Material Recognized Environmental Conditions requiring immediate remediation exceeding $1M per facility, purchase price reduction reflects remediation cost estimate plus 50% contingency for schedule/scope uncertainties.

3. **Distributor Consolidation Strategy Impact (-$50M to -$100M):** If ABP rejects "Grow Into" recommendation and pursues immediate consolidation, purchase price discount of 4-8% compensates for $153M-$415M incremental exposure. This mechanism aligns buyer incentives with recommended strategic approach.

4. **Working Capital FET Adjustment (+$350K):** If ABP is controlled group member without FET covenant, working capital increased by six months of expected FET cash flow impact to maintain liquidity for increased semi-monthly excise tax payments.

**Aggregate Potential Adjustments:** The cumulative downward purchase price risk of -$53.3M to -$107.6M (4.4-9.0% of $1.2B) materializes only if buyer rejects all recommended mitigations. Adoption of FET covenant, "Grow Into" distributor strategy, and Phase I ESA base-case scenario (no Material RECs) eliminates $55M-$110M of this adjustment risk.

### B. Critical Path Dependencies

Five sequential risk cascades demonstrate how failure to address foundational issues triggers compounding problems across multiple domains:

**Critical Path 1: Environmental → Closing → Financial**

Phase I ESA absence eliminates CERCLA Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser defense, creating unknown contamination exposure potentially exceeding $10M. Without Phase I ESAs completed before closing, buyer cannot satisfy 42 U.S.C. Section 9607(r) "All Appropriate Inquiries" requirement, forcing one of three outcomes: (1) massive purchase price reduction ($1M-$5M) to compensate for unlimited CERCLA exposure, (2) seller's refusal to accept reduction causing deal termination, or (3) buyer's decision to walk away from transaction. The $15K-$30K cost of Phase I ESAs is de minimis compared to this downside scenario, making immediate commissioning the single highest-priority due diligence action.

**Critical Path 2: Distributor Consents → Operations → Revenue**

Top 10 distributors controlling 72% of sales volume possess change-of-control consent rights in an estimated 60-80% of agreements. If majority refuse consent or demand onerous concessions, transaction closing with uncured consent breaches constitutes material breach of 183-244 agreements, triggering either distributor terminations ($70M-$145M brand value compensation for Top 10 alone) or revenue collapse from loss of 72% distribution capacity. Revenue disruption of this magnitude causes default under post-acquisition debt covenants, potentially forcing financial restructuring or distressed asset sale. The 90-180 day consent procurement campaign with $10M-$15M Top 10 concession budget (representing enhanced marketing support, contract term extensions, territory expansions) is mandatory transaction infrastructure, not optional relationship-building.

**Critical Path 3: FET Assignment → EBITDA → Debt Service**

Absent FET assignment covenant, 60-80% probability of default proportional assignment increases ASBC's annual FET liability by $698,000, reducing $18M EBITDA by 3.9%. If acquisition employs leverage (typical private equity capital structure), EBITDA decline impairs debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), potentially triggering lender remedies including accelerated maturity, increased interest rates, or mandatory equity injections. The IRR/return on investment deterioration from unexpected $698K annual cash drain undermines acquisition economics over 5-7 year hold period. The FET covenant's zero incremental cost to ABP's controlled group (total tax unchanged regardless of allocation) makes this the most cost-effective risk mitigation available.

**Critical Path 4: Employment Wage/Hour Class → Insurance → Cash Reserves**

Class action certification transforms individual claim exposure ($50K-$200K for Gonzalez alone) into $1.8M-$11.8M class-wide liability depending on opt-in rates. Absence of Employment Practices Liability insurance means both defense costs ($500K-$2M through trial) and settlement/judgment are paid entirely from cash reserves rather than policy limits. This cash drain affects working capital adequacy, debt covenant compliance, and operational flexibility for other business priorities (distributor support programs, marketing campaigns, capital equipment upgrades). The $18M employment escrow (1.5% of purchase price) with 24-month duration provides adequate buffer, but escrow exhaustion forces buyer to fund from ASBC operating cash flow during critical integration period.

**Critical Path 5: TTB Bourbon Formula → Revenue → Distributor Relations**

Bourbon formula denial eliminates flagship product representing $380K-$760K annual revenue, forcing brand discontinuation announcement that creates distributor portfolio gap. Distributors' competitive positioning depends on comprehensive brand portfolios; sudden removal of established bourbon brand allows competing suppliers to capture shelf space and on-premise placements previously held by ASBC. Even if ASBC develops replacement bourbon brand with compliant geographic designation, 12-24 month product development and market relaunch timeline creates sustained revenue decline exceeding initial $380K-$760K loss. Distributors may invoke performance relief clauses or reduce sales effort for remaining ASBC products, compounding revenue impact. The $2.66M bourbon escrow plus seller indemnity for lost revenue (12-24 months) provides cushion for portfolio transition, but strategic market communication plan emphasizing IPA flagship and spirits strength is essential to maintaining distributor confidence.

### C. Strategic Recommendations

Three unified contractual provisions address cross-cutting issues requiring coordinated legal documentation:

**Recommendation 1: Omnibus Regulatory Compliance Closing Condition**

Consolidate six domain-specific closing conditions into unified Article 7.2(h) "Regulatory Compliance Package" requiring seller delivery of (i) TTB permit/formula approval evidence, (ii) distillery stillage disposal documentation (36 months), (iii) Phase I ESAs for all five facilities (no Material RECs), (iv) FTC investigation status update, (v) server training certification verification (OR/CO/NC/WA/CA), and (vi) Top 10 distributor change-of-control consents. This integration simplifies closing checklist administration while providing clear 10-day pre-closing delivery deadline, enabling buyer's final compliance verification before wire transfer authorization.

**Recommendation 2: Cross-Domain Indemnification with Coordinated Caps**

Structure Article 10.2 indemnification caps in tiered format with domain-specific ceilings and escrow-first recovery sequencing: (a) General cap $72M for standard reps/warranties, (b) TTB regulatory $5M cap with $3M escrow first-source, (c) Employment $25M cap with $18M escrow first-source, (d) Environmental $10M cap for known contamination but unlimited liability for Phase I ESA failure, (e) Distributors $100M cap allocated $30M for Top 10 consent failures and $70M for brand value compensation claims within 24 months, (f) Coordinated cap calculation assigning multi-domain claims to most-direct-cause category, and (g) Basket elimination for TTB, employment, environmental, and distributor categories (first-dollar indemnification for frequent small claims). This structure balances generous caps for high-exposure categories against elimination of de minimis claim thresholds that would otherwise permit regulatory violations to accumulate beneath indemnity triggers.

**Recommendation 3: Federal Excise Tax Assignment Covenant with Earnout Integration**

Draft Article 5.15 covenant requiring ABP's controlled group to file annual TTB assignment elections allocating full reduced rates to ASBC for five-year covenant period, with specific subsection (b) earnout EBITDA adjustment adding back any FET increases resulting from buyer breach. Subsection (c) cross-domain integration acknowledgment flags downstream implications: (i) entity structure preservation for FET assignment may constrain post-closing restructuring, (ii) entity preservation affects distributor agreement assignment/novation strategies, and (iii) FET assignment interacts with state excise tax conformity rules in CA/OR/WA. Subsection (d) provides specific performance remedy in Delaware federal court, eliminating seller's need to prove monetary damages inadequacy (earnout manipulation would be primary harm). This integrated covenant structure prevents strategic buyer breach to depress EBITDA while acknowledging operational constraints the FET election imposes on other transaction dimensions.

**90-Day Operational Integration Plan:**

| Timeline | TTB Regulatory | Environmental | Distributors | Employment | FTC/Compliance |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| **Days 1-30** | File permit transfer applications (all facilities); retain TTB regulatory counsel | Commission Phase I ESAs (5 facilities); verify stillage disposal contracts | Distribute welcome letters (305 distributors); implement consolidation freeze policy | Server training audit (mandatory states); wage/hour compliance audit (all locations) | Proactive FTC outreach; propose consent order settlement |
| **Days 31-60** | Monitor permit approval status; prepare COLA re-application packages (28 brands) | Receive Phase I reports; commission Phase II if RECs identified; implement GHG reporting | Execute Tier 2 consent campaign (Next 40 distributors); track consent receipt rates | Implement corrective training programs; remediate wage/hour violations | Negotiate consent order terms; develop corrective advertising creative |
| **Days 61-90** | File COLA re-applications upon permits; bourbon formula status update to distributors | Complete Phase II investigations; remediation plan if needed; finalize annual compliance budget | Designate 50 strategic partners; communicate enhanced support programs | File amended wage statements (if required); establish quarterly compliance monitoring | Execute consent order; launch 30-day corrective social media campaign |

This sequenced implementation ensures foundational compliance establishment (permits, environmental assessments, distributor relations stabilization) in first 30 days, followed by remediation execution and compliance infrastructure build-out in subsequent 60 days. The plan coordinates interdependent workstreams (e.g., bourbon formula status affects distributor communications; wage/hour audit findings drive training program design) while maintaining distinct accountability for each domain-specific specialist.

## V. CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

This analysis assumes the following material facts, any variance from which would require reassessment of risk quantification and strategic recommendations:

**Bourbon Formula Investigation Outcome:** The 70-80% probability of TTB bourbon formula denial assumes TTB applies strict geographic authenticity standards to "Kentucky Bourbon" brand designation for product distilled in Portland, Oregon. If TTB demonstrates flexibility on geographic origin representations for craft distillers or accepts ASBC's clarifying label modifications, denial probability decreases to 40-50%, reducing expected exposure from $2.38M-$4.62M to $1.19M-$2.31M.

**Distributor Consent Procurement Success:** The change-of-control consent risk analysis assumes Top 10 distributors can be secured through reasonable concessions ($10M-$15M total) and that 80%+ of Tier 2/Tier 3 distributors consent without material negotiation. If major distributors demand onerous performance relief (e.g., 20% target reductions, 5-year term extensions, exclusive product launches) or refuse consent entirely, transaction closing may require either substantial additional concessions ($20M-$30M) or walking away from non-consenting distributors (revenue loss 5-15% of total sales).

**Federal Excise Tax Controlled Group Composition:** FET exposure calculations assume ABP's controlled group produces 200,000 barrels annually from other breweries (Breweries A+B) and 80,000 proof gallons from other distilleries (Distillery C), yielding combined group production of 685,000 barrels and 180,000 proof gallons—well below 2 million barrel and 22.13 million proof gallon thresholds triggering complete loss of reduced rates. If ABP's actual controlled group production exceeds these assumptions or approaches statutory caps, FET exposure increases materially. Due diligence must verify ABP's total controlled group production through Schedule 3.1(x) disclosure.

**Employment Class Action Opt-In Rates:** Wage/hour exposure modeling assumes 30% opt-in rate (285 of 950 employees) as base case, producing $1.8M-$3.6M exposure. Historical FLSA collective action opt-in rates average 5-25%, but aggressive plaintiff outreach or extensive media coverage can drive 40-70% participation. Each 10% opt-in increment adds approximately $600K-$1.2M to total exposure. The $18M employment escrow provides 5.0x-10.0x coverage of base case scenario but only 1.5x-3.0x coverage if opt-in rates reach 70%.

**Environmental Phase I ESA Findings:** All environmental analysis assumes Phase I ESAs identify no Material Recognized Environmental Conditions (defined as estimated remediation >$100K, contamination above cleanup standards, or CERCLA reportable quantities). If Phase I ESAs reveal petroleum releases from historical underground storage tanks, solvent contamination from prior industrial uses, or metals contamination, Phase II investigation costs ($10K-$50K per facility) and potential remediation ($100K-$500K minor releases to $1M-$10M+ major contamination) would substantially increase environmental exposure beyond modeled $227K-$4.56M range. The lower contamination risk profile of craft beverage facilities (organic wastes, natural gas fuel, modern construction) supports optimistic base-case assumption, but actual risk remains unknown without Phase I ESAs.

**Insurance Policy Coverage Verification:** Insurance analysis assumes general liability policy covers Oregon dram shop exposure (reducing gross $1.85M-$3.85M exposure to $100K self-insured retention) but identifies absence of Employment Practices Liability coverage requiring self-insurance of EEOC Gonzalez matter ($231K-$688K) and wage/hour defense costs ($500K-$2M). This analysis could not verify whether EPL policy exists but was not disclosed, or whether GL policy contains dram shop exclusions that would eliminate coverage entirely. Immediate insurance certificate review and carrier confirmation of coverage positions is mandatory within 10 days of LOI execution.

**Limitations Not Yet Resolved:**

This analysis could not verify the following critical factual matters requiring immediate due diligence follow-up:

1. **Distillery Stillage Disposal Method:** No documentation provided regarding disposal of 530K-795K gallons annually of high-strength stillage waste. Unpermitted discharge or land dumping creates $10K-$60K per day Clean Water Act or Oregon solid waste violation exposure.

2. **Actual ABP Controlled Group Production Volumes:** FET impact calculations rely on hypothetical assumptions about ABP's existing brewery/distillery holdings. Actual controlled group composition and production volumes must be disclosed through Schedule 3.1(x) representation and warranty.

3. **Environmental Permit Status:** No evidence provided of current Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permits for Portland/Denver/Asheville breweries, air quality permits for all facilities, EPA ID numbers for hazardous waste generators, or GHG emission reports for Portland facilities exceeding 2,500 metric ton reporting threshold.

4. **Insurance Policy Terms:** Insurance certificates provided but actual policy documents not reviewed for critical terms including dram shop coverage confirmations, EPL policy existence, punitive damages exclusions, aggregate limits, and excess/umbrella follow-form provisions.

5. **Section II Franchise Litigation Analysis:** Smith v. ASBC dram shop litigation analysis pending Section II completion. Insurance coverage confirmation, punitive damages risk assessment, and plaintiff settlement posture evaluation will be integrated upon Section II delivery.

**Consequence of Assumption Variance:** If bourbon formula approved contrary to 70-80% denial probability, TTB exposure reduces by $1.7M-$2.3M. If ABP's controlled group exceeds 2 million barrel cap, FET exposure increases by $1.7M annually ($6.4M NPV). If environmental Phase I ESAs identify major contamination requiring $2M+ remediation, environmental escrow must increase to $2M-$3M and purchase price reduction of $1M-$2M becomes appropriate. If insurance verification reveals dram shop exclusion eliminating GL coverage, uninsured litigation exposure increases by $1.75M-$3.75M (gross exposure minus $100K buyer would have paid as SIR).

## VI. PRIORITIZED RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### IMMEDIATE (0-72 hours):

**Action 1: Environmental Phase I ESAs — Commission Within 5 Business Days**
- **Owner:** Buyer's environmental counsel
- **Deliverable:** Signed engagement letters with environmental consulting firm for ASTM E1527-21 Phase I ESAs (5 facilities: Portland brewery, Portland distillery, Denver brewery, Asheville brewery, Hood River meadery)
- **Cost:** $15,000-$30,000 total ($3,000-$6,000 per facility)
- **Timeline:** 2-4 weeks per facility (parallel execution); completion Day 28-35
- **Rationale:** Preserves CERCLA Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser defense; identifies contamination liabilities before closing; prevents unlimited successor liability exposure ($100K-$10M+)

**Action 2: Distillery Stillage Disposal Verification — Request Documentation Within 5 Business Days**
- **Owner:** Seller's environmental compliance team with buyer's environmental counsel oversight
- **Deliverable:** (i) Current disposal contracts with receiving farms or licensed waste haulers, (ii) transportation records showing volume and frequency, (iii) Oregon DEQ Agricultural Use Exclusion correspondence, (iv) nutrient management plans if land application exceeds 50,000 gallons/year per farm
- **Cost:** Internal due diligence (no external cost if documentation exists)
- **Timeline:** Documentation request Day 1; delivery Day 5; verification Day 10
- **Rationale:** Eliminates $10,000-$60,000 per day Clean Water Act penalty exposure from non-compliant disposal; verifies Oregon solid waste regulation compliance

**Action 3: Distributor Consent Campaign Initiation — Top 10 Consents as Mandatory Closing Condition**
- **Owner:** Buyer's commercial contracts team with seller cooperation
- **Deliverable:** (i) Schedule 7.2(e) identifying Top 10 distributors by volume (72% of sales: RNDC, Southern Glazer's, Reyes, Ben E. Keith, +6 others), (ii) consent package template with enhanced support offerings (contract term extensions, marketing support increases, performance relief Year 1), (iii) C-suite meeting schedule for Top 4 distributors
- **Cost:** $10,000,000-$15,000,000 concession budget for Top 10 (present value of enhanced support programs over contract life)
- **Timeline:** Consent campaign Days 1-90; Top 10 consents must be executed before closing (mandatory closing condition Article 7.2(e))
- **Rationale:** Top 10 distributors controlling 72% of volume possess change-of-control termination rights in estimated 60-80% of agreements; loss of any Top 4 distributor threatens revenue continuity and competitive positioning

### SHORT-TERM (Pre-Signing — 15-60 days):

**Action 4: Federal Excise Tax Assignment Covenant Negotiation — Non-Negotiable Closing Condition**
- **Owner:** Buyer's tax counsel with seller negotiation support
- **Deliverable:** Article X.X (Federal Excise Tax Assignment Covenant) requiring ABP controlled group to allocate full 60,000-barrel beer and 100,000-proof-gallon spirits reduced rates to ASBC for 5-year covenant period, with specific performance remedy and earnout adjustment excluding FET increases from EBITDA calculations
- **Cost:** Zero incremental cost to ABP (total controlled group FET unchanged regardless of allocation); alternative protection if covenant refused: $2,275,000 purchase price reduction compensating for expected FET exposure NPV
- **Timeline:** Covenant negotiation Days 15-30; execution at signing
- **Rationale:** Prevents $0-$1.82M annual FET increase ($0-$6.88M NPV); protects EBITDA for earnout calculations; economically neutral to ABP but material to ASBC cash flows

**Action 5: Employment Compliance Audits and EEOC Gonzalez Settlement**
- **Owner:** Buyer's employment counsel with seller cooperation
- **Deliverable:** (i) Comprehensive 50-state wage/hour compliance audit (50-100 employee sample across 18 taprooms, manager interviews, policy review), (ii) alcohol server training certification audit (522 employees in OR/WA/CA mandatory states), (iii) settlement agreement with Maria Gonzalez including full release, class action waiver (if enforceable), and confidentiality provisions
- **Cost:** $150,000-$300,000 wage/hour audit; $50,000-$100,000 server training audit; $150,000-$350,000 Gonzalez settlement
- **Timeline:** Audit commissioning Day 10; preliminary findings Day 40; final report Day 60; Gonzalez settlement negotiation Days 15-60 (target execution pre-closing)
- **Rationale:** Quantifies wage/hour class exposure for escrow sizing; identifies immediate compliance gaps requiring remediation; resolves EEOC charge eliminating management distraction and potential class representative

**Action 6: TTB Permit Transfer Application Preparation and Bourbon Formula Resolution Strategy**
- **Owner:** Seller's regulatory compliance team with buyer's TTB counsel oversight
- **Deliverable:** (i) TTB brewer's notice and distiller's notice applications for all facilities (Portland brewery/distillery, Denver brewery, Asheville brewery, Hood River meadery), (ii) bourbon formula resolution status report including TTB correspondence and expected determination timeline, (iii) COLA re-application prioritization list (28 brands by revenue/strategic importance)
- **Cost:** $50,000-$100,000 regulatory counsel for permit applications and bourbon formula advocacy; $280,000-$560,000 COLA re-application fees (post-approval)
- **Timeline:** Permit application preparation Days 20-40; filing within 30 days of closing (post-closing action); bourbon formula resolution ongoing (expected Q1-Q2 2026 determination)
- **Rationale:** 60-90 day TTB permit approval timeline requires immediate filing to minimize production continuity gaps; bourbon formula resolution affects inventory write-off decision ($1.45M-$2.66M) and distributor portfolio communications

### PRE-CLOSING CONDITIONS (Must Complete Before Wire Transfer):

**Action 7: Phase I ESA Completion and Material REC Resolution**
- **Owner:** Buyer's environmental counsel
- **Condition:** Article 7.2(f) "It shall be a condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to close that Phase I Environmental Site Assessments conforming to ASTM E1527-21 have been completed for all five facilities and identify no Material Recognized Environmental Conditions (estimated remediation >$100,000, contamination above cleanup standards, or CERCLA reportable quantities), OR if Material RECs identified, Seller has (i) completed remediation prior to closing at Seller's expense, (ii) agreed to retain 100% liability through uncapped indemnification with no time limit, or (iii) accepted purchase price reduction equal to remediation cost estimate plus 50% contingency."
- **Walk-Away Trigger:** If Phase I ESAs identify contamination requiring remediation exceeding $1,000,000 per facility and Seller refuses options (i)-(iii) above, Buyer may terminate without penalty
- **Rationale:** CERCLA successor liability without BFPP defense creates unlimited strict, joint, and several exposure; buyer cannot rationally proceed without either confirming clean properties or obtaining adequate seller indemnification

**Action 8: Top 10 Distributor Change-of-Control Consents Executed**
- **Owner:** Buyer's commercial counsel with seller relationship support
- **Condition:** Article 7.2(e) "It shall be a condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to close that executed change-of-control consents in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer have been obtained from all distributors identified on Schedule 7.2(e) (Top 10 Distributors Controlling 72% of Volume)."
- **Alternative if Consents Not Obtained:** If any Top 10 distributor refuses consent or demands commercially unreasonable concessions exceeding $3,000,000 net present value of performance relief, Buyer may either (i) accept substitute distributor in same territory with comparable market coverage, subject to Buyer approval, or (ii) terminate transaction without penalty
- **Rationale:** Loss of Top 10 distributor (particularly Top 4: RNDC 18%, SGWS 14%, Reyes 12%, Ben E. Keith 8%) threatens immediate revenue collapse and competitive positioning; change-of-control provision in 60-80% of agreements creates material breach if closing occurs without consent

**Action 9: TTB Regulatory Compliance Package Delivery**
- **Owner:** Seller's regulatory team
- **Condition:** Article 7.2(h) "No later than 10 business days prior to Closing, Seller shall deliver: (i) evidence that federal permits are in full force with no violations or pending enforcement, (ii) distillery stillage disposal documentation (36 months compliant disposal), (iii) FTC investigation status update with settlement timeline, (iv) server training certification verification (mandatory states), and (v) confirmation that bourbon formula determination expected no earlier than [closing date + 90 days] to avoid pre-closing inventory write-off triggering working capital adjustment."
- **Rationale:** Consolidates six regulatory domains into unified pre-closing deliverable package with clear 10-day deadline enabling buyer's final verification; permits buyer to assess FTC settlement progress and bourbon timing before authorizing wire transfer

**Action 10: Federal Excise Tax Assignment Covenant Execution or Alternative Price Reduction**
- **Owner:** Buyer's tax counsel with ABP senior leadership approval
- **Condition:** Article 5.15 (FET Assignment Covenant) executed at signing as non-negotiable closing condition, OR if ABP refuses covenant, Article 2.2(c) (Purchase Price Reduction) implemented reducing purchase price by $2,275,000 to compensate for probability-weighted FET exposure over 5-year hold period
- **Rationale:** FET covenant is economically neutral to ABP's controlled group (total tax unchanged regardless of allocation) but prevents $698,000 annual EBITDA reduction if default proportional assignment occurs; clear binary choice structure (covenant or price reduction) eliminates ambiguity

## VII. DECISION REQUIRED

**DECISION REQUIRED:** Proceed with acquisition subject to enhanced protections outlined in Section VI by Investment Committee by [TBD — 30 days from Board presentation date].

### Options Analysis:

**Option A: Proceed as Currently Structured (Accept Unmitigated Exposure) — NOT RECOMMENDED**

Closing transaction without Phase I ESAs, distributor consent procurement, FET assignment covenant, or enhanced escrow structure exposes buyer to unmitigated aggregate risk of $198M-$560M (16.5-46.7% of purchase price). This option produces unacceptable downside scenarios including: (1) unlimited CERCLA successor liability without BFPP defense, (2) immediate $1.82M annual FET increase reducing EBITDA by 10.1%, (3) distributor network collapse if 183-244 change-of-control breaches trigger terminations requiring $183M-$535M brand value compensation, (4) employment class action exposure of $5.7M-$11.8M if opt-in rates reach 70-100%, and (5) bourbon formula denial forcing $2.66M inventory write-off with no indemnity protection.

**Financial Impact:** Expected loss $66M-$188M (probability-weighted), with tail risk exceeding $400M+ in severe downside scenarios (e.g., Phase I ESAs identify $5M+ per-facility contamination + Top 10 distributors terminate + employment class certified at 70% opt-in + bourbon formula denied). Investment IRR impaired by 8-15 percentage points relative to base case underwriting assumptions.

**Recommendation:** **Reject Option A.** This approach transforms strategic acquisition into distressed asset purchase requiring immediate crisis management and substantial unplanned capital deployment for regulatory remediation, distributor relationship repair, and litigation defense.

**Option B: Proceed with Enhanced Protections (Recommended) — PROCEED**

Implement all Section VI recommended actions including immediate Phase I ESA commissioning, Top 10 distributor consent procurement as mandatory closing condition, FET assignment covenant execution, $98.1M-$98.6M escrow structure (8.2% of purchase price), and adoption of "Grow Into" distributor consolidation strategy as official integration policy. Enhanced protections reduce aggregate risk exposure to $14.1M-$77.9M probability-weighted (1.2-6.5% of purchase price)—representing 79-86% risk reduction compared to Option A.

**Risk/Benefit Analysis:**

*Benefits:*
- Strategic platform acquisition in growing craft beverage sector with $18M EBITDA and established 305-distributor nationwide network
- CERCLA liability protection through BFPP defense (Phase I ESAs completed before closing)
- Federal excise tax preservation through assignment covenant (maintaining $7.28M annual FET vs. $9.1M worst-case scenario)
- Distributor relationships stabilized through consent procurement and "Grow Into" phased consolidation ($30M-$120M over 10 years vs. $183M-$535M immediate termination approach)
- Employment risks contained through wage/hour audit, EEOC settlement, and $18M escrow with 24-month class certification observation period
- TTB regulatory transition managed through permit transfer support and bourbon formula escrow ($3M for 18 months)

*Risks:*
- Escrow structure locks $98.1M-$98.6M of purchase price for 18-36 months depending on category (8.2% of total consideration)
- Phase I ESAs may identify Material RECs requiring Phase II investigations ($10K-$50K per facility) or purchase price reduction ($1M-$5M if major remediation needed)
- Top 10 distributor consent procurement may require $10M-$15M concession budget (contract extensions, marketing support, performance relief)
- FET assignment covenant constrains post-closing entity restructuring (ASBC must remain separate legal entity for tax elections)
- "Grow Into" distributor strategy requires 5-10 year timeline potentially conflicting with 5-7 year private equity fund life cycle

**Financial Impact:** Expected total cost of enhanced protections $25M-$45M (2.1-3.8% of purchase price), comprised of Phase I ESAs $15K-$30K, distributor consent procurement $10M-$15M, wage/hour audit and EEOC settlement $350K-$750K, TTB regulatory counsel $50K-$100K, environmental escrow opportunity cost (assuming 6% return on $500K-$1M for 36 months) $90K-$180K, and employment escrow opportunity cost (6% on $18M for 24 months) $2.16M. Enhanced protections eliminate $172M-$470M of exposure identified in Option A, producing net benefit of $147M-$425M (12.3-35.4% of purchase price).

**Recommendation:** **Approve Option B.** Enhanced protections structure converts high-risk speculative acquisition into institutionally-appropriate platform investment with manageable downside scenarios and clear risk mitigation pathways for each identified exposure category.

**Option C: Terminate Negotiations (Preserve Capital for Alternative Targets) — CONSIDER IF CONDITIONS NOT MET**

Walk away from ASBC acquisition if: (1) Phase I ESAs identify contamination requiring remediation exceeding $1,000,000 per facility and Seller refuses uncapped indemnification or purchase price reduction, (2) Top 10 distributors refuse change-of-control consents or demand combined concessions exceeding $25,000,000 net present value, (3) Seller refuses FET assignment covenant and rejects alternative $2,275,000 purchase price reduction, (4) distillery stillage disposal verification reveals ongoing Clean Water Act violations (unpermitted discharge to waters of U.S.) requiring immediate cessation and remediation, or (5) bourbon formula determination occurs pre-closing resulting in $1.45M-$2.66M inventory write-off requiring corresponding working capital adjustment that Seller contests.

**Risk/Benefit Analysis:**

*Benefits:*
- Capital preservation ($1.2B) for deployment to alternative craft beverage targets with cleaner legal profiles
- Avoidance of 18-36 month workout period resolving environmental contamination, distributor consolidation, employment class certification, and TTB regulatory compliance issues
- Elimination of management distraction from post-closing integration complexity spanning seven distinct legal domains
- Prevention of reputation risk if ASBC legal issues become public (FTC health claims investigation, EEOC discrimination charge, potential environmental violations)

*Risks:*
- Loss of strategic platform investment in craft beverage sector with established nationwide distribution infrastructure
- Competitive disadvantage if rival acquirer purchases ASBC and gains 305-distributor network control
- Sunk transaction costs including due diligence legal fees ($500K-$1M), environmental assessments ($15K-$30K), financial advisory fees (1-2% of purchase price or $12M-$24M), and management opportunity cost (6-12 months senior executive time)
- Market perception that buyer unable to execute acquisitions creates hesitation among future targets and limits deal flow

**Financial Impact:** Walk-away scenario preserves $1.2B capital but incurs sunk costs of $12.5M-$25M (1.0-2.1% of intended purchase price) with no return. Alternative deployment options depend on market availability of comparable craft beverage platforms; if no suitable alternative identified within 12-24 months, capital remains uninvested producing opportunity cost of 6-10% annual return ($72M-$120M per year).

**Recommendation:** **Reserve Option C as contingency if Phase I ESAs reveal severe contamination (>$5M total remediation across all facilities) or if Top 10 distributor consent campaign fails (majority refuse consent or demand >$25M combined concessions).** Otherwise, pursue Option B enhanced protections approach enabling transaction to proceed with institutional-grade risk mitigation.

### Decision Framework Summary:

| Option | Purchase Price | Additional Costs | Total Investment | Risk Exposure | Expected Loss | Net Expected Value | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Option A: As-Is** | $1,200M | $0 | $1,200M | $198M-$560M gross | $66M-$188M prob-weighted | $1,266M-$1,388M | **REJECT** |
| **Option B: Enhanced** | $1,200M | $25M-$45M | $1,225M-$1,245M | $41.7M-$150.5M gross | $14.1M-$77.9M prob-weighted | $1,239M-$1,323M | **APPROVE** |
| **Option C: Walk Away** | $0 | $12.5M-$25M sunk | $12.5M-$25M | $0 | $0 | $12.5M-$25M | **Reserve as Contingency** |

**Recommended Decision: Approve Option B (Proceed with Enhanced Protections).** This option delivers 79-86% risk reduction compared to Option A at incremental cost of only $25M-$45M (2.1-3.8% of purchase price), producing superior risk-adjusted returns while preserving strategic acquisition objectives. Expected value analysis demonstrates Option B reduces total investment (purchase price + costs + expected losses) to $1,239M-$1,323M versus $1,266M-$1,388M for Option A—representing $27M-$127M net benefit (2.3-10.6% IRR improvement) from enhanced protections implementation.
