## VII. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE & REMEDIATION

This section analyzes environmental regulatory compliance requirements for ASBC's five production facilities: three breweries (Portland OR 350K barrels, Denver CO 100K barrels, Asheville NC 75K barrels), one distillery (Portland OR 100K proof gallons), and one meadery (Hood River OR 12K cases). The analysis examines Clean Water Act pretreatment permits, Phase I Environmental Site Assessment requirements, air emissions compliance under the Clean Air Act, RCRA hazardous waste management, and CERCLA successor liability risks. Research confirms **CRITICAL GAP:** no Phase I ESAs have been conducted for any facility, creating potentially unlimited CERCLA successor liability exposure that eliminates the Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser defense.

**Overall Environmental Risk Rating: MEDIUM-HIGH** — While no federal enforcement actions appear in EPA ECHO database records, the absence of Phase I ESAs represents a material due diligence deficiency that could expose the acquirer to strict, joint, and several liability for pre-existing contamination ranging from $100,000 for minor petroleum releases to $10M+ for Superfund-eligible sites.¹

### A. Clean Water Act Pretreatment Permits (HIGH SEVERITY)

#### 1. Regulatory Framework and Applicability

The Clean Water Act establishes pretreatment standards for industrial users discharging to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) to prevent pollutants from "passing through" or "interfering with" municipal wastewater treatment operations.² Section 307(b) of the CWA authorizes EPA to promulgate national pretreatment standards, implemented through 40 CFR Part 403 General Pretreatment Regulations.³ EPA-approved state programs and local POTW-administered permits provide the enforcement mechanism for these federal standards.

Brewery wastewater contains biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentrations of 1,200-2,000 mg/L, representing 4-10 times higher organic loading than typical municipal wastewater (200-300 mg/L BOD).⁴ This high-strength wastewater results from:

- **Mashing/lautering operations:** Grain residues and sugars (BOD 3,000-5,000 mg/L)
- **Fermentation vessel cleaning:** Yeast solids and residual beer (BOD 5,000-10,000 mg/L)
- **Clean-in-place (CIP) systems:** Hot caustic and acid cleaning solutions (pH 3-12)
- **Packaging line wash:** Label adhesives and lubricants⁵

All three ASBC breweries discharge to POTWs and require industrial pretreatment permits. The absence of federal enforcement records in EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database suggests either compliance with local permit requirements or regulation solely at the state/local level without federal-level violations.⁶

#### 2. Portland Brewery and Distillery (Combined Operations)

**Wastewater Generation and Characteristics:**

The Portland brewery generates approximately 5.7 million gallons per year of wastewater (350,000 barrels production × 16.3 gallons wastewater per barrel).⁷ With BOD concentrations of 1,200-2,000 mg/L, the annual organic load totals 57,000-95,000 pounds of BOD. The co-located distillery operation presents distinct challenges addressed separately in subsection B below.

**Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) Jurisdiction:**

Portland operates an EPA-approved industrial pretreatment program under 40 CFR Part 403.⁸ Craft fermented beverage facilities must obtain either an Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit or comply with Alternative Discharge Control Mechanisms.⁹ Portland BES regulations establish:

- **pH discharge limits:** 5.0-11.5 standard units (Portland City Code 17.34.050)
- **Monitoring Access Structure (MAS):** Required per ENB 4.35 administrative rules for self-monitoring
- **Extra-strength charges:** Applied to high-BOD discharge exceeding typical municipal wastewater strength¹⁰

**Compliance Requirements and Costs:**

For fiscal year 2025-26, Portland BES assesses base permit fees of $3,395 for Significant Industrial Users (SIU) or $4,075 for Categorical Industrial Users (CIU).¹¹ Beyond base permit fees, Portland's most significant compliance cost derives from extra-strength charges for BOD loading. The Portland brewery's 57,000-95,000 pounds annual BOD load generates estimated extra-strength charges of **$50,000-$150,000 annually**, representing a material ongoing operational expense.¹²

**Due Diligence Requirements:**

Request from ASBC:
1. Current Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permit or Alternative Discharge Control Mechanism documentation
2. Self-monitoring reports for past 24 months showing BOD, TSS, and pH test results
3. Portland BES compliance correspondence and inspection reports
4. Extra-strength charge invoices (past 24 months) to quantify actual wastewater treatment costs
5. Any notices of violation, warning letters, or enforcement actions from Portland BES

**Enforcement Exposure:**

Clean Water Act Section 309(d) authorizes civil penalties up to **$59,950 per day per violation** (2024 inflation-adjusted).¹³ Criminal penalties for knowing violations reach $50,000 per day and three years imprisonment under 33 U.S.C. § 1319(c)(2).¹⁴ Realistic first-time violation settlements for minor BOD exceedances or pH violations with prompt corrective action typically range from $10,000-$50,000.¹⁵

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM — No EPA ECHO enforcement records located, but permit compliance must be verified through Portland BES records. Extra-strength charges represent predictable ongoing cost ($50K-$150K annually) rather than contingent liability.

#### 3. Denver Brewery

**Wastewater Generation and Characteristics:**

The Denver brewery (100,000 barrels annual production) generates approximately 1.6 million gallons per year of wastewater with an estimated BOD load of 16,000-27,000 pounds annually.¹⁶

**Metro Water Recovery Jurisdiction:**

Metro Water Recovery (formerly Metro Wastewater Reclamation District) serves Denver and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Jefferson, Douglas, and Weld counties.¹⁷ The district operates an EPA-approved industrial pretreatment program implementing 40 CFR Part 403 standards through local Rules and Regulations.¹⁸ All commercial and industrial dischargers must comply with Metro Water Recovery requirements, with individual permits, general permits, or sector permits issued based on discharge characteristics and volume.

**Compliance Requirements:**

The Denver brewery's 1.6 million gallon annual discharge and 16,000-27,000 pound BOD load likely require an individual permit with facility-specific BOD limits, TSS limits, pH range specifications, and quarterly or monthly self-monitoring reports.¹⁹

**Due Diligence Requirements:**

Request from ASBC:
1. Metro Water Recovery industrial pretreatment permit
2. Self-monitoring reports (past 24 months)
3. Compliance correspondence and inspection reports
4. Surcharge or extra-strength invoices (if applicable)

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM — Similar profile to Portland brewery. No EPA ECHO enforcement records, but local permit compliance requires verification.

#### 4. Asheville Brewery

**Wastewater Generation and Characteristics:**

The Asheville brewery (75,000 barrels annual production) generates approximately 1.2 million gallons per year, equivalent to 3,288 gallons per day.²⁰ This production volume falls **below the 25,000 gallon per day threshold** established by Metropolitan Sewerage District of Buncombe County (MSD) for mandatory individual permit requirements.²¹

**MSD Buncombe County Jurisdiction:**

MSD Buncombe County's Sewer Use Ordinance implements 40 CFR Part 403 General Pretreatment Regulations and requires fermented beverage manufacturers discharging more than 25,000 gallons per day to obtain discharge permits with specific limitations.²² The Ordinance also requires Authorization to Construct before installing pretreatment equipment and prior authorization for disposal of off-specification product.²³

**Compliance Status:**

The Asheville brewery likely operates under general discharge authorization or best management practices rather than an individual permit due to its below-threshold discharge volume. However, if production expands above 25,000 gallons per day, an individual permit with specific discharge limitations becomes mandatory.²⁴

**Due Diligence Requirements:**

Request from ASBC:
1. MSD Buncombe County general discharge authorization or correspondence confirming permit-exempt status
2. Any self-monitoring records maintained voluntarily
3. Correspondence confirming below-threshold operations

**Risk Assessment:** LOW-MEDIUM — Small-scale operation below regulatory thresholds. Primary risk is expansion triggering permit requirements.

#### 5. Wastewater Pretreatment Technologies and Capital Investment

High-strength brewery wastewater requires pretreatment before discharge to POTWs. Common technologies include:²⁵

| Technology | Function | Capital Cost | Operating Cost | BOD Reduction |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **pH Adjustment Systems** | Equalization tanks with acid/caustic dosing | $50K-$150K | $5K-$15K/year | N/A (pH control) |
| **Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)** | Removes suspended solids and FOG | $150K-$400K | $20K-$50K/year | 30-50% |
| **Anaerobic Digestion** | High-rate treatment, biogas production | $500K-$2M | $40K-$80K/year | 70-90% |
| **Aerobic Treatment (SBR)** | Final BOD polishing | $300K-$800K | $50K-$100K/year | 85-95% |

Due diligence should determine whether ASBC facilities have installed pretreatment systems or rely solely on POTW treatment capacity with surcharge payments. The Portland brewery's $50K-$150K annual extra-strength charges suggest reliance on POTW treatment rather than on-site pretreatment investment.

### B. Distillery Stillage Disposal (CRITICAL SEVERITY)

#### 1. Stillage Characteristics and Regulatory Challenges

The Portland distillery's production of 100,000 proof gallons annually generates **530,000-795,000 gallons per year** of stillage (spent mash), calculated at 10-15 gallons stillage per gallon of spirits produced.²⁶ Stillage represents one of the most challenging waste streams in beverage production:

- **BOD concentration:** 30,000-60,000 mg/L (100-300 times higher than typical brewery wastewater)
- **Chemical oxygen demand (COD):** 80,000-150,000 mg/L
- **Total solids:** 5-12% by weight
- **Protein content (dry basis):** 20-30% (valuable for livestock feed)
- **pH:** 3.5-4.5 (acidic from fermentation)
- **Temperature:** 80-95°C when discharged from still²⁷

**Why Stillage Cannot Be Sewered:**

At 650,000 gallons annually (midpoint estimate) with 45,000 mg/L BOD, the Portland distillery's stillage contains approximately 244,000 pounds of BOD per year — equivalent to the organic loading from a population of 11,000 people.²⁸ Discharging this volume directly to a POTW would overwhelm treatment capacity and require cost-prohibitive multi-stage pretreatment (anaerobic digestion, aerobic treatment, evaporation) that would exceed distillery operating margins.

#### 2. Oregon Beneficial Reuse Regulations

**Agricultural Use Exclusion (OAR 340-093-0030):**

Oregon Department of Environmental Quality exempts "industrial food processing wastes and spent brewery grains fed to livestock" from solid waste regulation when materials are used "on land in agricultural operations and the growing or harvesting of crops and the raising of fowls or animals" at or below agronomic rates.²⁹ The regulation establishes no volumetric caps and requires application at nutrient uptake capacity of crops or pasture.

Oregon DEQ and Oregon Department of Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2017 for coordinating agricultural material use oversight.³⁰ While the Agricultural Use Exclusion explicitly names "spent brewery grains," it does not specifically mention distillery stillage. However, stillage's high organic content (protein, minerals) makes it valuable for livestock nutrition, and industry practice widely accepts distillery stillage as cattle feed supplement for dairy and beef operations.³¹

#### 3. Disposal and Beneficial Reuse Options

**Option A: Livestock Feed (Recommended — Lowest Cost and Regulatory Risk):**

**Advantages:**
- No disposal cost (farmers typically accept free or pay nominal fee)
- Qualifies for Oregon Agricultural Use Exclusion (no DEQ permit required)
- Stillage provides 20-30% protein (dry basis), reducing farmer feed costs by $0.10-$0.15 per gallon equivalent feed value
- Established industry practice with minimal regulatory oversight

**Requirements:**
- Receiving farm must have adequate land for agronomic application (nutrient management)
- Transportation logistics: Tanker truck delivery 2-3 times weekly
- Storage at farm: Concrete bunker or lagoon (stillage ferments/degrades if stored more than 5 days)

**Estimated Annual Costs:**
- Transportation: $0.05-$0.10/gallon (100-mile radius) = **$26,500-$79,500 annually**
- No disposal fee (beneficial reuse)

**Option B: Land Application as Agricultural Fertilizer:**

**Regulatory Requirements:**
- Oregon DEQ Land Application Permit may be required depending on application rate and site characteristics
- Agronomic rates: Typically 5,000-15,000 gallons per acre per year (based on nitrogen loading)
- For 650,000 gallons annual volume: Requires 43-130 acres application area

**Estimated Annual Costs:**
- Permit: $5,000-$10,000 initial, $2,000-$5,000 annual
- Transportation and spreading: $0.15-$0.30/gallon = **$97,500-$238,500 annually**

**Option C: Waste Hauler Disposal (Least Preferred — Expensive):**

**Process:**
- Contract liquid waste hauler to transport stillage to wastewater treatment facility or composting operation

**Estimated Annual Costs:**
- Typical rates: $0.10-$0.30/gallon including hauling and disposal = **$53,000-$238,500 annually**

**Option D: On-Site Treatment (Capital Intensive — Not Economical at Current Scale):**

**Technologies:**
- Anaerobic digestion with biogas recovery: $500K-$1.5M capital, $50K-$100K annual operating costs
- Evaporation system: $300K-$800K capital, $80K-$150K annual energy costs

**Payback Analysis:**
- Biogas energy recovery: 15-25 years (not economical at 100,000 proof gallon scale)
- Only viable for distilleries producing more than 500,000 proof gallons annually³²

#### 4. Critical Documentation Gap and Risk Assessment

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Research has identified no documentation regarding ASBC's current stillage disposal method for the Portland distillery's 530,000-795,000 gallons per year of stillage. This represents a **material environmental compliance risk** requiring immediate pre-closing investigation.

**Potential Risk Scenarios:**

| Disposal Method | Compliance Status | Regulatory Risk | Financial Exposure |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Beneficial reuse to farms (documented)** | Compliant with Agricultural Use Exclusion | **LOW** | $26,500-$79,500/year (transportation only) |
| **Land application (permitted)** | Compliant if permit obtained and agronomic rates followed | **MEDIUM** | $97,500-$238,500/year |
| **Land application (unpermitted)** | Violation of solid waste regulations | **HIGH** | $10,000/day DEQ penalties³³ |
| **Discharge to stormwater** | CWA violation | **CRITICAL** | $59,950/day federal penalties³⁴ |
| **Unpermitted land dumping** | Solid waste violation | **CRITICAL** | $10,000/day + remediation costs |

**Mandatory Pre-Closing Investigation:**

Request from ASBC within 5 business days:
1. Current stillage disposal contracts (beneficial reuse farms or waste haulers)
2. Transportation arrangements (hauler agreements, volume records)
3. Oregon DEQ correspondence regarding Agricultural Use Exclusion applicability
4. If land application: Nutrient management plans demonstrating agronomic rates
5. Cost records: Disposal fees, transportation, handling (past 24 months)
6. Any Oregon DEQ or EPA correspondence regarding stillage disposal

**Closing Condition Recommendation:**

Include the following representation and warranty in the Purchase Agreement:

> **Section X.Y — Environmental Compliance — Distillery Waste Disposal:**
>
> Seller represents and warrants that all distillery stillage generated by the Portland Distillery during the past three (3) years has been disposed of in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, including but not limited to the Clean Water Act, Oregon solid waste regulations (OAR 340-093-0030), and Oregon DEQ Agricultural Use Exclusion requirements. Seller shall provide Buyer, no later than five (5) business days prior to Closing, documentation evidencing compliant disposal methods including: (i) contracts with receiving farms or licensed waste haulers; (ii) transportation records; (iii) nutrient management plans if applicable; and (iv) all correspondence with Oregon DEQ regarding stillage disposal. Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any violations, penalties, or remediation costs arising from pre-Closing stillage disposal practices.

**Risk Assessment:** **CRITICAL** until documentation verified — If ASBC cannot produce compliant disposal documentation, this represents a potential $10,000-$60,000 per day penalty exposure plus remediation costs. Immediate verification is mandatory.

See Section VII.B.4 (Stillage Disposal Risk), supra at ¶¶ 194-226, and Section VII.G (Closing Conditions), supra at ¶¶ 663-710, for analysis of distillery stillage disposal verification as mandatory closing condition precedent with $500K-$1M escrow recommendation.

### C. Clean Air Act Boiler and Process Emissions (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

#### 1. Regulatory Framework for Stationary Sources

The Clean Air Act establishes permit requirements for stationary sources based on annual emissions of criteria pollutants and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).³⁵ Title V Operating Permits apply to "major sources" emitting:

- ≥100 tons per year of any criteria pollutant (NOx, CO, PM, SO2, VOC), OR
- ≥10 tons per year of any single HAP, OR
- ≥25 tons per year of combined HAPs³⁶

Sources below major source thresholds may still require state-issued permits depending on jurisdiction-specific regulations. Two federal standards particularly affect brewery/distillery boiler operations:

- **New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) Subpart Dc:** Standards for small industrial-commercial-institutional steam generating units (40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Dc)³⁷
- **National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) Subpart JJJJJJ:** Area source boiler requirements (40 CFR Part 63, Subpart JJJJJJ)³⁸

#### 2. Boiler Emissions Analysis — All Facilities

**Typical Brewery/Distillery Boiler Specifications:**

ASBC facilities operate natural gas-fired boilers for brewing and distilling steam requirements:
- Fuel: Natural gas (cleanest-burning fossil fuel)
- Capacity: Estimated 10-50 MMBtu/hr heat input
- Usage: Brewing kettles, mash tuns, distillation stills, CIP hot water, space heating
- Operating schedule: 12-16 hours per day, 250-300 days per year

**Emission Estimates for Representative 30 MMBtu/hr Boiler (4,000 hours annual operation):**³⁹

| Pollutant | Emission Factor (lb/MMBtu) | Annual Emissions (tons/year) |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| NOx (nitrogen oxides) | 0.1 | 6.0 |
| CO (carbon monoxide) | 0.04 | 2.4 |
| PM (particulate matter) | 0.0075 | 0.45 |
| SO2 (sulfur dioxide) | 0.0006 | 0.036 |
| VOC (volatile organics) | 0.0054 | 0.32 |

**Conclusion:** All ASBC boiler emissions remain well below 100 tons per year Title V major source thresholds. The facilities are minor sources requiring state-level permits but exempt from federal Title V Operating Permits.⁴⁰

#### 3. Oregon Facilities (Portland Brewery/Distillery, Hood River Meadery)

**Oregon DEQ Basic Permit 04:**

Natural gas boilers with 10-30 MMBtu/hr heat input constructed after June 9, 1989 are eligible for Oregon DEQ Basic Permit 04.⁴¹ This streamlined permitting process costs less and processes faster than source-specific permits. Basic Permit 04 requires:
- Compliance with NSPS Subpart Dc (fuel analysis, NOx emission limits)
- Annual fuel usage reporting
- Compliance certification

**Greenhouse Gas Reporting Threshold — CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ISSUE:**

Oregon requires greenhouse gas reporting for facilities emitting ≥2,500 metric tons CO2 equivalent per year.⁴² The Portland brewery and distillery combined operations (estimated 40 MMBtu/hr brewery boiler + 20 MMBtu/hr distillery boiler = 60 MMBtu/hr total) generate approximately **7,200 metric tons CO2 annually** from combustion sources.⁴³ This exceeds the 2,500 metric ton reporting threshold.

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Portland facilities **likely require annual GHG reporting to Oregon DEQ** but research has not confirmed whether ASBC has filed required reports. Non-compliance with GHG reporting obligations could trigger enforcement actions.

**Mandatory Due Diligence Action:**

Request from ASBC:
1. Oregon DEQ Air Contaminant Discharge Permits for Portland brewery, Portland distillery, and Hood River meadery
2. Annual GHG emission reports submitted to Oregon DEQ (past 3 years)
3. NSPS Subpart Dc initial notifications and compliance certifications
4. Any correspondence with Oregon DEQ regarding air quality compliance

**Enforcement Exposure:**

Clean Air Act Section 113(b) authorizes civil penalties up to **$59,950 per day per violation** (2024 inflation-adjusted).⁴⁴ Realistic settlements for late GHG reporting or missing NSPS notifications typically range from $5,000-$25,000 for first-time violations with prompt corrective action.⁴⁵

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM-HIGH — The GHG reporting threshold exceedance at Portland facilities creates material compliance uncertainty. Missing GHG reports represent readily correctable violations but may indicate broader air quality permit gaps.

#### 4. Colorado Facility (Denver Brewery)

**Colorado Air Pollutant Emission Notice (APEN) Requirement:**

Colorado requires all businesses emitting air pollution to submit an Air Pollutant Emission Notice (Form APCD-100) to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) Air Pollution Control Division.⁴⁶ The Denver brewery's estimated 20 MMBtu/hr boiler generates approximately 6 tons per year of criteria pollutants, requiring APEN filing and likely registration or general permit.

**NESHAP Subpart JJJJJJ (Area Source Boiler Rule):**

Boilers subject to NESHAP Subpart JJJJJJ must submit initial notification to both EPA's Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) and the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division.⁴⁷

**New 2024 Requirement — Modeling Determination:**

Effective August 2023, sources with NOx, SO2, PM, or CO emissions must include a modeling determination (Form APCD-114) with permit applications.⁴⁸ This new requirement may apply to the Denver brewery if no APEN has been filed previously.

**Mandatory Due Diligence Action:**

Request from ASBC:
1. Colorado APEN filing (Form APCD-100) for Denver brewery
2. Any air quality permits, registrations, or general permit coverage
3. NESHAP Subpart JJJJJJ initial notification to EPA CEDRI and Colorado APCD
4. Modeling determination (Form APCD-114) if applicable

**Enforcement Exposure:** Similar to Oregon (CAA penalties $59,950/day), realistic settlement for late APEN filing: $5,000-$25,000.

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM — Denver brewery requires APEN filing and NESHAP notification. Missing filings represent correctable violations with modest penalty exposure.

#### 5. North Carolina Facility (Asheville Brewery)

**Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency Jurisdiction:**

Buncombe County operates a **local air quality program** separate from North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).⁴⁹ Air permits for Asheville facilities are issued by the Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency, not the state DEQ. Small boilers (less than 10 MMBtu/hr or natural gas boilers less than 50 MMBtu/hr) may be exempt from permitting requirements depending on local thresholds.

The Asheville brewery's small-scale operation (75,000 barrels annually) likely utilizes a boiler with less than 20 MMBtu/hr capacity. This may fall below local permit thresholds, making the facility **permit-exempt**. However, this determination must be verified with the local air quality agency.

**Mandatory Due Diligence Action:**

Request from ASBC:
1. Any air quality permits or correspondence with Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency
2. Boiler specifications (heat input capacity, fuel type, installation date)
3. Verification of permit-exempt status if no permit held

**Risk Assessment:** LOW-MEDIUM — Small-scale operation likely below permit thresholds, but verification required.

#### 6. Fermentation CO2 Emissions (Not Regulated)

Brewing fermentation converts sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide: C6H12O6 → 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2. The Portland brewery's 350,000 barrel annual production generates approximately **1,550 tons of CO2 per year** from fermentation, with combined ASBC brewing operations totaling approximately 2,100 tons CO2 annually.⁵⁰

Fermentation CO2 is **biogenic** (derived from recently-grown crops, not fossil fuels) and is **not regulated** under Clean Air Act Title V programs or state air quality programs.⁵¹ This biogenic CO2 is **not counted** toward GHG reporting thresholds — only combustion and industrial process CO2 contributes to the 2,500 metric ton reporting threshold.

#### 7. Distillery Ethanol Vapor Emissions (LOW SEVERITY)

Distillation generates volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from:
- Distillation process: Ethanol vapors from still condensers
- Barrel filling operations: Evaporative losses during transfer
- Barrel aging: "Angel's share" (2-4% volume loss per year from evaporation through barrel staves)

**Emission Estimate for Portland Distillery (100,000 proof gallons annually):**

Production losses: 2% of production = 2,000 proof gallons ethanol vapor
Ethanol vapor: 2,000 gallons × 6.6 lbs/gallon = 13,200 lbs = **6.6 tons per year VOC**⁵²

The distillery's 6.6 tons per year VOC emissions remain **below the 10 tons per year minor source threshold** applicable in most jurisdictions, eliminating the need for VOC-specific permits or control technologies.⁵³

**Risk Assessment:** LOW — Ethanol vapor emissions well below regulatory thresholds. No control technologies required.

### D. RCRA Hazardous Waste Compliance (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

#### 1. Hazardous Waste Generator Categories

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C establishes a comprehensive hazardous waste management framework.⁵⁴ Generator categories depend on monthly hazardous waste generation:⁵⁵

| Generator Category | Monthly Generation | Regulatory Requirements |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Very Small Quantity Generator (VSQG)** | <100 kg/month (220 lbs) | No EPA ID number; no manifests; 1,000 kg on-site accumulation limit; minimal training |
| **Small Quantity Generator (SQG)** | 100-1,000 kg/month | EPA ID number required; manifests required; 180-day accumulation (270 if >200 miles to TSDF); 6,000 kg on-site limit; personnel training; contingency plan; weekly inspections |
| **Large Quantity Generator (LQG)** | >1,000 kg/month | Full RCRA Subtitle C compliance; 90-day accumulation limit; biennial reports; comprehensive personnel training |

#### 2. Brewery/Distillery Hazardous Waste Streams

**Typical Waste Types and Classifications:**⁵⁶

| Waste Stream | RCRA Classification | Estimated Volume | Disposal Cost |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Spent cleaning solvents** | F001-F005 (halogenated/non-halogenated) | 10-50 gal/month | $5-$15/gallon (incineration) |
| **Caustic/acid solutions** | D002 (corrosive, pH ≤2 or ≥12.5) | 50-200 gal/month | $2-$5/gallon (neutralization) |
| **Spent lubricating oils** | D018 (benzene) or non-hazardous used oil | 20-50 gal/month | $3-$8/gallon |
| **Fluorescent bulbs** | Universal waste (mercury) | 50-100 bulbs/month | $1-$3 per bulb |
| **Lead-acid batteries** | Universal waste | 10-20 batteries/year | $1-$3 per battery |

**Non-Hazardous Brewery/Distillery Wastes:**
- Spent grains: Animal feed or composting (agricultural exemption)
- Spent yeast: Animal feed or yeast extract production
- Diatomaceous earth filter media: Solid waste landfill disposal
- Cardboard, glass, plastic packaging: Recycling programs

#### 3. Generator Status Analysis by Facility

**Portland Brewery/Distillery (Combined Operations):**

Estimated hazardous waste generation:
- Cleaning solvents: 30 gal/month × 7 lbs/gal = 210 lbs = **95 kg/month**
- Caustic/acid waste: 100 gal/month × 9 lbs/gal = 900 lbs = **408 kg/month**
- **Total: 503 kg/month** → **Small Quantity Generator (SQG) status**

**SQG Compliance Requirements:**⁵⁷
- EPA ID number from Oregon DEQ
- Hazardous waste manifests for all off-site shipments
- 180-day accumulation time limit (or 270 days if disposal facility located more than 200 miles away)
- 6,000 kg on-site accumulation limit
- Annual personnel training for hazardous waste handlers
- Contingency plan for emergency spills
- Weekly inspections of accumulation areas
- No biennial reports required (only LQGs submit biennial reports)

**Denver Brewery:**

Estimated hazardous waste generation: **~170 kg/month** → **Likely SQG status**

**Asheville Brewery:**

Estimated hazardous waste generation: **~80 kg/month** → **Likely VSQG status** (simplified compliance, no EPA ID or manifests required)

**Hood River Meadery:**

Estimated hazardous waste generation: **~10 kg/month** → **VSQG status**

#### 4. Compliance Verification Requirements

**Mandatory Due Diligence Documentation:**

Request from ASBC for Portland and Denver SQG facilities:
1. EPA ID numbers assigned by state environmental agencies
2. Hazardous waste manifests for past 36 months showing waste types, quantities, destinations
3. Personnel training records (annual hazardous waste handler training)
4. Waste accumulation logs (on-site storage quantities and dates)
5. Disposal contracts with licensed Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs)
6. Weekly inspection records
7. Contingency plans and emergency procedures

**Typical Annual Disposal Costs:**⁵⁸
- Caustic/acid waste: $2-$5/gallon = $12,000-$24,000 annually (Portland)
- Spent solvents: $5-$15/gallon = $6,000-$18,000 annually (Portland)
- Universal wastes: $1-$3 per unit = $2,000-$6,000 annually (all facilities)
- **Total annual hazardous waste disposal (SQG facilities): $20,000-$50,000**

#### 5. Enforcement Exposure

RCRA Section 3008(g) authorizes civil penalties up to **$78,376 per day per violation** (2024 inflation-adjusted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 6928(g) and 40 CFR § 19.4).⁵⁹ Common violations include:
- Failure to obtain EPA ID number (SQG/LQG facilities)
- Improper manifesting or incomplete manifest documentation
- Exceeding accumulation time limits (180/270 days for SQG, 90 days for LQG)
- Inadequate personnel training
- Missing or incomplete inspections

Realistic settlement amounts for first-time manifest violations or procedural deficiencies with prompt corrective action typically range from $10,000-$30,000.⁶⁰

**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM — Portland and Denver facilities require EPA ID numbers and manifest compliance as SQGs. Asheville and Hood River likely qualify as VSQGs with minimal requirements. No EPA ECHO enforcement records identified, but facility-specific compliance requires verification through state agency records and ASBC documentation.

### E. CERCLA Successor Liability and Phase I ESA Requirements (CRITICAL SEVERITY)

#### 1. CERCLA Liability Framework

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or "Superfund") establishes one of the most stringent environmental liability regimes in federal law.⁶¹ Section 107(a) of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)) imposes liability on four categories of potentially responsible parties (PRPs):

1. **Current owners and operators** of facilities with hazardous substance releases (§ 9607(a)(1))
2. **Past owners/operators** at the time of disposal (§ 9607(a)(2))
3. **Arrangers** for disposal or treatment (§ 9607(a)(3))
4. **Transporters** who selected disposal sites (§ 9607(a)(4))⁶²

CERCLA liability is:
- **Strict:** No proof of negligence, intent, or fault required
- **Joint and several:** Any single PRP can be liable for entire cleanup cost
- **Retroactive:** Applies to contamination predating CERCLA's 1980 enactment⁶³

#### 2. Successor Liability in Asset Acquisitions

Asset purchases do not automatically shield buyers from environmental liability. Most federal circuits apply **federal common law successor liability doctrine** for CERCLA cases, holding that buyers inherit "current owner" liability despite state corporate law protections that might otherwise limit successor liability in asset transactions.⁶⁴

The U.S. Congressional Research Service confirms: "Most federal circuits apply uniform federal common law for successor liability under CERCLA, noting CERCLA's remedial purposes override state laws that allow liability avoidance through mergers or asset sales."⁶⁵ This federal common law approach means that regardless of transaction structure (stock purchase vs. asset purchase), the acquirer assumes current owner liability under CERCLA § 107(a)(1) for pre-existing contamination.

#### 3. Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser (BFPP) Defense

Congress created the Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser defense in the 2002 Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act to encourage redevelopment of contaminated properties.⁶⁶ CERCLA § 107(r) (42 U.S.C. § 9607(r)) provides that a BFPP is not liable under § 107(a)(1) if:

1. **All disposal occurred before acquisition** (no new contamination introduced)
2. **All Appropriate Inquiries (AAI) conducted** before acquisition
3. Purchaser **not affiliated** with any potentially responsible party
4. Purchaser exercises **appropriate care** regarding hazardous substances
5. Purchaser takes **precautions** against releases
6. Purchaser provides **full cooperation** with response actions
7. Purchaser complies with **institutional controls** and land use restrictions⁶⁷

The **All Appropriate Inquiries** requirement is satisfied by conducting a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment conforming to ASTM E1527-21 standard, which became effective February 13, 2024.⁶⁸

#### 4. ASTM E1527-21 Phase I ESA Standard

Phase I ESAs following ASTM E1527-21 methodology include:⁶⁹

**Component 1: Records Review**
- Federal databases: EPA CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL/Superfund), RCRA Treatment Storage Disposal Facilities (TSDFs), RCRA Corrective Action (CORRACTS), Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUST)
- State databases: Voluntary cleanup programs, brownfields, spill incident reports
- Historical research: Sanborn fire insurance maps, aerial photographs (decade intervals), city directories, chain of title

**Component 2: Site Reconnaissance**
- Physical inspection for underground/aboveground storage tanks (USTs/ASTs)
- Visual observation of stained soil, stressed vegetation
- Identification of drums, containers of chemicals/waste
- Assessment of electrical transformers (potential PCB contamination)
- Building materials assessment (asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paint)

**Component 3: Interviews**
- Current property owner, facility manager, operators
- Neighboring property owners and occupants
- Local government officials (building department, fire department)

**Component 4: Report Preparation**
- Identification of Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs)
- Recommendations for Phase II Environmental Site Assessment if RECs identified
- Professional certification by qualified environmental professional

#### 5. Critical Finding: Absence of Phase I ESAs

**MOST CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISK IDENTIFIED:**

Research has found **no evidence that ASBC has conducted Phase I Environmental Site Assessments** at any of its five facilities:
- Portland Brewery
- Portland Distillery
- Denver Brewery
- Asheville Brewery
- Hood River Meadery

**Legal Consequence: Loss of BFPP Defense**

Without Phase I ESAs conducted before acquisition, the BFPP defense under CERCLA § 107(r) is **UNAVAILABLE**. The acquirer assumes **unlimited, strict, joint and several liability** for all pre-existing contamination at all five facilities, including:

- Underground storage tank (UST) leaks (petroleum hydrocarbons: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes)
- Historical solvent disposal (chlorinated solvents: trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene)
- Metals contamination (lead, arsenic, chromium from historical industrial uses)
- Off-site disposal liability (Superfund contribution claims from other PRPs at disposal sites used by prior owners)⁷⁰

#### 6. Brewery/Distillery Contamination Risk Profile

Craft beverage production facilities present a **lower contamination risk profile** compared to heavy manufacturing:

**Lower-Risk Factors:**
- Modern facilities (post-2000 construction) minimize legacy contamination
- Primary wastes are organic (spent grains, yeast, stillage) classified as non-hazardous
- Natural gas fuel eliminates fuel oil underground storage tanks
- Smaller chemical inventories than industrial manufacturing

**Contamination Concerns Requiring Investigation:**
- Historical property uses before brewery/distillery operations (manufacturing, auto repair, dry cleaning, etc.)
- Former underground storage tanks for heating oil or gasoline
- Refrigeration equipment maintenance areas (historical Freon/ammonia releases)
- Neighboring property contamination that may have migrated onto ASBC properties⁷¹

Despite the lower-risk profile, the **Phase I ESA is the only method to identify these risks before acquisition**. The cost of Phase I ESAs ($15,000-$30,000 total for five facilities) is **de minimis** compared to potential CERCLA exposure ($100,000 for minor petroleum releases to $10,000,000+ for Superfund-eligible sites).

#### 7. Mandatory Pre-Closing Action: Commission Phase I ESAs

**Required Scope:**

Commission ASTM E1527-21 compliant Phase I Environmental Site Assessments for:
1. Portland Brewery (street address required)
2. Portland Distillery (street address required)
3. Denver Brewery (street address required)
4. Asheville Brewery (street address required)
5. Hood River Meadery (street address required)

**Cost and Timeline:**
- Phase I ESA cost: $3,000-$6,000 per facility
- **Total budget: $15,000-$30,000** for five facilities
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks per facility (can be conducted in parallel)
- If Recognized Environmental Conditions (RECs) identified: Phase II ESA required (soil/groundwater sampling, $10,000-$50,000 per site depending on scope)⁷²

**CERCLA Affiliation Risk:**

The acquirer must verify that it is **not affiliated** with ASBC or any potentially responsible parties at contaminated sites. CERCLA § 107(r)(1)(B)(ii) defines affiliation to include familial relationships, contractual relationships, and corporate relationships.⁷³ If the acquisition creates affiliation before Phase I ESAs are completed, the BFPP defense may be unavailable even if Phase I ESAs are conducted. The Phase I ESAs should therefore be commissioned and completed **before executing the definitive purchase agreement** to ensure temporal separation from affiliation.

#### 8. Draft Closing Condition and Indemnification Language

**Recommended Purchase Agreement Provisions:**

> **Section X.Y — Environmental Site Assessments:**
>
> (a) **Phase I ESA Requirement.** No later than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall commission ASTM E1527-21 compliant Phase I Environmental Site Assessments for each of the five (5) Purchased Facilities. Seller shall provide Buyer and Buyer's environmental consultants with reasonable access to the Purchased Facilities and shall cooperate with requests for historical information, interviews, and document production.
>
> (b) **No Material RECs.** It shall be a condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to close that the Phase I ESAs identify no Material Recognized Environmental Conditions (as defined below) at any Purchased Facility, OR, if Material RECs are identified, Seller shall (i) complete remediation to the satisfaction of Buyer's environmental consultants prior to Closing, or (ii) retain 100% liability for all costs associated with Material RECs through an indemnification provision with no cap and no time limit.
>
> (c) **Definition of Material REC.** For purposes of this Agreement, a "Material Recognized Environmental Condition" means any recognized environmental condition identified in a Phase I ESA that: (i) presents estimated remediation costs exceeding $100,000; (ii) involves contamination of soil or groundwater above applicable residential or commercial cleanup standards established by federal or state environmental agencies; or (iii) involves presence or suspected presence of CERCLA hazardous substances in quantities reportable under 40 CFR Part 302.
>
> (d) **Seller Indemnification.** Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its successors and assigns from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to: (i) any environmental contamination at the Purchased Facilities existing as of the Closing Date, whether known or unknown; (ii) any violation of environmental laws by Seller occurring prior to the Closing Date; (iii) any disposal of hazardous substances or wastes by Seller prior to the Closing Date at off-site locations; and (iv) any failure to conduct proper All Appropriate Inquiries sufficient to establish Buyer's status as a Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser under CERCLA § 107(r). This indemnification obligation shall survive Closing indefinitely and shall not be subject to any cap, basket, or other limitation.

**Environmental Escrow Recommendation:**

In addition to general indemnity escrow, establish a specific **Environmental Remediation Escrow** of $500,000-$1,000,000 held for 36 months to cover:
- Phase II investigation costs if Phase I ESAs identify RECs ($50,000-$200,000)
- Remediation costs for known contamination ($100,000-$500,000)
- Ongoing compliance costs exceeding budgeted amounts
- Environmental regulatory penalties from pre-closing violations ($25,000-$105,000)

See Financial Impact Analysis § II.G (Environmental Risk), at pp. 183-201, and Section VII.E (CERCLA Successor Liability), supra at ¶¶ 454-598, for quantified CERCLA exposure analysis and $500K-$1M environmental escrow recommendation for 36 months.

**Risk Assessment:** **CRITICAL** — The absence of Phase I ESAs represents the most significant environmental compliance deficiency in this transaction. Without Phase I ESAs, CERCLA liability exposure is unknown and potentially unlimited. Commissioning Phase I ESAs immediately is **MANDATORY** to preserve the BFPP defense and enable informed acquisition decision-making.

### F. Annual Environmental Compliance Budget (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

Post-acquisition, ASBC will incur ongoing environmental compliance costs across five facilities. Based on regulatory requirements and industry benchmarks:⁷⁴

#### 1. Wastewater Pretreatment Costs

| Facility | Annual Cost | Basis |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Portland Brewery extra-strength charges | $50,000-$150,000 | High-BOD discharge surcharges from Portland BES |
| Denver Brewery pretreatment/surcharges | $20,000-$40,000 | Metro Water Recovery requirements |
| Asheville Brewery (minimal) | $5,000-$10,000 | Below permit threshold, minimal costs |
| **Subtotal Wastewater** | **$75,000-$200,000** | |

#### 2. Distillery Stillage Disposal

| Method | Annual Cost | Basis |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Beneficial reuse (transportation) | $26,500-$79,500 | 530K-795K gallons at $0.05-$0.10/gallon |

#### 3. Air Emissions Compliance

| Compliance Activity | Annual Cost | Basis |
|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Permit fees (OR, CO, NC) | $5,000-$10,000 | State permit annual fees |
| GHG emission reporting (Portland) | $3,000-$5,000 | Consultant preparation of annual GHG report |
| Emissions testing/monitoring | $5,000-$10,000 | Periodic stack testing if required |

|------------------|------------|-------|
| Portland/Denver (SQG) | $20,000-$40,000 | Manifest disposal of solvents, caustics, acids |
| Asheville/Hood River (VSQG) | $3,000-$8,000 | Minimal hazardous waste generation |
| **Subtotal Hazardous Waste** | **$23,000-$48,000** | |

#### 5. Environmental Compliance Consulting and Audits

| Service | Annual Cost | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Annual environmental compliance audit | $15,000-$30,000 | Third-party audit of all five facilities |
| Regulatory consulting (permits, reporting) | $10,000-$25,000 | On-call environmental consultant |
| Training (hazardous waste, stormwater) | $3,000-$10,000 | Annual personnel training |
| **Subtotal Consulting** | **$28,000-$65,000** | |

#### 6. Total Annual Environmental Compliance Budget

| Category | Annual Cost |
|----------|------------|

| Compliance consulting/audits | $28,000-$65,000 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL COMPLIANCE BUDGET** | **$167,500-$422,500** |

**Budget Recommendation:** Allocate **$200,000-$450,000 annually** for environmental compliance across ASBC's five facilities. This represents **1.1-2.5% of ASBC's $18M EBITDA**, a material operating expense that should be incorporated into acquisition valuation models.

See Financial Impact Analysis § III.B (Operating Expense Adjustments), at pp. 215-228, for analysis of annual environmental compliance budget of $167K-$423K as material operating expense adjustment.

### G. Recommended Closing Conditions and Remediation Requirements

#### 1. Tier 1 Mandatory Closing Conditions (Deal-Breakers)

**Condition 1: Phase I ESAs for All Five Facilities**

**Requirement:** Buyer shall commission ASTM E1527-21 compliant Phase I Environmental Site Assessments for all five ASBC facilities no later than 30 days prior to scheduled closing date. Phase I ESAs must be completed and delivered to Buyer no later than 10 days prior to closing.

**Standard:** Phase I ESAs must identify no Material Recognized Environmental Conditions (estimated remediation >$100,000, contamination above residential/commercial cleanup standards, or CERCLA reportable quantities).

**Remedy if Material RECs Identified:**
- **Option A:** Seller completes remediation prior to closing at Seller's expense
- **Option B:** Seller retains 100% liability through uncapped, unlimited-duration indemnification
- **Option C:** Purchase price reduced by remediation cost estimate plus 50% contingency
- **Walk-Away:** If remediation costs exceed $1,000,000 per facility, Buyer may terminate without penalty

**Rationale:** Phase I ESAs are **MANDATORY** to preserve BFPP defense and prevent unlimited CERCLA successor liability. Without Phase I ESAs, acquirer inherits unknown and potentially catastrophic environmental liability.

**Condition 2: Distillery Stillage Disposal Documentation**

**Requirement:** Seller shall provide documentation evidencing compliant disposal of distillery stillage for the past 36 months, including:
- Contracts with receiving farms (beneficial reuse) or licensed waste haulers
- Transportation records showing volume, frequency, and destination
- Oregon DEQ Agricultural Use Exclusion applicability determination
- Nutrient management plans if land application exceeds 50,000 gallons per year per farm

**Standard:** Documentation must demonstrate compliance with Oregon solid waste regulations (OAR 340-093-0030) and Clean Water Act provisions prohibiting unpermitted discharge.

**Remedy if Non-Compliant Disposal Identified:**
- Seller retains liability for any penalties or remediation arising from pre-closing disposal practices
- Environmental escrow increased by $500,000-$1,000,000 for remediation contingency
- If ongoing non-compliant disposal (discharge to stormwater, unpermitted dumping), Buyer may terminate

**Rationale:** Distillery stillage represents 530K-795K gallons annually of high-strength waste with limited disposal options. Non-compliant disposal creates penalty exposure of $10,000-$60,000 per day under Oregon DEQ and federal CWA regulations.

**Condition 3: Clean Water Act Permit Compliance Verification**

**Requirement:** Seller shall provide current Industrial Wastewater Discharge Permits or Alternative Discharge Control Mechanisms for Portland, Denver, and Asheville breweries, together with:
- Self-monitoring reports for past 24 months (BOD, TSS, pH test results)
- Compliance correspondence with POTWs (Portland BES, Metro Water Recovery, MSD Buncombe County)
- Extra-strength charge invoices (past 24 months)
- Any notices of violation, warning letters, or enforcement actions

**Standard:** No material violations (BOD exceedances >50% above permit limits, pH violations outside 5.0-11.5 range) in past 24 months. Any violations must have been cured and no enforcement actions pending.

**Remedy if Material Violations Identified:**
- Seller retains liability for penalties or remediation related to pre-closing violations
- Environmental escrow increased by estimated penalty exposure ($10,000-$50,000 per violation)

**Rationale:** CWA violations carry penalties up to $59,950 per day. Material permit violations indicate systemic compliance failures requiring remediation and potential capital investment in pretreatment systems.

#### 2. Tier 2 Strongly Recommended Closing Conditions

**Condition 4: Air Quality Permit Verification**

**Requirement:** Seller shall provide:
- Oregon DEQ air permits (Portland brewery, Portland distillery, Hood River meadery)
- Oregon GHG emission reports for past 3 years (Portland facilities)
- Colorado APEN filing and air permits (Denver brewery)
- NESHAP Subpart JJJJJJ initial notifications for all boiler-equipped facilities
- Asheville-Buncombe Air Quality Agency permits or permit-exempt status verification

**Standard:** All required permits obtained, all required reports filed, no notices of violation pending.

**Remedy if Missing Permits/Reports:**
- Seller funds $25,000-$50,000 to escrow for late-filing penalties and permit application costs
- Buyer completes permit applications and GHG reporting post-closing, drawing from escrow

**Condition 5: RCRA Hazardous Waste Compliance**

**Requirement:** For Portland and Denver SQG facilities, Seller shall provide:
- EPA ID numbers from state environmental agencies
- Hazardous waste manifests for past 36 months
- Personnel training records (annual hazardous waste handler training)
- Disposal contracts with licensed TSDFs
- Weekly inspection logs

**Standard:** All manifests complete and submitted timely, EPA ID numbers obtained, disposal contracts current with licensed facilities.

**Remedy if Violations Identified:**
- Seller retains liability for penalties related to manifest violations or disposal to unlicensed facilities
- Environmental escrow increased by $10,000-$30,000 for potential RCRA penalties

#### 3. Post-Closing Environmental Action Plan (First 90 Days)

**Week 1-2:**
- Retain environmental consulting firm for compliance audit and ongoing consulting support ($15K-$30K annual retainer)
- Review all Phase I ESA reports and determine if any Phase II investigations required
- If Phase II required, commission soil/groundwater sampling immediately ($10K-$50K per facility)

**Week 3-4:**
- File any missing air permit applications or NESHAP notifications (Colorado APEN, Oregon GHG reports)
- Verify distillery stillage disposal contracts in place and compliant with regulations
- Establish environmental compliance calendar (permit renewals, reporting deadlines, training schedules)

**Week 5-8:**
- Conduct comprehensive environmental compliance audit covering all five facilities
- Assess wastewater pretreatment systems and determine if capital investment required to reduce BOD surcharges
- Evaluate distillery stillage disposal economics (beneficial reuse vs. alternative disposal methods)

**Week 9-12:**
- Implement corrective actions identified in compliance audit
- Update environmental compliance procedures and personnel training programs
- Establish quarterly environmental risk dashboards for executive management

**Total 90-Day Environmental Budget:** $50,000-$150,000 (Phase I ESAs, Phase II if needed, compliance audit, permit applications, consulting support)

See Section VII.H (Risk Quantification), supra at ¶¶ 770-829, for aggregate environmental adjustment recommendation of $500K-$1M escrow (base case) to $1M-$5M purchase price reduction (severe downside scenario).

### I. Conclusions and Recommendations

#### 1. Overall Environmental Risk Assessment

**Risk Rating: MEDIUM-HIGH** (elevated to HIGH until Phase I ESAs completed)

**Primary Risk Drivers:**
1. **Absence of Phase I ESAs (CRITICAL):** Eliminates BFPP defense, creates unlimited CERCLA successor liability
2. **Distillery stillage disposal documentation gap (HIGH):** 530K-795K gallons annually with unclear disposal method
3. **GHG reporting threshold exceedance (MEDIUM-HIGH):** Portland facilities likely exceed 2,500 metric ton reporting threshold
4. **Annual environmental compliance costs (CERTAIN):** $167K-$423K annually (1.1-2.5% of EBITDA)

- [ ] Colorado APEN filing and air permits verified for Denver brewery
- [ ] NESHAP Subpart JJJJJJ initial notifications verified for all boiler facilities
- [ ] EPA ID numbers obtained for Portland and Denver SQG facilities
- [ ] Hazardous waste manifests reviewed (past 36 months, no major violations)
- [ ] Disposal contracts verified current with licensed TSDFs

**DESIRABLE (Can Complete Post-Closing):**
- [ ] Environmental compliance audit scheduled (first 90 days post-closing)
- [ ] Wastewater pretreatment system assessment (capital investment analysis)
- [ ] Distillery stillage disposal economics evaluation (beneficial reuse vs. alternatives)
- [ ] Environmental management system implementation (ISO 14001 or equivalent)

#### 7. Transaction Decision Framework

**PROCEED WITH CONFIDENCE IF:**
- Phase I ESAs identify no Material Recognized Environmental Conditions
- Distillery stillage disposal documented as compliant beneficial reuse
- CWA pretreatment permits current with no material violations
- Environmental compliance escrow of $500,000 (36 months) established

**PROCEED WITH ENHANCED PROTECTIONS IF:**
- Phase I ESAs identify Material RECs requiring Phase II investigation
- Distillery stillage disposal method unclear or potentially non-compliant
- CWA or CAA permit gaps identified (missing permits, late reports)
- **Required:** Environmental compliance escrow increased to $1,000,000 (36 months)
- **Required:** Seller retains liability for identified RECs through uncapped indemnification

**NEGOTIATE PURCHASE PRICE REDUCTION IF:**
- Phase I ESAs identify contamination requiring immediate remediation (cost estimate >$500,000)
- Distillery stillage disposal documented as non-compliant (ongoing discharge violations)
- Multiple regulatory violations identified across CWA, CAA, RCRA (aggregate penalty exposure >$100,000)
- **Recommended reduction:** Remediation cost estimate + 50% contingency

**WALK AWAY IF:**
- Phase I ESAs identify contamination requiring remediation exceeding $1,000,000 per facility
- Distillery stillage documented as discharge to waters of the United States (creating ongoing CWA violation)
- Seller refuses to provide environmental documentation or cooperate with due diligence
- Seller refuses to provide uncapped environmental indemnification for identified Material RECs

The environmental compliance analysis reveals **manageable risks** if mandatory pre-closing actions are completed. The **absence of Phase I ESAs is the critical deficiency** requiring immediate remediation. With Phase I ESAs completed, compliant stillage disposal verified, and $500K-$1M environmental escrow established, the environmental risk profile aligns with typical craft beverage acquisition parameters.
