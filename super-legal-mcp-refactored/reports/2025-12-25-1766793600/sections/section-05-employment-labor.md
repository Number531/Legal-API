## V. EMPLOYMENT & LABOR COMPLIANCE

The Employment & Labor compliance landscape for ASBC presents material financial and operational risks totaling $2.1M-$4.3M in probable exposure, with worst-case scenarios extending to $9.6M-$27.5M. Four HIGH and MEDIUM severity findings require immediate pre-closing remediation: the EEOC Gonzalez retaliation charge ($231K-$688K exposure), systemic wage/hour class action risk ($1.8M-$11.8M depending on class certification), multi-state alcohol server training compliance gaps across 950 taproom employees in jurisdictions imposing criminal liability for violations, and dram shop liability defense weaknesses in pending Oregon litigation. ASBC's 1,850-employee workforce spans five states with divergent regulatory frameworks, creating compliance complexity that materializes through both pending litigation and undisclosed systemic violations discovered during this due diligence investigation.

The analysis reveals three categories of exposure requiring distinct remediation approaches: (1) **Individual Employment Litigation** — the Gonzalez EEOC charge presents a strong prima facie retaliation case based on two-week temporal proximity between protected wage complaint and termination, requiring settlement authority of $150K-$350K; (2) **Systemic Wage/Hour Violations** — unpaid prep/cleanup work affecting 950 taproom employees creates class action exposure ranging from $1.8M (30% opt-in) to $11.8M (100% opt-in), necessitating immediate timekeeping audit and remediation; and (3) **Regulatory Compliance Gaps** — expired or missing alcohol server certifications in Oregon, Washington, and California undermine ASBC's dram shop defense in the Smith v. ASBC litigation while exposing the company to regulatory sanctions including liquor license suspension and criminal penalties.

### A. EEOC GONZALEZ RETALIATION CHARGE (HIGH SEVERITY)

Maria Gonzalez, a Hispanic female bartender employed at ASBC's Denver taproom from 2022-2024, filed an EEOC charge in October 2024 alleging national origin discrimination and retaliation. The charge arose from a July 2024 wage complaint to the Colorado Department of Labor alleging unpaid overtime for 15-30 minutes per shift of prep/cleanup work, followed by ASBC's termination of Gonzalez approximately **two weeks later** in August 2024. Research confirms that two-week temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse employment action creates a sufficiently strong inference of causation to survive summary judgment under current federal retaliation jurisprudence, particularly when combined with evidence of pretextual employer justifications.¹

#### 1. Prima Facie Retaliation Case Analysis

Under Title VII's retaliation prohibition, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by demonstrating: (1) engagement in protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection between the two.² Gonzalez satisfies all three elements with unusually strong evidence on the critical causation prong.

**Protected Activity.** Gonzalez's July 2024 wage complaint constitutes protected activity under multiple federal and state statutory frameworks. Filing a complaint with a state labor agency alleging unpaid overtime violations is protected under FLSA § 215(a)(3), which prohibits retaliation against employees who file complaints or institute proceedings under the Act.³ Colorado's COMPS Order § 7 provides parallel state-law protection, prohibiting employers from retaliating against employees for asserting wage rights.⁴ Additionally, if Gonzalez's wage complaint included allegations that compensation disparities correlated with her national origin, the complaint may constitute opposition to discrimination under Title VII's opposition clause, which protects employees who complain about practices they reasonably believe violate anti-discrimination laws.⁵

**Adverse Action.** Termination of employment constitutes a materially adverse action under any standard. The Supreme Court's *Burlington Northern* formulation — whether the action "well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination" — is easily satisfied when the employer terminates the complaining employee.⁶

**Causal Connection — Temporal Proximity Analysis.** Lower federal courts consistently find that two weeks between protected activity and termination creates a "very close" temporal proximity sufficient to establish the causal element at the prima facie stage.⁷ The Fourth Circuit has held that "a period of three to four months between the protected activity and the adverse action is not too long to establish a causal connection," implicitly treating shorter periods as even stronger evidence.⁸ The Tenth Circuit (governing Colorado) has found temporal proximity of less than two months sufficient where other circumstantial evidence of retaliation exists.⁹

The Supreme Court's 2013 decision in *University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar* heightened the causation standard for Title VII retaliation claims, requiring "but-for" causation rather than the more lenient "motivating factor" test applicable to discrimination claims.¹⁰ Post-*Nassar*, some circuits held that temporal proximity alone cannot establish but-for causation; however, courts continue to find temporal proximity sufficient when **combined with other circumstantial evidence** such as inconsistent employer explanations, procedural deviations from standard practice, or employer knowledge of the protected activity.¹¹

**2025 Legal Development.** In March 2025, Justices Thomas and Gorsuch questioned whether the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework "distorts" employment discrimination analysis by requiring plaintiffs to "win" at the summary judgment stage rather than merely surviving to trial.¹² The Eleventh Circuit responded by adopting a "big picture" approach: even when an employer articulates a facially legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for an adverse action, courts must consider the totality of circumstances — including temporal proximity, procedural irregularities, and comparator evidence — rather than mechanically applying the three-stage framework.¹³ This development strengthens Gonzalez's position, as her case combines very close temporal proximity with potential pretext evidence.

#### 2. Pretext Analysis — Vulnerability of ASBC's Stated Justifications

ASBC asserts three reasons for Gonzalez's termination: (1) three customer complaints between June-July 2024 regarding rude service and incorrect orders; (2) cash register discrepancies totaling $350 over six months; and (3) tardiness (late eight times in 2024).¹⁴ Each justification presents pretext vulnerabilities that plaintiff's counsel will exploit.

**Timing of Documentation.** The critical pretext question is whether ASBC documented Gonzalez's performance deficiencies **before** she filed her July 2024 wage complaint. If customer complaints, cash discrepancies, and tardiness incidents were not memorialized in her personnel file prior to the protected activity, the post-complaint documentation appears reactive and pretextual. Courts are particularly skeptical of employer records created or compiled shortly after an employee engages in protected activity, viewing such documentation as evidence that the employer searched for justifications after deciding to retaliate.¹⁵

**Comparator Evidence.** To demonstrate pretext, Gonzalez can introduce evidence that similarly situated non-Hispanic employees with comparable performance issues were treated more favorably — specifically, not terminated. The DOJ's guidance on proving discrimination emphasizes that "especially relevant to showing pretext would be evidence that white employees involved in acts of comparable seriousness were nevertheless retained or rehired."¹⁶ Discovery should identify all Denver taproom employee terminations from 2022-2024, analyzing whether non-Hispanic bartenders with similar customer complaints, cash shortages, or attendance issues received progressive discipline rather than immediate termination.

**Inconsistent Application of Policies.** If ASBC tolerates $350 cash discrepancies or eight tardiness incidents for other employees without termination, Gonzalez can argue that ASBC applied disciplinary standards inconsistently. The key inquiry is whether ASBC's Employee Handbook specifies that three customer complaints, $350 in shortages, or eight late arrivals constitute grounds for immediate termination without progressive discipline. If ASBC's written policies or past practice indicate that employees typically receive written warnings, performance improvement plans, or suspensions before termination, moving directly to termination for Gonzalez suggests disparate treatment.¹⁷

**Procedural Deviations.** Did ASBC follow its standard termination procedures for Gonzalez? Courts view procedural irregularities as probative of pretext, particularly when an employer deviates from established protocols immediately after an employee engages in protected activity. Relevant questions include: (1) Did HR review the termination decision? (2) Did Gonzalez receive progressive discipline? (3) Was the termination decision approved at appropriate management levels? (4) Did ASBC conduct an investigation before terminating Gonzalez?¹⁸

#### 3. National Origin Discrimination Claim (Weaker but Not Frivolous)

Gonzalez's national origin discrimination claim requires comparator evidence demonstrating that non-Hispanic employees in similar circumstances were treated more favorably. The McDonnell Douglas framework for discrimination claims requires the plaintiff to establish: (1) membership in a protected class; (2) qualification for the position; (3) adverse employment action; and (4) circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.¹⁹ Gonzalez satisfies the first three elements but faces an evidentiary gap on the fourth.

**Arlington Heights Alternative Framework.** Even without direct comparator evidence, Gonzalez may attempt to prove national origin discrimination through the *Village of Arlington Heights* factors: (1) statements by ASBC managers reflecting national origin bias; (2) statistical evidence showing disparate termination rates for Hispanic employees; (3) historical background suggesting ASBC's pattern of discrimination; and (4) procedural and substantive departures from normal decision-making processes.²⁰ Plaintiff's counsel will seek discovery on ASBC's workforce demographics, compensation patterns, and termination rates by national origin to build circumstantial evidence of systemic discrimination.

The practical weakness of the national origin claim is that it requires more extensive discovery and expert testimony on statistical disparities, increasing litigation costs and complexity. Most plaintiffs and their counsel prioritize the retaliation claim, which presents a simpler causation narrative and may warrant settlement earlier in litigation.

#### 4. Exposure Quantification and Settlement Analysis

**Back Pay.** Gonzalez's back pay exposure spans approximately 16 months from termination in August 2024 through December 2025 (trial date estimate). Based on her estimated monthly compensation of $2,200 (Colorado tipped minimum wage plus average tips), back pay totals $35,200.²¹ Back pay is not subject to the statutory damages cap and continues to accrue until trial or settlement.

**Compensatory Damages.** Title VII authorizes compensatory damages for emotional distress, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other non-pecuniary injuries.²² Compensatory damages in retaliation cases typically range from $50,000-$200,000 depending on severity of emotional harm, medical treatment sought, and impact on plaintiff's career and personal life.²³ Factors that increase compensatory awards include: documented medical treatment for depression or anxiety; expert testimony from mental health professionals; corroborating testimony from family members describing plaintiff's emotional deterioration; and evidence that plaintiff suffered career setbacks or prolonged unemployment due to the retaliatory termination.²⁴

**Punitive Damages.** Punitive damages are available under Title VII when the defendant acted with "malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual."²⁵ The Supreme Court in *Kolstad v. American Dental Association* held that punitive damages may be awarded upon a showing of the employer's "evil motive or intent" or "reckless or callous indifference" to the employee's federally protected rights.²⁶ Punitive damages are more likely when the temporal proximity is extremely close (suggesting deliberate retaliation) or when company leadership was directly involved in the termination decision despite knowing about the protected activity.

**Statutory Cap.** The Civil Rights Act of 1991 caps combined compensatory and punitive damages based on employer size. For employers with 500+ employees, the cap is $300,000.²⁷ ASBC's 1,850-employee workforce places it in the highest tier, subjecting it to the $300,000 cap. However, the cap does **not** apply to back pay, front pay, or attorney's fees, which are recoverable in addition to the capped compensatory and punitive damages.²⁸

**Front Pay.** When reinstatement is not feasible due to workplace hostility or plaintiff's loss of trust in the employer, courts award front pay representing future lost earnings.²⁹ Front pay calculations typically span one to two years, reflecting the period necessary for plaintiff to secure comparable employment. Based on Gonzalez's $2,200 monthly compensation, front pay ranges from $26,400 (one year) to $52,800 (two years).³⁰

**Attorney's Fees.** Prevailing plaintiffs in Title VII actions are entitled to reasonable attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k).³¹ Retaliation cases typically involve 300-500 attorney hours through trial, billed at $400-$600 per hour depending on counsel's experience and market, producing attorney's fees of $120,000-$300,000.³² Fees increase substantially if the case proceeds to appeal.

**Total Exposure Summary:**

| Component | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Back Pay | $35,200 | $35,200 | August 2024 - December 2025 |
| Compensatory Damages | $50,000 | $200,000 | Emotional distress |
| Punitive Damages | $0 | $100,000 | Malice standard |
| **Damages Cap Applied** | $50,000 | $300,000 | Comp + punitive combined |
| Front Pay | $26,400 | $52,800 | 1-2 years |
| Attorney's Fees | $120,000 | $300,000 | 300-500 hours |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | **$231,600** | **$688,000** | |

**Settlement Range.** Considering the strength of Gonzalez's prima facie case, the pretext vulnerabilities in ASBC's justifications, and the risk of a jury trial, reasonable settlement range is **$150,000-$350,000**. This range accounts for: (1) strong temporal proximity evidence; (2) potential comparator evidence from discovery; (3) litigation costs and management time diverted from operations; and (4) reputational risk from public EEOC proceedings. Settlement at the lower end ($150,000) is achievable if discovery reveals that ASBC documented performance issues before Gonzalez's wage complaint and applied discipline consistently across all Denver taproom employees. Settlement at the higher end ($350,000) becomes necessary if comparator evidence demonstrates disparate treatment or if procedural irregularities undermine ASBC's credibility.

**Recommended Pre-Closing Action:**

ABP should require ASBC to authorize settlement negotiations with Gonzalez's counsel at the $150K-$350K range **prior to closing**, with final settlement conditioned on general release of all claims, waiver of class action participation rights (to the extent legally permissible), and confidentiality provisions. Pre-closing settlement eliminates the distraction of ongoing EEOC proceedings during integration, removes a source of employee morale issues at the Denver taproom, and caps exposure at a known amount rather than allowing the case to proceed toward unpredictable trial outcomes.

### B. WAGE AND HOUR CLASS ACTION RISK (HIGH SEVERITY)

Gonzalez's July 2024 wage complaint alleging unpaid prep/cleanup work creates systemic class action exposure affecting all 950 taproom employees across ASBC's 18 locations. The alleged wage violations — requiring bartenders and servers to perform 15-30 minutes per shift of off-the-clock stocking, cleaning, and POS system preparation — satisfy the FLSA's "integral and indispensable" standard for compensable time, exposing ASBC to back wages, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees ranging from $1.8M (conservative 30% opt-in scenario) to $11.8M (worst-case 100% opt-in scenario).³³

#### 1. FLSA "Integral and Indispensable" Standard — Legal Framework

The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to compensate employees for all hours "suffered or permitted to work," including time spent on activities that are integral and indispensable to the employee's principal job duties.³⁴ The Supreme Court's decision in *Steiner v. Mitchell*, 350 U.S. 247 (1956), established that activities performed before or after the scheduled shift are compensable if they are "integral and indispensable" to the work the employee is employed to perform.³⁵

The Department of Labor's Fact Sheet #22 clarifies that "integral and indispensable" activities include those that are "an intrinsic element of [the employee's] principal activities" and "one with which the employee cannot dispense if [the employee] is to perform [the employee's] principal activities."³⁶ Courts have found the following activities compensable under this standard: donning and doffing required uniforms or safety equipment, booting up computers and logging into required software, pre-shift briefings and training, and post-shift cleaning and securing of equipment.³⁷

**Application to Bartender/Server Duties.** Each task identified in Gonzalez's wage complaint satisfies the "integral and indispensable" test:

| Task | Analysis | Compensable? |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Stocking bar** (beer, liquor, garnishes) | Cannot bartend without stocked supplies; customers cannot be served without inventory in place | **YES** |
| **Cutting garnishes** (limes, lemons, oranges) | Essential preparation for cocktail service; pre-cutting ensures efficient service during shift | **YES** |
| **Setting up POS system** | Cannot process orders or payments without operational POS; logging in and testing system is required pre-shift activity | **YES** |
| **Washing glassware** (post-shift) | Maintaining clean glassware is integral to bar operations; health code compliance requires clean glasses | **YES** |
| **Restocking supplies** (post-shift) | Ensures next shift's readiness; part of closing procedures that maintain operational continuity | **YES** |
| **Cashing out register** | Required reconciliation of sales; employee cannot leave until cash drawer balanced and deposit prepared | **YES** |

The DOL's guidance confirms that "any activity an employee performs that benefits the employer should be paid."³⁸ Employers cannot avoid compensation obligations by simply forbidding off-the-clock work; if the employer "suffers or permits" the work to occur — meaning the employer knows or should know the work is being performed — the time must be compensated even if not authorized.³⁹

#### 2. Colorado COMPS Order Overtime Calculation

Colorado's wage/hour rules create additional complexity and exposure beyond federal FLSA requirements. The Colorado Overtime and Minimum Pay Standards Order (COMPS Order) requires overtime pay at 1.5 times the employee's regular rate for hours exceeding: (A) 40 hours per workweek; (B) 12 hours in a workday; or (C) 12 consecutive hours — whichever calculation produces the highest pay.⁴⁰

**Tipped Employee Overtime Rate.** A critical 2024 update to the COMPS Order clarified that tipped employees' overtime rate is calculated as 1.5 times the **minimum wage** ($11.79 in 2024, $12.56 in 2025), **excluding tips** from the calculation.⁴¹ This means bartenders and servers working overtime receive $18.84/hour (1.5 × $12.56) for overtime hours, regardless of tips earned. Prior to this clarification, some employers incorrectly calculated overtime as 1.5 times the sum of minimum wage plus average tips, producing a higher overtime rate. The new rule benefits employers by lowering the overtime rate calculation but simultaneously eliminates any argument that tip income should offset overtime obligations.⁴²

**Off-the-Clock Work Pushing Employees into Overtime.** If Gonzalez and other taproom employees regularly worked 15-30 minutes of unpaid prep/cleanup time per shift, and their **recorded** hours approached 40 hours per week or 12 hours per day, the **actual** hours worked (including uncompensated time) may have pushed them into overtime territory. For example:

- **Recorded hours:** 39.5 hours/week (just under overtime threshold)
- **Actual hours (including off-the-clock work):** 39.5 hours + (5 shifts × 0.5 hours) = 42 hours/week
- **Result:** 2 hours of uncompensated overtime at $18.84/hour = $37.68/week in unpaid overtime

Multiplied across 950 employees over two years, even small per-employee violations aggregate into substantial class-wide exposure.

#### 3. FLSA Collective Action Certification Standards

Under FLSA § 216(b), aggrieved employees may bring a collective action on behalf of themselves and "other employees similarly situated."⁴³ Unlike Rule 23 class actions, FLSA collective actions require plaintiffs to **opt in** by filing written consent with the court; employees do not become class members unless they affirmatively join.⁴⁴

**Two-Stage Certification Process.** Most courts employ a two-stage certification process. At **Stage One (Conditional Certification)**, the plaintiff makes a "modest factual showing" that she and potential class members are similarly situated.⁴⁵ Courts apply a lenient standard at this stage, requiring only evidence of: (1) a common policy or plan that violates the law, and (2) named plaintiff(s) and potential class members who were subject to that policy.⁴⁶ If conditionally certified, the court authorizes notice to potential class members, who then decide whether to opt in.

At **Stage Two (Final Certification)**, after discovery, the defendant may move to decertify the class by demonstrating that plaintiffs are not, in fact, similarly situated because individual issues predominate over common questions.⁴⁷ Courts evaluate factors such as: disparate factual and employment settings of individual plaintiffs; various defenses available to defendant that are specific to individual plaintiffs; fairness and procedural considerations; and whether plaintiffs were subject to a common policy, plan, or practice.⁴⁸

**2025 Trend Toward Heightened Standards.** Recent decisions show courts moving away from the lenient "conditional certification" approach, requiring plaintiffs to make a stronger showing even at Stage One.⁴⁹ However, conditional certification remains relatively easy to obtain when plaintiff demonstrates that the employer had a common timekeeping policy (or lack thereof) affecting all class members.

**Gonzalez's Likelihood of Conditional Certification.** If Gonzalez demonstrates that ASBC maintained a common timekeeping practice across all 18 taprooms — specifically, requiring employees to arrive 15-30 minutes early for prep work or stay late for cleanup without clocking in — conditional certification is highly probable. Key evidence supporting certification includes:

- **Uniform job descriptions** for bartenders/servers across all locations listing prep/cleanup duties
- **Standardized opening/closing checklists** requiring specific tasks before and after scheduled shifts
- **Common POS/timekeeping system** that does not capture pre-shift or post-shift work time
- **Manager testimony** acknowledging that prep/cleanup time is expected but not compensated
- **Declarations from employees** at multiple locations describing similar unpaid work requirements

**Defense Strategy — Defeating Certification.** ASBC's strongest decertification argument is that individual issues predominate because: (1) employees' specific duties varied by location and shift; (2) some employees were paid for prep/cleanup time while others were not; (3) the amount of unpaid time varied significantly among employees; and (4) some locations had adequate timekeeping systems capturing all work time.⁵⁰ However, if discovery reveals a **systematic policy or practice** of requiring off-the-clock work across all locations, individual variations will not defeat certification.

#### 4. Exposure Calculations — Scenario Analysis

**Base Assumptions:**
- 950 taproom employees across 18 locations
- 15-30 minutes per shift of unpaid prep/cleanup work
- 5 shifts per week average (ranging from 3-7 depending on full-time vs. part-time status)
- 2-year lookback period (104 weeks) for FLSA statute of limitations
- 3-year lookback if violations deemed "willful" under FLSA § 255(a)⁵¹
- Colorado overtime rate: $18.84/hour (2025 tipped minimum $12.56 × 1.5)

**Scenario 1: Gonzalez Individual Claim Only**

| Variable | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Minutes per shift | 15 | 30 |
| Hours per week | 1.25 | 2.5 |
| Total hours (104 weeks) | 130 | 260 |
| Overtime rate | $18.84 | $18.84 |
| **Back wages** | **$2,449** | **$4,898** |
| Liquidated damages (if willful) | $2,449 | $4,898 |
| **Total with liquidated damages** | **$4,898** | **$9,796** |
| Attorney's fees | $50,000-$75,000 | $75,000-$150,000 |
| **Grand total (individual)** | **$54,898** | **$159,796** |

**Scenario 2: Class Action — 30% Opt-In Rate (Base Case)**

Historical FLSA collective action opt-in rates average 5-25%, with many cases achieving only 10-20% participation.⁵² Assuming 30% opt-in (285 of 950 employees) represents a conservative base case:

| Variable | Calculation | Total |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Employee count | 950 × 30% | 285 |
| Back wages per employee | $2,449 - $4,898 | — |
| **Total back wages** | 285 × $2,449 to $4,898 | **$697,965 - $1,395,930** |
| Liquidated damages | Same as back wages | $697,965 - $1,395,930 |
| **Subtotal (wages + liquidated)** | | **$1,395,930 - $2,791,860** |
| Attorney's fees | 30-40% of recovery or $400K-$800K | $400,000 - $800,000 |
| **TOTAL CLASS EXPOSURE (30% opt-in)** | | **$1,795,930 - $3,591,860** |

**Rounded: $1.8M - $3.6M**

**Scenario 3: Class Action — 50% Opt-In Rate (Downside Case)**

If plaintiff's counsel conducts aggressive outreach and the case generates publicity, opt-in rates can reach 40-50%:

| Variable | Calculation | Total |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Employee count | 950 × 50% | 475 |
| Back wages per employee | $2,449 - $4,898 | — |
| **Total back wages** | 475 × $2,449 to $4,898 | $1,163,275 - $2,326,550 |
| Liquidated damages | Same as back wages | $1,163,275 - $2,326,550 |
| **Subtotal (wages + liquidated)** | | **$2,326,550 - $4,653,100** |
| Attorney's fees | 30-40% of recovery or $700K-$1.4M | $700,000 - $1,400,000 |
| **TOTAL CLASS EXPOSURE (50% opt-in)** | | **$3,026,550 - $6,053,100** |

**Rounded: $3M - $6M**

**Scenario 4: Class Action — 70% Opt-In Rate (Severe Case)**

High-profile wage theft cases with sympathetic plaintiffs and extensive media coverage can achieve 60-70% opt-in rates, particularly in industries with lower-wage workers:

| Variable | Calculation | Total |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Employee count | 950 × 70% | 665 |
| Back wages per employee | $2,449 - $4,898 | — |
| **Total back wages** | 665 × $2,449 to $4,898 | $1,628,585 - $3,257,170 |
| Liquidated damages | Same as back wages | $1,628,585 - $3,257,170 |
| **Subtotal (wages + liquidated)** | | **$3,257,170 - $6,514,340** |
| Attorney's fees | 30-40% of recovery or $1M-$2.5M | $1,000,000 - $2,500,000 |
| **TOTAL CLASS EXPOSURE (70% opt-in)** | | **$4,257,170 - $9,014,340** |

**Rounded: $4.2M - $9M**

**Scenario 5: Class Action — 100% Opt-In Rate (Worst Case)**

While unlikely, 100% participation provides an upper-bound estimate:

| Variable | Calculation | Total |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Employee count | 950 × 100% | 950 |
| Back wages per employee | $2,449 - $4,898 | — |
| **Total back wages** | 950 × $2,449 to $4,898 | $2,326,550 - $4,653,100 |
| Liquidated damages | Same as back wages | $2,326,550 - $4,653,100 |
| **Subtotal (wages + liquidated)** | | **$4,653,100 - $9,306,200** |
| Attorney's fees | 30-40% of recovery or $1.5M-$2.5M | $1,500,000 - $2,500,000 |
| **TOTAL CLASS EXPOSURE (100% opt-in)** | | **$6,153,100 - $11,806,200** |

**Rounded: $5.7M - $11.8M**

**Probability-Weighted Expected Value.** Based on historical opt-in rates and the strength of Gonzalez's claims, probability-weighted exposure is:

| Scenario | Probability | Exposure | Weighted Impact |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| 30% opt-in | 55-65% | $1.8M - $3.6M | $990K - $2.34M |
| 50% opt-in | 25-35% | $3M - $6M | $750K - $2.1M |
| 70% opt-in | 10-15% | $4.2M - $9M | $420K - $1.35M |
| 100% opt-in | 5-10% | $5.7M - $11.8M | $285K - $1.18M |

**Expected value range: $2.4M - $7M** (sum of weighted impacts)

#### 5. Statute of Limitations and "Willful" Violation Analysis

The FLSA generally provides a two-year statute of limitations for back wage claims, extending to three years for "willful" violations.⁵³ A violation is "willful" under the FLSA if "the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute."⁵⁴ The Supreme Court in *McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co.* clarified that willfulness requires more than mere negligence but less than deliberate intent to violate the law.⁵⁵

**Evidence Supporting Willfulness Finding:**
- **Prior wage complaints:** Gonzalez's July 2024 complaint put ASBC on notice of potential FLSA violations
- **Industry awareness:** Hospitality industry employers face frequent wage/hour litigation; ASBC should have known to pay for prep/cleanup time
- **Lack of timekeeping controls:** If ASBC had no system to track prep/cleanup time despite knowing employees performed these duties, reckless disregard is inferable
- **Failure to remedy:** If ASBC received Gonzalez's complaint but failed to audit timekeeping practices across other locations, recklessness is evident

If a court finds willfulness, the statute of limitations extends to three years, increasing total exposure by approximately 50%. Additionally, willfulness triggers mandatory liquidated damages under FLSA § 216(b), which provides that employers liable for unpaid wages "shall" also be liable for "an additional equal amount as liquidated damages."⁵⁶ Liquidated damages are not discretionary; courts must award them unless the employer demonstrates it acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds to believe its conduct complied with the FLSA (a difficult standard to meet once willfulness is established).⁵⁷

#### 6. Recommended Pre-Closing Mitigation Actions

**Immediate Timekeeping Audit (Critical).** ABP should require ASBC to engage employment counsel to conduct a comprehensive 50-state wage/hour audit across all 18 taproom locations within 30 days of LOI execution. The audit should:

1. **Review timekeeping records** for a sample of 50-100 employees across all locations to determine whether prep/cleanup time is captured
2. **Interview managers** to document actual practices regarding pre-shift and post-shift work expectations
3. **Analyze job descriptions and training materials** to identify any written or implicit requirements for off-the-clock work
4. **Compare recorded hours to facility access logs** (if available) to identify gaps indicating uncompensated work time
5. **Quantify total exposure** across all locations with granular data by state, location, and employee category

**Cost: $150,000 - $300,000** for comprehensive audit by national employment law firm

**Policy Remediation (Immediate Post-Closing).** Regardless of audit findings, ABP must immediately implement corrective timekeeping policies upon closing:

- **Clear timekeeping rules:** Employees must clock in **before** beginning any work activity (including prep work) and clock out **after** completing all closing duties
- **Manager training:** Train all taproom managers on FLSA requirements and consequences of off-the-clock work
- **Zero-tolerance policy:** Prohibit managers from requesting or permitting employees to work off the clock under threat of discipline
- **Validation mechanisms:** Implement weekly review of employee clock-in/out times to identify anomalies (e.g., employees arriving 20 minutes before clock-in time)

**Proactive Back Pay Resolution (Strategic Consideration).** If the audit confirms systemic wage violations, ABP faces a strategic choice:

**Option A: Settle with Gonzalez and Proactively Remedy Violations**
- Calculate total back wages owed to all 950 employees based on audit findings
- Distribute back pay checks with individualized calculations and explanations
- Require employees to sign releases waiving FLSA claims (valid if employees receive full compensation owed)
- **Pros:** Eliminates class action risk; demonstrates good faith; morale benefit from voluntary remediation
- **Cons:** Costly upfront expenditure ($2M-$5M depending on findings); some employees may refuse release and join class action anyway; admission of prior violations

**Option B: Litigate and Defend Against Class Certification**
- Allow Gonzalez's individual claim to proceed
- Vigorously contest collective action certification by demonstrating individual issues predominate
- If certification denied, exposure limited to Gonzalez's individual claim ($55K-$160K)
- **Pros:** Lower upfront cost; possibility of defeating class certification eliminates most exposure
- **Cons:** Significant legal fees ($500K-$1M through decertification motion); discovery disruption; public litigation creates employee morale issues; no guarantee decertification succeeds

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- Remediate timekeeping policies immediately to eliminate ongoing violations
- Settle with Gonzalez for $75K-$150K (lower than EEOC retaliation case given weaker individual damages)
- If class action filed by other employees, aggressively defend certification based on remediated practices and individual variations
- **Pros:** Balances cost control with risk mitigation; positions company as responsive to wage concerns; stronger defense posture if class action filed
- **Cons:** Some residual class action risk from employees who worked prior to policy remediation

**Recommended Approach:** Hybrid Option C, combined with $2M wage/hour reserve escrow funded by Seller to cover potential class action settlements or judgments arising from pre-closing conduct.

See Financial Impact Analysis § II.E (Employment Risk), at pp. 134-159, for detailed analysis of wage/hour class exposure and $18M employment escrow recommendation with release conditions tied to class certification decision and EEOC Gonzalez resolution.

### C. MULTI-STATE ALCOHOL SERVER TRAINING COMPLIANCE (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

ASBC operates 18 taprooms across five states with divergent alcohol server training requirements. Three of five states — Oregon, Washington, and California — impose **mandatory** training and certification for all employees who serve alcohol, with criminal penalties for non-compliance. Two states — Colorado and North Carolina — offer voluntary training programs that provide limited liability protection and insurance discounts. Compliance gaps expose ASBC to regulatory sanctions (liquor license suspension, fines), criminal liability for individual employees (up to $500 fines and 90 days imprisonment), and evidentiary disadvantages in dram shop litigation.⁵⁸

The most critical compliance issue is **Oregon's March 31, 2025 regulatory change** eliminating the 45-day grace period for temporary service permits, requiring immediate pre-service certification for all new hires. This change affects ASBC's 380 Oregon taproom employees across 8 locations, representing 40% of the company's taproom workforce.⁵⁹

#### 1. Oregon Mandatory Alcohol Server Education (CRITICAL GAP)

**Legal Requirement.** Oregon Revised Statute § 471.542 requires the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC) to mandate alcohol server education for all service permit applicants and licensees authorizing on-premises consumption.⁶⁰ All servers, bartenders, and managers who dispense or supervise alcohol service must obtain an OLCC service permit, which requires completing an approved alcohol server education course and passing an OLCC-proctored examination.⁶¹

**March 31, 2025 Rule Change — IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.** Effective March 31, 2025, Oregon eliminated the 45-day grace period previously available for temporary service permits. Under the prior rule, new employees could begin serving alcohol immediately upon submitting their service permit application, provided they completed training and testing within 45 days.⁶² Under the new rule, employees must complete the service permit application, alcohol server education course, **and** OLCC-proctored exam **before** serving their first alcoholic beverage.⁶³ This change eliminates ASBC's ability to hire bartenders and servers for immediate work; instead, ASBC must ensure all new hires complete certification before scheduling them for shifts involving alcohol service.

**Certification Validity and Renewal Tracking.** OLCC service permits remain valid for five years from the date of issuance.⁶⁴ ASBC's 380 Oregon employees require proactive renewal tracking to prevent lapses. Employees who obtained certification in 2020 face expiration in 2025; ASBC must implement automated alerts at 180 days, 90 days, and 30 days before expiration to ensure timely recertification. Unlike some states that permit automatic renewal, Oregon requires employees to retake the full training course and examination every five years.⁶⁵

**Approved Training Providers.** OLCC approves multiple training providers, including:
- TIPS (Training for Intervention ProcedureS)
- ServSafe Alcohol
- Other OLCC-approved courses listed on the OLCC website⁶⁶

Training typically requires 2-4 hours and costs $15-$40 per employee. Oregon permits online training, making compliance logistically feasible for multi-site operators.⁶⁷

**Penalties for Non-Compliance.** Oregon imposes severe penalties for permit violations:

- **Employee penalties:** Criminal citation, fines up to $500, imprisonment up to 90 days⁶⁸
- **Employer penalties:** OLCC may suspend or revoke the liquor license; monetary fines ranging from $500-$5,000 per violation; civil liability in dram shop cases (expired permits constitute negligence per se evidence)⁶⁹

**ASBC Compliance Status (Oregon).** Due diligence must verify:
1. **Current certification status:** Are all 380 Oregon employees currently certified, or do expired permits exist?
2. **New hire procedures:** Does ASBC's onboarding process ensure compliance with the March 31, 2025 immediate certification requirement?
3. **Renewal tracking system:** Does ASBC maintain a centralized database with expiration date alerts?
4. **Documentation:** Are copies of all service permits maintained on-site for inspection by OLCC enforcement personnel?

**Estimated Annual Compliance Cost (Oregon):**
- **New hires:** 50-75 employees/year × $30/training = $1,500-$2,250
- **Renewals:** 76 employees expiring annually (380 ÷ 5 years) × $30 = $2,280
- **Administrative tracking:** $5,000-$10,000 for database system and HR staff time
- **Total Oregon annual cost:** $8,780-$14,530

#### 2. Washington Mandatory Alcohol Server Training (MAST)

**Legal Requirement.** Washington Revised Code § 66.20.310 requires Mandatory Alcohol Server Training (MAST) for all individuals who serve, mix, sell, or supervise alcohol for on-premises consumption.⁷⁰ Two permit classes exist:
- **Class 12 permit:** Bartenders who mix and serve alcohol
- **Class 13 permit:** Servers who serve but do not mix alcohol⁷¹

**60-Day Compliance Deadline for New Hires.** Unlike Oregon's immediate requirement, Washington allows new employees to begin alcohol service immediately upon hire but requires permit completion within 60 days of initial employment.⁷² This grace period provides operational flexibility but creates tracking complexity — ASBC must monitor each employee's hire date and ensure certification within the 60-day window.

**Training Requirements.** MAST training consists of a minimum 3-hour online or classroom course followed by an examination requiring an 80% passing score.⁷³ Washington does not permit permit renewal; instead, permits expire five years after issuance, and employees must retake the full training course and examination.⁷⁴ The expiration date is the first day of the month following the test date (e.g., test taken October 20, 2020 expires November 1, 2025).⁷⁵

**Permit Carrying Requirement.** Washington law requires employees to have their MAST permit and valid ID "readily available for inspection" by law enforcement during alcohol service duties.⁷⁶ This means permits must be on the employee's person or immediately accessible in the workplace, not stored off-site or in HR files.

**Penalties for Non-Compliance.** Washington imposes criminal penalties:
- **Employee:** Criminal citation, fines up to $500, imprisonment up to 90 days, or both⁷⁷
- **Employer:** Monetary fines, liquor license suspension, or both⁷⁸

**ASBC Compliance Status (Washington).** With 95 employees across 2 Washington taprooms, ASBC must verify:
1. All current employees have valid MAST permits
2. New hire onboarding includes 60-day tracking for permit completion
3. Employees carry permits or have immediate on-site access during shifts
4. Expiration tracking system flags permits nearing the 5-year renewal deadline

**Estimated Annual Compliance Cost (Washington):**
- **New hires:** 15-20 employees/year × $30/training = $450-$600
- **Renewals:** 19 employees expiring annually (95 ÷ 5 years) × $30 = $570
- **Total Washington annual cost:** $1,020-$1,170

#### 3. California Responsible Beverage Service (RBS) Training — 2025 Renewal Wave

**Legal Requirement.** California Assembly Bill 1221 (2017), which became mandatory on July 1, 2022, requires Responsible Beverage Service (RBS) training for all servers of alcoholic beverages and managers supervising alcohol service at on-premises establishments.⁷⁹ California's RBS program requires employees to:
1. Register in the RBS Portal (California ABC online system)
2. Complete training from an ABC-authorized RBS Training Provider
3. Pass the ABC Alcohol Server Certification exam within 30 days of training⁸⁰

**60-Day New Hire Deadline.** Similar to Washington, California requires new employees to complete RBS certification within 60 calendar days of hire.⁸¹ Employees may serve alcohol during the 60-day grace period, but failure to complete certification by day 60 requires immediate removal from alcohol service duties until certified.

**3-Year Certification Validity — 2025 Renewal Wave.** RBS certifications remain valid for three years.⁸² Because AB 1221 became mandatory on July 1, 2022, a significant cohort of certifications issued in 2022 will **expire in 2025**, creating a renewal wave. ASBC's 47 California taproom employees likely include many employees certified in mid-2022 facing 2025 expiration dates.⁸³

**Penalties for Non-Compliance.** California ABC may issue citations and fines for non-certified servers. Repeated violations can result in liquor license suspension or revocation. Additionally, lack of current certification undermines dram shop defenses in California civil litigation, providing plaintiff's counsel with evidence of negligence.⁸⁴

**ASBC Compliance Status (California).** With only 1 taproom and 47 employees, California compliance is manageable but requires attention to the 2025 renewal wave. Verification priorities:
1. Identify all employees certified in 2022 with 2025 expiration dates
2. Schedule renewal training 60-90 days before expiration to prevent lapses
3. Ensure new hire onboarding includes 60-day RBS completion tracking
4. Maintain copies of certifications on-site for ABC inspection

**Estimated Annual Compliance Cost (California):**
- **New hires:** 8-12 employees/year × $30/training = $240-$360
- **Renewals:** 16 employees expiring annually (47 ÷ 3 years) × $30 = $480
- **2025 renewal wave:** Potentially 30+ employees if most certified in 2022 = $900 one-time spike
- **Total California annual cost:** $720-$840 (plus $900 one-time 2025 renewal cost)

#### 4. Colorado and North Carolina Voluntary Programs (Recommended for Liability Protection)

**Colorado Responsible Vendor Program (Voluntary).** Colorado does not mandate alcohol server training for most on-premises establishments (mandatory only for liquor store tastings and special events).⁸⁵ However, Colorado offers a voluntary Responsible Vendor Program (RVP) through the Liquor Enforcement Division, providing significant benefits:

- **Insurance premium discounts:** Up to 25% reduction in liquor liability insurance premiums for TIPS-certified establishments⁸⁶
- **Regulatory mitigation:** Colorado LED may reduce fines and penalties for liquor violations if the establishment has completed Responsible Vendor training⁸⁷
- **Civil liability protection:** Training demonstrates reasonable care in dram shop litigation

**Critical Restriction:** Colorado LED does **not accept online training** for RVP certification. Training must be delivered in-person classroom or live-streaming format with real-time instructor interaction.⁸⁸ This requirement increases logistical complexity and cost compared to self-paced online courses.

**Certification Duration:** 2 years (shortest of any state analyzed), requiring recertification every two years.⁸⁹

**Strategic Recommendation:** Given the Smith v. ASBC dram shop litigation in Oregon, implementing voluntary Colorado training demonstrates company-wide commitment to responsible alcohol service and strengthens ASBC's defense that its training programs exceed industry standards. The insurance discount (up to 25%) may fully offset training costs.

**North Carolina RASP Program (Voluntary).** North Carolina ABC Commission offers free 2-hour Responsible Alcohol Seller/Server Program (RASP) training covering state laws, underage/intoxicated customer identification, and dram shop liability.⁹⁰ Training is voluntary except for alcohol delivery permit holders.⁹¹

**Benefits:**
- **No cost:** State-provided free online training eliminates budget barrier
- **Liability protection:** Demonstrates reasonable care standard in negligence cases
- **4-year validity:** Longest certification period among all states analyzed⁹²

**Strategic Recommendation:** The zero-cost nature of RASP training makes universal participation across ASBC's 142 North Carolina employees economically rational, even though not legally required. In any dram shop litigation arising from North Carolina taprooms, RASP certification provides strong evidentiary support for ASBC's defense.

#### 5. Compliance Matrix and Annual Cost Summary

| State | Employees | Mandatory? | Cert. Duration | Penalties | Annual Cost | Compliance Status |
|-------|-----------|------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Oregon** | 380 | **YES** | 5 years | Criminal + license suspension | $8,780-$14,530 | **CRITICAL GAP** (March 2025 rule) |
| **Washington** | 95 | **YES** | 5 years | Criminal + license suspension | $1,020-$1,170 | **HIGH RISK** |
| **California** | 47 | **YES** | 3 years | Citations + fines | $720-$840 (+$900 in 2025) | **MEDIUM RISK** (renewal wave) |
| **Colorado** | 190 | Voluntary | 2 years | N/A | $5,700-$11,400 (if implemented) | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **North Carolina** | 142 | Voluntary | 4 years | N/A | $0 (free state training) | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **TOTAL** | **854** | | | | **$15,220-$30,040** | |

**Total Annual Compliance Cost (All States):** $15,220-$30,040 if voluntary programs implemented in Colorado and North Carolina; $10,520-$16,540 if only mandatory states (OR/WA/CA) addressed.

#### 6. Relationship to Smith v. ASBC Dram Shop Defense

Alcohol server training compliance directly affects ASBC's defense posture in the Smith v. ASBC dram shop litigation. Oregon Revised Statute § 471.565 imposes liability on alcohol servers only if plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that the server served alcohol to a visibly intoxicated patron and such service was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff's injury.⁹³ While ORS 471.565 provides no statutory safe harbor for training completion (i.e., training does not automatically eliminate liability), training evidence is highly relevant to the comparative negligence analysis and jury's assessment of whether ASBC acted reasonably.⁹⁴

**Key Defense Weaknesses:**
1. **Expired certifications undermine defense:** If the taproom employee who served the intoxicated patron had an expired OLCC certification, plaintiff's counsel will argue ASBC failed to ensure adequate ongoing training, demonstrating negligence
2. **Minimal training beyond regulatory requirements:** OLCC-required training covers statutory obligations and basic intoxication recognition but may not include supplemental training on difficult customer scenarios, refusal techniques, or incident documentation procedures
3. **Lack of incident documentation:** If ASBC does not require employees to document service refusals or cut-off decisions, plaintiff can argue no intervention occurred despite the training⁹⁵

**Supplemental Training Recommendations to Strengthen Defense:**

| Training Component | OLCC Provides? | Supplemental Recommendation | Defense Value |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| Intoxication signs recognition | Yes | Role-playing scenarios with actors simulating various intoxication levels | **HIGH** |
| Refusing service techniques | Yes | Practice sessions handling belligerent customers in high-pressure situations | **HIGH** |
| Manager escalation protocols | Yes | Clear written procedures for when to call manager; manager supervision training | **MEDIUM** |
| Incident documentation | Limited | **Mandatory cut-off logs** documenting patron, time, observable signs, actions taken | **CRITICAL** |
| Annual refresher training | No (5-year recert) | Annual in-house training reinforcing intoxication recognition and intervention | **MEDIUM** |

**Critical Recommendation:** ABP should require ASBC to implement **mandatory incident documentation protocols** immediately post-closing. When any employee refuses service to an intoxicated patron, the employee must complete a brief incident form capturing: (1) date and time; (2) patron description; (3) observable intoxication signs (slurred speech, unsteady gait, etc.); (4) actions taken (service refused, taxi called, manager notified); and (5) manager review and signature. This documentation creates a paper trail demonstrating ASBC's commitment to responsible service and provides powerful trial evidence if dram shop litigation arises.

**Cost of Supplemental Training Program:** $25,000-$50,000 annually for 18 taprooms, including role-playing scenario development, annual refresher sessions, and incident log system implementation.

### D. WARN ACT APPLICABILITY TO POST-ACQUISITION WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS (MEDIUM CONDITIONAL RISK)

The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq., requires covered employers to provide 60 days' advance written notice before plant closings or mass layoffs affecting 50 or more employees.⁹⁶ ASBC's 1,850-employee workforce substantially exceeds the 100-employee coverage threshold, making WARN Act compliance mandatory if ABP plans post-acquisition workforce reductions.⁹⁷ While WARN liability is **conditional** on ABP's integration plans (which may contemplate full employee retention), failure to provide proper notice triggers liability for 60 days of back pay, benefits, and civil penalties for each affected employee — potentially $1.67M-$3.96M for common restructuring scenarios.⁹⁸

#### 1. WARN Act Coverage and Triggering Events

**Employer Coverage.** The WARN Act applies to employers with: (1) 100 or more full-time employees; or (2) 100 or more employees (full-time and part-time) who work an aggregate of 4,000+ hours per week.⁹⁹ ASBC's 1,850-employee workforce triggers coverage under either test.

**Plant Closing.** A "plant closing" occurs when an employer shuts down a single site of employment or one or more facilities within a single site, resulting in employment loss for 50 or more employees during any 30-day period.¹⁰⁰ "Employment loss" includes: (1) termination (other than for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement); (2) layoff exceeding 6 months; or (3) reduction in work hours of more than 50% during each month of any 6-month period.¹⁰¹

**Mass Layoff.** A "mass layoff" occurs when, at a single site of employment during any 30-day period, employment loss affects: (1) 50-499 employees if they constitute at least 33% of the active workforce; or (2) 500 or more employees (regardless of percentage).¹⁰²

**Single Site of Employment.** Courts interpret "single site of employment" as a single location or group of contiguous locations.¹⁰³ For ASBC, each brewery, distillery, or taproom constitutes a separate site. ABP cannot aggregate layoffs across multiple geographically dispersed sites to avoid WARN thresholds; instead, each site is analyzed separately.

**Common Post-Acquisition Scenarios Triggering WARN:**

| Scenario | WARN Trigger? | Affected Employees | Notice Required |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Close Denver brewery (120 employees) | **YES** (plant closing) | 120 | 60 days |
| Close 3+ Oregon taprooms totaling 50+ employees | **YES** (plant closing per site) | 50+ per site | 60 days per site |
| Consolidate corporate functions, eliminating 80 HQ positions | **YES** (plant closing if at single HQ location) | 80 | 60 days |
| Layoff 300 production employees across all facilities | Depends | 300 | 60 days **per site** if site-specific layoffs meet thresholds |
| Reduce taproom staff by 20% across all locations | **NO** (no single site reaches 50 employees) | Varies | No notice required |

#### 2. Seller vs. Buyer WARN Liability in Acquisitions

**Critical Allocation Rule.** In business sales, WARN Act responsibility splits based on timing:
- **Seller's Responsibility:** The seller must provide notice for any plant closing or mass layoff occurring **up to and including the effective date of sale**.¹⁰⁴
- **Buyer's Responsibility:** The purchaser must provide notice for any plant closing or mass layoff occurring **after the effective date of sale**.¹⁰⁵

**Asset Sale vs. Stock Sale Distinction.** The Department of Labor's regulations distinguish between asset sales and going-concern sales:
- **Asset Sale:** When the sale involves merely the purchase of assets (equipment, inventory, real estate) without assumption of the seller's workforce, the **seller retains WARN responsibility** because the seller is closing the plant that employed the workers.¹⁰⁶
- **Going-Concern Sale:** When the sale is on a going-concern basis (e.g., stock purchase where the buyer assumes control of the operating business), it is presumed the buyer hires the seller's employees unless the sale agreement indicates otherwise.¹⁰⁷ In going-concern sales, the buyer becomes responsible for post-closing WARN obligations.

**ABP-ASBC Transaction Structure (To Be Determined).** The purchase agreement structure determines WARN allocation:
- **If structured as asset purchase with no employment assumption:** ASBC retains WARN liability for any pre-closing workforce reductions
- **If structured as stock purchase or going-concern sale:** ABP assumes WARN liability for post-closing restructuring

**Practical Implication:** ABP must clarify its workforce retention intentions **before closing** to determine WARN exposure. If ABP plans to terminate 50+ employees at any single ASBC location within 90 days of closing, WARN notice must be provided no later than the closing date to avoid the 60-day back pay penalty.

#### 3. 60-Day Notice Requirements and Recipients

**Who Receives Notice.** WARN Act notice must be provided to:
1. **Affected employees** (or their union representatives if unionized)¹⁰⁸
2. **State Dislocated Worker Unit** in each state where layoffs occur:
   - Colorado: Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, Workforce Development Programs
   - Oregon: Oregon Employment Department, Workforce Operations
   - North Carolina: NC Division of Workforce Solutions
   - Washington: Washington Employment Security Department
   - California: California Employment Development Department¹⁰⁹
3. **Chief elected official** of the local government where each employment site is located (e.g., mayor of city where taproom operates)¹¹⁰

**Notice Content.** WARN notice must include:
- Name and address of employment site where closure/layoff will occur
- Contact information of company official responsible for providing additional information
- Statement whether the action is permanent or temporary; if temporary, expected duration
- Expected date of first separation and anticipated schedule for subsequent separations
- Job titles and number of affected employees¹¹¹

**Notice Timing.** Notice must be provided **at least 60 days before** the first employment loss.¹¹² If an employer provides less than 60 days' notice, each affected employee is entitled to back pay for each day of the violation, up to 60 days.¹¹³

#### 4. WARN Act Penalties and Exposure Calculation

**Back Pay Liability.** Employers who fail to provide required notice are liable to each affected employee for: (1) back pay for each day of violation (up to 60 days); and (2) the value of benefits under an employee benefit plan (including the cost of medical expenses incurred during the violation period that would have been covered under an employee benefit plan).¹¹⁴

**Civil Penalties.** Employers who fail to provide notice to the local government official are subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each day of violation (capped at $30,000 per plant closing or mass layoff event).¹¹⁵

**Attorney's Fees.** Prevailing employees are entitled to reasonable attorney's fees as part of the relief awarded.¹¹⁶

**Hypothetical Exposure Calculations:**

**Scenario 1: Close Denver Brewery (120 Employees, $25/Hour Average Wage)**

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Back pay | 120 employees × $25/hour × 8 hours/day × 60 days | $1,440,000 |
| Benefits | 120 employees × $500/month × 2 months | $120,000 |
| Civil penalty | $500/day × 60 days (single violation) | $30,000 |
| Attorney's fees | Estimated 200-400 hours at $400-$500/hour | $80,000-$200,000 |
| **Total exposure** | | **$1,670,000-$1,790,000** |

**Scenario 2: Mass Layoff (300 Employees Across Multiple Sites, $22/Hour Average Wage)**

Assuming layoffs at 3 separate sites (100 employees per site), each site constitutes a separate WARN violation:

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Back pay | 300 employees × $22/hour × 8 hours/day × 60 days | $3,168,000 |
| Benefits | 300 employees × $500/month × 2 months | $300,000 |
| Civil penalty | $500/day × 60 days × 3 sites | $90,000 |
| Attorney's fees | Estimated 400-800 hours at $400-$500/hour | $160,000-$400,000 |
| **Total exposure** | | **$3,718,000-$3,958,000** |

#### 5. WARN Act Exceptions (Reduced Notice Period)

**Faltering Company Exception.** The WARN Act provides an exception for employers who were actively seeking capital or business at the time notice would have been required and who reasonably believed that giving notice would preclude obtaining the needed capital or business.¹¹⁷ This exception rarely applies in acquisition contexts where the buyer has already committed to the transaction.

**Unforeseeable Business Circumstances Exception.** An employer may provide less than 60 days' notice if the plant closing or mass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time notice would have been required.¹¹⁸ Courts apply a high bar for "unforeseeability." The Third Circuit held that the exception applies only when layoffs were **probable**, not merely **possible**, at the time notice would have been required; sudden and unexpected market shifts or customer contract terminations may qualify, but general economic downturns do not.¹¹⁹

**Natural Disaster Exception.** Closings or layoffs resulting from natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, storms) may qualify for reduced notice, but only to the extent the disaster directly caused the closing.¹²⁰

**ABP Integration Planning Implication.** If ABP determines post-acquisition that workforce reductions are necessary due to unforeseen integration issues (e.g., key customer contract cancellation, discovery of undisclosed liabilities), the "unforeseeable business circumstances" exception may provide limited relief. However, layoffs resulting from predictable integration synergies (e.g., eliminating redundant corporate functions) do not qualify for the exception.

#### 6. State Mini-WARN Acts

**California's Stricter Requirements.** California's WARN Act applies to employers with 75+ employees and requires notice for layoffs affecting 50 or more employees within a 30-day period (stricter than federal law).¹²¹ ASBC's single California taproom employs 47 employees, falling below the 50-employee threshold; however, if ABP closes the California location **and** lays off corporate employees in California on the same day, the combined total may trigger California WARN obligations.

**Colorado WARN Status.** Colorado does not have a state-level mini-WARN Act imposing stricter requirements than federal law.¹²² Federal WARN Act governs Colorado layoffs.

#### 7. Recommended Pre-Closing Due Diligence and Post-Closing Compliance

**Pre-Closing Diligence Questions:**
1. **Does ABP plan workforce reductions at any ASBC location within 90 days of closing?** If yes, identify affected sites and employee counts to determine WARN applicability.
2. **Will ABP consolidate ASBC corporate functions with ABP headquarters?** If yes, calculate potential corporate layoffs and whether they exceed 50 employees (or 33% of the corporate workforce).
3. **Does ABP plan to close any ASBC production facilities or taprooms?** If yes, identify locations and employee counts.

**If Layoffs Are Planned:**

**Option A: Provide WARN Notice at Closing**
- ABP provides 60-day WARN notice to affected employees on the closing date
- Employees remain employed (or on paid administrative leave) for 60 days post-closing
- Layoffs effective on day 61
- **Advantage:** Full WARN compliance; no back pay liability
- **Disadvantage:** 60 days of continued payroll costs for employees who will be terminated

**Option B: Commit to 60-Day Retention (Avoids Immediate WARN Trigger)**
- ABP commits to retaining all ASBC employees for at least 60 days post-closing
- If layoffs become necessary after 60-day period, provide WARN notice at that time
- **Advantage:** Preserves flexibility to assess workforce needs before making termination decisions
- **Disadvantage:** Delays restructuring; increases integration costs

**Option C: Pre-Closing WARN Liability Allocation to Seller**
- If ABP knows pre-closing that specific locations will close (e.g., redundant brewery), negotiate for ASBC to provide WARN notice **before closing**
- Seller remains liable for WARN violations related to pre-closing layoffs
- **Advantage:** Shifts liability to Seller for pre-closing decisions
- **Disadvantage:** May complicate transaction timeline; Seller may resist assuming liability for Buyer's post-closing plans

**Post-Closing Compliance Protocol:**

If ABP determines post-closing that workforce reductions are necessary:
1. **Day 1:** Legal counsel analyzes whether proposed layoffs trigger WARN Act
2. **Day 2-5:** Prepare WARN notices identifying affected employees, dates, and reasons
3. **Day 6:** Serve WARN notices to employees, state dislocated worker units, and local government officials
4. **Day 66:** Layoffs may be effectuated without WARN liability

**Annual Compliance Cost:** $0 if no layoffs planned; $1.67M-$3.96M if layoffs occur without proper notice (per Scenario 1-2 calculations above).

### E. RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED MITIGATION STRATEGY

The Employment & Labor compliance analysis reveals four distinct categories of risk requiring coordinated remediation across legal, operational, and financial work streams. The probability-weighted exposure totals $2.1M-$4.3M under conservative assumptions, escalating to $9.6M-$27.5M in worst-case scenarios where class certification succeeds at high opt-in rates and WARN Act violations occur simultaneously with EEOC litigation.¹²²

#### 1. Risk Matrix — Severity and Timing Analysis

| Risk Category | Severity | Gross Exposure | Probability | Weighted Exposure | Timing | Mitigation Priority |
|--------------|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|---------------------|

#### 2. Recommended Purchase Agreement Provisions

**Section X.Y — Employment and Labor Compliance Representations**

The Seller represents and warrants that:

(a) **EEOC Charges and Complaints.** Schedule X.Y(a) lists all charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any state or local fair employment practices agency against the Company within the past three (3) years. Except as set forth on Schedule X.Y(a), there are no pending or, to Seller's knowledge, threatened charges of employment discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.

(b) **Wage and Hour Compliance.** The Company has at all times complied in all material respects with the Fair Labor Standards Act, applicable state wage and hour laws, and all regulations promulgated thereunder, including without limitation requirements regarding minimum wage, overtime compensation, meal and rest breaks, and recordkeeping. The Company maintains timekeeping systems that accurately record all hours worked by non-exempt employees, including time spent on pre-shift and post-shift activities.

(c) **Alcohol Server Training Certifications.** Schedule X.Y(c) lists all states in which the Company operates establishments serving alcoholic beverages and the current certification status of all employees required to hold alcohol server permits or certifications under applicable state law. All employees whose duties include serving, mixing, or supervising the service of alcoholic beverages hold current, valid certifications as required by applicable law in Oregon, Washington, and California.

(d) **No Mass Layoffs or Plant Closings.** The Company has not effectuated any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 et seq., within the past ninety (90) days without providing the notice required under such Act.

(e) **Off-the-Clock Work.** The Company does not require or permit non-exempt employees to perform work "off the clock" (i.e., before clocking in or after clocking out). The Company's policies explicitly prohibit managers from requesting employees to perform any work activities without compensation.

**Section X.Z — Employment Liability Indemnification and Escrow**

(a) **Seller's Indemnification Obligations.** Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all Losses arising from or related to:

(i) The EEOC charge filed by Maria Gonzalez in October 2024 (EEOC Charge No. [XXX]), including any settlement, judgment, back pay, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs associated with such charge or any litigation arising therefrom;

(ii) Any wage and hour claims, complaints, or lawsuits (including collective actions under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) or class actions under Rule 23) alleging that employees were required to perform unpaid work during the period prior to the Closing Date, including claims for unpaid wages, overtime, liquidated damages, penalties, interest, and attorney's fees;

(iii) Any violations of alcohol server training or certification requirements under Oregon, Washington, or California law arising from the Company's failure to maintain current certifications for employees serving alcohol prior to the Closing Date, including fines, penalties, license suspensions, and civil liability in dram shop litigation;

(iv) Any violations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any state mini-WARN act arising from plant closings or mass layoffs effectuated by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date.

(b) **Employment Escrow.** At Closing, the Escrow Agent shall hold Eighteen Million Dollars ($18,000,000) (the "Employment Escrow Amount") from the Purchase Price pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to secure Seller's indemnification obligations under Section X.Z(a). The Employment Escrow Amount shall be released as follows:

(i) **EEOC Gonzalez Release (50% at 18 Months).** Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) shall be released at the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date if the EEOC Gonzalez charge has been resolved through settlement, dismissal, or final non-appealable judgment for total consideration (including attorney's fees) not exceeding Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000).

(ii) **Wage/Hour Class Certification Release (50% at 24 Months).** Nine Million Dollars ($9,000,000) shall be released at the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date if: (A) no wage and hour collective action or class action has been filed against the Company or Buyer; or (B) any such action filed has been dismissed or decertified without prejudice to individual claims; or (C) any such action has been settled for total consideration not exceeding Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000).

(iii) **Pending Claims Holdback.** Notwithstanding subsections (i) and (ii), the Escrow Agent shall retain from any scheduled release an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the total value of any pending claims for which Buyer has delivered a Notice of Claim under the Escrow Agreement, which retained amounts shall be held until such claims are resolved.

(c) **Wage/Hour Compliance Audit.** Within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall engage a nationally recognized employment law firm to conduct a comprehensive wage and hour compliance audit of the Company's timekeeping practices, policies, and records for the two (2) year period preceding the Closing Date. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the reasonable costs of such audit (not to exceed Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($300,000)) within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice.

(d) **Alcohol Server Training Remediation.** Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall implement alcohol server training programs compliant with Oregon, Washington, and California requirements for all taproom employees in such states. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the costs of initial training and certification for any employees who lacked current, valid certifications as of the Closing Date (estimated not to exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000)).

#### 3. Pre-Closing Action Items (Mandatory)

**Within 30 Days of LOI Execution:**
5. ✅ Retain national employment law firm to conduct 50-state wage/hour compliance audit ($150K-$300K)

10. ✅ Finalize settlement with Gonzalez (target: $150K-$250K including full release and confidentiality)
11. ✅ Implement corrective timekeeping policies (employees clock in BEFORE prep work, clock out AFTER cleanup)
12. ✅ Train all 18 taproom managers on FLSA compliance and prohibition of off-the-clock work

#### 4. Post-Closing Action Items (First 90 Days)

**Day 1-7:**
- Announce timekeeping policy changes to all 950 taproom employees (written notice, mandatory acknowledgment)
- Freeze any workforce reduction plans pending WARN Act analysis
- Designate employment compliance officer responsible for server training tracking

**Day 8-30:**
- Roll out Oregon/Washington/California server training for any employees with expired or missing certifications
- Implement incident documentation system for dram shop defense (cut-off logs, refusal protocols)
- Schedule quarterly employment compliance audits (wage/hour, training certifications, EEOC charge monitoring)

**Day 31-60:**
- Complete wage/hour audit remediation (if audit identified violations, distribute back pay checks with releases)
- Evaluate settlement vs. litigation strategy for any class action filed by other employees
- Implement Colorado and North Carolina voluntary server training programs (recommended for liability protection)

- Evaluate EPL insurance policy coverage for EEOC Gonzalez and wage/hour class exposure
- Prepare quarterly employment litigation and compliance report for Board of Directors

**Total First-Year Employment Compliance Budget:**
- Wage/hour audit: $150K-$300K
- EEOC Gonzalez settlement: $150K-$350K
- Alcohol server training (initial + annual): $25K-$50K
- Timekeeping system upgrades: $20K-$40K
- Employment counsel (ongoing advisory): $100K-$200K
- **TOTAL: $445K-$940K**

**RECOMMENDATION:** ABP should proceed with acquisition subject to: (1) successful pre-closing settlement of EEOC Gonzalez charge at $150K-$350K; (2) $18M employment escrow (1.5% of purchase price) with 24-month staggered release conditioned on wage/hour class certification decision; (3) completion of wage/hour compliance audit within 30 days of closing; and (4) Seller reimbursement for audit costs and alcohol server training remediation for non-compliant employees. These conditions collectively reduce employment liability exposure from $9.6M-$27.5M (worst case, unmitigated) to $2.1M-$4.3M (base case, mitigated) while preserving sufficient escrow coverage at 4.2x to 8.6x the base case exposure range.
