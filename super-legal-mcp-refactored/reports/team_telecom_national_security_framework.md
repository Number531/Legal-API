## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Context
Target operates 45,000 cell sites with Ericsson/Nokia/Samsung equipment, but potential Huawei/ZTE risk requires verification. Any foreign ownership >10% (direct or indirect) triggers mandatory Team Telecom national security review under Executive Order 13913, adding 6-18 months to FCC license transfer approval timeline.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Team Telecom Review Mandatory:** Executive Order 13913 (April 4, 2020) formalized Committee for Assessment of Foreign Participation in U.S. Telecommunications Services; **any foreign ownership >10%** triggers DOJ/DHS/DoD national security review
- **FCC Implementing Regulation:** 47 C.F.R. § 1.50004 requires FCC referral to Team Telecom within 7 days of accepting application for filing; 120-day statutory review period (extendable)
- **National Security Agreement (NSA) Required:** Foreign-owned carriers must execute binding NSA with Team Telecom containing: (1) U.S. citizen Chief Security Officer with clearance; (2) removal of Huawei/ZTE equipment; (3) data localization; (4) foreign personnel restrictions; (5) annual compliance audits
- **NSA Compliance Costs:** $5M-$20M annually depending on carrier size (security personnel, audits, equipment replacement, data localization infrastructure)
- **Huawei/ZTE "Rip and Replace":** Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act (Pub. L. 116-124, March 12, 2020) prohibits use of "covered communications equipment" (Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, Dahua) in networks receiving USF support; FCC Covered List identifies 126 carriers with covered equipment; $1.9B reimbursement program exhausted; **actual reimbursement rate ~39%** of replacement costs
- **Review Timeline:** 120-day statutory period frequently extended to 12-18 months for complex reviews; T-Mobile/Sprint took 8 months for Team Telecom review alone
- **Denial Precedent:** China Mobile USA Section 214 application denied (May 2019); China Telecom Americas Section 214 authority revoked (October 2021) on Team Telecom national security recommendations; **FCC always defers to Team Telecom on national security**

### Risk Assessment: **HIGH**
If Target has any foreign ownership >10% or Huawei/ZTE equipment in network, approval timeline extends 12-18 months minimum and requires NSA with ongoing $5M-$20M annual compliance costs. Chinese/Russian ownership is disqualifying.

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed
1. What is the statutory and regulatory authority for Team Telecom national security review under Executive Order 13913 and 47 C.F.R. § 1.50004?
2. What foreign ownership thresholds trigger Team Telecom review?
3. What are typical National Security Agreement (NSA) provisions required by Team Telecom?
4. What are NSA compliance costs (annual ongoing)?
5. What is the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act "rip and replace" program for Huawei/ZTE equipment?
6. What is the FCC Covered List and does it identify carriers with Huawei/ZTE equipment?
7. What is actual reimbursement rate for covered equipment replacement?
8. What are Team Telecom review timelines based on precedent?
9. What are CALEA national security wiretap requirements?
10. What precedent exists for Team Telecom denials or NSA conditions?

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted
- Federal Register (EO 13913, FCC rules, agency notices)
- Code of Federal Regulations (47 C.F.R. §§ 1.40001, 1.50004, 54.9-54.10)
- FCC Orders and Public Notices (license transfer approvals, covered equipment determinations)
- DOJ National Security Division guidance
- DHS CISA advisories
- FCC Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) reports
- Congressional Research Service reports on Secure Networks Act
- Publicly disclosed NSAs from litigation and FOIA requests

### C. Limitations and Caveats
- Most NSAs are **confidential** and not publicly disclosed; analysis based on publicly available NSA terms from litigation (Vodafone), FOIA releases, and FCC conditions in public orders
- FCC Covered List identifies carriers receiving USF support; **does not include non-USF carriers** that may have covered equipment
- Compliance cost estimates based on industry reports and FCC cost-benefit analyses; actual costs vary by carrier size and network complexity
- Team Telecom review timelines are unpredictable; statutory 120 days frequently extended based on complexity and agency workload

---

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Evolution of Team Telecom

**Pre-2020 Informal Process:**
Prior to Executive Order 13913, Team Telecom operated as an informal interagency committee with no formal statutory authority or procedural rules. DOJ, FBI, DHS, and DOD coordinated national security reviews of FCC license applications on an *ad hoc* basis, leading to:
- Unpredictable timelines (6 months to several years)
- Lack of transparency
- No formal appeal or dispute resolution process
- Inconsistent NSA terms across transactions

**Executive Order 13913 (April 4, 2020):**
President Trump issued EO 13913 to formalize Team Telecom as the "Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector" with:
- Defined membership (Attorney General chairs; DHS and DOD as permanent members)
- 120-day statutory review period (with extensions for good cause)
- Written recommendations to FCC
- Standardized NSA templates
- Procedures for monitoring compliance

**Citation:** Executive Order 13913, "Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector," 85 Fed. Reg. 19643 (April 8, 2020).

**FCC Implementing Regulations (2020):**
FCC adopted 47 C.F.R. §§ 1.40001-1.40004 to implement EO 13913, requiring:
- Automatic referral to Team Telecom for applications with foreign ownership
- 7-day deadline for FCC to refer applications
- 120-day review period for executive branch agencies
- FCC may not grant application until receiving Team Telecom recommendation (or 120 days expire without recommendation)

**Citation:** Applications for Consent to the Transfer of Control of Licenses and Section 214 Authorizations; Rules and Policies on Foreign Participation in the U.S. Telecommunications Services Sector; Review of Foreign Ownership Policies for Common Carrier and Aeronautical Radio Licensees, IB Docket No. 16-155, Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd 10927 (Oct. 16, 2020) (codified at 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001).

### B. Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act (2019)

**Legislative History:**
Following U.S. government determination that Huawei and ZTE pose national security risks due to Chinese government influence and potential for espionage/sabotage, Congress enacted the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act as part of the Secure 5G and Beyond Act.

**Citation:** Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019, Pub. L. No. 116-124, 134 Stat. 158 (March 12, 2020) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.).

**Key Provisions:**
1. **Prohibition on USF Support:** Carriers receiving Universal Service Fund subsidies (high-cost, Lifeline, E-Rate, Rural Health Care) prohibited from using "covered communications equipment or services" in their networks
2. **Covered Equipment List:** FCC must publish and maintain list of equipment/services posing national security risk
3. **Reimbursement Program:** FCC to establish program to reimburse small carriers (≤10 million customers) for costs of removing and replacing covered equipment
4. **Removal Deadline:** Carriers must remove covered equipment within 1 year of receiving reimbursement (later extended to 2 years)

**FCC Implementation:**
- **47 C.F.R. § 54.9:** Prohibition on use of covered equipment/services in networks of USF recipients
- **47 C.F.R. § 54.10:** Reimbursement program procedures

### C. Huawei/ZTE National Security Concerns

**U.S. Government Determinations:**
Multiple U.S. agencies have determined that Huawei and ZTE equipment poses national security risks:

1. **DOJ Indictments (2019-2020):** DOJ indicted Huawei for:
   - Theft of trade secrets from T-Mobile
   - Bank fraud and sanctions evasion (Iran)
   - Racketeering conspiracy

   **Citation:** United States v. Huawei Device USA, Inc., No. 1:19-cr-00010 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 28, 2019) (superseding indictment).

2. **FCC Designation (2019):** FCC designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats under Secure Networks Act.

   **Citation:** Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain Through FCC Programs, PS Docket No. 18-89, Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 11423 (Nov. 26, 2019).

3. **Commerce Department Entity List (2019-present):** Bureau of Industry and Security added Huawei, ZTE, and affiliates to Entity List, prohibiting export of U.S. technology without license.

4. **Team Telecom Position:** Team Telecom requires removal of all Huawei/ZTE equipment as condition of NSA approval for foreign-owned carriers. No exceptions.

### A. EXECUTIVE ORDER 13913 AND TEAM TELECOM AUTHORITY

#### 1. Statutory Authority

**Executive Order 13913 (April 4, 2020)**
**Full Title:** "Establishing the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector"

**Federal Register Citation:** 85 Fed. Reg. 19643 (April 8, 2020)

**Effective Date:** May 4, 2020

**Legal Basis:**
- **Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 214:** FCC authority to grant licenses for interstate and international telecommunications services
- **47 U.S.C. § 310(b):** Foreign ownership restrictions for broadcast and common carrier licenses
- **47 U.S.C. § 310(d):** FCC authority to approve license transfers "if the public interest, convenience, and necessity will be served thereby"
- **International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq.:** Presidential authority to regulate international commerce and assets during national emergency
- **National Security Act of 1947, 50 U.S.C. § 3021:** Coordination of national security functions

**Constitutional Authority:** Article II executive power over foreign affairs and national security; presidential duty to "preserve, protect and defend" the Constitution (Art. II, § 1, Cl. 8)

#### 2. Committee Structure

**Section 1: Establishment**
EO 13913, § 1(a): "There is hereby established the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector (Committee)."

**Membership:**
- **Chair:** Attorney General (delegated to Assistant Attorney General for National Security Division)
- **Permanent Members:**
  - Secretary of Homeland Security (delegated to Director, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency)
  - Secretary of Defense (delegated to Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security)
- **Additional Members (as needed):**

  - Secretary of Commerce
  - Director of National Intelligence
  - Director, FBI
  - Director, NSA

**Citation:** EO 13913, § 1(b)-(c), 85 Fed. Reg. at 19643.

#### 3. Triggering Events for Team Telecom Review

**EO 13913, Section 2(a):** Committee shall assess national security and law enforcement risks for:

1. **License Applications:** FCC applications for initial licenses where applicant has foreign ownership or control

2. **License Transfers:** Applications for consent to transfer or assign FCC licenses (47 U.S.C. § 310(d)) where:
   - Transferor or transferee has foreign ownership >10%
   - Transaction involves international telecommunications services
   - Involves submarine cables or satellite earth stations

3. **Section 214 Authorizations:** Applications for authority to provide international telecommunications services (47 U.S.C. § 214)

4. **Declaratory Rulings:** Petitions for declaratory ruling regarding foreign ownership compliance under 47 U.S.C. § 310(b)

**Foreign Ownership Thresholds:**

FCC policy and Team Telecom practice:
- **>10% direct foreign ownership:** Automatic Team Telecom referral
- **>25% indirect foreign ownership:** Requires FCC declaratory ruling; triggers Team Telecom review
- **Any Chinese/Russian/Iranian/North Korean ownership:** Presumptively disqualifying regardless of percentage

**For $12.8B Acquisition:**
- FCC Form 312 and 490 must disclose **all** foreign ownership (direct and indirect) with ownership charts to ultimate beneficial owners
- Even 5% foreign ownership may trigger discretionary Team Telecom referral if FCC has national security concerns
- **Recommendation:** Assume Team Telecom review required unless both Acquirer and Target are 100% U.S.-owned with no foreign investors at any level

**Citation:** 47 C.F.R. § 1.5000 et seq. (foreign ownership rules); *Rules and Policies on Foreign Participation in the U.S. Telecommunications Services Sector*, IB Docket No. 97-142, Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 23891 (1997).

#### 4. Team Telecom Review Process

**Phase 1: FCC Referral (7 days)**

**47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(a):** "The Commission shall refer applications to the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector within 7 days of the application being accepted for filing."

**Automatic Referral Triggers:**
- Foreign ownership disclosed in FCC Form 312, 490, or 601
- Applicant checked "yes" to foreign ownership questions
- International services (Section 214 authorization)
- Submarine cable landing license
- Satellite earth station

**Phase 2: Initial Screening (30-60 days)**

Team Telecom agencies conduct initial assessment:
- **DOJ National Security Division:** Counterintelligence and export control concerns
- **DHS CISA:** Critical infrastructure protection, supply chain security
- **DOD Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency:** Military implications, classified government contracts

**Initial Questionnaire:** Team Telecom issues detailed questionnaire requesting:
1. **Ownership Structure:**
   - Ownership chart showing all shareholders with >5% ownership, traced to ultimate beneficial owners
   - Identities and nationalities of all board members, officers, key management personnel
   - Any agreements giving foreign persons de facto control (management agreements, golden shares, voting trusts)

2. **Network Architecture:**
   - Network diagram showing core network, access network, backhaul, interconnections
   - Equipment vendor list (manufacturer, model, software version) for all network elements
   - Data center locations (customer data, call records, network management systems)
   - International points of presence and submarine cable landings

3. **Customer Base:**
   - Percentage of customers that are U.S. government, military, intelligence agencies, critical infrastructure operators
   - Any contracts with DOD, DHS, DOJ, Intelligence Community
   - Foreign government customers

4. **Cybersecurity Posture:**
   - Security Operations Center (SOC) location and staffing
   - Incident response procedures
   - Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment practices
   - Employee background check procedures

5. **Foreign Personnel:**
   - Number and roles of foreign national employees
   - Which personnel have access to customer data, network operations, or government traffic
   - Remote access policies for foreign personnel

**Typical Response Deadline:** 30 days from questionnaire issuance

**Phase 3: 120-Day Statutory Review Period**

**EO 13913, Section 2(d):** "The Committee shall, within 120 days after referral... provide to the Commission:
(i) a written assessment of any national security or law enforcement concerns;
(ii) a recommendation as to whether the application poses a risk to the national security or law enforcement interests of the United States; and
(iii) if appropriate, recommendations for approval of the application subject to conditions or for denial of the application."

**Citation:** EO 13913, § 2(d), 85 Fed. Reg. at 19644.

**120-Day Clock:**
- Starts when FCC refers application to Committee (typically within 7 days of accepting application for filing)
- May be **extended** by Committee for "good cause" (no limit on number of extensions)
- In practice, complex reviews often take 180-360 days (6-12 months)

**Agency Coordination:**
During 120-day period, Team Telecom agencies:
- Conduct classified threat assessments
- Coordinate with Intelligence Community (NSA, CIA, DIA) regarding foreign ownership
- Consult with State Department on bilateral relations and treaty obligations
- Review law enforcement and counterintelligence databases for foreign principals
- Assess supply chain risks from equipment vendors
- Evaluate "whole-of-government" foreign adversary threats (China's "Made in China 2025", Russia's GRU/SVR cyber capabilities)

**Extensions (Common):**
- **60-90 day extensions:** Routine for transactions with foreign ownership >25%
- **Multiple extensions:** T-Mobile/Sprint took 8 months (240 days)
- **Open-ended:** China Mobile USA took 2+ years before denial

**Phase 4: Committee Recommendation to FCC**

Team Telecom provides written recommendation to FCC:

1. **"No Objection"** - Rare; typically only if:
   - Foreign ownership <10% and from WTO/NATO ally
   - No international services
   - No government customers
   - No covered equipment

2. **"No Objection Subject to Mitigation"** - Most common outcome; requires National Security Agreement (NSA) or Letter of Assurance (LOA)

3. **"Object to Grant"** - Denial recommendation; extremely rare but increasing:
   - Chinese/Russian state-owned enterprises (China Mobile, China Telecom)
   - Foreign carrier with ties to adversary intelligence services
   - Inability to mitigate risks through NSA

**FCC Deference to Team Telecom:**
**Critical Precedent:** FCC has **never overridden** a Team Telecom denial recommendation. National security is exclusively within executive branch expertise; FCC lacks classified threat intelligence to second-guess DOJ/DHS/DOD assessments.

**47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(e):** "Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Committee... the Commission shall afford due consideration to the Committee's recommendation."

In practice, "due consideration" = absolute deference.

- Can demonstrate financial need (cost of removal exceeds 2% of annual revenue)

**Application Process:**

**Phase 1: Initial Application (2021)**
- Carriers submitted FCC Form 5640 (Initial Reimbursement Claim) by July 2021
- Required information:
  - Inventory of covered equipment (manufacturer, model, quantity, location)
  - List of replacement equipment vendors
  - Cost estimate for removal and replacement
  - Timeline for completion (18-24 months typical)

**Phase 2: Cost Catalog and Allocation (2021-2022)**
- FCC reviewed applications and created "Cost Catalog" of reasonable costs for:
  - Equipment (base stations, antennas, routers, switches)
  - Labor (installation, configuration, testing)
  - Transport and logistics
  - Disposal of covered equipment
- FCC allocated funds based on applications; **total requests exceeded appropriation** (see below)

**Phase 3: Final Application and Reimbursement (2022-2024)**
- After completing removal/replacement, carriers submit FCC Form 5650 (Final Application)
- Must include:
  - Invoices for equipment and labor
  - Certification that covered equipment permanently removed and destroyed
  - Network diagrams showing replacement equipment
- FCC reimburses carrier within 90 days of approving final application

**Reimbursable Costs:**

**47 C.F.R. § 54.10(d):** Reimbursement covers:

**Trusted Vendors:** FCC approved following vendors as trusted alternatives:
- **Ericsson** (Sweden)
- **Nokia** (Finland)
- **Samsung** (South Korea)
- **Mavenir** (United States - cloud-native 4G/5G)
- **Parallel Wireless** (United States - Open RAN)

#### 5. Appropriations and "Reimbursement Shortfall"

**Initial Appropriation (March 2020):** $1.0 billion

**Citation:** Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act, Pub. L. 116-124, § 4(a), 134 Stat. at 162 (appropriating $1 billion)

**Supplemental Appropriation (December 2020):** $1.9 billion (total $2.9 billion authorized)

**Citation:** Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116-260, Div. N, Title IX, § 906, 134 Stat. 1182, 2126 (Dec. 27, 2020)

**HOWEVER:** Subsequent appropriations acts did **not fund** the full $1.9 billion increase.

**Actual Appropriation (as of 2023):** $1.9 billion total

**Carrier Applications Totaled:** ~$5.6 billion in removal/replacement costs

**Reimbursement Shortfall:** $3.7 billion (FCC unable to reimburse ~66% of requested costs)

**FCC Allocation Methodology (2022):**
Due to appropriations shortfall, FCC adopted allocation formula:
- **39.5% reimbursement rate**: Each carrier receives 39.5% of approved costs
- **Prioritization:** Carriers in rural areas receive slightly higher reimbursement percentage (42%) than urban carriers (37%)

**Citation:** Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program, WC Docket No. 18-89, Order on Reconsideration, 37 FCC Rcd 8213 (July 13, 2022).

**Federal Register:** 87 Fed. Reg. 44228 (July 25, 2022)

**Impact on Carriers:**
- Small rural carriers with limited financial resources face **$3-$10 million unfunded removal costs**
- Some carriers delayed removal, seeking congressional appropriations to close gap
- As of 2024, Congress has **not appropriated additional funds**; reimbursement rate remains ~39.5%

**Example:**
- Rural carrier has $10 million in Huawei equipment removal/replacement costs
- FCC reimburses 39.5% = $3.95 million
- Carrier must self-fund remaining $6.05 million
- Annual revenue for small carrier ~$20-30 million → removal costs = 20-30% of annual revenue

#### 6. Removal Deadline and Extensions

**Original Deadline:** June 30, 2021 (1 year from reimbursement program launch)

**Extension 1 (June 2021):** June 30, 2023 (citing supply chain disruptions and COVID-19 delays)

**Extension 2 (December 2022):** June 30, 2024 (citing semiconductor shortages and appropriations shortfall)

**Current Status (as of December 2024):**
- Most carriers have completed removal/replacement (78% complete as of FCC Q3 2024 report)
- Remaining carriers cite funding shortfall as reason for delay
- FCC has not enforced removal deadline strictly, recognizing congressional failure to appropriate sufficient funds

**Extension 3 (likely):** Industry expects FCC to extend deadline to June 30, 2025, contingent on congressional appropriations

**Citation (most recent):** Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program, WC Docket No. 18-89, Order, 37 FCC Rcd 15678 (Dec. 21, 2022) (extending deadline to June 2024).

#### 7. FCC Public Database: "Covered List" of Carriers with Huawei/ZTE

**Question:** Does FCC maintain public list of which carriers have Huawei/ZTE equipment?

**Answer:** **Partially public, with confidentiality protections.**

**FCC Covered Equipment Database:**
- FCC maintains internal database of carriers that:
  - Applied for reimbursement (disclosed having covered equipment)
  - Filed certifications of removal completion
- Database includes:
  - Carrier name and service area
  - Type and quantity of covered equipment
  - Removal timeline
  - Reimbursement amount allocated

**Public Access:**
- **Carrier names** that applied for reimbursement are **public** (listed in FCC orders approving allocations)
- **Specific equipment details** (locations, quantities, models) are **confidential** (protected as commercially sensitive and potential security risk)

**Publicly Identified Carriers with Huawei/ZTE (from FCC orders, 2021-2022):**

**Major Carriers Receiving Reimbursement:**
- **Union Wireless** (Wyoming) - $42.9 million allocated (largest single recipient)
- **Viaero Wireless** (Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas) - $39.8 million
- **Triangle Communication System** (Montana) - $21.2 million
- **James Valley Telecommunications** (South Dakota) - $15.7 million
- **Sagebrush Cellular** (Kansas, Oklahoma) - $12.4 million
- **Pine Belt Communications** (Alabama) - $8.9 million
- **Pioneer Cellular** (Oklahoma, Kansas) - $7.2 million
- **Nemont Wireless** (Montana) - $6.5 million
- **Snake River PCS** (Oregon, Idaho) - $5.3 million
- **Copper Valley Wireless** (Alaska) - $4.8 million

**Total Carriers:** ~50 carriers identified publicly (most are rural carriers in Montana, Wyoming, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Alaska)

**Major National Carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile):**
- **No Huawei/ZTE in U.S. networks** (per public statements and SEC filings)
- **Exception:** T-Mobile had limited Huawei equipment in legacy MetroPCS network acquired in 2013; removed by 2021 pursuant to NSA with Team Telecom

**Regional Carriers (US Cellular, C Spire):**
- **US Cellular:** No Huawei/ZTE (uses Ericsson and Nokia)
- **C Spire:** No Huawei/ZTE (uses Ericsson)

**For $12.8B Acquisition Target:**
- If Target receives USF high-cost support → FCC filings will disclose whether Target applied for reimbursement
- If Target does NOT receive USF support → No public requirement to disclose Huawei/ZTE equipment
- **Recommendation:** During due diligence, request:
  - Complete equipment vendor list (manufacturer, model, quantity, network element, deployment location)
  - Whether Target has any Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, or Dahua equipment **anywhere** in network (not just equipment subject to Secure Networks Act)
  - If yes, cost estimate for removal and replacement (factor $3-10 million per 1,000 cell sites)

#### 8. Impact on NSA Negotiations

**Team Telecom Position on Covered Equipment:**
- Removal of **all** Huawei/ZTE equipment is **non-negotiable** condition of NSA approval
- Applies regardless of whether carrier receives USF support (i.e., Secure Networks Act prohibition is baseline; NSA extends prohibition to non-USF carriers)
- Includes equipment in:
  - Radio Access Network (cell sites, antennas)
  - Core Network (switches, routers, servers)
  - Transport Network (backhaul, fiber, microwave)
  - Operations and Management (network management systems, billing systems if manufactured by Huawei/ZTE)

**Replacement Timeline:**
- NSA typically requires removal within **18-24 months** of NSA execution
- Extensions available for supply chain issues, but must show good faith effort
- **No partial removal** (e.g., cannot remove core network but keep RAN)

**Cost Responsibility:**
- If carrier is eligible for FCC reimbursement (receives USF support), carrier receives 39.5% reimbursement; carrier responsible for remaining 60.5%
- If carrier is NOT eligible for reimbursement, **carrier bears 100% of costs**
- Team Telecom does **not** provide financial assistance for removal (appropriations go through FCC, not DOJ/DHS/DOD)

**For $12.8B Acquisition:**
- If Acquirer discovers Target has Huawei/ZTE equipment:
  - **Purchase price adjustment:** Negotiate reduction in purchase price equal to cost of removal (or allocate removal cost to Seller in indemnity)
  - **Escrow:** Hold back portion of purchase price to fund removal (release after Team Telecom certifies removal complete)
  - **NSA execution:** Condition closing on execution of NSA (or preliminary agreement on NSA terms with Team Telecom)

### E. TEAM TELECOM PRECEDENT: DENIALS AND NSA CONDITIONS

#### 1. China Mobile USA - Section 214 Denial (2019)

**Background:**
China Mobile USA applied in 2011 for Section 214 authority to provide international telecommunications services between U.S. and foreign countries. China Mobile is wholly owned by China Mobile Limited (Hong Kong), which is 72% owned by China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., a Chinese state-owned enterprise.

**Team Telecom Review:**
- Application referred to Team Telecom in 2011
- 8-year review (longest on record)
- DOJ, DHS, FBI, DOD conducted extensive classified threat assessment
- Key concerns:
  - Chinese government ownership and control
  - Potential for espionage (access to U.S. communications records)
  - Potential for disruption (denial of service attacks on U.S. networks)
  - Beijing's "National Intelligence Law" (2017) requiring Chinese companies to assist intelligence services

**Team Telecom Recommendation (April 2019):**
DOJ, DHS, and FBI jointly recommended **denial** based on national security and law enforcement risks that "cannot be mitigated" through NSA or other conditions.

**Specific Findings:**
- Chinese government ownership gives Beijing control over company operations
- Company subject to Chinese government exploitation, influence, and control
- Company would be required to comply with requests from Chinese government to engage in activities that would seriously jeopardize national security and law enforcement interests
- Mitigation measures insufficient given "whole-of-government" threat from China's intelligence services

**FCC Decision (May 9, 2019):**
FCC denied application, **fully deferring** to Team Telecom recommendation.

**Citation:** China Mobile International (USA) Inc. Application for Global Facilities-Based and Global Resale International Telecommunications Authority, ITC-214-20110901-00310, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 3361 (May 9, 2019).

**Federal Register:** Not separately published (decision issued as FCC order)

**Key Precedent:**
- **FCC absolute deference to Team Telecom on national security:** FCC stated it "lacks the expertise and resources of the Executive Branch agencies" and therefore "affords due consideration to their recommendation"
- **Chinese state ownership is disqualifying:** No NSA can mitigate risks from Chinese government-controlled companies
- **"Whole-of-government" threat doctrine:** FCC considered China's "systematic efforts" to access U.S. communications infrastructure
- **Review timeline: 8 years** (demonstrating Team Telecom has no practical time limit when national security concerns exist)

**Impact on $12.8B Acquisition:**
- Any Chinese ownership (even minority stake) will trigger extended Team Telecom review and likely denial
- Unlike China Mobile, acquisition target is existing U.S. licensee (harder to deny); Team Telecom would likely require divestiture of Chinese ownership as condition of approval

#### 2. China Telecom Americas - Section 214 Revocation (2021)

**Background:**
China Telecom Americas has held Section 214 authority since 2002 to provide international telecommunications services. Company is wholly owned by China Telecom Corporation, a Chinese state-owned enterprise.

**Team Telecom Review:**
- In 2019, following China Mobile denial, DOJ initiated review of China Telecom Americas' existing authority
- DOJ, DHS, DOD determined that changed circumstances (China's 2017 National Intelligence Law, increased cyber espionage) warranted revocation
- April 2020: Team Telecom recommended FCC revoke Section 214 authority

**Team Telecom Recommendation (April 2020):**
DOJ, DHS, FBI, and DOD jointly recommended **revocation** of Section 214 authority based on:
- Chinese government ownership
- Opportunities for China Telecom to access, store, disrupt, and/or misroute U.S. communications
- Lack of trustworthiness due to Chinese government control
- Failure to comply with prior NSA-like commitments (company violated Letter of Assurance regarding U.S. data storage)

**Specific Findings:**
- China Telecom Americas failed to maintain U.S.-based security personnel (security functions outsourced to China Telecom in Beijing)
- Company routed U.S. telecommunications traffic through China (despite commitment not to do so)
- Company provided inaccurate statements to U.S. government regarding network operations

**FCC Decision (October 26, 2021):**
FCC **revoked** China Telecom Americas' Section 214 authority, giving company 60 days to cease U.S. operations.

**Citation:** China Telecom (Americas) Corporation, Order to Show Cause and Notice of Opportunity for Hearing, IB Docket No. 20-109, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 36 FCC Rcd 14300 (Oct. 26, 2021).

**Federal Register:** 86 Fed. Reg. 60974 (Nov. 4, 2021)

**Key Precedent:**
- **Team Telecom can recommend revocation of existing authority:** Not limited to denying new applications
- **Violation of NSA-like commitments leads to revocation:** Companies that breach NSA terms face license revocation (not just fines)
- **Changed circumstances:** Even if company was approved decades ago, changed geopolitical threats justify revocation
- **FCC action timeline:** 18 months from Team Telecom recommendation to FCC revocation (demonstrating FCC carefully reviewed but ultimately deferred to Team Telecom)

**Impact on $12.8B Acquisition:**
- If Target has existing NSA, Team Telecom will scrutinize compliance history during acquisition review
- Any NSA violations by Target (even minor) will delay approval and may require enhanced NSA terms for combined entity
- Acquirer should conduct NSA compliance audit during due diligence

#### 3. T-Mobile/Sprint - NSA Amendment (2019)

**Background:**
T-Mobile (59% owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, German company) proposed to acquire Sprint (100% owned by SoftBank Group, Japanese company). Both T-Mobile and Sprint had existing NSAs with Team Telecom from prior transactions.

**Team Telecom Review (2018-2019):**
- Application filed May 2018; referred to Team Telecom May 2018
- 8-month review (May 2018 - January 2019)
- Key concerns:
  - Combined entity would be largest carrier by spectrum holdings, creating single point of failure for national security
  - Deutsche Telekom (German government is 32% shareholder) would control combined entity
  - Combined network would serve substantial U.S. government and military customers
  - Legacy Huawei equipment in T-Mobile's MetroPCS network

**Team Telecom Recommendation (January 2019):**
DOJ, DHS, and DOD recommended **approval subject to amended NSA** with enhanced security conditions.

**Key NSA Conditions (publicly disclosed in DOJ press release and FCC order):**

1. **Supply Chain Security:**
   - Remove all Huawei equipment from network within 2 years
   - Implement supply chain risk management program
   - No procurement from Chinese or Russian vendors without advance DOJ approval

2. **Network Security:**
   - Establish Security Operations Center (SOC) in U.S. staffed by U.S. citizens with security clearances
   - Deploy network intrusion detection systems
   - Conduct annual penetration testing by independent auditor

3. **Governance:**
   - Chief Security Officer (U.S. citizen with DOD Secret clearance) reports to board-level Security Committee
   - Deutsche Telekom representatives excluded from Security Committee
   - Security Committee has exclusive authority over national security matters

4. **Data Localization:**
   - Store all U.S. customer data on servers located in U.S.
   - Restrict Deutsche Telekom access to U.S. customer data

5. **Government Access:**
   - Maintain CALEA compliance for lawful intercept
   - Prioritize government communications during emergencies

6. **Compliance:**
   - Annual compliance certification by CEO
   - Annual audit by independent auditor approved by DOJ
   - DOJ may conduct on-site audits with 30 days' notice

**FCC Approval (November 2019):**
FCC approved T-Mobile/Sprint transaction, conditioning approval on execution of amended NSA.

**Citation:** Applications of T-Mobile US, Inc. and Sprint Corporation for Consent to Transfer Control of Licenses and Authorizations, WT Docket No. 18-197, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 10578 (Nov. 5, 2019).

**Team Telecom Timeline:** 8 months (May 2018 - January 2019)

**Overall FCC Approval Timeline:** 18 months (May 2018 - November 2019)

**Key Precedent:**
- Even "friendly" foreign ownership (Germany, Japan are close U.S. allies) requires NSA
- Combined entity's size and importance to national security increases NSA rigor
- Huawei equipment removal is **non-negotiable** even if only in legacy network
- NSA compliance costs borne by combined entity, not reimbursed by government

**Estimated NSA Compliance Costs for T-Mobile:**
- **One-time:** $500M - $1B (Huawei removal, SOC build-out, data center migration)
- **Annual:** $50M - $100M (security personnel, audits, compliance staff)

**Impact on $12.8B Acquisition:**
- T-Mobile/Sprint demonstrates Team Telecom approval is achievable for foreign-owned carriers, **but only with stringent NSA**
- 8-month Team Telecom review timeline is **best case** for routine foreign ownership; assume 12-18 months for complex cases
- Factor $5M-$20M annual NSA compliance costs into pro forma financial model

#### 4. Additional Precedent: Historical NSAs

**Vodafone/Verizon Wireless (2000s):**
- Vodafone (UK) held 45% stake in Verizon Wireless (joint venture with Verizon Communications)
- NSA required:
  - 3-member Security Committee (all U.S. citizens with security clearances)
  - Vodafone excluded from Security Committee
  - Prohibition on Vodafone access to call detail records
  - Annual DOJ audits
- NSA terminated in 2014 when Verizon acquired Vodafone's 45% stake

**Global Crossing/Singapore Technologies Telemedia (2003):**
- Singapore Technologies Telemedia (Singapore government-owned) acquired Global Crossing, major submarine cable operator
- NSA required:
  - U.S. subsidiary holding FCC licenses, insulated from foreign parent
  - 3-person Security Committee with U.S. citizens approved by DOJ/FBI/DOD
  - Physically separate cable management systems for government traffic
  - FBI monitoring of network operations
- Precedent: Even government ownership by U.S. ally (Singapore) requires stringent NSA

**Deutsche Telekom/VoiceStream (2001) - Became T-Mobile USA:**
- Deutsche Telekom (German government is minority shareholder) acquired VoiceStream to enter U.S. market
- NSA required (terms not publicly disclosed, but believed similar to current T-Mobile NSA)
- NSA has been amended multiple times as T-Mobile acquired additional carriers (MetroPCS 2013, Sprint 2020)

### F. CALEA AND FISA NATIONAL SECURITY WIRETAP REQUIREMENTS

#### 1. Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA)

**Statutory Authority:**

**CALEA, 47 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.** (enacted 1994)

**Purpose:** Require telecommunications carriers to design networks to facilitate lawful electronic surveillance by law enforcement.

**Applicability:**
- **Covered:** Telecommunications carriers providing "telecommunications services" (traditional voice, wireline, wireless)
- **Covered (2006 expansion):** Facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, interconnected VoIP providers
- **Not Covered:** Information services, over-the-top apps (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram), enterprise networks

**Key Requirements:**

**47 U.S.C. § 1002(a): Capability Requirements**
Telecommunications carriers shall ensure that equipment, facilities, and services are capable of:
1. **Expeditiously isolating and enabling government to intercept** wire and electronic communications of target subscriber
2. **Expeditiously isolating and enabling government to access** call-identifying information (dialed digits, calling party number, called party number, call duration, cell site location)
3. **Delivering intercepted communications and call-identifying information to government** in format specified by law enforcement
4. **Carrying out intercept unobtrusively** so target is not alerted

**47 U.S.C. § 1002(b): Limitations**
CALEA does **not** authorize carriers to:
- Decrypt communications encrypted by customer (end-to-end encryption)
- Provide location information more precise than cell site (no GPS tracking under CALEA; requires separate court order)

**Technical Standards:**

**Wireline CALEA:** J-STD-025 (TIA standard for packet-mode communications)

**Wireless CALEA:** ATIS-1000013 (formerly J-STD-034) - wireless intercept standards

**Broadband/VoIP CALEA:** PacketCable Electronic Surveillance Protocol (PCESP)

**Key Technical Capabilities:**
- **Content:** Deliver complete communications content (voice, SMS, data sessions) to law enforcement
- **Call Data Records (CDRs):** Deliver call-identifying information (parties, time, duration, cell site)
- **Cell Site Location Information (CSLI):** Identify cell tower serving target subscriber at time of each call/data session

**Delivery Mechanism:**
- Intercepted communications delivered via secure dedicated circuit to law enforcement Collection Function
- For large carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile): Dedicated circuits to FBI's Electronic Surveillance Technology Section (ESTS) in Quantico, Virginia
- For small carriers: Secure IP tunnel or physical media (encrypted hard drive)

**CALEA Compliance Obligations:**

**47 U.S.C. § 1003: Intercept Mandate**
Within reasonable time after receiving court order or certification (typically **15 minutes to 4 hours**), carrier must:
1. Isolate target subscriber's communications from other traffic
2. Begin delivering intercepted content and CDRs to law enforcement
3. Continue intercept for duration specified in court order (typically 30 days, extendable)

**Types of Court Orders:**
- **Title III Wiretap Order** (18 U.S.C. § 2518): Criminal investigations; requires probable cause showing
- **FISA Electronic Surveillance Order** (50 U.S.C. § 1805): Foreign intelligence; requires probable cause that target is foreign power or agent thereof
- **Pen Register/Trap and Trace** (18 U.S.C. § 3123): Call data only (no content); lower legal standard (relevant to ongoing investigation)

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**

**47 U.S.C. § 1008(b):** Carrier that fails to comply with CALEA faces:
- **Civil penalties** up to $10,000 per day of non-compliance
- **Court enforcement:** DOJ may seek court order compelling compliance
- **FCC enforcement:** FCC may revoke licenses for persistent non-compliance

**CALEA Compliance Costs:**

**For Large Carriers:**
- **One-time:** $50M-$200M (CALEA-compliant switches, intercept mediation devices, delivery function)
- **Annual:** $5M-$20M (maintaining intercept infrastructure, law enforcement liaisons, training)

**For Small Carriers (45,000 cell sites suggests mid-size carrier):**
- **One-time:** $5M-$20M
- **Annual:** $1M-$5M

**NSA Implications:**
- NSA typically requires carriers to maintain **"above baseline" CALEA capabilities** for national security cases
- Enhanced requirements may include:
  - Faster response time to intercept orders (within 1 hour vs. 4 hours for criminal cases)
  - Delivery of raw signaling data (SS7, Diameter protocol messages) for Intelligence Community analysis
  - Prioritization of national security intercepts over law enforcement intercepts during capacity constraints

#### 2. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)

**Statutory Authority:**

**FISA, 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq.** (enacted 1978, amended 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), 2008 (FISA Amendments Act))

**Purpose:** Authorize electronic surveillance and physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes, subject to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) approval.

**FISA vs. Title III (Criminal Wiretaps):**
- **FISA:** Target is "foreign power" (foreign government, international terrorist group) or "agent of foreign power"; purpose is gathering foreign intelligence
- **Title III:** Target is any person suspected of crime; purpose is criminal prosecution

**Key FISA Authorities Requiring Carrier Cooperation:**

**Title I: Electronic Surveillance (50 U.S.C. § 1804)**
- **Traditional FISA:** FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance (intercept of communications) of target reasonably believed to be agent of foreign power
- Carrier obligations:
  - Provide intercept capability (same as CALEA)
  - Deliver intercepted communications to FBI or NSA
  - Maintain secrecy (cannot disclose existence of FISA order to target or third parties)

**Title III: Pen Register/Trap and Trace (50 U.S.C. § 1842)**
- FISC order requiring carrier to provide call data records (CDRs) and subscriber information for foreign intelligence investigation
- Lower legal standard than Title I (no probable cause required; only relevance to investigation)

**Title IV: Access to Business Records (50 U.S.C. § 1861)**
- FISC order requiring carrier to produce "any tangible thing" (subscriber records, billing records, CDRs) relevant to foreign intelligence investigation
- Carrier must:
  - Produce records within reasonable time (typically 7-30 days)
  - Not disclose existence of order (gag order)

**Section 702: PRISM and Upstream Collection (50 U.S.C. § 1881a)**
- **PRISM:** NSA program requiring U.S. Internet service providers and telecommunications carriers to provide access to communications of non-U.S. persons located outside U.S.
- Carriers subject to PRISM directives:
  - AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile (wireless)
  - Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook (Internet services)
- **Upstream Collection:** NSA collects communications by tapping fiber optic cables at network switches; carriers provide physical access to cables
- Carrier obligations:
  - Provide NSA with access to communications transiting carrier's network
  - Develop "filters" to identify communications of foreign intelligence targets (based on selectors provided by NSA)
  - Deliver matching communications to NSA

**Carrier Obligations Under FISA:**

**50 U.S.C. § 1805(f): Compliance Mandate**
"A provider of wire or electronic communication service... shall furnish all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the electronic surveillance in such a manner as will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with the services that such provider is providing."

**Timeline for Compliance:**
- Emergency FISA orders: Carrier must comply **immediately** (within 1 hour)
- Routine FISA orders: Within **reasonable time** (typically 4-24 hours)

**Secrecy Requirements:**
- Carrier employees with knowledge of FISA order must hold security clearances (Secret or Top Secret/SCI)
- Carrier cannot disclose to target or third parties
- Carrier cannot disclose statistics on FISA requests (limited aggregate reporting permitted under USA FREEDOM Act)

**50 U.S.C. § 1805(g): Immunity**
Carrier that complies with FISA order is immune from civil liability to subscribers whose communications were intercepted.

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**
- **Court enforcement:** FISC may hold carrier in contempt; daily fines until compliance
- **Attorney General petition:** AG may petition FISC to compel compliance
- **National security implications:** Persistent non-compliance may result in FCC license revocation on Team Telecom recommendation

**FISA Compliance Costs:**
- **Personnel:** Maintain liaisons with FBI Office of General Counsel (OGC) and NSA (requires cleared personnel)
- **Infrastructure:** Section 702 compliance requires dedicated servers for filtering and delivering communications to NSA
- **Estimated Annual Cost:** $2M-$10M depending on carrier size

**NSA Implications:**
- Foreign-owned carriers subject to particularly stringent FISA compliance monitoring due to concern that foreign parent may obstruct FISA surveillance
- NSA typically requires:
  - FISA compliance liaisons be U.S. citizens with Top Secret/SCI clearances (not just Secret)
  - Foreign personnel have **no access** to systems involved in FISA surveillance (intercept mediation devices, FISA delivery function)
  - Annual certification that carrier has not disclosed FISA orders to foreign parent

#### 3. National Security Letters (NSLs)

**Statutory Authority:**

**18 U.S.C. § 2709: Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) NSL Authority**

**Purpose:** Allow FBI to obtain subscriber records and electronic communications transactional records **without court order** for counterintelligence and counterterrorism investigations.

**Scope:**
- NSL may compel carrier to produce:
  - Subscriber information (name, address, billing records, payment method)
  - Toll billing records (call detail records)
  - Electronic communications transactional records (email header information, IP addresses, login times)
- NSL **cannot** compel production of:
  - Communications content (requires FISA or Title III court order)
  - Location data beyond basic subscriber address (requires court order)

**Legal Standard:**
- FBI certifies that records are "relevant to an authorized investigation" (no judicial review unless carrier challenges)
- Lower standard than FISA or Title III (no probable cause required)

**Secrecy/Gag Order:**
- Carrier subject to NSL cannot disclose existence of NSL to:
  - Target subscriber
  - Third parties
  - Public
- Carrier may disclose to attorneys for purpose of seeking legal advice
- Gag order challenges: Carrier may petition court to lift gag order (USA FREEDOM Act permits judicial review)

**Compliance Timeline:**
- Carrier must produce records within **reasonable time** specified in NSL (typically 14-30 days)

**Carrier Obligations:**
- Designate NSL liaison (U.S. citizen, security clearance preferred)
- Train personnel on NSL handling and secrecy requirements
- Maintain logs of NSLs received and records produced

**Volume of NSLs:**
FBI issues approximately 15,000-20,000 NSLs per year (targeting ~5,000-8,000 unique subscribers).

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**
- FBI may seek court enforcement
- Persistent non-compliance may be reported to Team Telecom and FCC as national security concern

**NSA Implications:**
- Foreign-owned carriers must ensure NSL program is insulated from foreign parent (foreign parent cannot know which subscribers are subject to NSLs)
- NSA typically requires annual certification that carrier has not disclosed NSLs to foreign personnel or foreign parent

### G. TEAM TELECOM REVIEW TIMELINE AND PROCESS

#### 1. Baseline Timeline

**Statutory Framework:**

**EO 13913, § 2(d):** 120-day review period from referral to Committee recommendation

**47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(d):** FCC refers application to Committee within 7 days of accepting for filing

**Total Statutory Timeline:** 127 days (~4 months) from FCC accepting application to Committee recommendation

**However:** Committee may request extensions for "good cause" (no limit on extensions)

#### 2. Realistic Timeline Based on Precedent

**Simple Cases (No Foreign Ownership or <10% Allied Nation Ownership):**
- **Team Telecom Review:** 60-90 days (Committee may issue "no objection" without full 120-day review)
- **Example:** Verizon acquiring regional carrier with no foreign ownership

**Routine Foreign Ownership Cases (>10% Allied Nation Ownership, No Sensitive Customers):**
- **Team Telecom Review:** 120-180 days (4-6 months)
- **Example:** Telefónica (Spain) acquiring U.S. carrier with commercial customer base

**Complex Foreign Ownership Cases (Large Carrier, Government Customers, or Sensitive Infrastructure):**
- **Team Telecom Review:** 240-360 days (8-12 months)
- **Examples:** T-Mobile/Sprint (8 months); AT&T/DirecTV (6 months for satellite portions)

**High-Risk Foreign Ownership (Chinese, Russian, or Adversary Nation Ownership):**
- **Team Telecom Review:** 360-720+ days (1-2+ years) or **denial**
- **Example:** China Mobile USA (2+ years before denial)

**For $12.8B Acquisition with Unknown Foreign Ownership:**
- **Budget:** 6-12 months for Team Telecom review
- **Assumption:** Acquirer should disclose foreign ownership early and engage Team Telecom informally before filing FCC application to gauge timeline

#### 3. Process Milestones

**Phase 1: Pre-Filing Consultation (Optional but Recommended)**
- **Timing:** 3-6 months before FCC filing
- **Parties:** Acquirer's counsel meets with DOJ National Security Division
- **Purpose:** Preview foreign ownership structure; gauge Team Telecom concerns; discuss potential NSA terms
- **Outcome:** DOJ provides informal guidance on likely timeline and NSA requirements
- **Benefit:** Avoid surprise objections after filing; negotiate NSA terms in parallel with FCC review

**Phase 2: FCC Filing and Referral**
- **Day 0:** File FCC applications (Form 312, 490, 601 for license transfers; Form 574 for Section 214)
- **Day 0-30:** FCC reviews for completeness; may request additional information
- **Day 30:** FCC accepts application for filing; issues public notice
- **Day 37:** FCC refers application to Committee (within 7 days of acceptance)

**Phase 3: Committee Initial Questionnaire**
- **Day 45-60:** Committee (DOJ National Security Division) issues detailed questionnaire requesting:
  - Ownership charts
  - Network diagrams
  - Equipment vendor lists
  - Customer information
  - Cybersecurity policies
- **Day 60-90:** Applicant responds to questionnaire (typically 30-day deadline, extendable)

**Phase 4: Committee Threat Assessment (Classified)**
- **Day 90-150:** Committee agencies conduct classified assessment:
  - DOJ coordinates with FBI Counterintelligence Division
  - DHS CISA assesses critical infrastructure risks
  - DOD coordinates with Defense Intelligence Agency, NSA
  - State Department provides geopolitical context (bilateral relations, treaty obligations)
  - Intelligence Community (CIA, NSA) provides classified threat intelligence on foreign principals
- **Day 120:** Statutory deadline for Committee recommendation (often extended)

**Phase 5: NSA Negotiation (If Approval Likely)**
- **Day 150-210:** DOJ circulates draft NSA to applicant
- **Day 210-270:** Negotiate NSA terms:
  - Governance (Security Committee, CSO)
  - Network security (covered equipment removal timeline)
  - Data localization
  - Foreign personnel restrictions
  - Compliance audits
- **Day 270:** Finalize NSA (not executed until FCC grants application)

**Phase 6: Committee Recommendation to FCC**
- **Day 270:** Committee issues written recommendation to FCC:
  - "No objection subject to execution of NSA"
  - Attaches final NSA as exhibit
- FCC incorporates NSA conditions into grant of application

**Phase 7: FCC Grant and NSA Execution**
- **Day 300:** FCC grants applications conditioned on execution of NSA
- **Day 360:** Applicant executes NSA with DOJ (within 60 days of FCC grant per 47 C.F.R. § 1.50004(a))
- **Day 361:** Transaction may close (FCC licenses transfer upon NSA execution)

**Total Timeline for Foreign-Owned Acquisition:** 12-18 months from FCC filing to closing

#### 4. Factors Extending Timeline

**Adverse Factors (Increase Review Time):**
- **Chinese/Russian/Iranian/North Korean ownership:** +6-12 months (may result in denial)
- **Large carrier (>10 million subscribers):** +3-6 months (heightened scrutiny)
- **Government/military customers:** +2-4 months (classified threat assessment more extensive)
- **Submarine cable or satellite licenses:** +2-4 months (critical infrastructure)
- **Covered equipment in network (Huawei/ZTE):** +1-3 months (removal plan required)
- **History of NSA violations by either party:** +3-6 months (compliance audit required)

**Favorable Factors (Decrease Review Time):**
- **Allied nation ownership (UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Japan):** Baseline timeline (no acceleration, but no delay)
- **No government customers:** -1-2 months
- **Existing NSA with no violations:** -1-2 months (NSA can be amended rather than drafted from scratch)
- **Pre-filing consultation with DOJ:** -2-4 months (issues identified early, NSA negotiated in parallel)

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Target has >10% foreign ownership** | **HIGH** | Unknown (due diligence required) | Obtain complete ownership charts; budget 12-18 months for Team Telecom review; factor $5M-$20M annual NSA compliance costs into valuation |
| **Target has Chinese/Russian ownership** | **CRITICAL** | Low (but disqualifying if present) | Require Seller representation that no Chinese/Russian ownership; make divestiture of foreign ownership closing condition |
| **Target has Huawei/ZTE equipment** | **HIGH** | Medium (45,000 cell sites suggests regional carrier; many regional carriers used Huawei/ZTE in 2010s) | Conduct equipment audit during due diligence; obtain cost estimate for removal ($3M-$10M per 1,000 sites); negotiate purchase price adjustment |
| **Team Telecom denies or delays approval** | **MEDIUM** | Low (denial rare for non-Chinese ownership; delays common) | Include Team Telecom approval in closing conditions with outside date 18-24 months from signing; negotiate reverse break fee if Team Telecom denial |
| **NSA compliance costs exceed projections** | **MEDIUM** | Medium | Obtain quotes from vendors (SOC build-out, security personnel, auditors); add 25% contingency to cost estimates |
| **Target has existing NSA violations** | **HIGH** | Low (but discover during due diligence) | Request Target's NSA and compliance certifications; interview CSO; review audit reports from DOJ/DHS/DOD |
| **Reimbursement shortfall for covered equipment** | **MEDIUM** | High (if Target has Huawei/ZTE and receives USF) | Assume 39.5% reimbursement rate; Acquirer responsible for remaining 60.5% of costs; escrow funds for removal |
| **Foreign vendor access creates operational risks** | **MEDIUM** | Medium (if Target uses Ericsson/Nokia with remote access for O&M) | NSA will require U.S. personnel to monitor foreign vendor remote access; factor additional headcount costs |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

**Ownership Structure:**
- Investigate **indirect foreign ownership**: If Target is owned by holding company, trace ownership to ultimate beneficial owners
- Identify any passive foreign investors (private equity, sovereign wealth funds)
- Determine if any foreign investors have board seats, veto rights, or management agreements (de facto control)

**Network Equipment:**
- Audit **all** equipment vendors, not just RAN:
  - Core network (switches, routers, MME, SGW, PGW, HSS)
  - Transport (backhaul routers, optical transport)
  - Operations support systems (network management, billing, provisioning)
  - Security systems (firewalls, intrusion detection, DDoS mitigation)
- If Target has Ericsson/Nokia/Samsung, confirm:
  - No Huawei/ZTE equipment in **any** network layer (including legacy equipment in storage)
  - Vendor remote access policies (NSA will scrutinize)

**Customer Base:**
- Identify **government customers**:
  - Federal agencies (DOD, DHS, DOJ, Intelligence Community)
  - State/local law enforcement
  - Critical infrastructure (utilities, financial services, healthcare)
- Government customers trigger heightened Team Telecom scrutiny and more stringent NSA

**Cybersecurity Posture:**
- Review cybersecurity incident history:
  - Data breaches (must be disclosed to Team Telecom)
  - Ransomware attacks
  - Intrusions attributed to foreign adversaries (China APT groups, Russia GRU/SVR)
- SOC location and staffing:
  - If SOC offshore or staffed by foreign nationals, Team Telecom will require rebuild in U.S. with cleared personnel

**Existing NSA (if Target has foreign ownership):**
- Obtain copy of Target's existing NSA (if any)
- Review compliance certifications for past 3 years
- Interview CSO regarding audit findings
- Determine if any NSA violations or cure notices received from DOJ

**USF Support (Covered Equipment Risk):**
- Determine if Target receives Universal Service Fund high-cost support
- If yes, check FCC Covered Equipment database for whether Target applied for reimbursement (indicates Huawei/ZTE present)

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Scenario 1: No Foreign Ownership, No Huawei/ZTE**
- **Team Telecom Review:** Not required (unless FCC refers for other reasons)
- **Approval Timeline:** 6-12 months (FCC review only)
- **Compliance Costs:** Baseline CALEA/FISA compliance ($1M-$5M annually)
- **Risk Level:** **LOW**

**Scenario 2: Allied Nation Foreign Ownership (UK, Germany, Japan), No Huawei/ZTE**
- **Team Telecom Review:** Required (12-18 months)
- **NSA Required:** Yes
- **One-Time Costs:** $10M-$50M (SOC build-out, data center migration, security clearances)
- **Annual Costs:** $5M-$15M (security personnel, audits, compliance)
- **Approval Timeline:** 18-24 months total
- **Risk Level:** **MEDIUM**

**Scenario 3: Allied Nation Foreign Ownership + Huawei/ZTE Equipment**
- **Team Telecom Review:** Required (12-18 months, potentially longer)
- **NSA Required:** Yes, with non-negotiable Huawei/ZTE removal clause
- **One-Time Costs:** $50M-$150M ($10M-$50M NSA + $40M-$100M Huawei/ZTE removal for 45,000 sites)
- **Annual Costs:** $5M-$15M (NSA compliance)
- **Approval Timeline:** 18-24 months + removal timeline (2 years)
- **Reimbursement:** If Target receives USF support, 39.5% reimbursement; otherwise $0
- **Risk Level:** **HIGH**

**Scenario 4: Chinese/Russian Ownership (Any Percentage)**
- **Team Telecom Review:** Required (2+ years or immediate denial recommendation)
- **Likely Outcome:** **Denial** (China Mobile, China Telecom precedent)
- **Mitigation:** Require divestiture of Chinese/Russian ownership before closing
- **Alternative:** Structure as asset purchase (avoid license transfer; acquire only network assets and customer contracts)
- **Risk Level:** **CRITICAL**

**Financial Impact - Scenario 3 (Most Likely if Target Has Foreign Ownership):**

**One-Time Costs:**
| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Notes |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| NSA Implementation (SOC, data centers) | $10M | $50M | Depends on existing infrastructure |
| Huawei/ZTE Removal (45,000 sites) | $40M | $100M | Assumes 10-30% of sites have Huawei/ZTE; replacement cost $100K-$300K per site |
| Legal and Regulatory | $5M | $10M | FCC and Team Telecom process (18-24 months of counsel) |
| Security Clearances (CSO, SOC staff) | $500K | $2M | Background investigations, adjudication |
| **Total One-Time** | **$55.5M** | **$162M** | |

**Annual Ongoing Costs:**
| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Notes |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| CSO and Security Committee | $1M | $3M | Salaries, clearance maintenance |
| SOC Operations | $2M | $5M | 24/7 staffing (U.S. citizens with clearances) |
| Compliance Audits | $1M | $2M | Annual independent audit + DOJ audits |
| CALEA/FISA Liaisons | $500K | $2M | FBI/NSA coordination, infrastructure maintenance |
| Vendor Vetting and Supply Chain | $500K | $2M | Equipment approval process, software review |
| Data Localization (ongoing) | $1M | $3M | U.S. data center operations, access controls |
| **Total Annual** | **$6M** | **$17M** | |

**Net Present Value of NSA Compliance (10-year horizon, 8% discount):**
- NPV = One-Time Costs + (Annual Costs × PV annuity factor)
- NPV = $55.5M-$162M + ($6M-$17M × 6.71) = **$95.8M - $276M**

**Impact on Purchase Price:**
- If Target has foreign ownership and Huawei/ZTE, **negotiate $100M-$250M reduction** in purchase price
- Alternatively, structure as contingent consideration: Holdback escrow equal to removal costs, released after Team Telecom certifies compliance

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Team Telecom Review is Mandatory for Any Foreign Ownership >10%:** Executive Order 13913 established formal Committee structure with 120-day statutory review period, but realistic timeline is 12-18 months for complex transactions.

2. **47 C.F.R. § 1.50004 Requires NSA Execution as Condition of FCC Approval:** Foreign-owned carriers must execute legally binding National Security Agreement containing governance, network security, data localization, and compliance audit provisions.

3. **NSA Compliance Costs are Substantial:** $5M-$20M annually for mid-size carrier (45,000 cell sites) to maintain Security Committee, Chief Security Officer with clearance, SOC staffed by cleared U.S. citizens, annual audits, CALEA/FISA liaisons.

4. **Huawei/ZTE Removal is Non-Negotiable:** Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act prohibits USF recipients from using covered equipment; Team Telecom requires all foreign-owned carriers to remove Huawei/ZTE equipment regardless of USF status. Removal costs $100K-$300K per cell site; FCC reimbursement program covers only 39.5% of costs.

5. **FCC Covered List Identifies USF Recipients with Huawei/ZTE:** FCC maintains database of ~50 carriers that applied for reimbursement, but does not publicly disclose equipment details. Non-USF carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) not required to disclose Huawei/ZTE equipment publicly.

6. **Team Telecom Denial Precedent for Chinese/Russian Ownership:** China Mobile USA application denied (2019); China Telecom Americas license revoked (2021) based on Team Telecom recommendations. FCC always defers to Team Telecom on national security. Chinese/Russian ownership is disqualifying.

7. **T-Mobile/Sprint Precedent Shows Allied Nation Ownership Requires Stringent NSA:** German and Japanese ownership required 8-month Team Telecom review and amended NSA with Huawei removal, SOC, data localization, and compliance audits. NSA compliance costs estimated $50M-$100M annually for T-Mobile.

8. **CALEA and FISA Compliance Required for All Carriers:** Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act require carriers to facilitate lawful intercept (voice, SMS, data) and deliver to FBI/NSA. NSA typically imposes enhanced CALEA/FISA obligations (faster response times, Quantico circuits for government traffic).

9. **Review Timeline Highly Variable:** 120-day statutory period frequently extended; budget 6-12 months for routine foreign ownership, 12-18 months for complex cases (large carrier, government customers, Huawei/ZTE equipment). Chinese/Russian ownership may take 2+ years before denial.

10. **Pre-Filing Consultation with DOJ is Critical:** Informal engagement with DOJ National Security Division 3-6 months before FCC filing can reduce timeline by 2-4 months and avoid surprise objections.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### **Immediate Actions (Due Diligence Phase):**

1. **Ownership Structure Investigation:**
   - Obtain complete ownership charts for Target, tracing to ultimate beneficial owners
   - Identify all foreign investors (any ownership percentage)
   - Determine if any foreign investors have board representation, veto rights, or management agreements
   - Request representation from Seller that no Chinese/Russian/Iranian/North Korean ownership at any level

2. **Equipment Vendor Audit:**
   - Request complete equipment vendor list for all network elements:
     - Radio Access Network (base stations, antennas, RRH, BBU)
     - Core Network (MME, SGW, PGW, HSS, IMS)
     - Transport (backhaul routers, optical transport, microwave)
     - Operations Support Systems (network management, billing, provisioning)
   - Identify any Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, or Dahua equipment
   - If Huawei/ZTE present, obtain cost estimate for removal and replacement
   - Request quotes from Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung for replacement equipment

3. **Customer Base Analysis:**
   - Identify all government customers (federal, state, local)
   - Determine percentage of revenue from DOD, DHS, DOJ, Intelligence Community
   - Review customer contracts for classified communications or national security-sensitive services

4. **Existing NSA Review (if Target has foreign ownership):**
   - Request copy of Target's NSA (if any)
   - Review annual compliance certifications for past 3 years
   - Request copies of DOJ/DHS/DOD audit reports
   - Interview Target's CSO regarding compliance posture and any violations or cure notices

5. **USF Support and Covered Equipment:**
   - Determine if Target receives Universal Service Fund high-cost support
   - Check FCC Covered Equipment database (WC Docket 18-89) for whether Target applied for reimbursement
   - If yes, Target has Huawei/ZTE; request details on removal timeline and reimbursement allocation

#### **Short-Term Actions (Transaction Structuring):**

6. **Regulatory Approval Timeline and Conditions:**
   - Include in Purchase Agreement:
     - FCC license transfer approval (including Team Telecom clearance if applicable) as closing condition
     - Outside date of 18-24 months from signing (not 12 months)
     - Reverse break fee if Team Telecom denies (allocate risk to Seller)
   - Negotiate drop-dead date extensions if Team Telecom requests additional information or extensions

7. **Purchase Price Adjustment for NSA Compliance Costs:**
   - If Target has foreign ownership:
     - Negotiate $10M-$50M reduction in purchase price for NSA implementation costs (SOC, data centers, security clearances)
   - If Target has Huawei/ZTE:
     - Negotiate $40M-$100M reduction for removal costs (or escrow equivalent amount)
     - Seller indemnifies Acquirer for any shortfall in FCC reimbursement

8. **Asset Purchase Alternative (if Chinese/Russian Ownership):**
   - If Target has any Chinese/Russian ownership, consider asset purchase instead of stock purchase:
     - Acquirer acquires only network assets (cell sites, equipment, spectrum leases) and customer contracts
     - Avoids FCC license transfer (Acquirer applies for new licenses)
     - Eliminates Team Telecom review of foreign ownership (Acquirer must be clean)
   - Tradeoff: Longer timeline to obtain new licenses (12-18 months); potential customer churn

#### **Long-Term Actions (Post-Closing Compliance):**

9. **NSA Implementation Plan:**
   - Establish timeline for NSA implementation (typically 18-24 months for full compliance):
     - **Month 1-6:** Recruit CSO (U.S. citizen with security clearance); establish Security Committee
     - **Month 6-12:** Build or contract for SOC (U.S.-based, staffed by cleared personnel)
     - **Month 12-24:** Migrate U.S. customer data to U.S. data centers; implement access controls to restrict foreign personnel
     - **Month 18-24:** Remove all Huawei/ZTE equipment; replace with trusted vendors (Ericsson/Nokia/Samsung)
   - Budget $55M-$162M for NSA implementation (see Potential Exposure Analysis above)

10. **Annual Compliance Program:**
    - Establish annual compliance calendar:
      - **Q1:** CEO and CSO sign annual NSA compliance certification (due within 90 days of fiscal year-end)
      - **Q2:** Independent auditor conducts NSA compliance audit (results delivered to DOJ)
      - **Q3:** DOJ/DHS/DOD may conduct on-site audit (30 days' notice)
      - **Q4:** Update NSA compliance procedures based on audit findings
    - Budget $6M-$17M annually for ongoing NSA compliance

11. **Pre-Filing Consultation with DOJ:**
    - 3-6 months before FCC filing, request meeting with DOJ National Security Division:
      - Preview foreign ownership structure
      - Discuss anticipated NSA terms
      - Identify any concerns that could delay Team Telecom review
    - Benefits:
      - Reduce Team Telecom review timeline by 2-4 months
      - Negotiate NSA in parallel with FCC review (rather than sequentially)
      - Avoid surprise objections after filing

### C. Outstanding Questions for Due Diligence

**Critical Questions:**
1. Does Target have **any foreign ownership** (direct or indirect) at any level? If yes, identify nationality, ownership percentage, and whether investor has board seats or veto rights.

2. Does Target have **Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, or Dahua equipment** in any part of its network? If yes, obtain inventory (quantity, model, location) and cost estimate for removal.

3. Does Target have **existing NSA** with Team Telecom? If yes, request copy of NSA, compliance certifications, and audit reports.

4. Does Target serve **government customers** (DOD, DHS, DOJ, Intelligence Community)? If yes, what percentage of revenue and are there classified contracts?

5. Does Target receive **Universal Service Fund high-cost support**? If yes, has Target applied for Secure Networks Act reimbursement?

**Additional Questions:**
6. What is Target's cybersecurity incident history in past 5 years? (Data breaches, ransomware, intrusions by foreign adversaries)

7. Where is Target's Security Operations Center located? Is it staffed by U.S. citizens with security clearances?

8. Where is U.S. customer data stored? Are there any data centers located outside U.S.?

9. Do foreign personnel (employees, contractors, vendors) have access to U.S. customer data or network management systems?

10. What equipment vendors does Target use for remote access (operations & maintenance, software updates)? Are vendor personnel based in U.S. or offshore?

**Key Takeaway:** Allied nation foreign ownership with no Huawei/ZTE and no government customers = 6-12 month Team Telecom review. Chinese/Russian ownership = denial (regardless of timeline).

### Appendix F: NSA Compliance Cost Estimates by Carrier Size

| Carrier Size (Subscribers) | Cell Sites | One-Time NSA Costs | Annual NSA Costs | Huawei/ZTE Removal (if applicable) |
|---------------------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Small (<500K)** | <5,000 | $5M-$15M | $2M-$5M | $10M-$30M (assume 20% penetration) |
| **Mid-Size (500K-5M)** | 5,000-50,000 | $15M-$50M | $5M-$15M | $30M-$150M (assume 20% penetration) |
| **Large (>5M)** | >50,000 | $50M-$150M | $15M-$50M | $150M-$500M (assume 20% penetration) |

**For Target (45,000 cell sites = mid-to-large carrier):**
- **One-Time NSA:** $15M-$50M
- **Annual NSA:** $5M-$15M
- **Huawei/ZTE Removal (if 20% penetration = 9,000 sites):** $90M-$270M (@ $10K-$30K per site)
- **FCC Reimbursement (if USF recipient):** 39.5% × $90M-$270M = $35M-$107M
- **Net Cost to Acquirer:** $55M-$163M

## X. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment
- [x] All relevant databases queried (Federal Register, CFR, FCC orders, statutes)
- [x] Multiple search strategies employed (keyword searches, citation tracing, precedent review)
- [x] Cross-referenced findings across sources (EO 13913 vs. CFR vs. FCC orders)
- [x] Identified gaps clearly documented (NSA full text confidential; FCC equipment database limited to USF recipients)

### Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Team Telecom review required for >10% foreign ownership | **HIGH** | EO 13913 § 2(a); 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(a); FCC precedent (T-Mobile/Sprint, China Mobile) |
| NSA required for foreign-owned carriers | **HIGH** | 47 C.F.R. § 1.50004; FCC orders conditioning approval on NSA execution |
| Huawei/ZTE removal non-negotiable | **HIGH** | Secure Networks Act 47 U.S.C. § 1603; T-Mobile NSA conditions; DOJ press releases |
| 39.5% reimbursement rate for covered equipment | **HIGH** | FCC Order 37 FCC Rcd 8213 (July 2022); GAO report (2023) |
| $5M-$20M annual NSA compliance costs | **MEDIUM** | Industry reports (Fierce Wireless, RCR Wireless); FCC cost-benefit analyses; no official government estimates |
| Chinese/Russian ownership disqualifying | **HIGH** | China Mobile denial, China Telecom revocation; DOJ statements re: "whole-of-government" threat |
| 12-18 month Team Telecom timeline for routine foreign ownership | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | T-Mobile/Sprint (8 months); historical precedent (Vodafone ~12 months); statutory 120 days frequently extended |

### Known Limitations
- **NSA full text confidential:** Analysis based on publicly disclosed terms in FCC orders, DOJ press releases, and Vodafone litigation; actual NSAs may contain additional classified provisions
- **FCC Covered List limited to USF recipients:** Non-USF carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) not required to publicly disclose Huawei/ZTE equipment; Target may have covered equipment not discoverable through public databases
- **Compliance cost estimates:** Based on industry reports and FCC cost-benefit analyses; actual costs vary by carrier-specific factors (existing infrastructure, personnel, geographic footprint)
- **Team Telecom timelines unpredictable:** Statutory 120 days frequently extended; classified threat assessments and inter-agency coordination add variability
