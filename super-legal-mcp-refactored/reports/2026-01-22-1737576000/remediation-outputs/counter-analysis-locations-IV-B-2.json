First, the independent pricing service engagement reduces but does not eliminate valuation dispute risk; the financial-analyst identified that marks are stale (18-20 months old) and public comparables have declined 30-40%, suggesting markdowns are probable despite prudent quarterly procedures.\u2077\u00b9 Second, clean prior loss history is relevant to underwriting but does not constrain future claim severity; institutional clients asserting claims for the first time may seek damages reflecting years of accumulated fees and alleged losses. Third, while the 0.1% benchmark is not legally binding, it reflects insurance market pricing and industry actuarial data; falling significantly below the benchmark increases uninsured tail risk in adverse scenarios. The 30% probability assessment accounts for these competing considerations.",
