## IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

These 50 enhanced citations should be integrated into the final-memorandum.md file at their respective line numbers. Each parenthetical:

1. **Explains relevance**: States WHY the case is cited (specific holding relevant to analysis)
2. **Maintains brevity**: 10-15 words (maximum 20 for complex holdings)
3. **Focuses on holding**: Describes court's holding or SEC's finding, not general case background
4. **Adds value**: Provides information NOT obvious from surrounding context
