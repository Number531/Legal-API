## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

**Option 1: Direct Python execution (recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-22-1737576000/remediation-outputs
python3 W4-001-execute-now.py
```

**Option 2: Full script with verification**
```bash
cd /Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-22-1737576000/remediation-outputs
bash execute-W4-001.sh
```

**Option 3: Alternative neutralize-advocacy.py script**
```bash
cd /Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-22-1737576000/remediation-outputs
python3 neutralize-advocacy.py
```

All three methods produce the same output file: `W4-001-neutral-language.md`

## POST-EXECUTION VERIFICATION

After running execution script, verify with:

```bash
# 1. Confirm advocacy term removed
grep -n "clearly sufficient" W4-001-neutral-language.md
# Expected: No results

# 2. Confirm replacement present
grep -n "sufficient under precedent" W4-001-neutral-language.md
# Expected: 1 match at line 2225

# 3. Verify ERISA statute quote preserved
grep -n "clearly prudent not to do so" W4-001-neutral-language.md
# Expected: 1 match at line 3009

# 4. Verify SEC regulation quotes preserved
grep -c "Clearly and prominently discloses" W4-001-neutral-language.md
# Expected: 3 matches (lines 6633-6635)

# 5. File size check
ls -lh W3-XREF-INSERT-final-memorandum-xrefs.md W4-001-neutral-language.md
# Expected: Output file ~17 bytes larger (1,407,913 → 1,407,930)
```

## TASK DESCRIPTION DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS

**Expected vs. Actual Findings:**

| Advocacy Term | Expected Count | Actual Count | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| "clearly" | 3 advocacy instances | 1 advocacy instance | 3 additional instances are statutory/regulatory quotes |
| "obviously" | 2 instances | 0 instances | Not present in document |
| "undoubtedly" | 2 instances | 0 instances | Not present in document |
| "without question" | 1 instance | 0 instances | Not present in document |
| "it is certain" | 1 instance | 0 instances | Not present in document |
| **TOTAL** | **9 instances** | **1 instance** | Discrepancy likely due to earlier draft or prior remediation |

**Statutory/Regulatory Quotes Preserved:**

1. **Line 3009**: "clearly prudent not to do so" — ERISA Section 1104(a)(1)(C) direct quote
2. **Line 6633**: "Clearly and prominently discloses whether..." — 17 C.F.R. § 275.206(4)-1(b)(1) direct quote
3. **Line 6634**: "Clearly and prominently discloses any compensation..." — 17 C.F.R. § 275.206(4)-1(b)(1) direct quote
4. **Line 6635**: "Clearly and prominently discloses any material conflicts..." — 17 C.F.R. § 275.206(4)-1(b)(1) direct quote

**Rationale for Preservation**: Legal memoranda must quote statutes and regulations verbatim. Modifying statutory language ("clearly prudent") or regulatory language ("Clearly and prominently discloses") would constitute misquotation and professional malpractice.
