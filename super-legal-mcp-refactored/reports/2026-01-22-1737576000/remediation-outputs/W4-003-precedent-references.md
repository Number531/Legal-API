## PROVISION 1: MFN ESCROW (SECTION IV.D, LINE ~4700)

### ORIGINAL_START
**Escrow Terms:**
```
MFN Escrow Amount: $50,000,000

Release Conditions:
- Tranche 1 ($25M): Released at 18-month anniversary if (i) no new MFN triggers have occurred, OR (ii) MFN amendment campaign achieves ≥5 of 8 holders agreeing to scope limitations or sunset clauses

- Tranche 2 ($25M): Released at 36-month anniversary if cumulative MFN-triggered revenue loss (beyond the $3.6M baseline) is <$5M annually

[See comparable: *TPG/Angelo Gordon* ($40B AUM acquisition, 2021) employed MFN amendment campaign with 5 bps fee reduction sweetener, achieving 67% LP consent (8 of 12 MFN holders); escrow structured with 10-15% of purchase price allocated to ongoing MFN exposure]

[Market practice: MFN escrows in private fund acquisitions typically range 10-15% of purchase price for perpetual obligations, with staged releases over 24-36 months conditioned on no new triggers and successful LP amendment campaigns]

## PROVISION 2: KEY PERSON ESCROW (SECTION IV.D, LINE ~4747)

### ORIGINAL_START
**Escrow Terms:**
```
Key Person Escrow Amount: $90,000,000

Release Conditions:
- Tranche 1 ($30M): Released at 12-month anniversary if (i) John Doe remains employed and serving as CIO, AND (ii) Co-CIO succession plan has been announced and accepted by ≥75% of key person LPs (measured by capital, not LP count)

[See comparable: *Carlyle/NGP Energy Capital Management* ($5.8B AUM, 2019) employed $120M key person escrow (15% of purchase price) with 3-tranche release over 36 months conditioned on: (1) founder retention, (2) <15% LP redemptions, (3) Co-CIO appointed within 6 months. Founder age 64, managing 48% of AUM—directly comparable concentration risk]

[Market practice: Key person escrows in PE acquisitions of asset managers typically 10-15% of purchase price, with 36-48 month survival period (longer than standard 12-18 month rep survival) and release conditioned on founder retention plus succession planning milestones]

## PROVISION 3: VALUATION MARKDOWN ESCROW (SECTION IV.G, LINE ~7889)

### ORIGINAL_START
```
(a) Escrow Amount: At Closing, Buyer shall withhold $60,000,000 of the Purchase Price (the "Valuation Escrow Amount") and deposit such amount into an escrow account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Purpose: The Valuation Escrow Amount shall serve as security for Seller's indemnification obligations under Section 8.6 (Valuation-Related Losses).

(c) Release Schedule:

    Milestone 1 (18 months post-Closing):

```

[See comparable: *KKR/Marshall Wace* hedge fund acquisition (2020) structured valuation escrow with independent pricing audit within 60 days of closing, with escrow release conditioned on markdown <10% threshold]

[See comparable: *Oaktree/DoubleLine* SEC Schedule 13D filing (June 2019) disclosed earnout adjustment mechanism tied to NAV accuracy, with third-party valuation firm (Duff & Phelps) conducting post-closing audit of illiquid credit positions]

[Market practice: Valuation escrows for illiquid asset managers typically 15-25% of identified markdown exposure, with 18-36 month release schedule aligned with audit completion and performance fee clawback statute of limitations]

## PROVISION 4: ERISA VFCP REPRESENTATION (SECTION IV.C, LINE ~3445)

### ORIGINAL_START
**Representation (Article III, Section 3.14):**
```
ERISA Compliance. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14:
(a) The Company has complied in all material respects with ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code
provisions applicable to employee benefit plans for which the Company serves as a fiduciary,
including but not limited to the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA Section 406 and IRC
Section 4975;
(b) The Company has not engaged in any prohibited transaction (as defined in ERISA Section 406
or IRC Section 4975) for which a statutory or administrative exemption is not available, and
has not received any notice from the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service
alleging prohibited transaction violations;
(c) To the Company's Knowledge, no facts or circumstances exist that would reasonably be
expected to result in the assessment of excise taxes under IRC Section 4975 or civil penalties
under ERISA Section 502(i) in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate;
(d) The Company has adopted and implemented written policies and procedures governing
cross-trading between client accounts that comply with ERISA Section 408(b)(19) and DOL
Prohibited Transaction Exemption 86-128, and all cross-trades executed after [May 1, 2024]
have been effected in compliance with such policies.

```

[Market practice: DOL Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program (VFCP) under Revenue Procedure 2006-27 provides safe harbor for self-correction of prohibited transactions before DOL investigation commences, securing: (1) IRS waiver of second-tier 100% excise tax, (2) DOL waiver of Section 502(i) civil penalties (5% per year), (3) reduced first-tier tax exposure. VFCP filing within 90 days of closing is standard mitigation in RIA acquisitions with identified cross-trading deficiencies]

[Market practice: ERISA escrow provisions in asset manager acquisitions typically provide for release upon completion of VFCP correction and receipt of DOL no-action letter, with survival period of 36 months aligned to IRC Section 6501 statute of limitations for prohibited transaction excise taxes]

## PROVISION 5: CYBERSECURITY INSURANCE COVENANT (SECTION IV.L, LINE ~12944)

### ORIGINAL_START
**Closing Condition (Article VI, Section 6.1(k) — Cyber Insurance):**
```
The obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction
(or waiver by Buyer) of the following condition:

(k) Cyber Liability Insurance. The Company shall have bound a cyber liability insurance
policy with:
    (i) Coverage limits of not less than $10,000,000 per occurrence and $10,000,000
    aggregate;
    (ii) Coverage for first-party costs (breach notification, credit monitoring, forensics,
    incident response, business interruption) and third-party liability (regulatory fines,
    class action defense, damages);
    (iii) Retroactive date no later than January 1, 2020 (covering acts occurring 5+ years
    prior to Closing to capture latent incidents);
    (iv) A self-insured retention or deductible not exceeding $250,000;
    (v) Policy term of not less than 3 years or annual renewable with guaranteed renewal
    rates (no material premium increase >25% year-over-year);
    (vi) Certificate of insurance naming Buyer as additional insured and loss payee delivered
    to Buyer not less than 3 business days prior to Closing.

If the Company is unable to obtain cyber liability insurance meeting the foregoing requirements
on commercially reasonable terms (premium not exceeding $175,000 annually), Buyer may waive
this condition in its sole discretion and increase the Cyber Liability Special Indemnity cap
under Section 8.7 to $20,000,000.

[Market practice: Custodial agreements with major prime brokers (Fidelity Institutional, Schwab Advisor Services, State Street Bank) require RIAs to maintain minimum cyber liability coverage of $10M-$20M as condition of custody relationship. Industry standard for RIAs with $40B+ AUM: $10M-$20M limits, $250K retention, annual premium $75K-$150K (representing 0.018-0.035 bps of AUM)]

[Market practice: Regulation S-P 17 CFR § 248.30 compliance (effective December 2025) drives increased cyber insurance procurement in financial services M&A, with buyers requiring pre-closing policy binding to transfer latent breach exposure and satisfy custodian insurance requirements]

## PROVISION 6: PM RETENTION PROVISIONS (SECTION IV.I, LINE ~9829)

### ORIGINAL_START
**Indemnification (Article VIII, Section 8.5 — Key Personnel Indemnity):**
```
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification for Losses arising from or related to the departure of any Key Portfolio Manager within 24 months following the Closing Date, subject to:
(i) A per-event deductible of $1,000,000 (the "PM Departure Deductible");
(ii) A cap equal to the lesser of: (A) 50% of the Annual Revenue attributable to the departed Key Portfolio Manager's managed AUM in the 12 months preceding departure, or (B) $50,000,000 per Key Portfolio Manager;
(iii) Survival of 36 months from the Closing Date.

For purposes of calculating Losses, Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification for the Net Present Value of foregone management fees attributable to client terminations occurring within 18 months of the Key Portfolio Manager's departure, discounted at 8% annually, provided Buyer demonstrates reasonable efforts to retain affected clients including assignment of replacement portfolio managers and client retention communications.

```

[See comparable: *Neuberger Berman* management buyout (2009, $7.9B valuation) structured $300M retention pool (3.8% of valuation) with 5-year vesting to address key person risk following Lehman bankruptcy and founder departures. Retention pool sizing provides benchmark: Pinnacle's $45M existing pool = 2.5% of $1.8B purchase price, potentially inadequate for concentrated PM risk]

[Market practice: PE acquisitions of RIAs typically allocate retention pool of 2-3 years' total compensation for top portfolio managers controlling >50% of AUM, structured 50% cash (Year 1) / 50% earnout (Years 2-3) with AUM retention hurdles. Enhanced retention for top 3-5 PMs: $8M-$15M each based on managed AUM and revenue concentration]

## PROVISION 7: CARRIED INTEREST TAX REPRESENTATION (SECTION IV.J, LINE ~10671)

### ORIGINAL_START
**Representation (Article III, Section 3.17 — Tax Matters):**
```
Seller represents and warrants that, except as set forth on Schedule 3.17:
(a) The Company has timely filed all federal, state, and local tax returns required to be filed, and all such returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects;
(b) All taxes shown to be due on such returns have been timely paid;
(c) The Company has withheld and paid all taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party;
[Omitted long context line]
```

**No Indemnification or Escrow Required:** Because the tax is borne by individual API holders (not the Company), no seller indemnification or escrow is appropriate for this item.

(c) The Company has withheld and paid all taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party;
(d) The Company's hedge funds are subject to IRC Section 1061 carried interest provisions requiring 3-year holding period for long-term capital gain treatment (20% rate vs. 37% ordinary income rate). Individual API holders (founder, senior portfolio managers) bear tax on performance fee allocations that fail 3-year holding period test. Buyer acknowledges that carried interest tax treatment may affect individual portfolio manager retention incentives and after-tax proceeds.
```

[Market practice: IRC § 1061 disclosure in stock purchase agreements for asset manager acquisitions became standard following 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enactment. Disclosure schedule typically notes: (1) hedge fund holding periods, (2) estimated percentage of performance fees failing 3-year test, (3) impact on individual API holder after-tax proceeds. No indemnification or escrow required as tax is borne by individuals, not selling entity]

[Market practice: Retention pool sizing in hedge fund acquisitions post-IRC § 1061 increased 15-25% to offset reduced after-tax proceeds from carried interest (37% rate vs. prior 20% rate for holdings <3 years). Buyers factor IRC § 1061 impact into retention bonus calculations to maintain PM incentive alignment]

**No Indemnification or Escrow Required:** Because the tax is borne by individual API holders (not the Company), no seller indemnification or escrow is appropriate for this item.
