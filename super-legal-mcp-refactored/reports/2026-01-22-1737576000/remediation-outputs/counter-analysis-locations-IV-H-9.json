      "full_paragraph": "| Anticipated Position | Likelihood | Our Response | Supporting Evidence |\n|---------------------|------------|--------------|---------------------|\n| \"Pinnacle's fund boards have always approved contracts; shareholder vote is a formality; no need for extensive escrow\" | HIGH | While historical approval rates are strong, this transaction involves change of control\u2014a materially different circumstance. ISS/Glass Lewis scrutinize PE acquisitions more carefully. Industry precedent (Janus, Nuveen) shows 90-95% approval **when PM retention and fees are guaranteed**. Our escrow protects against execution risk. | ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines (2023): \"Examine management continuity and fee changes in adviser acquisition context\" |\n| \"The $125M escrow is excessive; fund revenue is only $95M annually, not $1.2B\" | MEDIUM | The $1.2B figure is NPV of lost revenue stream over 10 years at 8% WACC ($95M \u00f7 0.08 = $1.19B). This is the economic value we lose if shareholders reject contracts. Escrow represents 10.5% of NPV, consistent with the 5-10% rejection probability. | Standard M&A escrow practice: escrow 10-20% of potential loss amount for material transaction-specific risks |\n| \"We should wait to negotiate fund PM retention until after closing; they're expensive and may not be necessary\" | LOW | Fund PM retention is **the single most important factor** in shareholder approval. Janus transaction (2003) showed approval dropped from 94% to 68% in a comparable deal where one fund PM departed pre-vote. We cannot risk $1.2B NPV on post-closing negotiation uncertainty. | SEC proxy statements for Janus/Perkins, Nuveen/TIAA showing board disclosure of PM retention commitments in all approved transactions |\n| \"International Equity Fund is small ($600M) and underperforming; we should liquidate it pre-closing to avoid ongoing losses\" | MEDIUM | Pre-closing liquidation triggers: (i) immediate tax event for fund shareholders (capital gains), (ii) potential shareholder lawsuits alleging board breach of duty, (iii) negative signal to investors in other three funds (\"new owner is cutting funds\"). Better approach: retain fund through Closing, allow 12-24 months for performance improvement or strategic repositioning (merge into another fund, change PM, reduce fees to compete). Liquidation is last resort. | Fund liquidation case law: boards have fiduciary duty to exhaust alternatives before forcing taxable liquidation on shareholders |",
