### FINANCIAL PRE-AGGREGATION (Board Briefing Ready)

| Category | Gross | Probability | Weighted | Method | Sources |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Regulatory** | $2.25M-$4.265M | 85% avg | $3.06M | EV/NPV | T1, T3, T6 |
| **Commercial Contracts** | $149M-$259M | 57% avg | $204.65M | EV/NPV | T4, T1 |

| **TOTAL** | **$343.7M-$744.425M** | **—** | **$410.71M** | **—** | **—** |

#### Liability Methodology Validation

All exposures use appropriate methodologies:
- **Expected Value (EV):** Used for contingent liabilities (litigation, ERISA penalties, client terminations) = Gross × Probability
- **Net Present Value (NPV):** Used for multi-year cash flow impacts (MFN ongoing, HWM recovery delay, PM retention)
- **Tax Calculation:** Used for IRC Section 1061 carried interest recharacterization (certain liability)

**No Methodology Corrections Required**

#### Recommended Purchase Price Impact

| Component | Amount | Basis |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Escrow/Holdback** | $150M-$200M | Covers contingent items: MFN ($98M), key person fire-sale ($71.5M), valuation markdown ($70M) = 75-90th percentile |
| **Insurance Requirement (Pre-Closing)** | $10M-$20M cyber policy | Addresses uninsured cybersecurity exposure ($12.4M weighted) |
| **Enhanced Retention Pool** | $20M-$30M supplement | Reduces PM departure probability from 50% to 30% (saves $20M-$35M) |

#### Escrow Recommendations

| Matter | Amount | Release Condition |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Side Letter MFN Exposure | $50M | Month 24 if MFN amendments executed ≥5 of 8 holders |
| Key Person Event | $75M | Month 12 if no key person departure OR LP redemptions <20% if departure |
| Valuation Markdown | $50M | Month 18 if no LP clawback claims + SEC follow-up exam complete |
| Client Concentration | $25M | Month 12 if client terminations <10% institutional AUM |
| **Total** | **$200M** | Tranched releases |

**Usage:** memo-executive-summary-writer should copy this table to Board Briefing Section II.

- [ ] IV.D → IV.H: Side letter MFN and key person clauses analyzed in commercial contracts context
- [ ] IV.G → IV.D, IV.E: Valuation markdown triggers performance fee clawback and SEC follow-up exam risk
- [ ] IV.H → IV.I: Client concentration linked to PM retention (client relationships portability)
- [ ] IV.K → IV.L: Cyber breach exposure uninsured due to insurance gap
- [ ] IV.I → IV.H: Non-compete enforceability limited by client portability and MA Reform Act
- [ ] IV.J → IV.D: Carried interest tax treatment depends on hedge fund holding periods
- [ ] IV.B → IV.H: Mutual fund assignment requires shareholder approval, affects client agreements

**Pattern Count:** 12 mandatory cross-references

**Usage:** memo-section-writers should check off these cross-references as they write. memo-executive-summary-writer should verify all are present.
