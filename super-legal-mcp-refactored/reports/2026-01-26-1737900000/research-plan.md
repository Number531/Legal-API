## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| CMS proposed 2024 staffing rule finalizes substantially as proposed | Federal Register notice of proposed rulemaking | If final rule requires >3.5 PPD or shorter phase-in, costs increase >$4.3M |
| DOJ intervenes in Martinez qui tam by Q2 2025 | Typical 6-12 month intervention decision timeline from unsealing December 2024 | If DOJ declines, relator proceeds alone with unpredictable outcome |
| Orange County March 2025 survey occurs on schedule | Annual survey cycle typically 9-15 months from prior survey | If survey delayed to Q2 2025, SFF candidate status uncertain at closing |
| Medicare provider agreements valid and no termination proceedings beyond Orange County SFF | User-provided data room documents | If additional facilities under termination threat, material risk |
| No undisclosed litigation beyond Martinez qui tam | Standard assumption due diligence | If additional qui tam under seal or resident injury class actions, material exposure |
| Financial statements EBITDA $52M accurate | User-provided data | If DPNA/CMP/turnover costs not fully reflected, pro forma EBITDA overstated |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual insurance policy terms not provided (assuming industry-standard limits $5M-$10M professional liability, $10M-$25M D&O)
- Target employee count 1,850 estimated (breakdown by facility not provided, assuming proportional to licensed beds)
- Medicare cost report accuracy not verified (historical overpayments possible if cost reports inflated, desk review/audit risk)
- Sale-leaseback decision not finalized (Silver Oak "under consideration", modeling assumes $150M-$200M real estate value, $12M-$16M annual rent)

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:** Financial-analyst (T8) depends on T1-T7 quantified findings for monte_carlo risk aggregation, but can begin preliminary modeling in parallel and update upon specialist completion.

**Potential Issues:**
- Orange County SFF candidate status could delay California CHOW approval, blocking entire transaction closing (3-6 month delay possible)
- If DOJ intervenes in Martinez qui tam and demands >$15M settlement, purchase price adjustment triggers
- If CMS finalizes staffing rule with >3.5 PPD requirement or <3 year phase-in, costs exceed $4.3M budget

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If any specialist finds >$100M exposure beyond identified risks, flag immediately
- If research-review-analyst determines REMEDIATE (coverage gaps), spawn additional specialists before proceeding to memorandum synthesis
- If Orange County SFF designated full SFF before closing, recommend excluding facility from transaction (145 beds, $28M revenue, not worth termination risk)

### DEAL-BLOCKING ISSUES DETECTED

**Issue 1: Orange County SFF Medicare Termination Risk - ⚠️ DEAL-BLOCKING POTENTIAL (MITIGATABLE)**

**Status:** ESCALATION RECOMMENDED (BUT MITIGATABLE)

**Trigger Finding:** Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA) designated SFF candidate September 2024 following two immediate jeopardy citations within 12 months. March 2025 survey (60 days post-closing) critical: if immediate jeopardy recurs → full SFF designation September 2025 → 60-70% probability Medicare provider agreement termination within 18-36 months.

**Source:** cms-regulatory-compliance-report.md, Section I.1

**Trigger Type:** REGULATORY DENIAL / CLOSING CONDITION FAILURE

**Deal Impact Assessment:**

1. **California CHOW Approval Delay:** 40-50% probability California CDPH delays license transfer pending March 2025 survey results, delaying CHOW approval 3-6 months.

2. **Transaction Timeline Impact:** Target closing March 2025 → potentially pushed to June-September 2025; financing commitment expires (extension fees $2M-$3M); coordinated federal/state approvals for 11 other facilities must wait.

3. **Facility Exclusion Risk:** If Orange County elevated to full SFF designation before closing (10-20% probability), CMS will not approve CHOW for facility under termination proceedings. Orange County ($28M value, 145 beds, $24.6M annual revenue) becomes unacquirable → must exclude from transaction.

4. **Revenue Loss if Acquired:** If transaction closes with Orange County included but facility subsequently terminates Medicare agreement (60% probability if March 2025 survey fails), Silver Oak loses $24.6M annual revenue (88% of Orange County's $28M), facility must close, 350 employees laid off (WARN Act $5.2M liability).

**Probability of Deal Failure:** **10-15%** (conditional on Orange County elevated to full SFF before closing + CMS denies CHOW)

**Basis:** CMS SFF program termination data 2020-2024 shows 60-70% of full SFF facilities ultimately terminate Medicare provider agreements; however, SFF candidates (pre-full-designation) have 40-50% graduation rate if improvement plan implemented immediately.

---

**Orchestrator Decision: RECOMMENDED - Continue Full Research & Memo Generation with Deal Structure Modifications**

**Rationale:**
1. **Risk is Mitigatable:** Orange County SFF termination risk (60% probability) can be reduced to 30-40% probability if $2.75M annual improvement plan implemented immediately.

2. **Transaction Structure Flexibility Available:** Purchase agreement can include conditional closing provisions:
   - **Option A (Delay Closing):** Extend outside date to September 2025 to allow Orange County March 2025 survey results
   - **Option B (Exclude Orange County):** If CDPH delays/denies CHOW >90 days, buyer may exclude Orange County with $28M purchase price reduction
   - **Option C (Conditional Acquisition with Escrow):** Proceed with 12-facility closing, but escrow $5M released to buyer if CMS delays Orange County CHOW >90 days post-closing or terminates Medicare agreement within 24 months

3. **Not "Fundamental Assumption Invalidated":** Core deal premise (acquiring 12 SNF portfolio with regulatory compliance challenges requiring remediation investment) remains valid. Orange County SFF risk was disclosed in research-plan.md critical issues checklist (Issue #2).

4. **Economic Impact Manageable:** If Orange County excluded, transaction reduces from $425M (12 facilities) to $397M (11 facilities) = $28M reduction (6.6% of enterprise value). Remaining 11 facilities ($48M EBITDA) still attractive at 8.3× EBITDA multiple.

### GAPS REQUIRING REMEDIATION

**Gap Assessment: NO CRITICAL GAPS**

All 10 critical issues from research-plan.md adequately covered by 7 specialist reports. No additional specialist invocation required.

**Minor Enhancement Opportunities (Optional, Not Required for Proceeding):**

**Gap 1: Medicare Cost Report Historical Accuracy Audit**
- **Affected Sections:** IV.G (Tax - cost report settlement risk), IV.A (Regulatory - desk review/audit risk)
- **Recommended Specialist:** healthcare-reimbursement-analyst (48-hour targeted task)
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Reason:** If Sunset's FY2020-2024 cost reports overstated costs, CMS may recoup overpayments upon CHOW desk review. Typical exposure: 5-15% of Medicare revenue ($80M) = $4M-$12M potential recoupment.
- **Decision:** OPTIONAL - Can be addressed post-closing; recommend escrow $2M-$8M for cost report indemnification (typical 5-10% of Medicare revenue for 3-year look-back).
