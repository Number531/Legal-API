## I. TRANSACTION OVERVIEW

Silver Oak Healthcare LLC ("Silver Oak" or "Acquirer"), a private equity-backed healthcare platform, proposes to acquire Sunset Senior Living Group, LLC ("Sunset" or "Target") from Golden Gate Capital [Fact #T.6] for a nominal purchase price of $425,000,000 [Fact #T.1]. The transaction is structured as an asset purchase [Fact #T.2], with parties considering an IRC Section 338(h)(10) election that would provide $50.77M in net present value tax benefits to the buyer over 10 years [Fact #X.1], though this requires a $37M-$50M purchase price increase to compensate the seller for incremental tax burden [Fact #X.3].

Sunset operates a portfolio of 12 skilled nursing facilities across three states: Arizona (6 facilities), Nevada (3 facilities), and California (3 facilities) [Facts #F.4, F.5, F.6]. The portfolio comprises 1,650 licensed beds with current occupancy of 1,485 residents (90% occupancy rate) [Facts #F.2, F.3]. The target generates annual revenue of $285,000,000 with EBITDA of $52,000,000 (18.2% margin) [Facts #M.1, M.2]. The payer mix is heavily weighted toward government programs: Medicare 28%, Medicaid 58%, and private pay 14% [Facts #M.3, M.4, M.5]. The workforce comprises 1,850 employees, including 980 nursing staff (180 RN, 320 LPN, 480 CNA) [Facts #E.1, E.2].

This legal due diligence memorandum examines seven substantive areas: (A) CMS Regulatory Compliance and Quality Ratings; (B) False Claims Act Litigation; (C) Commercial Contracts and Change of Ownership; (D) Insurance Coverage and Risk Transfer; (E) Employment and Labor Relations; (F) Privacy and HIPAA Compliance; and (G) Tax Structure and Transaction Planning. The analysis identifies 23 material findings across these domains, with aggregate probability-weighted exposure of $95M-$114M (22%-27% of purchase price) [Risk Aggregation Report]. The target closing date is Q2 2025 (March-June range) [Fact #T.3], though the Orange County facility's regulatory status may extend the timeline to Q3 2025 if CHOW approval is delayed.

### C. Risk Categories

#### 1. Regulatory Compliance Risk (Section IV.A)
**Total Weighted Exposure:** $22.9M-$24.6M (after correlation adjustments)
**Escrow Recommended:** $10M

**Key Drivers:**
- **Orange County SFF Termination Risk** (CRITICAL): The Orange County Care Center was designated a Special Focus Facility candidate in September 2024 [Fact #D.10], with a 2-star overall rating [Fact #F.10]. A critical CMS survey is expected March 15-30, 2025 [Fact #D.2], approximately 60 days post-closing. If designated full SFF, CMS may deny CHOW approval or terminate the Medicare agreement, resulting in loss of $24.6M annual federal revenue (88% of facility's $28M revenue) [Facts #F.8, F.9]. See **Section IV.A.B.1** for detailed analysis.

- **DPNA Recurrence Risk** (HIGH): Orange County currently has Directed Plan of Correction and DPNA restrictions, having lost $990K in FY2024 [Fact #R.7]. As an SFF candidate, enhanced survey frequency (every 6 months) increases DPNA recurrence probability to 50-60% [Fact #R.8], with potential $1.44M-$2.88M revenue loss. See **Section IV.A.B.2**.

- **Resident Trust Fund Remediation** (HIGH): California requires a $5.2M surety bond for the 3 California facilities (1/12 of $62.4M California annual revenue) [Fact #R.12]. Current bond is only $300K [Fact #R.11], creating a $4.9M shortfall. Additionally, $72K in unallocated resident interest must be distributed [Fact #R.13]. See **Section IV.A.B.5**.

- **POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT - CMS Staffing Rule Repeal**: The federal CMS staffing rule (89 Fed. Reg. 40568, May 2024) was **REPEALED in January 2025** via the Congressional Review Act [Fact #D.8]. Only California AB 1502 state mandate applies, requiring $580K annually for 13 CNAs at California facilities [Fact #R.1]. This represents **$3.72M annual savings** versus the original $4.3M federal compliance estimate. See **Section IV.A.B.3** and **Section IV.E.B.4**.

#### 2. Litigation and FCA Risk (Sections IV.B, IV.D)
**Total Weighted Exposure:** $9M-$15.2M (FCA) + $22.7M-$28.9M (Insurance)
**Escrow Recommended:** $8M (FCA) + $8M (Insurance underinsurance)

**Key Drivers:**
- **Martinez Qui Tam Action** (HIGH): Dr. Elena Martinez, former Medical Director at the Orange County facility, filed a qui tam complaint in May 2023 (unsealed December 2024) [Facts #L.1, #D.4, #D.5] alleging: (1) therapy minute upcoding under RUG-IV and PDPM systems; (2) billing for medically unnecessary skilled nursing services; and (3) Anti-Kickback Statute violations related to Dr. Richard Johnson's medical director arrangement ($180K annually, $15K/month) [Fact #L.6]. Maximum statutory exposure is $58.7M-$77.2M (treble damages plus penalties) [Fact #L.2], but settlement is expected at $8M-$15M (95% settlement probability if DOJ intervenes) [Fact #L.3]. DOJ intervention decision expected Q1-Q2 2025 [Fact #D.3]. See **Section IV.B.B.1**.

- **Corporate Integrity Agreement** (HIGH): If FCA settles, 75% probability of 5-year CIA with OIG [Fact #L.4]. CIA compliance costs $3.5M-$6M NPV (compliance officer, IRO audits, training, monitoring). Buyer typically assumes CIA for operational control; recommend $4M purchase price credit. See **Section IV.B.B.2**.

- **Martinez Wrongful Termination** (MEDIUM): Dr. Martinez was terminated December 2022 [Fact #D.6], 5 months before filing the qui tam. FCA anti-retaliation claim (31 USC Section 3730(h)) has 40-50% success probability [Fact #L.5], with $680K-$1.4M exposure (double back pay plus attorney fees). See **Section IV.B.B.3**.

- **D&O Prior Knowledge Exclusion** (HIGH): D&O policy ($10M limit) [Fact #I.1] likely contains prior knowledge exclusion. Martinez complaint alleges internal audit March 2020 and Board discussion June 2020 identified Medicare billing concerns [Fact #I.11]. If D&O policy incepted after June 2020 (70% probability), coverage denial is likely, leaving FCA settlement uninsured. **CRITICAL ACTION: Verify D&O policy inception date within 48 hours of data room access.** See **Section IV.D.B.2**.

#### 3. Commercial and Operational Risk (Sections IV.C, IV.E)
**Total Weighted Exposure:** $13.5M-$15.1M (one-time) + $23.93M annually (ongoing)
**Escrow Recommended:** $2M (employment) + conditional closing provisions (CHOW)

**Key Drivers:**
- **CHOW Approval Delay** (HIGH): Orange County SFF candidate status creates 40-50% probability of CHOW approval delay or conditional approval. CMS may condition approval on demonstrated quality improvement or impose enhanced monitoring. Transaction structure should include conditional closing provision allowing Orange County exclusion with $28M-$30M price reduction if CHOW delayed >90 days. See **Section IV.C.B.1**.

- **Medical Director FMV Excess Compensation** (HIGH): Dr. Johnson's $180K annual compensation (42% of Medicare referrals, $8.1M referral revenue over 3 years) [Facts #L.6, L.7, L.8] exceeds fair market value benchmarks ($60K-$90K for part-time SNF medical director). If minimal duties proven, AKS violation probability is 65-75% [Fact #L.6]. Similar arrangements suspected at 11 other facilities. Recommend independent FMV valuation and prospective remediation. See **Section IV.C.B.2**.

- **High Staff Turnover** (HIGH): Current turnover rates significantly exceed national averages: CNAs 85% vs. 65% national, LPNs 55% vs. 45% national, RNs 40% vs. 35% national [Facts #E.4, E.5, E.6]. This generates $12M annual cost ($2.5M recruitment plus $9.5M agency premium) [Fact #E.10], representing 23% of EBITDA. See **Section IV.E.B.1**.

- **Retention Strategy Investment** (HIGH): Sustainable operations require $16.45M annual retention investment (wage increases, benefit enhancements, career development) [Fact #C.4], offset by $5.1M savings from reduced turnover, yielding $11.35M net annual cost [Fact #C.5]. This investment is required for CMS Five Star improvement and long-term operational viability. See **Section IV.E.B.2**.

- **California Meal/Rest Break Violations** (HIGH): Historical exposure $600K (3-year look-back) plus $200K annual ongoing exposure if not remediated [Facts #C.2, C.3]. 60% class action probability given pattern across 3 California facilities. See **Section IV.E.B.5**.

#### 4. Compliance, Privacy, and Tax Risk (Sections IV.F, IV.G)
**Total Weighted Exposure:** $64K-$446K (privacy) + $609K (state transaction taxes)
**Escrow Recommended:** $100K (privacy)

**Key Drivers:**
- **HIPAA Security Rule Gaps** (HIGH): Potential risk assessment outdated (38% probability) and unencrypted mobile devices (15% probability), with combined exposure $250K-$1.1M. OCR enforcement pattern analysis yields $56.5K-$393K weighted exposure. Remediation cost $160K-$225K is cost-effective. See **Section IV.F.B.1**.

- **Business Associate Agreement Gaps** (HIGH): 35% probability of missing BAAs with EMR vendor, cloud storage, or therapy providers. OCR penalty exposure $20K-$150K. Recommend BAA inventory audit within 30 days of data room access. See **Section IV.F.B.2**.

- **State Transaction Taxes** (HIGH): Arizona TPT ($967.5K) plus California sales tax ($573.75K) total $1.54M gross [Fact #X.6]. Net buyer cost $609K after 50% seller reimbursement and California medical device exemptions [Fact #X.7]. See **Section IV.G.B.3**.

- **Section 338(h)(10) Election Analysis**: The election provides $50.77M NPV benefit to buyer (10-year tax savings) [Fact #X.1], but requires $37M-$50M purchase price increase to compensate seller for $87M-$99M incremental tax burden [Facts #X.2, X.3]. Net buyer benefit is only $0.77M-$13.77M [Fact #X.4]. Election is **marginally beneficial** and should be negotiated based on overall deal economics. See **Section IV.G.B.1**.

## III. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

This section identifies critical interconnections where risks in one domain trigger or amplify risks in another. These cross-domain patterns represent the primary value-add of this executive summary.

### Pattern 1: Orange County SFF Status Creates Cascading Multi-Domain Risk

**Primary Finding:** Orange County Care Center's SFF candidate designation [Fact #F.11] creates interconnected risks across four sections.

**Cross-Domain Cascade:**

| Domain | Section | Impact | Financial Consequence |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **CMS Regulatory** | IV.A | SFF designation triggers enhanced surveys (every 6 months), DPNA recurrence, potential Medicare termination | $24.6M revenue at risk |
| **Commercial/CHOW** | IV.C | SFF status delays or conditions CHOW approval; may require facility exclusion from transaction | $28M-$30M price reduction if excluded |
| **Employment/WARN** | IV.E | If Medicare termination triggers facility closure, WARN Act applies to 350 employees [Fact #E.11] | $5.2M WARN liability [Fact #C.1] |
| **FCA Litigation** | IV.B | Martinez qui tam cites Orange County quality deficiencies; SFF designation may corroborate whistleblower allegations | Strengthens DOJ intervention case |

**Legal Doctrine:** Medicare provider agreement termination (42 C.F.R. Section 489.52) automatically terminates state Medicaid participation and triggers contractual termination of Medicare Advantage and Medicaid MCO agreements.

**Aggregate Cross-Domain Exposure:** $24.6M + $5.2M WARN = $29.8M direct; $30M price reduction if facility excluded. **Total potential impact: $30M-$60M.**

**Recommended Mitigation:** Structure transaction with **Orange County conditional closing provision** (see Section IV.C.E.2):
- Buyer option to exclude facility if CMS denies CHOW or designates full SFF
- Price reduction: $28M-$30M (reflecting lost revenue and operational restructuring)
- Alternatively, implement $2.75M annual quality improvement plan pre-closing to reduce termination probability from 60% to 35% [Fact #R.6]

### Pattern 2: FCA Litigation Creates Insurance Coverage Gap and Tax Implications

**Primary Finding:** The Martinez qui tam [Fact #L.1] creates interconnected risks across insurance, tax, and employment domains.

**Cross-Domain Cascade:**

| Domain | Section | Impact | Financial Consequence |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **Insurance (D&O)** | IV.D | D&O prior knowledge exclusion (Board discussion June 2020) likely bars coverage for FCA settlement | $10M D&O limit unavailable; $7.75M uninsured exposure |
| **Tax** | IV.G | FCA settlement must be structured for tax optimization: 60% restitution (deductible under IRC Section 162(f)) / 40% penalties (non-deductible) | $2.77M tax savings if properly allocated [Fact #X.5] |
| **Employment** | IV.E | Martinez wrongful termination claim (FCA anti-retaliation) compounds litigation exposure; EPL policy excludes punitive damages | $680K-$1.4M additional exposure; punitive damages ($1M-$3M) uninsured |
| **Commercial** | IV.C | Dr. Johnson medical director arrangement creates AKS exposure; FMV remediation required for all 12 medical director contracts | $3M-$3.6M excess compensation disgorgement risk |

**Legal Doctrine:** Affordable Care Act amended FCA to provide that claims "resulting from" an AKS violation constitute false claims *per se* (42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b(g)), eliminating need to prove separate FCA scienter for kickback-tainted claims.

**Aggregate Cross-Domain Exposure:** $8M-$15M FCA settlement + $7.75M uninsured (D&O denial) + $3M-$3.6M medical director FMV + $868K Martinez wrongful termination = **$19.6M-$27.2M total FCA-related exposure.**

**Recommended Mitigation:**
1. **Pre-closing:** Verify D&O policy inception date; if post-June 2020, negotiate seller indemnification for uninsured FCA exposure
2. **Settlement structure:** Require settlement agreement to allocate 60% to restitution (deductible) to maximize $2.77M tax benefit
3. **Medical directors:** Conduct independent FMV valuation of all 12 medical director contracts; remediate compensation prospectively

### Pattern 3: Staffing Deficiencies Create Regulatory, Employment, and Insurance Risks

**Primary Finding:** Sunset's staffing shortfall (current 3.45 PPD vs. California AB 1502 minimum 3.5 PPD) [Fact #E.3] and high turnover (85% CNA, 55% LPN, 40% RN) [Facts #E.4, E.5, E.6] create interconnected risks.

**Cross-Domain Cascade:**

| Domain | Section | Impact | Financial Consequence |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **CMS Regulatory** | IV.A | Staffing shortfall contributes to CMS quality deficiencies; understaffing correlated with immediate jeopardy citations | $580K annual compliance cost for CA facilities [Fact #R.1] |
| **Employment** | IV.E | High turnover creates $12M annual cost; requires $11.35M retention investment to stabilize workforce | $11.35M net annual cost [Fact #C.5] |
| **Insurance** | IV.D | Staffing-related care failures (pressure ulcers, falls, medication errors) generate professional liability claims | $4M-$12M COVID-19 wrongful death exposure from inadequate infection control staffing |
| **Commercial** | IV.C | CMS Five Star staffing rating (current 2.6 stars) [Fact #F.12] affects Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates and managed care contract terms | 5-15% rate differential for 3+ star vs. below-3-star facilities |

**Legal Doctrine:** California AB 1502 (Cal. Health & Safety Code Sections 1276.5, 1276.65) [Fact #R.3] mandates 3.5 PPD staffing minimum with 75% citation probability for non-compliance [CDPH enforcement pattern].

**POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT:** Federal CMS staffing rule REPEALED January 2025. Original estimate of $4.3M annual compliance cost reduced to **$580K** (California facilities only), representing **$3.72M annual savings** [Fact #R.1].

**Aggregate Cross-Domain Exposure:** $580K (staffing compliance) + $11.35M (retention strategy) = **$11.93M annual ongoing cost** (operational, not escrow-able).

**Recommended Mitigation:**
1. Implement retention strategy ($16.45M investment) to reduce turnover from 44% to 28%
2. Hire 13 CNAs for California facilities within 90 days post-closing
3. Normalize EBITDA by $11.93M annually for deal valuation

### Pattern 4: Insurance Underinsurance Compounds All Liability Exposures

**Primary Finding:** Sunset's insurance program is materially inadequate across all coverage lines, creating uninsured exposure for multiple identified risks.

**Cross-Domain Cascade:**

| Coverage | Current Limit | Industry Benchmark | Shortfall | Uninsured Exposure |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| D&O | $10M [Fact #I.1] | $25M-$50M | 60%-80% | FCA settlement ($8M-$15M) partially/fully uninsured |
| Professional Liability | $1M/$3M [Fact #I.2] | $2M/$6M | 50% | COVID-19 wrongful deaths ($4M-$12M) if exclusion applies |
| EPL | $2M [Fact #I.3] | $5M-$10M | 60%-80% | Martinez punitive damages ($1M-$3M) excluded |
| Umbrella | $10M [Fact #I.5] | $25M-$50M | 60%-80% | Catastrophic claims exceed available coverage |

**Aggregate Uninsured Exposure:** $60M-$72M worst-case [Fact #I.7]; $18.7M probability-weighted [Risk Aggregation Report].

**Critical Coverage Gaps:**
1. **D&O Prior Knowledge Exclusion:** 70% probability coverage denied for FCA claims if policy incepted post-June 2020
2. **Communicable Disease Exclusion:** 60% probability professional liability excludes COVID-19 wrongful death claims
3. **Punitive Damages Exclusion:** EPL universally excludes punitive damages; whistleblower retaliation claims may include punitive component

**Recommended Mitigation:**
1. **Pre-closing:** Verify D&O inception date and professional liability exclusions
2. **Tail coverage:** Require seller to purchase 6-year ERP ($1.33M-$1.73M) [Fact #I.8], 75% seller-funded
3. **Price adjustment:** $12M-$15M reduction for material underinsurance
4. **Post-closing:** Enhance coverage limits ($510K-$730K annually for incremental $15M-$25M limits)

### Pattern 5: Tax Structure Election Creates Marginal Benefit with Negotiation Complexity

**Primary Finding:** Section 338(h)(10) election provides tax benefits but requires purchase price increase to compensate seller.

**Cross-Domain Analysis:**

| Component | Amount | Impact |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Buyer Tax Benefit (10-year NPV) | $50.77M [Fact #X.1] | Step-up in asset basis creates $7.57M annual depreciation/amortization deductions |
| Seller Incremental Tax | $87M-$99M [Fact #X.2] | Deemed asset sale triggers ordinary income recognition on recaptured depreciation |
| Required Purchase Price Increase | $37M-$50M [Fact #X.3] | 40-55% of seller incremental tax per market practice |
| **Net Buyer Benefit** | **$0.77M-$13.77M** [Fact #X.4] | Marginal benefit after compensating seller |

**Recommendation:** Election is **marginally beneficial** with significant negotiation complexity. Proceed with election only if:
1. Seller accepts 40% allocation (lower end of market range), yielding $13.77M net buyer benefit
2. Overall deal economics support $37M-$50M price increase within valuation parameters
3. Integration planning confirms stepped-up basis allocation maximizes depreciation timing

---

## IV. DEAL-BLOCKING ISSUES ASSESSMENT

### Issue 1: Orange County Special Focus Facility Risk

**Status:** SFF candidate designated September 2024 [Fact #D.10]; critical March 2025 survey 60 days post-closing [Fact #D.2]

**Deal Impact:** **MITIGATABLE** via conditional closing provision

**Analysis:** Orange County Care Center represents $28M annual revenue (9.8% of total) [Fact #F.8] with 88% ($24.6M) derived from Medicare and Medicaid [Fact #F.9]. If designated full SFF:
- CMS may deny CHOW approval (40-50% probability)
- CMS may terminate Medicare agreement (60% probability if immediate jeopardy recurs) [Fact #R.5]
- Transaction cannot close as structured if CMS denies CHOW for Orange County

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Conditional Closing Provision (RECOMMENDED):** Buyer option to exclude Orange County with $28M-$30M price reduction if:
   - CMS denies or conditions CHOW approval beyond 90 days post-initial application
   - Orange County elevated to full SFF designation pre-closing
   - CMS issues termination letter for Medicare agreement

2. **Pre-Closing Remediation (SECONDARY):** Seller implements $2.75M annual quality improvement plan [Fact #R.6]:
   - Enhanced staffing ratios (RN 24/7 coverage)
   - Quality consultant engagement
   - Infection control protocols
   - Survey preparation support
   - Reduces termination probability from 60% to 35%

**Section Reference:** See **Section IV.A.B.1** and **Section IV.C.E.2** for detailed analysis and draft contract provisions.

### Issue 2: FCA Qui Tam with DOJ Intervention Pending

**Status:** Martinez qui tam filed May 2023, unsealed December 2024 [Facts #D.4, D.5]; DOJ intervention decision expected Q1-Q2 2025 [Fact #D.3]

**Deal Impact:** **NOT BLOCKING** but requires significant escrow and indemnification

**Analysis:** DOJ intervention probability is 70-80% based on: (1) relator insider access (former Medical Director), (2) kickback allegations (Dr. Johnson), (3) documentary evidence (internal emails regarding therapy quotas), and (4) active investigation since May 2023. However:
- 95% of DOJ-intervened FCA cases settle [DOJ Civil Fraud Statistics]
- Settlement range $8M-$15M based on comparable SNF precedents [Fact #L.3]
- Transaction can proceed with appropriate escrow and indemnification structure

**Note:** Research-review-analyst flagged 75% DOJ intervention estimate as potentially overstated; industry-wide DOJ intervention rate is 25-35%. If actual rate is 30%, weighted FCA exposure drops from $9.1M to $3.4M.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **FCA Escrow:** $12M held at closing, released upon:
   - DOJ declination: 58% released immediately, 42% held for relator-only prosecution
   - Settlement at or below $10M: Difference released to seller
   - 24 months post-closing with no DOJ action: Full release

2. **Seller Special Indemnification:** Uncapped indemnification for FCA settlement amounts exceeding escrow; survival period until final resolution

3. **CIA Transition:** Buyer assumes CIA management post-closing; $4M purchase price credit for 5-year compliance burden

**Section Reference:** See **Section IV.B.E.1** for detailed escrow structure and draft contract provisions.

### Issue 3: Insurance Coverage Adequacy

**Status:** Material underinsurance identified across all coverage lines [Fact #I.6]

**Deal Impact:** **NOT BLOCKING** but requires price adjustment and enhanced escrow

**Analysis:** Total theoretical insurance coverage is $29M [Fact #I.6], but exclusions (prior knowledge, communicable disease, punitive damages) reduce actual available coverage to $15M-$20M. Worst-case uninsured exposure is $60M-$72M [Fact #I.7]. Transaction can proceed with:
- Verification of key policy terms (D&O inception date, professional liability exclusions)
- Price adjustment for underinsurance risk
- Enhanced escrow for identified coverage gaps

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. **Due Diligence (Within 48 Hours):**
   - Verify D&O policy inception date
   - Confirm professional liability communicable disease exclusion scope
   - Review umbrella "follow form" provisions

2. **Price Adjustment:** $12M-$15M reduction for material underinsurance

3. **Tail Coverage:** Seller purchases 6-year ERP at closing ($997K-$1.3M seller cost)

4. **Insurance Escrow:** $8M within general indemnity escrow for uninsured claims

**Section Reference:** See **Section IV.D.E.1** for detailed insurance schedule and draft representations.

---

## V. RECOMMENDED TRANSACTION ADJUSTMENTS

### A. Purchase Price Adjustment

**Recommended Reduction:** $20M-$28M
**Adjusted Purchase Price:** $397M-$405M (from $425M nominal)

**Methodology:** 30-40% seller allocation of $95M-$114M weighted exposure, consistent with healthcare M&A market practice for operational risks vs. contingent liabilities.

| Component | Amount | Basis |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Insurance underinsurance adjustment | $12M-$15M | 65%-80% of $18.7M expected uninsured loss |
| FCA/CIA burden shift to buyer | $4M | NPV of 5-year CIA compliance assumed by buyer |
| Regulatory compliance normalization | $4M-$9M | 1-year impact of ongoing compliance costs vs. seller representations |
| **Total Recommended Adjustment** | **$20M-$28M** | 4.7%-6.6% of purchase price |

**Transaction Multiple Analysis:**
- Original multiple: 8.2x ($425M / $52M EBITDA) [Risk Aggregation Report]
- Adjusted multiple: 7.6x-7.8x ($397M-$405M / $52M EBITDA)
- Market range for SNF acquisitions: 7.0x-9.0x [within acceptable range]

### B. Escrow Structure

**Total Escrow:** $25M (5.9% of purchase price) [Fact #A.4]

| Escrow Category | Amount | Duration | Coverage | Release Conditions |
|-----------------|--------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Regulatory Escrow** | $10M | 24 months | Orange County SFF ($8.6M mitigated), DPNA ($792K-$1.58M), CMPs ($300K-$642K), LSC capital ($341K), trust funds ($5.27M - separate closing condition) | 50% at 12 months if no SFF designation; 50% at 24 months if 3+ stars maintained |
| **General Indemnity Escrow** | $15M | 24 months | FCA settlement (up to $15M), Martinez wrongful termination ($306K-$630K), medical director FMV ($1.65M-$1.98M), WARN Act ($650K), CA meal/rest break ($360K), HIPAA/BAA ($64K-$446K), resident rights litigation ($500K-$2M) | 33% at 12 months if no material claims; 33% at 18 months if FCA settles below $10M; 34% at 24 months |

**Escrow Adequacy:**
- Coverage ratio: 24.6% ($25M / $101.5M weighted exposure median)
- Largest single exposure coverage: 102% ($25M / $24.6M Orange County SFF)
- Interpretation: Escrow covers approximately 25% of expected losses; buyer retains 75% via indemnity provisions beyond escrow

### C. Conditional Closing Provisions

#### 1. Orange County Facility Exclusion Option

**Trigger Conditions:**
- CMS denies CHOW approval for Orange County facility
- CMS conditions CHOW approval beyond 90 days from initial application
- Orange County elevated to full SFF designation pre-closing
- CMS issues Medicare termination letter

**Economic Adjustment:**
- Purchase price reduction: $28M-$30M (reflecting $28M annual revenue and operational restructuring costs)
- Employee assumption: Silver Oak not obligated to offer employment to Orange County staff if excluded
- Lease/contract assignment: Exclude Orange County from all third-party consents and assignments

**Section Reference:** See **Section IV.C.E.2** for draft contract provision language.

#### 2. DOJ Intervention Response

**Pre-Closing DOJ Intervention:**
If DOJ files intervention notice before closing:
- Parties negotiate in good faith regarding FCA escrow increase (up to $15M additional)
- If parties cannot agree within 30 days, buyer may terminate with deposit return
- Seller may elect to settle FCA pre-closing (buyer consent required for settlement terms)

**Post-Closing DOJ Intervention:**
- Buyer controls defense and settlement (with seller consultation rights)
- Seller indemnification for settlement amounts exceeding escrow
- CIA assumption provisions per Section IV.B.E.2

### D. Representation and Warranty Enhancements

## VI. MATERIAL FINDINGS BY DOMAIN

### A. CMS Regulatory Compliance & Quality Ratings (Section IV.A)

**Summary:** Sunset's portfolio presents regulatory risk concentrated in the Orange County facility, which is designated an SFF candidate with below-average quality metrics. The federal CMS staffing rule repeal provides material positive development, reducing compliance costs by $3.72M annually.

**Key Findings:**

| # | Finding | Severity | Weighted Exposure | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Orange County SFF Medicare Termination | CRITICAL | $14.76M (unmitigated), $8.61M (mitigated) | $2.75M annual quality improvement plan; conditional closing provision |
| 2 | DPNA Recurrence (Orange County) | HIGH | $792K-$1.58M | Enhanced survey preparation; infection control protocols |
| 3 | CMP Escalation (Third Immediate Jeopardy) | HIGH | $300K-$642K | SFF improvement plan addresses root causes |
| 4 | Resident Trust Fund Remediation | HIGH | $5.27M | Closing condition: $5.2M surety bond + $72K interest distribution |
| 5 | Life Safety Code Capital | HIGH | $341K | Pre-closing LSC assessments or escrow |
| 6 | CMS Staffing (CA AB 1502 only) | HIGH | $580K/year | Hire 13 CNAs within 90 days post-closing |

**Cross-Domain Impacts:**
- Employment (WARN Act if Orange County closes)
- Commercial Contracts (CHOW approval delay)
- Insurance (CMPs uninsured; professional liability tail)
- FCA Litigation (SFF designation corroborates Martinez allegations)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Implement conditional closing provision for Orange County
2. Verify California surety bond compliance as closing condition
3. Budget $580K annually for California staffing compliance (not $4.3M per original estimates)

### B. False Claims Act Litigation (Section IV.B)

**Summary:** The Martinez qui tam presents material but manageable litigation risk. Settlement is highly probable (95% if DOJ intervenes), with expected range of $8M-$15M. Corporate Integrity Agreement is likely (75% probability), requiring 5-year compliance program.

**Key Findings:**

| # | Finding | Severity | Weighted Exposure | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Martinez FCA Settlement | HIGH | $9.1M (probability-weighted) | $12M escrow; seller special indemnification |
| 2 | Corporate Integrity Agreement (5-year) | HIGH | $2.6M-$4.5M | $4M purchase price credit; buyer assumes CIA management |
| 3 | Martinez Wrongful Termination | MEDIUM | $306K-$630K | Separate settlement $500K-$750K with mutual release |
| 4 | OIG Exclusion Risk | LOW | $4M-$8M (5-10% probability) | Settlement compliance; first-offender mitigation |

**Cross-Domain Impacts:**
- Insurance (D&O prior knowledge exclusion)
- Tax (settlement allocation for deductibility)
- Commercial Contracts (Dr. Johnson AKS remediation)
- Employment (whistleblower protection policies)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Establish $12M FCA escrow with structured release schedule
2. Structure settlement to allocate 60% to restitution (deductible)
3. Negotiate $4M purchase price credit for CIA assumption
4. Implement whistleblower protection training post-closing

### C. Commercial Contracts & Change of Ownership (Section IV.C)

**Summary:** CHOW approval risk is concentrated in Orange County due to SFF status. Medical director arrangements across all 12 facilities require FMV validation. Material contracts (managed care, pharmacy, staffing) contain standard change-of-control provisions.

**Key Findings:**

| # | Finding | Severity | Weighted Exposure | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | CHOW Approval Delay (Orange County) | HIGH | $28M-$30M (if excluded) | Conditional closing provision |
| 2 | Medical Director FMV Excess | HIGH | $1.65M-$1.98M | Independent FMV valuation; prospective remediation |
| 3 | Managed Care Contract Assignments | MEDIUM | Operational continuity | 60-day notice; CHOW-contingent consents |
| 4 | Pharmacy/Lab Contract Terms | LOW | $0 (normal course) | Standard assignment provisions |

**Cross-Domain Impacts:**
- CMS Regulatory (CHOW tied to Medicare certification)
- FCA Litigation (Dr. Johnson AKS violations)
- Privacy (EMR vendor BAA assignment)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Structure conditional closing provision for Orange County
2. Obtain independent FMV opinions for all 12 medical director arrangements
3. Begin managed care consent process 90 days pre-closing

### D. Insurance Coverage & Risk Transfer (Section IV.D)

**Summary:** Sunset's insurance program is materially inadequate, with coverage limits 50%-80% below industry benchmarks. D&O prior knowledge exclusion and professional liability communicable disease exclusion create significant coverage gaps for identified risks.

**Key Findings:**

| # | Finding | Severity | Weighted Exposure | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Material Underinsurance (Worst-Case) | CRITICAL | $15M-$18M | $12M-$15M price adjustment; post-closing enhancements |
| 2 | D&O Prior Knowledge Exclusion | HIGH | $4.99M | Verify inception date; seller indemnification if post-June 2020 |
| 3 | COVID-19 Wrongful Deaths (Exclusion) | HIGH | $2.4M-$7.2M | Verify exclusion scope; $6M escrow if excluded |
| 4 | Tail Coverage (6-year ERP) | HIGH | $1.15M (seller 75%) | Condition precedent to closing |

**Cross-Domain Impacts:**
- FCA Litigation (D&O coverage for settlement)
- Employment (EPL coverage for Martinez; punitive damages excluded)
- CMS Regulatory (CMPs uninsured under all policies)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Verify D&O policy inception date within 48 hours
2. Confirm professional liability exclusion scope
3. Require tail coverage purchase as closing condition
4. Adjust purchase price $12M-$15M for underinsurance

### E. Employment & Labor Relations (Section IV.E)

**Summary:** High turnover (44% overall, 85% CNA) creates significant operational cost ($12M annually) and quality risk. California meal/rest break compliance requires remediation. Federal CMS staffing rule repeal reduces compliance burden to California facilities only.

**Key Findings:**

| # | Finding | Severity | Weighted Exposure | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | High Staff Turnover | HIGH | $12M/year (current) | Retention strategy reduces to $11.35M net |
| 2 | Retention Strategy Investment | HIGH | $11.35M/year (net) | Budget for EBITDA normalization |
| 3 | WARN Act (Orange County) | HIGH | $650K (12.5% probability) | Conditional on SFF termination |
| 4 | CA Meal/Rest Break (Historical) | HIGH | $360K | Seller indemnification |
| 5 | CA Meal/Rest Break (Ongoing) | HIGH | $120K/year | Compliance system implementation |

**Cross-Domain Impacts:**
- CMS Regulatory (staffing compliance affects survey outcomes)
- Insurance (workers' compensation claims from understaffing)
- Commercial Contracts (managed care quality metrics)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Implement retention strategy post-closing ($16.45M investment)
2. Budget $11.35M annual net cost in normalized EBITDA
3. Hire 13 CNAs for California facilities within 90 days
4. Implement meal/rest break compliance systems

### F. Privacy & HIPAA Compliance (Section IV.F)

**Summary:** Privacy risk is relatively low, with weighted exposure under $500K. Potential gaps in risk assessment currency and BAA inventory require verification but are readily remediable.

**Key Findings:**

| # | Finding | Severity | Weighted Exposure | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | HIPAA Security Rule Gaps | HIGH | $56.5K-$393K | Risk assessment update; device encryption |
| 2 | Business Associate Agreement Gaps | HIGH | $7K-$52.5K | BAA inventory audit; obtain missing agreements |

**Cross-Domain Impacts:**
- Insurance (cyber liability coverage for breach notification)
- Commercial Contracts (EMR vendor BAA assignment)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Verify risk assessment currency within 30 days
2. Conduct BAA inventory audit
3. Encrypt all mobile devices within 90 days post-closing
4. Budget $160K-$225K for remediation

### G. Tax Structure & Transaction Planning (Section IV.G)

**Summary:** Section 338(h)(10) election provides marginal net benefit ($0.77M-$13.77M) after compensating seller for incremental tax burden. State transaction taxes total $609K net after seller reimbursement. FCA settlement allocation for tax optimization provides $2.77M deduction benefit.

**Key Findings:**

| # | Finding | Severity | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Section 338(h)(10) Election | MEDIUM | $0.77M-$13.77M net benefit | Negotiate 40% seller allocation |
| 2 | FCA Settlement Tax Allocation | HIGH | $2.77M tax savings | Structure 60% restitution / 40% penalties |
| 3 | State Transaction Taxes | HIGH | $609K net | 50% seller reimbursement + exemptions |

**Cross-Domain Impacts:**
- FCA Litigation (settlement structure affects deductibility)
- Commercial Contracts (asset vs. stock purchase implications)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Proceed with 338(h)(10) election only if seller accepts 40% allocation
2. Structure FCA settlement for 60% restitution allocation
3. File state tax exemption applications for medical equipment

## VII. SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### Base Case (60% Probability)

**Assumptions:**
- FCA settles at midpoint ($11.5M) with DOJ intervention
- Orange County achieves quality improvement (SFF termination probability 35%)
- D&O policy provides partial coverage (30% recovery)
- Communicable disease exclusion applies (60% probability)
- Retention strategy implemented ($11.35M annually)

**Total Weighted Exposure:** $95M-$114M (median $104.5M)

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Purchase price reduction: $20M-$28M
- Total escrow: $25M
- Adjusted price: $397M-$405M

### Downside Case (30% Probability)

**Assumptions:**
- FCA settles at high end ($15M) with CIA ($6M)
- Orange County designated full SFF (60% termination probability)
- D&O policy denies coverage (prior knowledge exclusion applies)
- All COVID-19 wrongful death claims filed ($12M)
- Additional employment/compliance issues discovered

**Total Weighted Exposure:** $110M-$135M

**Recommended Adjustments:**
- Purchase price reduction: $35M-$45M
- Total escrow: $35M
- Adjusted price: $380M-$390M

### Severe Downside Case (10% Probability)

**Assumptions:**
- FCA proceeds to trial with adverse verdict ($58.7M-$77.2M)
- Orange County Medicare agreement terminated ($24.6M revenue loss)
- WARN Act liability triggered ($5.2M)
- CIA imposed with enhanced monitoring ($6M)
- Multiple insurance coverage denials ($72M uninsured)

**Total Weighted Exposure:** $150M-$180M

**Recommended Action:** If severe downside factors crystallize pre-closing, recommend transaction restructuring or termination. Single facility (Orange County) concentration of 40%+ of severe downside exposure justifies conditional closing provision.

---

## VIII. BOARD RECOMMENDATION

### Transaction Recommendation

**Status:** **PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS**

**Rationale:**

The acquisition of Sunset Senior Living Group presents attractive strategic value within an acceptable risk profile, provided the recommended transaction adjustments are implemented. The $425M nominal purchase price should be reduced by $20M-$28M to account for identified legal exposures, with $25M held in escrow to secure seller indemnification obligations.

The probability-weighted exposure of $95M-$114M (22%-27% of purchase price) is material but typical for skilled nursing facility acquisitions with regulatory complexity. The risk profile is concentrated in three areas: (1) Orange County SFF status (30% of weighted exposure), (2) FCA litigation (15% of weighted exposure), and (3) insurance underinsurance (20% of weighted exposure). Each of these risks is structurally mitigatable through conditional closing provisions, escrow, and seller indemnification.

The federal CMS staffing rule repeal represents a significant positive development, reducing annual compliance costs by $3.72M versus original projections. This improvement partially offsets the ongoing operational costs ($11.35M annually) required for sustainable workforce retention.

The FCA qui tam, while significant, is expected to settle within the $8M-$15M range based on comparable SNF precedents. The 95% settlement probability and available escrow structure provide adequate protection against catastrophic FCA exposure.

### Required Conditions for Closing

1. **Orange County Conditional Closing Provision:** Transaction documents must include buyer option to exclude Orange County facility with $28M-$30M price reduction if:
   - CMS denies or conditions CHOW approval
   - Orange County designated full SFF pre-closing
   - CMS issues Medicare termination letter

2. **California Surety Bond:** Seller must obtain $5.2M surety bond for California facilities as closing condition, or provide equivalent cash collateral.

3. **Tail Coverage Purchase:** Seller must purchase 6-year extended reporting period coverage ($1.33M-$1.73M) with proof of payment 5 business days prior to closing.

4. **D&O Policy Verification:** Seller must disclose D&O policy inception date and provide carrier coverage position letter within 48 hours of data room access. If inception post-June 2020, additional seller indemnification required for uninsured FCA exposure.

5. **Medical Director FMV Validation:** Seller must provide independent FMV opinions for all 12 medical director arrangements, or representations sufficient to support AKS compliance.

### Timeline Considerations

| Milestone | Target Date | Risk Level | Dependency |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Data room access | Week 1 | LOW | Seller cooperation |
| D&O/insurance verification | Week 1 | HIGH | Coverage determination |
| Due diligence completion | Week 8 | MEDIUM | Document review |
| DOJ intervention decision | Q1-Q2 2025 | HIGH | Government process |
| Orange County CMS survey | March 15-30, 2025 | CRITICAL | CMS schedule |
| CHOW applications filed | Week 10 | MEDIUM | State agency timelines |
| Definitive agreement execution | Week 12 | MEDIUM | Negotiation |
| CHOW approvals received | March-May 2025 | HIGH | 90-120 day processing |
| **Target Closing** | **Q2 2025** | MEDIUM | All conditions satisfied |

**Critical Path Items:**
- Orange County CMS survey (March 2025) occurs approximately 60 days post-anticipated closing
- DOJ intervention decision may occur pre- or post-closing
- CHOW approval timeline (90-120 days) may extend closing to Q3 2025 if Orange County delays approval

### Post-Closing Integration Priorities (First 90 Days)

1. **Orange County Quality Improvement:** Implement $2.75M annual quality improvement plan immediately post-closing; engage survey preparation consultant; enhance staffing ratios to exceed minimum requirements.

2. **Retention Strategy Launch:** Implement wage increases and benefit enhancements within 30 days; establish career development programs within 60 days; target turnover reduction from 44% to 28% within 12 months.

3. **California Staffing Compliance:** Hire 13 CNAs for California facilities within 90 days to achieve AB 1502 3.5 PPD minimum; implement meal/rest break compliance systems.

4. **FCA Defense Coordination:** Engage FCA defense counsel; prepare settlement authorization parameters; coordinate with seller on defense strategy and cost allocation.

5. **Insurance Enhancement:** Obtain quotes for enhanced D&O ($25M), professional liability ($2M/$6M), and umbrella ($25M) coverage; bind enhanced coverage within 60 days post-closing.
