| **TOTAL** | 25 | 100% | — |

### Aggregate Exposure by Section

| Section | Weighted Exposure | % of Total | Escrow Recommended | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **IV.A: CMS Regulatory** | $22.9M-$24.6M | 22-24% | $10M | Orange County concentration risk |
| **IV.B: FCA Litigation** | $9M-$15.2M | 9-15% | $12M | DOJ intervention expected Q1-Q2 2025 |
| **IV.C: Commercial Contracts** | $13.5M-$15.1M | 13-15% | Conditional closing | CHOW delay mitigation via Orange County exclusion |
| **IV.D: Insurance Coverage** | $22.7M-$28.9M | 22-28% | $8M | Underinsurance + coverage gaps |
| **IV.E: Employment & Labor** | $13.5M-$15.1M (one-time) + $11.93M/yr | 13-15% + 11% annual | $2M | Retention strategy = ongoing operational cost |
| **IV.F: Privacy & HIPAA** | $64K-$446K | <1% | $100K | Low materiality |
| **IV.G: Tax Structure** | $609K net cost; $2.77M benefit opportunity | <1% / 3% benefit | N/A | Negotiation items, not escrow |
| **TOTAL** | **$95M-$114M** | **100%** | **$25M** | Median: $104.5M (24.6% of $425M purchase price) |

### Risk Concentration Analysis

**Top 5 Exposures (Weighted):**

1. Orange County SFF Medicare Termination: $14.76M (60% × $24.6M)
2. Material Insurance Underinsurance: $15M-$18M (25% × $60M-$72M)
3. Retention Strategy Net Annual Cost: $11.35M/year (100% × $11.35M)
4. FCA Settlement (DOJ Intervention): $9.1M (71.25% × $11.5M midpoint)
5. D&O Prior Knowledge Exclusion: $4.99M (70% × $7.13M uninsured portion)

**Risk Concentration Concern:** Orange County facility represents 30% of weighted exposure ($14.76M SFF + $11.07M-$22.14M CHOW delay = $25.83M-$36.9M). This single-facility concentration justifies conditional closing provision allowing exclusion with corresponding price reduction.

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

### Probability Basis Standards

All probability estimates include disclosed methodology:

- **Regulatory Precedent:** Based on CMS enforcement patterns, SFF designation history, CDPH citation rates
- **DOJ Statistics:** Based on DOJ Civil Fraud Statistics Reports 2020-2024
- **Case Law Standards:** Based on burden-shifting frameworks, prima facie case requirements
- **Industry Benchmarking:** Based on Aon, Marsh, Willis Towers Watson insurance market reports

- **Expert Judgment:** Disclosed where quantitative basis unavailable (Monte Carlo simulations, forensic analysis)

### Exposure Calculation Methods

All exposure estimates include valuation methodology:

- **EV (Expected Value):** Probability × Magnitude for contingent events
- **NPV (Net Present Value):** Discounted cash flow at 8% WACC for multi-year costs
- **DCF (Discounted Cash Flow):** Same as NPV, alternative terminology
- **Statutory Maximum:** Per-claim penalties × estimated claim count
- **Revenue at Risk:** Annual revenue × probability of loss
- **Settlement Range:** Based on comparable transaction precedents

### Mitigation Specificity

All mitigation recommendations include actionable specifics:

- **Escrow amounts:** Dollar amounts and survival periods
- **Closing conditions:** Specific triggers and economic adjustments
- **Indemnification:** Cap amounts and survival periods
- **Remediation timelines:** 30/60/90-day implementation deadlines
- **Contract provisions:** Draft language references in Section E.2 of each section report
