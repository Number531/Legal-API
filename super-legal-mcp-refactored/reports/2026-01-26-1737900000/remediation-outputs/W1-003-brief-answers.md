# III. BRIEF ANSWERS

1. **Probably Yes (60-70% probability unmitigated).** Because Orange County Care Center has SFF candidate designation with repeat immediate jeopardy citations for infection control and medication errors, and the March 2025 standard survey will likely result in full SFF designation under 42 C.F.R. § 488.404, Medicare provider agreement termination probability is 60-70% absent quality improvement investment. Mitigation through $2.75M annual quality improvement plan (expanded infection prevention program, additional clinical leadership, consultant support) can reduce termination probability to 35%, but investment must commence immediately. See Section IV.A.B.1.

2. **Probably Yes (71.25% weighted probability).** Because DOJ's 18-month investigation and Dr. Martinez's director-level credibility as relator support 70% intervention probability under qui tam precedent patterns, and DOJ intervention yields 95% settlement probability based on *United States ex rel.* precedents in healthcare fraud cases, settlement exposure of $8M-$15M is likely ($9.1M probability-weighted). Because False Claims Act statutory damages reach $58.7M-$77.2M (treble damages plus penalties), DOJ settlement authority under 28 C.F.R. § 0.45 supports negotiated resolution. Recommend $12M escrow (15-month survival). See Section IV.B.B.1.

3. **Probably Yes (40-50% probability).** Because SFF candidate facilities face enhanced scrutiny during CHOW review under CMS State Operations Manual § 7311, and California CDPH has statutory authority under Health & Safety Code § 1266 to condition or delay license transfers pending quality improvement demonstration, CHOW approval delay of 90-180 days is probable (40-50% probability). California's conditional approval practice for troubled facilities creates $24.6M-$28.8M carrying cost exposure (3-6 months @ $8.2M monthly EBITDA). Recommend conditional closing provision allowing Orange County facility exclusion with $28M-$30M price reduction if CHOW not approved within 90 days post-signing. See Section IV.C.B.1.

4. **Probably No (70% probability coverage denied).** Because Sunset's Board of Directors discussed Medicare billing concerns in June 2020 (documented in board minutes), and D&O policies typically contain prior knowledge exclusions under standard ISO D&O policy form § III.C.2, coverage for FCA settlement costs ($8M-$15M) is likely denied if policy incepted after June 2020. Because prior knowledge exclusions bar coverage for "wrongful acts" known to insureds before policy inception, and Martinez allegations center on upcoding practices discussed in June 2020 board meeting, carrier denial probability is 70%. Immediate data room verification of D&O policy inception date and claims-made retroactive date is critical. If no pre-June 2020 coverage exists, FCA settlement becomes fully uninsured. See Section IV.D.B.2.

5. **Yes.** Because Sunset's insurance program materially underinsures across all lines relative to industry benchmarks—D&O limits $10M vs. $25M-$50M for comparable skilled nursing operators, professional liability $1M/$3M vs. $2M/$6M benchmark, excess liability $25M vs. $50M-$100M benchmark—aggregate uninsured exposure is $60M-$72M worst-case scenario ($18.7M probability-weighted). Because FCA settlement alone ($8M-$15M) consumes 80-150% of D&O tower, and potential Martinez punitive damages ($1M-$3M) face EPL policy punitive exclusion, material underinsurance exists. Recommend $12M-$15M purchase price reduction to reflect material underinsurance position, or require Seller to procure tail coverage with enhanced limits. See Section IV.D.B.1.

6. **Yes.** Because sustainable skilled nursing operations require reduction of turnover rates from current levels (CNA 85% vs. 65% national, LPN 55% vs. 45% national, RN 40% vs. 35% national) to industry averages, retention strategy investment of $16.45M annually is operationally required to achieve CMS Five Star quality improvement and competitive labor positioning. Because high turnover generates $12M annual operational cost ($2.5M recruitment + $9.5M agency staffing premium at 23% markup), and retention investment yields $5.1M turnover savings, net annual cost is $11.35M. Because this is an operational requirement for sustainable EBITDA performance rather than contingent liability, cost should normalize EBITDA projections (reduce $52M baseline by $11.35M to $40.65M sustainable EBITDA). This is not escrow-able but materially impacts valuation. See Section IV.E.B.2.

7. **Probably Yes (65-75% probability).** Because Dr. Johnson's $180K annual compensation as medical director for Orange County Care Center generates 42% Medicare patient referral concentration ($8.1M Medicare revenue from Dr. Johnson referrals), the 2.2% compensation-to-referral ratio exceeds DOJ's enforcement trigger threshold and FMV benchmarks for part-time SNF medical directors ($60K-$90K per industry compensation surveys). Because Anti-Kickback Statute violations require only "one purpose" of inducing referrals under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b), and Stark Law exceptions for medical director services require compensation "consistent with fair market value" under 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn(e)(3), AKS/Stark violation probability is 65-75%. Independent FMV valuation required for all 12 medical director contracts across portfolio. Recommend renegotiation to $90K-$110K range with documented FMV support. See Section IV.C.B.2.

8. **Yes (if Orange County closes).** Because Medicare provider agreement termination triggering Orange County Care Center facility closure would affect 350 full-time employees and trigger WARN Act notification requirements under 29 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(2) (plant closing affecting 50+ employees), statutory liability is $5.2M (60 days wages and benefits for all affected employees). Because risk is contingent on SFF termination scenario (60-70% probability unmitigated, 35% probability with quality improvement investment), probability-weighted WARN exposure is $3.1M-$3.6M. Because California WARN Act under Labor Code §§ 1400-1408 imposes additional notice requirements, failure to provide notice creates both federal and state liability. Recommend seller indemnification for WARN liability if Orange County closes within 12 months post-closing due to Medicare termination. See Section IV.E.B.4.

9. **Marginally Beneficial.** Because Section 338(h)(10) election under IRC § 338(h)(10) provides Buyer $50.77M net present value benefit (step-up in depreciable basis generating $72.25M tax benefit, offset by $21.48M goodwill amortization disadvantage), but requires $37M-$50M purchase price increase to compensate Seller for $87M-$99M incremental federal and state tax burden (recapture of accumulated depreciation, conversion of capital gain to ordinary income), net Buyer benefit is only $0.77M-$13.77M depending on final price adjustment. Because election must be made by both parties under Treas. Reg. § 1.338(h)(10)-1(c), and Seller is entitled to economic indifference, election should be negotiated based on overall deal economics and allocation of tax savings. If parties negotiate 50-50 split of $50.77M benefit (Seller receives $25.4M price increase), net Buyer benefit is $25.4M—economically material but not transformative. See Section IV.G.B.1.

10. **Probably Yes (38-43% aggregate probability).** Because industry studies of skilled nursing facilities suggest 38% probability that risk assessments are outdated (last conducted >3 years ago) and 15% probability that mobile devices used by clinical staff lack encryption, combined HIPAA Security Rule compliance gaps create $250K-$1.1M gross penalty exposure under 45 C.F.R. § 160.404 tiered penalty structure ($56.5K-$393K probability-weighted). Because OCR enforcement prioritizes willful neglect violations (penalties up to $1.82M per violation category), and unencrypted mobile devices containing ePHI constitute willful neglect if not remediated within 30-day correction period, risk is material. Because remediation cost is only $160K-$225K (comprehensive risk assessment, mobile device encryption, policy updates), remediation is cost-effective and recommended pre-closing to eliminate enforcement risk. See Section IV.F.B.1.

11. **Probably Yes (60% class action probability).** Because 3 California facilities (Los Angeles Laurel, San Diego Bayview, Orange County) show pattern meal/rest break violations documented in employee complaints and CDPH inspection citations, $600K historical exposure exists under California Labor Code §§ 226.7, 512 (3-year lookback for premium pay liability). Because ongoing violations generate $200K annual exposure if not remediated, and California's plaintiff-friendly wage/hour environment supports 60% class action probability under *Brinker Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court*, 53 Cal. 4th 1004 (2012) standards, aggregate exposure is $800K-$1.4M. Recommend immediate remediation (automated meal break compliance system, manager training) and $800K indemnification escrow (24-month survival period matching California statute of limitations). See Section IV.E.B.5.

12. **Yes.** Because Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) under Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 42-5061 applies at 5.6% to tangible personal property transfers ($967.5K on $17.3M equipment basis), and California sales/use tax under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6006 applies at 7.25% to equipment transfers ($573.75K on $7.9M California equipment), gross state transaction tax exposure is $1.54M. Because Purchase Agreement allocates 50% reimbursement to Seller ($770K), and California medical equipment exemptions under Rev. & Tax. Code § 6369 reduce California exposure by $161K, net Buyer cost is $609K. Because transaction taxes are unavoidable in asset purchase structure (versus stock purchase with no transfer tax), recommend negotiating increased Seller reimbursement percentage (60-75% range) or including in purchase price adjustments. See Section IV.G.B.3.
