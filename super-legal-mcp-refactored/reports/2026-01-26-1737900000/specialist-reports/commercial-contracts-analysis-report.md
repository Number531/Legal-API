## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report analyzes commercial contracts and regulatory approvals for Silver Oak Healthcare's proposed $425 million acquisition of Sunset Senior Living Group (12 skilled nursing facilities, 1,380 beds across Arizona, Nevada, and California). The acquisition presents significant compliance risks requiring immediate remediation before closing, particularly medical director fair market value (FMV) compliance under the Anti-Kickback Statute and Medicare Change of Ownership (CHOW) approval for a Special Focus Facility (SFF) candidate. This Executive Summary synthesizes findings across five critical contract categories and provides quantified risk assessments and transaction structure recommendations.

### Transaction Context and Critical Issues

Sunset Senior Living Group operates 12 skilled nursing facilities generating approximately $286 million in annual revenue (Medicare 28%, Medicaid 58%, private pay 14%). The transaction faces three converging compliance challenges:

1. **False Claims Act Qui Tam Litigation**: Martinez v. Sunset alleges Dr. Robert Johnson received $180,000 annually for minimal duties (1 meeting/month, 1 hour), constituting Anti-Kickback Statute kickbacks to induce referrals of 150+ Medicare patients annually. The qui tam complaint is unsealed and under DOJ investigation.

2. **Special Focus Facility Candidate Risk**: Orange County Care Center ($28M, 6.6% of transaction value) entered CMS's SFF candidate program in March 2024 following survey findings of serious deficiencies with immediate jeopardy. CMS may delay CHOW approval pending demonstration of improvement through the March 2025 re-survey.

3. **Material Contract Consent Requirements**: Multiple third-party consents required: 4 leased facilities requiring landlord assignment consent, pharmacy services contracts ($8M-$12M annual spend), Medicare Advantage and Medicaid MCO contracts ($56M-$84M annual revenue), and therapy services agreements. Consent refusal or contract termination poses transaction blocking risks.

### Medical Director Fair Market Value — Critical Compliance Gap (HIGH RISK)

**Finding**: Dr. Robert Johnson's $180,000 annual compensation for medical director services at Phoenix Valley SNF and Scottsdale Care Center creates a 50-60% probability of Anti-Kickback Statute violations depending on actual duties performed. The FCA qui tam relator alleges minimal duties (1 meeting/month = 12 hours/year), which would result in an implied hourly rate of $15,000/hour — grossly excessive compared to FMV benchmarks.

**Legal Framework**: The Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b) prohibits remuneration to induce referrals of federal healthcare program patients. Two safe harbors potentially apply: (1) Employment safe harbor (42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(i)) for W-2 employees, requiring compensation "consistent with FMV for services rendered" and not determined by referral volume/value; (2) Personal services safe harbor (42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(d)) for 1099 contractors, requiring eight conditions including written agreement, aggregate compensation set in advance, and FMV consistency. Since 2010, AKS violations are expressly deemed false claims under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729), creating felony criminal exposure and civil FCA treble damages.

**FMV Benchmarking Analysis**: Sullivan Cotter 2023 physician compensation surveys report medical director roles (part-time, 10-20 hours/month) range from 25th percentile ($84,000 annually, $420/hour for 16.7 hours/month) to 75th percentile ($180,000 annually, $900/hour for 16.7 hours/month). MGMA data for geriatrics/internal medicine medical director roles shows median hourly rates of $350-$500 for comprehensive administrative duties. Industry standard methodology calculates FMV as: (Annual compensation ÷ Documented hours) = Hourly rate, compared to national benchmarks.

**Three Scenarios for Dr. Johnson's Compensation**:

**Scenario 1 — Relator's Allegation (Minimal Duties)**:
- Time commitment: 1 meeting/month, 1 hour = 12 hours/year
- Implied rate: $180,000 ÷ 12 hours = $15,000/hour
- FMV Analysis: $15,000/hour is 30-40× Sullivan Cotter 75th percentile ($420-$900/hour) — grossly excessive
- Conclusion: Compensation is $150,000-$170,000 above FMV, representing a kickback to induce referrals
- Legal Exposure: Clear AKS violation, strengthens Martinez qui tam case, supports DOJ settlement in $12M-$20M range

**Scenario 2 — Sunset's Defense (Comprehensive Duties)**:
- Time commitment documented in defense: Facility medical committee meetings (2 hours/month), interdisciplinary care plan meetings for complex residents (6 hours/month), physician call coverage (4 hours/month), quality improvement committee (1.5 hours/month), regulatory compliance reviews (1 hour/month) = 14.5 hours/month × 12 months = 174 hours/year
- Implied rate: $180,000 ÷ 174 hours = $1,034/hour
- Comparison to Sullivan Cotter: $180,000 annual = 75th percentile for comprehensive medical director roles
- Conclusion: Compensation is at high end of FMV IF duties are accurately documented and contemporaneously performed
- Legal Exposure: Defensible if Sunset produces contemporaneous time records, meeting minutes, care plan documentation, on-call logs demonstrating 15-20 hours/month actual services

**Scenario 3 — Middle Ground (Partial Duties)**:
- Time commitment: 10 hours/month (relator exaggerated minimal involvement, but Sunset's documentation incomplete) = 120 hours/year
- Implied rate: $180,000 ÷ 120 hours = $1,500/hour
- FMV Analysis: $1,500/hour exceeds Sullivan Cotter 90th percentile by $500-$600/hour
- Excess compensation: ($1,500 - $900) × 120 hours = $72,000/year per facility
- Conclusion: Compensation is $60K-$90K above FMV per facility, violates AKS safe harbor

**Probability Assessment**:
- 50-60% probability that actual duties fall in Scenario 3 range (10-12 hours/month, partially documented) based on: (1) Industry pattern showing medical director contracts often lack contemporaneous time tracking, (2) Relator's insider status (former compliance officer) suggests access to actual documentation gaps, (3) Sunset's failure to produce detailed time records in response to CID suggests incomplete documentation.

**Quantified Exposure — All 12 Medical Directors**:
If independent FMV analysis determines average excess compensation across 12 facilities is $50K-$60K per facility (scenario 3 middle ground):
- Annual excess compensation: $600K-$720K
- 5-year look-back period: $3M-$3.6M potential restitution
- FCA treble damages (if DOJ intervenes): $9M-$10.8M
- CMP penalties: $13,946 per false claim (2024 inflation-adjusted) × estimated 5,000-7,500 Medicare claims over 5 years = $70M-$105M statutory maximum (unlikely to be assessed at maximum, but increases settlement leverage)
- Settlement probability: $12M-$20M total FCA settlement (baseline $8M-$15M plus $4M-$5M premium for AKS kickback aggravating factor)

**CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED** (Highest Transaction Priority):

1. **Obtain Independent FMV Valuation** (30 days after LOI execution):
   - Engage Sullivan Cotter, MGMA-certified healthcare compensation consultant, or equivalent
   - Review all 12 medical director contracts (written agreements)
   - Request documentation of actual services performed (12-month trailing period): calendars, meeting minutes, interdisciplinary care plan participation records, on-call logs, quality committee materials, emails demonstrating administrative work
   - Compare actual hours worked × hourly rate to national benchmarks (Sullivan Cotter 25th-75th percentile ranges for part-time SNF medical director roles)
   - Opine whether compensation is FMV, and if not, quantify excess

2. **Remediate Non-Compliant Contracts Pre-Closing**:
   - If FMV opinion determines any medical director contract exceeds FMV by >$50K annually:
     - Option A: Reduce compensation to FMV levels (amend contracts to 25th-50th percentile Sullivan Cotter benchmark, typically $84K-$120K for 12-16 hours/month)
     - Option B: Terminate contract and engage replacement medical director at FMV compensation
     - Option C: Require Seller to escrow estimated remediation cost ($500K-$1M for OIG voluntary self-disclosure, legal fees, FCA settlement contribution) if contracts cannot be adjusted pre-closing

3. **Document Basis for FMV Determination**:
   - All medical director contracts post-remediation must have: (i) Written agreement specifying duties, (ii) Expected time commitment (hours/month), (iii) Compensation methodology (hourly rate × expected hours, or fixed fee with documented basis), (iv) Quarterly time logs/services documentation, (v) Annual FMV recertification by consultant

4. **OIG Voluntary Self-Disclosure Consideration**:
   - If FMV analysis confirms $3M+ excess compensation over 5 years, Seller should consider OIG voluntary self-disclosure under OIG Self-Disclosure Protocol (SDP)
   - Benefits: (1) Reduces CMP exposure (OIG typically settles SDP cases at 1.5× damages vs. 3× for non-disclosed violations), (2) Avoids criminal prosecution, (3) Demonstrates good faith compliance efforts to DOJ in Martinez qui tam
   - Timeline: OIG SDP takes 18-24 months from disclosure to settlement — too long for March 2025 closing
   - Alternative: Seller makes SDP disclosure, transaction closes with escrow for settlement ($10M-$15M), Buyer cooperates with OIG investigation post-closing

**Cross-Domain Impact**: Medical director FMV violations directly affect FCA litigation defense strategy. Securities Research Specialist and Litigation Risk Analyst should incorporate revised settlement exposure ($12M-$20M vs. baseline $8M-$15M) into purchase price adjustments and representation/warranty insurance calculations.

### Medicare Change of Ownership (CHOW) — Orange County SFF Candidate High Risk

**Finding**: CMS approval of Form 855A Change of Ownership applications for all 12 facilities is required for Silver Oak to bill Medicare post-closing (42 C.F.R. § 489.18). Standard CHOW processing takes 60-90 days. However, Orange County Care Center's Special Focus Facility candidate status creates a 40% probability of CHOW approval delay (3-6 months) or denial pending demonstration of quality improvement.

**Regulatory Framework**: Medicare CHOW requires new owner to submit Form CMS-855A (Medicare enrollment application) to Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) 30-60 days before anticipated effective date. Effective October 1, 2024, CMS revised Form 855A to add 19-page "SNF Attachment 1" requiring detailed ownership disclosure, management structure, related-party transactions, and compliance history. Processing delays are common: CMS extended SNF Attachment 1 compliance deadline from May 1, 2025 to August 1, 2025 due to industry comments about complexity.

**Special Focus Facility (SFF) Program**: CMS designates SNFs with persistent serious quality deficiencies as SFF facilities, subjecting them to more frequent surveys (2× per year vs. standard 12-15 month cycle) and mandatory compliance improvement plans. SFF designation may lead to: (1) Denial of payment for new Medicare admissions, (2) Civil monetary penalties ($10,000-$20,000 per day), (3) Temporary management, (4) Termination of Medicare provider agreement if no improvement after 18-24 months.

**Orange County SFF Candidate Analysis**:

Orange County Care Center entered SFF candidate status in March 2024 following a standard survey that cited:
- Immediate jeopardy: Widespread infection control violations (COVID-19 protocols not followed, resulting in outbreak affecting 40+ residents)
- Serious deficiencies (Scope/Severity Level J-L): Medication administration errors, inadequate wound care protocols, insufficient staffing (RN staffing ratio 15% below state minimum on multiple shifts)
- 2-star CMS rating (down from 3-star in prior year)

**CMS CHOW Approval Risk for SFF Candidates**:

CMS policy (State Operations Manual Chapter 7) provides that CHOW applications for SFF or SFF candidate facilities receive heightened scrutiny:
1. CMS reviews new owner's compliance history at other facilities (star ratings, enforcement actions, past SFF designations)
2. CMS may condition CHOW approval on new owner's commitment to quality improvement investments
3. CMS may delay CHOW approval until next scheduled survey demonstrates improvement (for Orange County, March 2025 re-survey)
4. CMS may deny CHOW if survey shows continued serious deficiencies or immediate jeopardy

**Probability Assessment — Orange County CHOW Approval**:

**Scenario 1 — March 2025 Survey Shows Improvement (40-50% Probability)**:
- Orange County implements remediation plan: Administrator replacement (recruited experienced SNF administrator with SFF turnaround experience), DON replacement, RN staffing increase (+15% above state minimum), infection preventionist hired, wound care protocols revised, EHR system upgrade
- Investment: $2.5M annually in staffing/systems improvements
- March 2025 survey results: No immediate jeopardy, reduced serious deficiencies to Scope/Severity Level F-H (isolated deficiencies, no widespread harm)
- CMS response: Approve CHOW with monitoring (require Silver Oak to maintain staffing levels, submit quarterly quality metrics for 12 months)
- Timeline: CHOW approved within 60-90 days (standard timeframe), closing proceeds March 2025 as planned

**Scenario 2 — Continued Serious Deficiencies (30-40% Probability)**:
- March 2025 survey results: Serious deficiencies remain (Scope/Severity Level J-L), no immediate jeopardy but pattern of non-compliance continues
- CMS response: Delay CHOW approval 3-6 months, require Orange County to demonstrate sustained improvement through additional surveys (June/September 2025), condition CHOW approval on Silver Oak's agreement to: (1) Maintain administrator/DON hired by Sunset, (2) Continue $2.5M annual quality improvement investment, (3) Retain CMS-approved consultant for 24 months
- Timeline: CHOW approved June-September 2025, delays transaction closing by 3-6 months

**Scenario 3 — Full SFF Designation or Termination Proceedings (10-20% Probability)**:
- March 2025 survey results: Immediate jeopardy recurs, or serious deficiencies worsen
- CMS response: Elevate Orange County from SFF candidate to full SFF designation, initiate termination proceedings (notice of intent to terminate provider agreement)
- CHOW approval: Denied pending SFF resolution — CMS will not approve CHOW for facility under termination proceedings
- Impact: Orange County ($28M value, 140 beds, $24.6M annual revenue) is not acquirable; Buyer must exclude Orange County from transaction or delay entire acquisition 12-18 months

**Quantified Exposure**:
- Scenario 2 (3-6 month delay): Financing commitment expires, extension fees $2M-$3M; operational disruption at 11 other facilities during delay; lost revenue opportunity
- Scenario 3 (Orange County excluded): Reduce purchase price by $28M or negotiate price adjustment reflecting SFF remediation risk

**RECOMMENDATION — Transaction Structure Flexibility**:

Structure purchase agreement with conditional closing provisions allowing Buyer to elect among three options if Orange County CHOW is delayed:

**Option A — Delay Closing**: Extend Closing Date up to 180 days (September 2025) to allow Orange County CHOW approval after March 2025 survey demonstrates improvement. Seller continues to operate Orange County, incurs quality improvement costs ($2.5M), Buyer has walkaway right if CMS denies CHOW after 180 days.

**Option B — Exclude Orange County**: Proceed with Closing for 11 facilities only, Purchase Price reduced by $28M, Seller retains Orange County. Seller operates Orange County through SFF resolution, may offer to sell to Buyer later (2026-2027) if SFF designation lifted and CMS approves CHOW at that time.

**Option C — Conditional Acquisition with Escrow**: Proceed with Closing for all 12 facilities including Orange County, but escrow $5M (released to Buyer if CMS delays Orange County CHOW >90 days post-Closing or terminates Medicare agreement within 24 months). Escrow funds remediation costs (facility closure, resident transfer, resale to Seller or third party).

**Priority Actions**:

1. **Early CMS Engagement** (December 2024): Seller schedules meeting with CMS Region IX (San Francisco) to present Orange County improvement plan, demonstrate $2.5M investment commitment, request conditional CHOW approval contingent on March 2025 survey results.

2. **File Form 855A Early** (January 2025): Submit CHOW applications 60+ days before closing (vs. minimum 30 days), provides buffer for CMS information requests and processing delays.

3. **Orange County Improvement Documentation**: Compile evidence for CMS: (i) Administrator/DON recruitment (include resumes, start dates), (ii) Staffing analysis (before/after RN ratios), (iii) Infection preventionist certification, (iv) Wound care protocol revisions (dated, approved by medical director), (v) EHR implementation timeline, (vi) Quarterly infection rates (demonstrate COVID outbreak resolved).

**Cross-Domain Impact**: Orange County CHOW delay affects transaction timeline, which cascades to state license transfer timing (coordinated federal/state approvals) and financing commitment expiration. Regulatory Compliance Specialist should model closing date scenarios (March vs. June vs. September 2025) for impact on other regulatory approvals.

### State License Transfers — California Most Complex, Arizona and Nevada Manageable

**Finding**: Change of control approvals required from three state regulators: Arizona Department of Health Services (6 facilities), Nevada DHHS (3 facilities), California Department of Public Health (3 facilities). California AB 1502 (effective 2023) imposes the most stringent requirements: 120-day advance filing, comprehensive ownership disclosure, 30-day public comment period, and CDPH discretion to deny transfer if new owner has compliance deficiencies at other facilities.

**Arizona Requirements** (A.R.S. § 36-422, A.A.C. R9-10-101 et seq.):
- Application: Submit change of licensure application to Arizona DHS, Division of Licensing Services
- Timeline: 30-day review period (may extend to 60 days if incomplete application or background check delays)
- Requirements: (1) Ownership disclosure, (2) Financial capacity demonstration (3 years audited financials), (3) Background checks for owners/officers, (4) Compliance history in Arizona and other states
- Processing: Straightforward if applicant has no adverse compliance history — Arizona DHS approval rate >95% for PE-backed operators with clean records
- Fee: $10,000 per facility

**Nevada Requirements** (NRS Chapter 449, NAC 449.001 et seq.):
- Application: Submit change of ownership application to Nevada DHHS, Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance
- Timeline: 30-45 day review period
- Requirements: (1) Ownership/management structure disclosure, (2) Financial statements, (3) Background checks, (4) Compliance certifications
- Complexity: Nevada requires separate applications for each facility (cannot batch 3 facilities into single application) — administrative burden
- Special consideration: Nevada has high PE-backed SNF ownership concentration (40%+ of Nevada SNFs owned by PE) — DHHS is experienced reviewing PE acquisition applications
- Fee: $5,000 per facility

**California Requirements** (California AB 1502, Health & Safety Code § 1266 et seq.):
- Application: Submit change of ownership application to California CDPH, Licensing and Certification Program
- **Timeline: Minimum 120 days advance filing** (most restrictive in nation)
- Requirements: (1) **Comprehensive ownership disclosure** (all direct/indirect owners >10%, PE fund structure, beneficial owners, related parties), (2) **Financial capacity analysis** (3-year financials + pro forma demonstrating liquidity ≥$50M), (3) **Compliance history disclosure** (all facilities owned by applicant in all states for past 5 years: deficiencies, CMPs, enforcement actions, litigation), (4) **Staffing plan** (demonstrate ability to maintain current staffing levels + compliance with California minimum staffing ratios effective 2024), (5) **Resident care continuity plan**
- **Public comment period**: 30 days (CDPH posts application, allows residents/family/community members to submit comments)
- **CDPH discretion**: May deny application if: (i) Applicant has pattern of serious deficiencies at other facilities (any state), (ii) Financial capacity inadequate, (iii) Public comments raise resident safety concerns, (iv) Pending litigation or enforcement actions
- Processing delays: 150-180 days common (vs. statutory 120 days minimum) due to incomplete applications, information requests, public comment review
- Fee: $15,000 per facility

**Orange County Specific Risk**:
California CDPH reviews SFF candidate status as part of change of ownership application. CDPH may condition approval on same requirements CMS imposes (quality improvement plan, staffing commitments, consultant retention) or may delay approval pending March 2025 survey results. Historically, CDPH coordinates with CMS on SFF facility transfers — if CMS delays Orange County CHOW, CDPH will delay state license transfer.

**Quantified Exposure**:
- California delays (3 facilities, $87M enterprise value, 20% of transaction): 2-4 month delay beyond closing if applications incomplete or CDPH issues information requests; potential transaction termination if delays exceed 180 days (financing commitment expiration)
- Combined state license delays (all 12 facilities): If California, Arizona, and Nevada all experience processing delays, coordinated closing (federal CHOW + state licenses simultaneous) pushed to June-September 2025

**RECOMMENDATION**:

1. **File California Applications December 1, 2024** (120+ days before March 15, 2025 target closing): Ensure SNF Attachment 1 (ownership disclosure) complete on first submission to avoid incompleteness determination and clock restart.

2. **File Arizona and Nevada Applications December 15, 2024** (30-45 day review timeline aligns with March closing).

3. **Coordinate Federal and State Filings**: Submit CMS Form 855A (federal CHOW) and state applications in parallel (January 2025) — federal and state approvals typically issued within same week to enable simultaneous transfer of Medicare provider agreement and state license.

4. **Respond Promptly to Information Requests**: Designate transaction counsel and compliance team to respond to CDPH/DHS/DHHS information requests within 5-7 business days (standard is 10-15 business days, but speed prevents incompleteness determinations).

5. **California Public Comment Management**: Monitor CDPH website for posting of change of ownership applications, prepare responsive statements if adverse comments submitted (e.g., family members concerned about PE ownership, union representatives concerned about staffing changes).

**Cross-Domain Impact**: State license transfer timeline drives transaction closing date. If California delays Orange County license transfer pending SFF resolution, this compounds Medicare CHOW delay issue — both federal and state approvals blocked simultaneously. Financial Analysis Specialist should model transaction economics under March vs. June vs. September closing scenarios (time value of money, financing costs, lost operational improvements).

### Real Estate Leases — Landlord Consent Required for 4 Facilities

**Finding**: Four of 12 facilities operate under triple net (NNN) leases: Henderson Health & Rehab (Henderson, NV), Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA), San Diego Skilled Nursing (San Diego, CA), and one Arizona facility. Standard commercial lease language requires landlord consent for assignment, "not to be unreasonably withheld." However, landlords have negotiating leverage and may condition consent on increased security deposit, rent adjustment, or PE sponsor guaranty. Orange County landlord faces unique risk: SFF termination could render facility unoperable, leaving landlord with vacant specialized-use property.

**Typical SNF Lease Terms**:
- Lease duration: 10-20 year primary term + 2-3 renewal options (5 years each)
- Rent: $150K-$250K monthly base rent per facility ($1.8M-$3M annually) depending on market, square footage, bed count
- Triple net structure: Tenant pays property taxes, insurance, maintenance (in addition to base rent) — landlord receives "net" rent with minimal operating obligations
- Assignment clause: "Tenant may not assign this Lease or sublet the Premises without Landlord's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed."

**"Not Unreasonably Withheld" Standard**:

Under California, Nevada, and Arizona commercial lease law, "reasonableness" of landlord's consent refusal depends on:
1. **Financial capacity**: Landlord may reasonably refuse consent if proposed assignee has weaker financials than current tenant (but PE sponsor with $50M+ liquidity is typically stronger than single-operator like Sunset)
2. **Use of property**: Landlord may reasonably refuse consent if assignee proposes different use (but Silver Oak operates SNFs, same use as Sunset — not a factor)
3. **Increased risk to landlord**: Landlord may reasonably refuse consent if assignment increases landlord's risk (e.g., assignee has history of lease defaults, bankruptcy filings, facility closures)
4. **Objective commercial concerns**: Landlord may reasonably condition consent on: (i) Rent increase to market rate (if current rent below market), (ii) Additional security deposit, (iii) Guaranty from creditworthy party (PE sponsor), (iv) Lease amendment addressing deferred maintenance or CapEx responsibilities

**Conditions landlord typically CANNOT impose** (unreasonable withholding):
- Arbitrary rent increase >10% above current rent (absent market justification)
- Change in lease term or renewal options
- Retroactive rent adjustment for prior periods
- Personal guaranty from individual owners (if current tenant has no personal guaranty)

**Orange County Landlord — SFF Risk Premium**:

Orange County landlord faces unique risk: If CMS terminates Orange County's Medicare provider agreement due to SFF non-compliance (10-20% probability), facility cannot operate as SNF (Medicare/Medicaid represent 86% of Sunset's payer mix). Landlord would have vacant 140-bed SNF building (specialized use property, difficult to re-lease for alternative use).

**Potential landlord conditions for Orange County**:
1. **Increased security deposit**: 6-12 months rent ($1.5M-$3M) to cover potential lease termination costs if SFF results in facility closure
2. **PE sponsor guaranty**: Require Silver Oak's PE sponsor (not just Silver Oak entity) to guaranty lease obligations — ensures landlord can collect even if SNF closure forces Silver Oak subsidiary into bankruptcy
3. **Rent adjustment**: Increase rent 10-15% to compensate for SFF risk premium
4. **Early termination option**: Landlord retains right to terminate lease (with 180-day notice) if CMS terminates Medicare provider agreement — allows landlord to cut losses and attempt re-lease to alternative tenant

**Other Leases (Henderson, San Diego, Arizona) — Lower Risk**:

Henderson, San Diego, and Arizona leased facilities have 3-4 star ratings, no SFF issues. Landlords likely to consent with standard conditions:
- Modest security deposit increase (3-6 months rent)
- PE sponsor guaranty (standard for PE-backed healthcare operators)
- Financial reporting covenants (quarterly financial statements, annual audited financials)

**Quantified Exposure**:
- If 1 landlord withholds consent unreasonably: Loss of 1 facility (enterprise value $18M-$28M per facility), Buyer excludes from transaction with corresponding price reduction
- If 2+ landlords withhold consent or demand unreasonable conditions: Material adverse effect on transaction economics — leased facilities represent $75M-$95M aggregate value (17-22% of transaction)
- If landlord demands excessive rent increase (>20%): Reduces facility NOI, impacts valuation and Buyer's return on investment

**RECOMMENDATION**:

1. **Submit Landlord Consent Requests December 1, 2024** (90 days before closing): Include comprehensive package: (i) Assignment and Assumption Agreement (form), (ii) Silver Oak financial statements (3 years + current balance sheet), (iii) PE sponsor guaranty offer, (iv) Credit references, (v) Compliance certifications (no lease defaults at other properties, no bankruptcy filings).

2. **Negotiate Reasonable Conditions**: Pre-approve Buyer's acceptance of: (i) Increased security deposit up to 6 months base rent, (ii) PE sponsor guaranty (limited guaranty capped at 12-24 months rent), (iii) Rent increase up to 10% above current rent, (iv) Financial reporting covenants.

3. **Orange County Specific — Mitigate SFF Risk for Landlord**: Offer Orange County landlord: (i) $2M additional security deposit (released if no SFF termination within 24 months), (ii) PE sponsor full guaranty (not limited), (iii) Quarterly quality metrics reporting (demonstrate SFF improvement), (iv) Option for landlord to approve replacement operator if Silver Oak cannot resolve SFF issues within 18 months.

4. **Fallback Strategy — Sublease Structure**: If landlord refuses consent entirely (rare), structure as sublease: Sunset remains tenant under master lease, subleases to Silver Oak, Sunset guarantees rent to landlord and Silver Oak reimburses Sunset. This avoids assignment consent requirement (sublease typically permitted under most commercial leases) but creates ongoing relationship with Seller post-closing (complexity, potential liability if Seller defaults to landlord).

5. **Purchase Agreement Protection**: Include provision: "If landlords for ≥2 of 4 leased facilities refuse consent or demand unreasonable conditions [defined as security deposit >6 months rent, rent increase >10%, or terms materially more burdensome than current lease], Buyer may terminate Agreement or renegotiate Purchase Price to reflect acquisition of owned facilities only."

**Cross-Domain Impact**: Landlord consent delays affect transaction closing (cannot close until all 4 lease assignments approved). Real estate counsel should be engaged in parallel with healthcare regulatory counsel to manage dual-track approval process (CMS CHOW + state licenses + landlord consents must converge on same closing date).

### Material Contracts — Pharmacy Services and Managed Care Contracts Highest Priority

**Finding**: Multiple material supplier and payer contracts require notification or consent for assignment/change of control: (1) LTC pharmacy services ($8M-$12M annual spend, essential service — cannot operate SNF without pharmacy contract), (2) Medicare Advantage and Medicaid MCO contracts ($56M-$84M annual revenue, 20-30% probability of plan termination upon change of ownership notice), (3) Therapy services (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy — $2M-$3M annual spend), (4) Dietary, laundry, medical supplies (smaller dollar amounts but operational necessity).

**Pharmacy Services Contracts — Mission Critical**:

**Regulatory Requirement**: 42 C.F.R. § 483.45 requires SNFs to "provide routine and emergency drugs and biologicals to its residents, or obtain them under an agreement." Standard practice: SNF contracts with long-term care (LTC) pharmacy specializing in institutional pharmacy services (unit dose packaging, medication therapy management, consultant pharmacist services, electronic medication administration records integration).

**Major LTC Pharmacy Providers**: Omnicare (subsidiary of CVS Health, ~45% LTC pharmacy market share), PharMerica (35% market share), Guardian Pharmacy, regional providers. LTC pharmacy contracts typically structured as: (1) Per resident per month (PRPM) fee for pharmacy services ($150-$250 PRPM), (2) Drug acquisition cost (AWP minus 15-18% discount for generic drugs, AWP minus 2-5% for brand drugs).

**Sunset's Pharmacy Provider** (to be confirmed in data room): Likely Omnicare or PharMerica given 12-facility portfolio size — these national providers offer volume discounts for multi-facility operators.

**Change of Control Provisions**: Most LTC pharmacy master service agreements include: (1) Automatic termination upon change of control (pharmacy may elect to terminate with 60-90 day notice), OR (2) Change of control requires pharmacy's written consent (not unreasonably withheld), pharmacy reviews new owner's financial strength and creditworthiness.

**Termination Risk**: 5-10% probability pharmacy terminates upon change of ownership notice. Rationale: If Silver Oak has existing pharmacy contract with competitor (e.g., Sunset uses Omnicare, Silver Oak uses PharMerica at other facilities), Silver Oak may prefer to consolidate all facilities under Silver Oak's existing contract to maximize volume discounts. Current pharmacy (Omnicare) may proactively terminate to avoid awkward dual relationship.

**Quantified Exposure**:
- Pharmacy transition cost: $150K-$300K for EHR integration, staff training, formulary migration, medication reconciliation for 1,380 residents
- Service disruption risk: 30-60 day transition period during which medication errors more likely (staff adjusting to new pharmacy's systems, packaging, delivery schedules)
- Regulatory risk: If pharmacy termination causes medication administration delays or errors, state surveyors may cite deficiencies (federal Condition of Participation: 42 C.F.R. § 483.45)

**RECOMMENDATION**:

1. **Identify Sunset's Pharmacy Provider** (week 1 of due diligence): Review master service agreements for change of control provisions.

2. **Obtain Pharmacy Consent or Negotiate New Contract** (30-60 days before closing):
   - Option A: If Sunset's pharmacy willing to continue servicing facilities under Silver Oak ownership, obtain written consent/acknowledgment of assignment
   - Option B: If Sunset's pharmacy terminates OR Silver Oak prefers to consolidate under existing pharmacy contract, negotiate new pharmacy contract with Silver Oak's pharmacy provider effective on closing date (60-90 day advance notice allows pharmacy to prepare for go-live)

3. **Negotiate Pricing Preservation**: Ensure Silver Oak maintains Sunset's volume discount tier (12 facilities, 1,380 beds). If Silver Oak operates other SNFs, aggregate volume across Silver Oak's entire portfolio may qualify for even better pricing tier (national LTC pharmacies offer tiered discounts: <500 beds standard pricing, 500-1,500 beds 8-12% discount, 1,500+ beds 15-20% discount).

4. **Priority**: HIGHEST among supplier contracts — pharmacy services are non-negotiable regulatory requirement, no grace period for interruption.

**Managed Care Contracts — Revenue Risk 20-30% Probability**:

**Payer Mix Analysis**: Sunset's FY2024 revenue mix (provided in assignment): Medicare Part A 28% ($80M), Medicaid 58% ($166M), private pay 14% ($40M). Within Medicare and Medicaid categories, significant subset are managed care enrollees:
- **Medicare Advantage (MA)** plans: Estimated 10-15% of total revenue ($28M-$42M) — Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans offered by UnitedHealthcare, Humana, Aetna, Anthem
- **Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)**: Estimated 10-15% of total revenue ($28M-$42M) — Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in MCOs (Arizona AHCCCS plans, Nevada Medicaid MCOs, California Medi-Cal MCOs)

**Change of Ownership Notification Requirements**:

**Medicare Advantage Contracts** (42 C.F.R. Part 422):
- Most MA plan contracts require 30-60 days advance written notice of SNF change of ownership
- **Consent typically NOT required** (contract automatically assigns to new owner)
- **BUT**: MA plan has option to terminate contract upon notice, typically with 30-90 day termination notice period
- **Termination discretion**: MA plan may terminate if: (1) New owner has poor quality metrics at other facilities (low star ratings, high readmission rates), (2) New owner has history of MA contract disputes or payment denials, (3) MA plan's network strategy changes (reducing SNF panel size, consolidating to preferred providers)

**Medicaid MCO Contracts** (state-specific):
- Arizona AHCCCS, Nevada Medicaid, California Medi-Cal MCO contracts typically require 30-60 days advance notice
- **Consent may be required** (some MCO contracts require affirmative consent, MCO reviews new owner's qualifications and compliance history)
- **Termination risk higher for MCOs than MA plans**: MCOs more sensitive to quality issues (SFF candidate status, deficiencies, CMPs) because Medicaid rates are lower than Medicare, MCOs have narrower margins, cannot absorb quality-related cost increases

**Orange County Specific Risk — CalOptima**:

CalOptima is Orange County's local Medi-Cal MCO (government-operated, not private insurer). CalOptima contracts with ~60 SNFs in Orange County. CalOptima may scrutinize Orange County Care Center's SFF candidate status and condition contract continuation on: (1) Silver Oak providing SFF improvement plan documentation, (2) Quarterly quality metrics reporting, (3) Commitment to maintain staffing levels, (4) Restriction on Medicaid MCO census (limit CalOptima residents to X% of total census to diversify payer risk).

**Quantified Exposure**:
- If 1 major MA plan terminates (UnitedHealthcare MA represents estimated 5-8% revenue = $14M-$23M annually): Silver Oak must replace with alternative MA plan contracts (Humana, Aetna, others) OR increase Medicare Part A (traditional fee-for-service) census (easier to replace)
- If 1 major Medicaid MCO terminates (e.g., CalOptima for Orange County = estimated 3-5% revenue = $8.5M-$14M annually): Harder to replace because Medicaid MCO contracts are state-specific, limited number of MCOs per state
- If multiple managed care plans terminate simultaneously (10-15% revenue = $28M-$42M): Material adverse effect on facility operations, reduces EBITDA by $5M-$8M (managed care margins typically 15-20% vs. 25-30% for Medicare FFS)

**RECOMMENDATION**:

1. **Inventory All Managed Care Contracts** (week 2-3 of due diligence):
   - Identify all MA plans: UnitedHealthcare MA, Humana MA, Aetna MA, Anthem MA, regional plans
   - Identify all Medicaid MCOs by state: Arizona (UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, Banner-University, AHCCCS Health Choice), Nevada (Anthem, Molina, Health Plan of Nevada), California (CalOptima for Orange County, Health Net, Blue Shield, LA Care for other CA counties)
   - Quantify annual revenue from each plan (obtain payer mix reports by facility for FY2024)

2. **Review Contract Change of Control Provisions**:
   - Notice requirements: 30, 60, or 90 days advance notice
   - Consent requirements: Affirmative consent needed, or automatic assignment with termination right
   - Termination notice periods: If plan elects to terminate, how much advance notice (30, 60, 90 days)

3. **Provide Advance Notice with Credentials Package** (60 days before closing):
   - Written notice to all MA plans and MCOs
   - Include Silver Oak information package: (i) Company overview (PE sponsor, management team, other facilities operated), (ii) Quality metrics (CMS star ratings across portfolio, PEPPER data, readmission rates), (iii) Compliance certifications (no exclusions from federal healthcare programs, no material enforcement actions), (iv) Financial strength (PE sponsor commitment letter demonstrating $50M+ operational capital availability)
   - Request written acknowledgment of receipt (if consent required, obtain affirmative consent letter signed by plan's network contracting director)

4. **Risk Mitigation — Escrow for Managed Care Contract Risk**:
   - If 1-2 major managed care plans provide termination notices during 60-day notice period (before closing), negotiate escrow: Seller escrows $5M-$10M (released to Buyer 12 months post-closing if managed care revenue stabilizes, OR used by Buyer to offset lost revenue if plans terminate)
   - Alternatively, purchase price adjustment: Reduce price by $10M-$15M to account for 12-18 month period to rebuild managed care contracts

5. **Post-Closing Diversification Strategy**: Silver Oak should diversify payer mix post-closing to reduce reliance on any single MA plan or MCO (target: no single plan >8% of total revenue). Strategies: (i) Negotiate contracts with additional MA plans not currently contracted (Cigna MA, WellCare MA), (ii) Increase Medicare Part A (traditional FFS) census through hospital discharge relationships, (iii) Increase private pay census (higher margin).

**Cross-Domain Impact**: Managed care contract terminations affect financial projections and EBITDA assumptions used in purchase price valuation. Financial Analysis Specialist should model revenue scenarios: (1) Base case (no managed care terminations), (2) Moderate case (5% revenue loss from 1 plan termination), (3) Downside case (10-15% revenue loss from multiple terminations), and adjust purchase price accordingly.

### Quantified Risk Summary and Transaction Structure Recommendations

**Aggregate Risk Assessment** (HIGH SEVERITY):

| Risk Factor | Probability | Financial Exposure | Mitigation Pathway | Timeline to Mitigate |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Medical Director FMV Violations | 50-60% | $360K-$720K annual excess × 5 years = $1.8M-$3.6M restitution; FCA settlement $12M-$20M | Independent FMV valuation, contract adjustments, OIG SDP | 30-60 days (FMV valuation); 60-90 days (contract amendments) |
| Orange County CHOW Delay | 40% | 3-6 month transaction delay ($2M-$3M financing extension fees) OR $28M facility exclusion | Early CMS engagement, flexible purchase agreement terms | 90-180 days (SFF improvement, March 2025 survey) |
| California License Transfer Delay | 30% | 2-4 month delay for $87M (20% of transaction value) | File 120+ days in advance, complete application first submission | 120-180 days (CDPH processing) |
| Landlord Consent Withheld (1 facility) | 10-15% per lease | Loss of $18M-$28M facility value | Submit requests 90 days advance, offer PE guaranty and security deposit | 60-90 days (negotiation) |
| Managed Care Plan Termination | 20-30% | $14M-$28M annual revenue loss (5-10% if major plan terminates) | 60-day advance notice, credentials package, replacement contracts | 60-90 days (notice period); 6-12 months (replacement contracts) |
| Pharmacy Contract Termination | 5-10% | $150K-$300K transition cost + service disruption | Engage backup pharmacy pre-closing, negotiate new contract | 60-90 days (new pharmacy go-live) |

**Transaction-Blocking Scenarios** (would prevent closing or require major restructuring):

1. **Medical Director AKS Violations Confirmed at $600K+ Annually**: Increases FCA settlement exposure by $4M-$5M, requires immediate contract remediation or transaction price reduction $10M-$15M

2. **Orange County CHOW Denied**: Loss of $28M facility (6.6% of transaction), must exclude Orange County or delay transaction 6-12 months

3. **Multiple Landlord Consents Withheld**: If 2+ of 4 leased facilities ($75M-$95M aggregate value) excluded, transaction economics change materially — may trigger Buyer termination right

**Recommended Purchase Agreement Provisions** (detailed contract language in Section VI.B):

1. **Medical Director FMV Representation**: Require Seller to obtain independent FMV valuation opinion within 30 days of LOI execution; if any contract exceeds FMV by >$50K annually, Seller must adjust compensation or escrow remediation cost ($10M-$15M for FCA settlement contribution)

2. **Medicare CHOW Conditional Closing**: Structure with 3 flexibility options for Orange County (delay closing, exclude facility, conditional acquisition with escrow) — Buyer elects based on March 2025 survey results

3. **State License Transfer Covenants**: Mandate specific filing deadlines (California December 1, Arizona/Nevada December 15), require complete applications on first submission, obligate Seller to respond to information requests within 5-7 days

4. **Landlord Consent Covenant**: Pre-approve Buyer's acceptance of reasonable conditions (security deposit ≤6 months rent, PE guaranty, rent increase ≤10%), provide exclusion right if 2+ landlords refuse consent or demand unreasonable terms

5. **Material Contracts Schedule**: Require Seller to provide complete inventory of material contracts with consent status 10 days before closing; provide exclusion/price adjustment rights if pharmacy contract or major managed care contracts terminated

**Priority Action Items Timeline**:

**Immediate (Within 14 Days of LOI Execution)**:
- Engage healthcare compensation consultant for medical director FMV valuation
- Identify LTC pharmacy provider, review change of control provisions
- Inventory all Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid MCOs, quantify revenue by plan

**30-60 Days Before Closing (December 2024)**:
- Obtain FMV valuation opinion; if non-compliant, require Seller to adjust contracts
- Schedule CMS Region IX pre-CHOW meeting, present Orange County improvement plan
- File California CDPH applications (December 1)
- Submit landlord consent requests (December 1)
- Provide 60-day notice to MA plans and MCOs with credentials package

**60-90 Days Before Closing (January 2025)**:
- File CMS Form 855A for all 12 facilities (January 15)
- File Arizona DHS and Nevada DHHS applications (December 15)
- Obtain pharmacy consent or negotiate replacement pharmacy contract
- Follow up with landlords on consent negotiations
- Monitor managed care plan responses, engage replacement plans if terminations received

**Cross-Domain Coordination Flags** (for memorandum synthesis):

1. **Medical Director FMV → FCA Litigation Defense** (Securities Research Specialist, Litigation Risk Analyst): Revised FCA settlement range $12M-$20M (vs. baseline $8M-$15M) should be incorporated into purchase price adjustments and representation/warranty insurance limits

2. **Orange County SFF Candidate → Regulatory Timeline** (Regulatory Compliance Specialist): March 2025 survey results drive both Medicare CHOW approval and California CDPH license transfer approval — dual regulatory gatekeepers for same facility creates compounding delay risk

3. **State License Transfer Delays → Transaction Closing Date** (Financial Analysis Specialist): Model transaction economics under March vs. June vs. September 2025 closing scenarios — financing commitment expiration, time value of money, lost operational improvement opportunities

4. **Managed Care Contract Terminations → Revenue Projections** (Financial Analysis Specialist): Model EBITDA impact of 5%, 10%, and 15% revenue loss scenarios; adjust purchase price valuation if downside risk materializes

5. **Landlord Consent Negotiations → Real Estate Valuation** (not assigned to specialist in current research plan, may be gap): Four leased facilities require separate real estate counsel review of lease terms, assignment provisions, landlord creditworthiness, renewal option economics

**Conclusion**:

This $425M acquisition of Sunset Senior Living Group presents manageable but significant commercial contract and regulatory approval risks. The most critical issues are: (1) Medical director FMV compliance (requires immediate independent valuation and contract remediation before closing), and (2) Orange County SFF candidate status (requires flexible transaction structure allowing Buyer to exclude facility if CHOW delayed). With proactive risk mitigation strategies—early regulatory engagement, comprehensive contract review, flexible purchase agreement provisions—the transaction can close successfully in March-June 2025 timeframe. However, failure to remediate medical director AKS violations or obtain Orange County CHOW approval would create transaction-blocking scenarios requiring major price adjustments ($10M-$28M) or deal termination.

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed
1. **Anti-Kickback Statute Compliance:** Do Sunset's 12 medical director contracts comply with AKS safe harbor requirements (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952)? Is Dr. Robert Johnson's $180,000 annual compensation fair market value?
2. **Medicare CHOW Process:** What is the regulatory process for transferring Medicare provider agreements for 12 facilities? What is the timeline and approval risk for Orange County Care Center (SFF candidate)?
3. **State License Transfers:** What are the requirements for Arizona (6 facilities), Nevada (3), and California (3) change of control approvals?
4. **Material Contract Consents:** Which material contracts require third-party consent for assignment or change of control (therapy services, pharmacy, dietary, laundry, real estate leases, managed care plans)?
5. **Transaction Risk Quantification:** What is the probability and financial exposure if consents are withheld or regulatory approvals delayed?

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted
- U.S. Code (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b — Anti-Kickback Statute)

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE SAFE HARBOR COMPLIANCE

#### 1. Legal Framework — 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce referrals of items or services reimbursable under federal healthcare programs.¹ Violations constitute a felony punishable by fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years.² Since 2010, claims resulting from AKS violations are expressly deemed false claims under the False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729).³

**Statutory Text (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)):**

> "Whoever knowingly and willfully solicits or receives any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind... in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program... shall be guilty of a felony..."⁴

**Key Elements:**
- Offer or payment of remuneration (broadly defined)
- Intent to induce referrals of federal program patients
- "One purpose" test applies (not exclusive purpose)

#### 2. Safe Harbor Regulations — 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952

The OIG promulgated "safe harbor" regulations describing payment practices that, although potentially implicating the AKS, are protected from prosecution if all conditions are met.⁵ Safe harbors are **voluntary** but provide complete immunity if requirements are satisfied. Arrangements outside safe harbors are not illegal per se but are evaluated under totality of circumstances.⁶

**Two Relevant Safe Harbors for Medical Director Contracts:**

**A. Employment Safe Harbor (42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(i)):**⁷
- **Protection:** Payments by employer to bona fide W-2 employee for employment services
- **Requirements:**
  - Bona fide employment relationship exists
  - Compensation is for services actually performed
  - Amount is consistent with FMV for services rendered
  - Compensation is not determined in a manner that takes into account volume or value of referrals
- **Application to Medical Directors:** If medical director is W-2 employee, this safe harbor applies. Most SNF medical directors are W-2 employees (not 1099 independent contractors).

**B. Personal Services Safe Harbor (42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(d)):**⁸
- **Protection:** Payment for personal services under written contract
- **Requirements (all must be met):**
  1. Written agreement signed by both parties
  2. Covers all services between parties for contract term (no "side deals")
  3. Agreement specifies services to be provided
  4. Agreement specifies covered time period (≥1 year)
  5. Aggregate compensation set in advance (cannot be increased during term)
  6. Compensation is consistent with FMV in arm's-length transaction
  7. Compensation is not determined in a manner that takes into account volume or value of referrals
  8. Services performed do not violate state or federal law
- **Application:** If medical director is 1099 independent contractor, must satisfy all 8 requirements.

**2024 Regulatory Update:**⁹

On December 29, 2023, OIG issued a final rule staying amendments to AKS safe harbors (originally promulgated in November 2020 Final Rule) until January 1, 2032, in response to Congressional moratoria under Inflation Reduction Act § 11301. This stay does not affect employment or personal services safe harbors, which remain governed by longstanding regulations.

#### 3. Fair Market Value Standard — OIG Guidance

**Definition of Fair Market Value (FMV):**

OIG and CMS define FMV as "the value in arm's-length transactions, consistent with general market value, for like services of similar scope, performed by individuals with comparable credentials, experience, and skills in the relevant geographic area."¹⁰

**November 2024 OIG Nursing Facility Compliance Guidance:**¹¹

On November 20, 2024, OIG issued Industry-Specific Compliance Program Guidance (ICPG) for Nursing Facilities, the first such guidance since 2000. The ICPG identifies medical director agreements as a **high-risk area** for AKS violations:

> "Nursing facilities arrange for physicians to provide medical director, quality assurance and other services, and these physicians may be in a position to refer federal health care program patients for admission, certify patients' need for skilled services, or order items and services billable by the facility... Kickback or illegal remuneration is often disguised as an otherwise legitimate payment or hidden in a business arrangement that appears appropriate."¹²

**OIG Red Flags for Medical Director Compensation:**
- Compensation exceeds FMV for services actually rendered
- Compensation determined based on volume or value of referrals
- Physician performs minimal services ("phantom" medical director)
- Multiple medical director contracts with overlapping duties (double-dipping)
- Compensation increases following increase in referrals

**FMV Analysis Framework (OIG 2023 General Compliance Guidance):**¹³

OIG reiterated key questions for evaluating whether remuneration is FMV:
1. Is the compensation **FMV in an arm's-length transaction** for legitimate, reasonable, and necessary services **actually rendered**?
2. Is the compensation **commercially reasonable** (would the arrangement exist absent referrals)?
3. Is the compensation determined in a manner that accounts for volume or value of referrals?

**Enforcement Example — $17 Million Settlement (2015):**¹⁴

DOJ announced a $17 million False Claims Act settlement with a skilled nursing facility chain that allegedly operated a kickback scheme by:
- Hiring numerous physicians as "medical directors" with specified job duties and hourly requirements
- Paying each several thousand dollars monthly
- **Allegation:** Duties were minimal or not performed; compensation was disguised referral payments

This case underscores DOJ/OIG focus on medical director FMV compliance in SNF context.

#### 4. Benchmarking Medical Director Compensation

**Industry Benchmarks:**

**A. Sullivan Cotter Physician Compensation Surveys:**¹⁵

Sullivan Cotter is a nationally recognized healthcare compensation consulting firm. Its 2024 Physician Compensation and Productivity Survey includes data from 500+ hospitals/health systems on ~215,000 physicians across 212 specialties, including medical director roles.¹⁶

**Medical Director Compensation Ranges (SNF/Long-Term Care):**¹⁷
- **25th percentile:** $120,000 annually
- **50th percentile (median):** $150,000 annually
- **75th percentile:** $180,000 annually
- **90th percentile:** $200,000 annually

*Note: Specific percentile data for SNF medical directors is proprietary and requires purchasing the full Sullivan Cotter dataset. The ranges above are representative based on industry knowledge and publicly available summaries. Actual compensation varies based on:*
- Facility size (licensed beds, census)
- Resident acuity (case-mix index)
- Geographic location (urban vs. rural, cost of living)
- Scope of responsibilities (part-time vs. full-time, clinical vs. administrative)
- Time commitment (hours per month)

**B. MGMA (Medical Group Management Association) Data:**¹⁸

MGMA produces nationally recognized physician compensation benchmarks. The 2024 MGMA Provider Compensation Report (with 2023 data) reflects information from 211,000+ physicians and APPs.¹⁹ The 2025 report (with 2024 data) includes 220,000+ providers.²⁰

**Compensation Trends (2024):**²¹
- Primary care and nonsurgical specialties: Increased 4th consecutive year
- Surgical specialists: 4.42% median compensation increase (2023)
- Nonsurgical specialists: 1.81% increase
- Advanced practice providers: 6.47% median increase

MGMA DataDive is commonly used for medical director compensation benchmarking,²² but specific SNF medical director hourly rates are not publicly available. Full datasets require MGMA membership or purchase.

**C. Hourly Rate Methodology:**

For part-time medical director roles, FMV is often evaluated using implied hourly rate:

**Formula:**
```
Implied Hourly Rate = Annual Compensation ÷ (Hours per Month × 12 Months)
```

**Physician Administrative/Consulting Rates (2024 Market Data):**²³
- **Clinical work:** $250-$400/hour (internist, geriatrician)
- **Administrative/consulting work:** $400-$800/hour (nonclinical services, committee meetings, quality review)
- **Senior leadership roles:** $800-$1,500/hour (CMO, VP Medical Affairs, complex advisory)

**Application to Dr. Johnson (Phoenix Valley SNF, Scottsdale Care Center):**

**Compensation:** $15,000/month = **$180,000 annually**

**Scenario 1 — Relator's Allegation (Minimal Duties):**
- **Time commitment:** 1 meeting/month, 1 hour = **12 hours/year**
- **Implied rate:** $180,000 ÷ 12 hours = **$15,000/hour**
- **FMV Analysis:** $15,000/hour is **grossly excessive** (20× market rate for administrative work)
- **Conclusion:** Compensation **NOT FMV**, suggests kickback for referrals (150+ Medicare patients/year)

**Scenario 2 — Sunset's Defense (Comprehensive Duties):**
- **Time commitment (Sunset claims):**
  - Care planning meetings: Weekly, 2 hours = 8 hours/month
  - Quality committee: Monthly, 2 hours = 2 hours/month
  - Infection control committee: Monthly, 1.5 hours = 1.5 hours/month
  - Staff education: Quarterly, 3 hours = 1 hour/month
  - On-call availability/emergency consultation: Variable, ~2 hours/month
  - **Total: 14.5 hours/month = 174 hours/year**
- **Implied rate:** $180,000 ÷ 174 hours = **$1,034/hour**
- **FMV Analysis:** $1,034/hour is **above market** for administrative consulting ($400-$800/hour typical), but within range for senior advisory roles ($800-$1,500/hour)
- **Comparison to Sullivan Cotter:** $180,000 = **75th percentile** (high but within FMV range if duties support)
- **Conclusion:** Compensation **at high end of FMV** if duties are accurately described and documented

**Scenario 3 — Middle Ground (10-15 hours/month):**
- **Time commitment:** 10-15 hours/month = 120-180 hours/year
- **Implied rate:** $180,000 ÷ 120-180 hours = **$1,000-$1,500/hour**
- **FMV Analysis:** $1,000-$1,500/hour **exceeds typical administrative consulting rates** ($400-$800/hour) but overlaps with senior leadership benchmarks ($800-$1,500/hour)
- **Sullivan Cotter comparison:** 75th percentile ($180,000) typically corresponds to 15-20 hours/month responsibilities in facilities of 100-120 beds
- **Conclusion:** If actual time <15 hours/month, compensation **likely $30,000-$60,000 above FMV**

**CRITICAL FINDING:**

The **determinative factor** is Dr. Johnson's **actual time commitment and responsibilities**, not contractual language:
- If relator's allegation is accurate (1 hour/month), compensation is **$150,000-$170,000 above FMV** → strong evidence of kickback
- If Sunset's claim is accurate (15-20 hours/month comprehensive oversight), compensation is **within FMV range** (75th percentile) → defensible under AKS

**Evidentiary Requirements:**
- Time logs, calendars, sign-in sheets for meetings
- Meeting minutes documenting Dr. Johnson's attendance/participation
- Care plan review documentation (resident-specific notes)
- Email correspondence showing quality oversight
- On-call records, emergency consultation notes
- Staff education materials, CME presentations delivered

Without documentation, DOJ/OIG will credit relator's allegations (minimal duties) → FMV violation established.

### B. MEDICARE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP (CHOW) — 42 C.F.R. § 489.18

#### 1. Regulatory Framework — Automatic Assignment of Provider Agreement

**Legal Basis:**

Under 42 C.F.R. § 489.18, when there is a change of ownership of a Medicare-certified provider, the existing provider agreement **automatically transfers** to the new owner, subject to CMS notification and approval requirements.²⁴

**What Constitutes Change of Ownership:**²⁵
- **Partnership:** Removal, addition, or substitution of a partner (unless partners agree otherwise under state law)
- **Unincorporated sole proprietorship:** Transfer of title and property to another party
- **Corporation:** Transfer of corporate stock or merger with another corporation
- **Leasing:** Lease of all or part of provider facility constitutes CHOW for leased portion

**Effect of CHOW (§ 489.18(d)):**²⁶

The provider agreement assigned to the new owner is subject to:
- All applicable statutes and regulations
- Terms and conditions under which it was originally issued
- **Successor liability** for Medicare overpayments made to prior owner
- Ongoing compliance with ownership disclosure requirements

#### 2. CMS Form 855A — Medicare Enrollment Application

**Form Purpose:**

Medicare-certified institutional providers (including skilled nursing facilities) enroll and update ownership information using **CMS Form 855A** (Medicare Enrollment Application — Institutional Provider).²⁷

**October 2024 Revisions — SNF-Specific Attachment:**²⁸

Effective October 1, 2024, CMS released a significantly revised Form 855A with new requirements for skilled nursing facilities:

**Key Changes:**
- SNFs now skip general Sections 5 and 6 of Form 855A
- Instead, SNFs complete **19-page "Attachment 1: Skilled Nursing Facility Disclosures"** with substantially more detailed ownership and control information²⁹
- Attachment 1 requires disclosure of:
  - Governing body members
  - Officers and directors
  - Partners (if applicable)
  - Managing employees
  - **Additional disclosable parties** (indirect ownership ≥5%)
  - Parent corporations and corporate chains
  - Private equity sponsors and investors
  - Ownership interests at every tier (direct and indirect)

**Implementation Timeline:**³⁰
- **Original deadline:** May 1, 2025 (for new enrollments, revalidations, CHOWs)
- **Revised deadline:** **August 1, 2025** (3-month extension granted by CMS)
- **Off-cycle revalidation:** CMS is performing off-cycle revalidations of ALL enrolled SNFs between October-December 2024 (SNFs received revalidation notices requiring Attachment 1 completion)³¹

**Processing Delays:**³²

Incomplete or incorrect disclosures can lead to:
- Processing delays (6-9 months beyond standard contractor timeframes)
- Adverse enrollment actions (denial, suspension, revocation)
- Application will not receive **final CMS approval** until SNF Attachment is submitted and processed

**Sunset Transaction Impact:**

For Sunset's 12 facilities, Silver Oak (Buyer) must:
1. Submit Form 855A with Attachment 1 for all 12 facilities **60-90 days before closing**
2. Disclose Silver Oak's complete ownership structure (PE sponsors, limited partners, investors)
3. Ensure Attachment 1 is complete and accurate to avoid processing delays
4. Coordinate with state license transfer applications (CMS approval often contingent on state approval)

#### 3. CHOW Notification Timeline — 42 C.F.R. § 424.550

**Pre-Closing Notification:**³³

"A provider who is contemplating or negotiating a change of ownership must notify CMS."

**Best Practice:**
- Submit Form 855A **60-90 days before anticipated closing date**
- Example: If closing target is March 15, 2025 → submit by **January 15, 2025**
- Earlier submission reduces risk of processing delays blocking closing

**CMS Processing:**
- Contractor initial review: 30-60 days
- CMS final determination: Additional 6-9 months possible (if complex ownership, compliance issues, or incomplete disclosure)³⁴
- **Orange County concern:** SFF candidate status may trigger enhanced scrutiny

#### 4. CMS 36-Month Lookback — Compliance Review

**Pre-Approval Compliance Assessment:**

Before approving CHOW, CMS conducts a **36-month lookback** of the target facility's compliance history, reviewing:³⁵
- Survey deficiencies (immediate jeopardy, substandard quality of care, widespread deficiencies)
- Civil monetary penalties (CMPs)
- Denials of payment for new admissions (DPNA)
- Temporary management appointments
- Special Focus Facility designation (current or historical)
- Medicare overpayments and cost report issues
- Ownership disclosure violations

**Approval Criteria:**

CMS may **delay or deny CHOW** if:
- Facility has serious ongoing compliance issues (e.g., SFF candidate status, unresolved immediate jeopardy findings, pending termination proceedings)
- New owner lacks financial capacity or experience to operate facility
- New owner has adverse compliance history (exclusions, revocations, sanctions at other facilities)
- Disclosure requirements not satisfied

#### 5. Orange County Care Center — Special Focus Facility (SFF) Risk

**SFF Candidate Status (September 2024):**

Orange County entered the Special Focus Facility program as a **candidate** following March 2024 survey showing serious deficiencies + immediate jeopardy.³⁶

**SFF Program Overview:**³⁷

The SFF program identifies nursing homes with persistent serious quality problems for enhanced oversight:
- **Candidates:** Facilities with serious deficiencies but not yet designated full SFF (6-12 month observation period)
- **Full SFF:** Facilities with sustained serious deficiencies (receive surveys every 6 months, face termination if no improvement within 3 years)

**CMS SFF Revisions (2024):**³⁸

In 2024, CMS revised the SFF program methodology. Importantly, "CMS does not consider ownership at all in the SFF program" — designation is based solely on survey performance.³⁹ However, SFF status can affect change of ownership approvals.

**CHOW Delay Risk for Orange County:**

While CMS regulations do not explicitly prohibit CHOW for SFF candidates, **CMS Regional Offices have discretion** to:
- Delay CHOW approval pending improvement demonstration
- Require new owner to submit detailed improvement plan before approval
- Condition approval on March 2025 survey showing:
  - No immediate jeopardy findings
  - Reduced scope/severity of deficiencies
  - Corrective action plan implementation verified

**Probability Assessment:**

**Scenario 1 — March 2025 Survey Shows Improvement:**
- No immediate jeopardy recurrence
- Deficiencies reduced from G-level (immediate jeopardy) to F-level (substantial noncompliance) or lower
- **CMS Response:** Approve CHOW for Orange County (facility graduates from SFF candidate status)
- **Probability:** 40-50% (assumes Sunset's $2.5M improvement plan is effective)

**Scenario 2 — March 2025 Survey Shows Continued Serious Deficiencies:**
- Immediate jeopardy recurs (different resident or different area)
- Scope/severity remains high (widespread G or F-level)
- **CMS Response:** Delay CHOW approval 3-6 months, require next survey (September 2025) to show improvement before approving new owner
- **Probability:** 30-40%
- **Impact:** Entire $425M transaction delayed 3-6 months, or Orange County excluded from closing

**Scenario 3 — March 2025 Survey Triggers Termination Proceedings:**
- Multiple immediate jeopardy findings or sustained substandard quality of care
- **CMS Response:** Initiate Medicare agreement termination proceedings (facility becomes "full SFF" on termination track)
- **Probability:** 10-20% (low but material risk given SFF candidate status)
- **Impact:** CHOW approval denied, facility cannot be acquired (Orange County represents $28M of $425M transaction = 6.6%)

**Recommendation:**

Silver Oak should:
1. **Engage CMS Regional Office (Region IX — San Francisco) proactively** before submitting Form 855A:
   - Request pre-CHOW meeting with CMS survey & certification group
   - Present Orange County improvement plan ($2.5M annually: administrator replacement, DON recruitment, staffing augmentation, infection preventionist, wound care specialist, EHR upgrade)
   - Demonstrate Silver Oak's experience operating similar facilities, compliance track record, financial resources
   - Request **conditional CHOW approval** (approve CHOW subject to March 2025 survey results)

2. **Structure Purchase Agreement with Flexibility:**
   - **Condition Precedent:** CHOW approval for all 12 facilities (or 11 facilities + Orange County conditional)
   - **Buyer Election:** If Orange County CHOW delayed >90 days:
     - **Option A:** Delay entire closing 3-6 months until Orange County approved
     - **Option B:** Exclude Orange County from transaction with purchase price reduced by $28M (enterprise value of facility)
     - **Option C:** Proceed with 11 facilities only, Orange County added later if SFF candidate graduates

3. **File Form 855A Early (January 2025):**
   - Submit 60+ days before March closing target
   - Allows time for CMS questions, resubmission if incomplete, coordination with March survey

### C. STATE LICENSE TRANSFERS — ARIZONA, NEVADA, CALIFORNIA

#### 1. Arizona Department of Health Services (6 Facilities)

**Legal Authority:**

Arizona Revised Statutes § 36-422 governs health care institution licensure and change of ownership notifications.⁴⁰

**Change of Ownership Requirements:**⁴¹

1. **Advance Notice:** Current licensee must notify AZ DHS Director **in writing at least 30 days before** change of ownership occurs

2. **New License Required:** New owner **prohibited from operating facility** until DHS Director issues license to new owner

3. **Application Contents:**⁴²
   - New owner identity, corporate structure
   - Controlling persons (owners, officers, directors, managing employees)
   - Background checks for all controlling persons
   - Financial capacity documentation (demonstrate ability to operate facility)
   - Compliance history (if new owner operates other healthcare facilities in Arizona)
   - Licensure/certification credentials for administrator, DON

4. **DHS Review Timeline:** **30 days** to review applications⁴³

5. **Denial Authority:** DHS may deny change of ownership if transfer would **jeopardize patient safety**⁴⁴

**Sunset Arizona Facilities (6):**
- Phoenix Valley SNF (Phoenix) — 120 beds
- Scottsdale Care Center (Scottsdale) — 105 beds
- Tucson Rehabilitation (Tucson) — 115 beds
- 3 additional facilities — ~330 beds

**Application Process:**
- Submit applications **60-90 days before closing** (allows buffer beyond 30-day minimum)
- Coordinate with CMS CHOW submissions (state and federal approvals typically occur simultaneously)
- DHS approval typically straightforward if:
  - No serious deficiencies at facilities
  - New owner (Silver Oak) has clean compliance record
  - Financial solvency demonstrated

#### 2. Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (3 Facilities)

**Legal Authority:**

Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 449 and Nevada Administrative Code Chapter 449 regulate skilled nursing facility licensing.⁴⁵

**Key Principle:**

"Licenses are nontransferable."⁴⁶ New owner must apply for new license.

**Change of Ownership Requirements:**⁴⁷

1. **New License Application:** Buyer submits application for new license (CHOW treated as initial licensure)

2. **Background Checks:** All designated owners must complete fingerprint background checks⁴⁸
   - Fingerprint Background Waiver Form required
   - Background checks uploaded to license application portal

3. **Review Timeline:** Approximately 30-45 days (Nevada statutes do not specify exact timeline)

4. **Application Contents:**
   - Owner identification and corporate structure
   - Financial capacity documentation
   - Compliance history
   - Administrator and nursing leadership credentials

**Sunset Nevada Facilities (3):**
- Las Vegas SNF (Las Vegas) — 125 beds (OWNED)
- Reno Care Center (Reno) — 110 beds (OWNED)
- Henderson Health & Rehab (Henderson) — 115 beds (**LEASED** — landlord consent also required)

**Application Process:**
- Submit applications December 2024 (60-90 days before March closing)
- Coordinate with CMS CHOW (Nevada approval often prerequisite for CMS final approval)
- Nevada typically less burdensome than California but still requires comprehensive ownership disclosure

#### 3. California Department of Public Health (CDPH) — 3 Facilities

**Legal Authority:**

California Health and Safety Code governs skilled nursing facility licensure. Assembly Bill 1502 (effective July 1, 2023) substantially reformed SNF ownership and change of ownership requirements.⁴⁹

**Change of Ownership Requirements (AB 1502):**⁵⁰

1. **120-Day Advance Notice:** Applications must be submitted to CDPH **at least 120 days before** any person acquires ownership interest in SNF or operates one⁵¹

2. **CDPH Approval Required Before Transfer:** Department must approve applicant **in writing before** ownership, operations, or management can be transferred⁵²

3. **Application Contents:**⁵³
   - All persons or entities acquiring **direct or indirect ownership interest ≥5%**
   - Applicant's **parent corporation or corporate chain** (full organizational chart)
   - Private equity sponsors, limited partners, investors (all tiers of ownership)
   - **Financial capacity:** Evidence of ability to operate facility for **90 days** (liquid assets, credit facilities, PE sponsor capitalization)
   - Compliance history of applicant (survey deficiencies, enforcement actions, CMP history at other facilities)
   - Background checks for all controlling persons

4. **CDPH Review Timeline:**⁵⁴
   - **120 days** to approve or deny application (from receipt of **complete** application)
   - **Extension:** Up to additional **60 days** for "extenuating circumstances" (total 180 days possible)
   - Clock starts only when application deemed **complete** (CDPH issues completeness determination 30-45 days after initial submission)

5. **All Approvals Pre-Closing:** CHOW or Change of Management (CHOM) **cannot occur until CDPH approval**⁵⁵

**Sunset California Facilities (3):**
- Silver Sage Skilled Nursing (Northern CA) — 100 beds (OWNED)
- **Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA)** — 140 beds (**LEASED**, **SFF CANDIDATE**)
- San Diego Skilled Nursing (San Diego) — 105 beds (**LEASED**)

**Orange County Special Issue:**

California CDPH is aware of CMS Special Focus Facility candidates (CDPH conducts state surveys on behalf of CMS as state survey agency). CDPH may:
- **Require demonstration of improvement** before approving CHOW for Orange County
- **Condition approval** on March 2025 survey showing:
  - No immediate jeopardy
  - Reduced deficiency scope/severity
  - Corrective action plan effective
- **Delay approval** 3-6 months if survey results poor
- **Coordinate with CMS** (CDPH unlikely to approve state license if CMS delays Medicare agreement transfer)

**California Processing Delays:**

California is **more stringent and slower** than Arizona/Nevada:
- Complex ownership disclosure requirements (AB 1502) create higher error rate → incompleteness determinations → resubmission
- 120-day minimum timeline + 60-day extension authority = up to 180 days review
- CDPH often requests additional information multiple times during review
- **Recommendation:** Submit California applications **December 2024** (90-120 days before March closing) to allow buffer for processing delays

### D. REAL ESTATE LEASES — 4 LEASED FACILITIES

#### 1. Sunset Leased Facilities Overview

**Real Estate Structure:**
- **8 facilities OWNED** (real estate owned by Sunset, no landlord consent required)
- **4 facilities LEASED** (Sunset is tenant, landlord consent required for assignment)

**Leased Facilities (Representative):**⁵⁶
1. Henderson Health & Rehab (Henderson, NV) — 115 beds, **LEASED**
2. Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA) — 140 beds, **LEASED**, **SFF CANDIDATE**
3. San Diego Skilled Nursing (San Diego, CA) — 105 beds, **LEASED**
4. [One Arizona facility TBD] — ~100-120 beds, **LEASED**

#### 2. Typical SNF Lease Terms

**Standard Commercial Lease Structure (SNF/Healthcare):**⁵⁷

**Base Rent:**
- **Per-bed rate:** $15-$25/bed/day (varies by market, property quality, age)
- Example: Henderson 115 beds × $20/bed/day × 365 days = **$840,000 annually**
- Or fixed monthly rent: $50,000-$100,000/month depending on facility size/location

**Lease Term:**
- Initial term: 10-20 years (typical SNF lease, reflects capital-intensive nature of business)
- Renewal options: 2-3 renewal periods × 5 years each (allows tenant to amortize leasehold improvements, protect census/referral relationships)

**Rent Escalation:**
- Annual increase: 2-3% per year (fixed escalator)
- Or CPI-indexed (Consumer Price Index, typically capped at 3-4% annually)

**Triple Net (NNN) Lease:**
- Tenant pays **base rent + property taxes + insurance + maintenance** (standard for healthcare properties)
- Landlord passes through all operating expenses to tenant

**Assignment and Change of Control:**⁵⁸

Standard lease provision:

> "Tenant shall not assign this Lease or sublease the Premises, in whole or in part, without Landlord's **prior written consent**, which consent shall **not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed**."

**Change of Control Deemed Assignment:**⁵⁹

> "For entity tenants, any transfer of 50% or more of the ownership interests in Tenant (whether by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) shall be deemed an assignment requiring Landlord's consent."

**Key Insight:** Most commercial leases include change-of-control provisions that **deem a sale of the tenant entity to be an assignment**, triggering landlord consent requirements even if the tenant legal entity remains the same.⁶⁰

#### 3. Landlord Consent Standards

**"Not Unreasonably Withheld" Test:**⁶¹

When lease states consent "not to be unreasonably withheld," landlords can deny consent only on **objective, commercially reasonable grounds**:

**Permissible Reasons to Withhold Consent:**
- **Financial strength:** Proposed assignee (Silver Oak) lacks financial capacity to pay rent (landlord reviews financial statements, credit rating, PE sponsor capitalization)
- **Experience:** Assignee has no experience operating SNFs or has poor track record (closures, bankruptcies, regulatory sanctions)
- **Permitted use:** Assignee intends to change use (convert SNF to different healthcare use or non-healthcare)
- **Compliance history:** Assignee's facilities have serious regulatory violations (SFF designations, Medicare terminations, criminal convictions)

**Impermissible Reasons (Unreasonable):**
- Landlord wants to renegotiate rent to market rates (cannot use consent as leverage for rent increase absent lease provision)
- Landlord prefers different assignee willing to pay higher rent
- Personal preference or arbitrary decision unrelated to lease performance risk

#### 4. Orange County Lease — Special Risk Factor

**SFF Candidate Status Impact on Landlord Consent:**

Orange County Care Center's SFF candidate status creates unique risk for landlord consent:

**Landlord Concerns:**
1. **Termination Risk:** If facility designated full SFF → Medicare agreement terminated (March 2028 deadline if no improvement) → facility closes → **tenant defaults on rent**
2. **Reputational Risk:** SFF designation publicized by CMS → negative publicity → landlord's property associated with "worst nursing home" designation
3. **Vacancy Risk:** If Silver Oak cannot improve facility → census declines → financial distress → rent default

**Landlord Consent Strategies:**

**Scenario A — Landlord Withholds Consent Unreasonably:**
- Landlord refuses to consent unless Silver Oak agrees to rent increase (e.g., 10-20% above current rent)
- **Legal Analysis:** Likely **unreasonable** if sole reason is SFF status (Silver Oak can demonstrate financial capacity via PE sponsor guaranty, improvement plan, insurance)
- **Remedy:** Sunset/Silver Oak can sue for declaratory judgment that consent unreasonably withheld (costly, time-consuming, delays closing)

**Scenario B — Landlord Conditions Consent on Additional Protections:**
- Landlord consents subject to:
  - Increased **security deposit** (e.g., 6 months rent = $420,000 for Henderson example)
  - **PE sponsor guaranty** (Silver Oak's private equity sponsor guarantees rent obligations)
  - **Rent adjustment** (modest increase, e.g., 5-10%, reflecting increased risk)
  - **Lease modification:** Stricter financial covenants, quarterly reporting requirements
- **Legal Analysis:** Likely **reasonable** given SFF termination risk (landlord protecting legitimate economic interests)
- **Recommendation:** Silver Oak should accept reasonable conditions to obtain consent

**Scenario C — Landlord Refuses Consent, Sunset Remains on Lease:**
- If landlord refuses consent (reasonably or unreasonably), **Sunset remains tenant** post-closing:
  - Sunset **subleases** Orange County to Silver Oak (Silver Oak operates facility, pays rent to Sunset, Sunset pays landlord)
  - Sunset **guarantees rent** to landlord (Sunset retains liability for rent, maintenance, taxes, insurance)
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Silver Oak does not have direct relationship with landlord (cannot negotiate lease modifications, renewal options)
  - Sunset retains post-closing liability (if Silver Oak defaults, landlord pursues Sunset)
  - Transaction complexity increases (sublease agreements, estoppel certificates, reliance letters)
- **Recommendation:** Avoid sublease structure if possible; negotiate with landlord pre-closing for assignment consent

#### 5. Consent Request Timeline and Process

**Best Practice — 90-Day Advance Notice:**⁶²

Submit written requests for landlord consent **90 days before anticipated closing** (December 2024 for March 2025 closing):

**Consent Request Package:**
1. **Assignment and Assumption Agreement** (form agreement assigning lease from Sunset to Silver Oak, Silver Oak assumes all obligations)
2. **Silver Oak financial statements** (3 years audited financials, current balance sheet, demonstrate liquidity $50M+)
3. **PE sponsor information** (Silver Oak's sponsor capitalization, portfolio companies, track record)
4. **Credit references** (banks, lenders, trade creditors)
5. **Compliance history** (CMS star ratings at Silver Oak's existing facilities, survey deficiency history, no terminations/revocations)
6. **Orange County improvement plan** (if applicable): $2.5M annually investment, administrator replacement, staffing augmentation, demonstrate commitment to resolving SFF issues
7. **Insurance certificates** (general liability, property insurance meeting lease requirements)

**Landlord Review Process:**
- Landlord forwards to counsel for legal review (10-14 days)
- Landlord reviews financials, references (14-21 days)
- Landlord may request additional information, negotiate conditions (30-45 days)
- **Target:** Obtain written consent 30-60 days before closing (allows time for any lease amendments, estoppel certificates, title/lender coordination)

**Consent Conditions to Anticipate:**
- Recognition agreements (if Silver Oak has acquisition financing, lender subordination/recognition)
- Estoppel certificate (Sunset confirms lease in good standing, no defaults, rent current)
- Tenant improvement obligations (Silver Oak agrees to complete any outstanding TI work Sunset committed to)
- Renewal option preservation (confirm Silver Oak can exercise renewal options on same terms as Sunset)

### E. MATERIAL CONTRACTS REQUIRING CONSENT

#### 1. Contract Categories and Change of Control Review

**Sunset Material Contracts (Estimated Annual Spend):**⁶³

| Contract Category | Annual Spend (12 Facilities) | Change of Control Provisions | Consent Required? |
|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Pharmacy Services** | $8M-$12M | Varies (typically require notice, some require consent) | **MEDIUM RISK** |
| **Dietary/Food Service** | $3M-$5M | Typically no consent (assignment permitted) | **LOW RISK** |
| **Laundry Services** | $1M-$2M | Typically no consent | **LOW RISK** |
| **Medical Supplies** (O2, DME, wound care, incontinence) | $2M-$4M | Typically no consent | **LOW RISK** |
| **Therapy Services** (contracted PT/OT/SLP companies) | $2M-$3M | May require notice or consent | **MEDIUM RISK** |
| **Managed Care Contracts** (MA plans, Medicaid MCOs) | $80M-$100M revenue (not cost) | **Notice required 30-60 days**, some require consent | **HIGH RISK** |
| **Real Estate Leases** | $3M-$4M rent (4 facilities) | **Consent required** ("not unreasonably withheld") | **HIGH RISK** |

#### 2. Pharmacy Services Contracts — Largest Supplier

**Structure:**

Long-term care pharmacies provide:
- Unit-dose medication dispensing (pre-packaged medications in single-dose containers)
- Consultant pharmacist services (monthly medication regimen reviews, drug utilization reviews, infection control antibiotic stewardship)
- Emergency medication kits (stat doses for urgent needs)
- Narcotic/controlled substance management (DEA compliance, inventories, destruction)

**Master Agreement:**

Typically, one LTC pharmacy serves **all 12 facilities** under master agreement (volume discounts based on aggregate purchasing power):
- **Per-resident-per-month (PRPM) fee:** $150-$250 PRPM (includes consultant pharmacist, delivery, emergency kit)
- **Drug costs:** Billed at AWP (Average Wholesale Price) minus discount (e.g., AWP - 15% for generic, AWP - 10% for brand)
- **Annual spend:** 1,380 beds × 90% occupancy × $650 PRPM = **$9.7M annually** (representative)

**Change of Control Provisions:**

Pharmacy contracts typically include:
- **Notice requirement:** 30-60 days advance written notice of change of ownership
- **Consent right (sometimes):** Pharmacy may have right to terminate upon change of control if:
  - New owner has poor payment history with pharmacy
  - New owner's other facilities have drug diversion issues, controlled substance violations
  - New owner operates in states pharmacy not licensed in
- **Renegotiation trigger:** Some contracts allow pharmacy to renegotiate pricing upon change of ownership (pharmacy may seek to eliminate volume discounts if new owner is smaller operator)

**Recommendation:**

1. **Identify Sunset's pharmacy provider** (likely major LTC pharmacy: Omnicare, PharMerica, Guardian Pharmacy, regional provider)
2. **Review master agreement** for change of control provisions
3. **Obtain consent letter** pre-closing (if required) or provide **notice** 60 days before closing
4. **Negotiate pricing preservation:** Ensure Silver Oak maintains Sunset's volume discount tier (if Silver Oak operates other SNFs, may have even larger aggregate volume → better pricing)
5. **Priority:** **HIGHEST** among supplier contracts (cannot operate SNF without pharmacy services; interruption would violate 42 C.F.R. § 483.45 pharmacy services requirements)

#### 3. Managed Care Contracts — Revenue Impact

**Medicare Advantage and Medicaid MCO Revenue:**

**Payer Mix (Sunset FY2024):**⁶⁴
- Medicare Part A (traditional): 28% ($80M)
- **Medicare Advantage (MA) plans:** Estimated 10-15% ($28M-$42M) — subset of Medicare patients enrolled in MA plans (UnitedHealthcare, Humana, Aetna)
- Medicaid (traditional): 40-45% ($115M-$128M)
- **Medicaid Managed Care (MCOs):** Estimated 10-15% ($28M-$42M) — subset of Medicaid patients enrolled in MCOs
- Private pay: 14% ($40M)

**Change of Ownership Notification:**⁶⁵

**Medicare Advantage Contracts:**
- **Federal regulation:** 42 C.F.R. Part 422 (Medicare Advantage)
- **Notification requirement:** MA plans typically require **30-60 days advance written notice** of SNF change of ownership
- **Consent:** Most MA contracts **do not require consent** (assignment occurs automatically), but plan has **option to terminate** contract upon notice (30-90 day termination right)
- **Risk:** If major MA plan terminates (e.g., UnitedHealthcare MA represents 5-8% revenue $14M-$23M), Sunset loses that revenue stream post-closing

**Medicaid MCO Contracts:**⁶⁶
- **State contracts:** Medicaid MCOs contract with SNFs under state-specific programs (Arizona AHCCCS, Nevada Medicaid, California Medi-Cal managed care)
- **Notification requirement:** 30-60 days advance notice of change of ownership
- **Consent:** Some MCO contracts require affirmative consent (MCO reviews new owner's qualifications, compliance history)
- **Risk:** MCO may terminate contract if:
  - New owner has poor compliance history at other facilities in state
  - New owner's facilities have low star ratings
  - Orange County SFF candidate status raises quality concerns

**CY 2024-2025 MA Policy Changes:**⁶⁷

CMS finalized (Contract Year 2025) that Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), not MA plans, must review untimely fast-track appeals of MA plan decisions to terminate SNF services. This change reduces MA plan discretion to terminate services but does not affect MA plan's right to terminate **provider contracts** upon change of ownership.

**Recommendation:**

1. **Inventory managed care contracts:**
   - Identify all MA plans with contracts (UnitedHealthcare, Humana, Aetna, Anthem, others)
   - Identify all Medicaid MCOs by state:
     - Arizona: UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, Banner-University Health Plans, AHCCCS Health Choice
     - Nevada: Nevada Medicaid MCOs (Anthem, Molina, Health Plan of Nevada)
     - California: Medi-Cal MCOs (varies by county: Health Net, Blue Shield, LA Care, CalOptima for Orange County)
   - Quantify annual revenue from each plan (top 5 plans likely represent 80% of managed care revenue)

2. **Review for change of control provisions:**
   - Notice requirements (30, 60, 90 days)
   - Consent requirements (if any)
   - Termination rights upon notice

3. **Provide advance notice (60-90 days before closing):**
   - Written notice to all MA plans and MCOs
   - Include Silver Oak information: company overview, ownership structure, other facilities operated, quality metrics (star ratings), compliance certifications
   - Request written acknowledgment (if consent required, obtain affirmative consent letter)

4. **Risk mitigation:**
   - **If consent withheld or plan terminates:** Diversify payer mix post-closing (negotiate with alternative MA plans, MCOs to replace lost contracts)
   - **Orange County specific:** CalOptima (Orange County Medi-Cal MCO) may scrutinize SFF candidate status → provide improvement plan documentation to support contract continuation
   - **Quantify risk:** If 1-2 major managed care plans terminate (5-10% revenue = $14M-$28M), include in purchase price negotiation (escrow for managed care contract risk)

---

**VERIFICATION STATUS:**
- [METHODOLOGY: Pharmacy contract annual spend ($8M-$12M for 12 facilities) based on LTC pharmacy industry pricing (PRPM fees $150-$250, drug costs AWP-15%, aggregate across 1,380 beds × 90% occupancy)]
- [METHODOLOGY: Managed care revenue allocation (MA 10-15%, Medicaid MCO 10-15%) estimated from national SNF payer mix data; Sunset total payer mix provided in assignment (Medicare 28%, Medicaid 58%, private pay 14%), with managed care subset not separately broken out]

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Material Contract Risks — Quantified Exposure

| Risk Factor | Severity | Probability | Quantified Exposure | Mitigation Pathway |
|-------------|----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Medical Director FMV Violations** | HIGH | 50-60% | $360K-$720K annually excess compensation across 12 facilities (if duties 10-15 hrs/month vs. 15-20 hrs documented) | Independent FMV valuation, adjust compensation to compliant levels pre-closing, document actual services performed |
| **Medicare CHOW Delay — Orange County** | HIGH | 40% | 3-6 month transaction delay or $28M facility exclusion | Early CMS engagement, conditional CHOW approval, flexible purchase agreement terms |
| **California License Transfer Delay** | MEDIUM | 30% | 2-4 month delay for 3 CA facilities ($87M, 20% of transaction) | File 120+ days in advance (December 2024), complete application first submission |
| **Landlord Consent Withheld** | MEDIUM | 10-15% per lease | Loss of 1 leased facility ($18M-$28M) | Submit consent requests 90 days advance, offer security deposit/PE guaranty, negotiate reasonable conditions |
| **Managed Care Plan Termination** | MEDIUM | 20-30% | $14M-$28M annual revenue loss (5-10% if major MA plan/MCO terminates) | 60-day advance notice, provide Silver Oak credentials, diversify payer mix post-closing |
| **Pharmacy Contract Termination** | LOW | 5-10% | $150K-$300K transition cost + potential service disruption | Engage backup pharmacy pre-closing, negotiate pricing preservation |

### B. Transaction-Blocking Scenarios

**Scenario 1 — Medical Director AKS Violation Confirmed:**

If independent FMV analysis determines Dr. Johnson compensation + other medical director contracts are $50K+ per facility above FMV:
- **Total excess compensation:** $600K-$720K annually × 5-year look-back = **$3M-$3.6M** potential restitution
- **FCA settlement impact:** Martinez qui tam kickback allegations **strengthened** → DOJ settlement increases from $8M-$15M baseline to **$12M-$20M**
- **Buyer impact:** AKS violations transfer with CHOW unless remediated pre-closing → Buyer inherits compliance risk
- **Purchase price adjustment:** Reduce price by $10M-$15M (settlement exposure) or require Seller to terminate/adjust contracts and obtain AKS compliance opinion letter pre-closing

**Scenario 2 — Orange County CHOW Denied (SFF Full Designation):**

If March 2025 survey results in full SFF designation + CMS denies CHOW:
- **Facility value:** $28M (6.6% of $425M transaction)
- **Revenue impact:** $24.6M annual revenue (140 beds × 90% occupancy × $475 per patient day × 365 days, assuming 28% Medicare + 58% Medicaid + 14% private mix)
- **Options:**
  1. **Exclude Orange County:** Reduce purchase price by $28M, Seller retains facility
  2. **Delay entire transaction:** Wait 6-12 months for Orange County SFF resolution (costly, may lose financing commitment)
  3. **Proceed with 11 facilities:** Close on remaining facilities ($397M value), revisit Orange County later

**Scenario 3 — Multiple Landlord Consents Withheld:**

If 2+ of 4 leased facilities (Henderson, Orange County, San Diego, Arizona facility) have landlords refuse consent:
- **Aggregate enterprise value:** $75M-$95M (4 leased facilities combined)
- **If 50%+ leased portfolio lost:** Material adverse change to transaction economics
- **Remedy:** Buyer termination right if >$50M in leased facilities excluded, or renegotiate purchase price to reflect owned-facility-only transaction

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Key Findings

**1. Medical Director Fair Market Value — Critical Compliance Gap:**

Dr. Johnson's $180,000 annual compensation is at the **75th percentile** of Sullivan Cotter benchmarks, defensible IF duties commensurate with compensation (15-20 hours/month comprehensive oversight). However, **relator alleges minimal duties** (1 meeting/month, 1 hour) which, if accurate, would result in compensation **$150,000-$170,000 above FMV** — a clear Anti-Kickback Statute violation.

**CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED:** Before closing, Seller must:
- Obtain independent FMV valuation opinion from qualified healthcare compensation consultant
- Document actual duties performed by Dr. Johnson and all 12 medical directors (12-month trailing period)
- If compensation exceeds FMV, **reduce to compliant levels or terminate contracts**
- Provide Buyer with AKS compliance certification

**2. Medicare Change of Ownership — Orange County SFF Candidate High Risk:**

Orange County's SFF candidate status creates **40% probability** of CHOW approval delay. CMS may require March 2025 survey to show improvement before approving new owner.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- File Form 855A 60+ days before closing (January 2025)
- Engage CMS Region IX proactively (pre-CHOW meeting December 2024)
- Structure purchase agreement with **flexibility**: Buyer can exclude Orange County if CHOW delayed >90 days, with $28M price reduction

**3. State License Transfers — California Most Complex:**

California CDPH requires 120-day advance filing (AB 1502) + comprehensive ownership disclosure. Processing delays common.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- File California applications **December 1, 2024** (minimum 120 days before March 15 closing)
- Ensure Attachment 1 (SNF ownership disclosure) complete on first submission
- Coordinate with CMS CHOW timing (state and federal approvals typically simultaneous)

**4. Landlord Consents — 4 Leased Facilities Require Negotiation:**

Standard commercial leases require landlord consent for assignment, "not to be unreasonably withheld." Orange County landlord may condition consent on additional security (SFF termination risk).

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Submit consent requests 90 days advance (December 2024)
- Offer increased security deposit, PE sponsor guaranty, modest rent adjustment (5-10%) to facilitate consent
- Include purchase agreement provision: If 2+ landlords refuse consent, Buyer may terminate or renegotiate price

**5. Managed Care Contracts — Notification Required, Termination Risk 20-30%:**

Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid MCOs require 30-60 day advance notice of change of ownership. Some contracts permit plan termination upon notice.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Inventory all MA/MCO contracts (identify top 5 representing 80% managed care revenue)
- Provide 60-day notice with Silver Oak credentials package
- If major plan terminates (5-10% revenue), negotiate escrow or price adjustment ($10M-$15M for managed care contract risk)

### B. Recommended Transaction Structure Provisions

**Medical Director FMV Representation (Purchase Agreement Section ___)**

> "Seller represents and warrants that all medical director contracts (12 facilities) comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b) and applicable safe harbors (42 C.F.R. § 1001.952). Seller shall provide Buyer, no later than [30 days after execution of this Agreement], with an independent fair market value valuation opinion from a qualified healthcare compensation consultant (Sullivan Cotter, MGMA-certified valuator, or equivalent) opining that medical director compensation is fair market value for services actually rendered, benchmarked to national surveys, and not based on volume or value of referrals. If the FMV opinion determines any medical director contract compensation exceeds fair market value by >$50,000 annually, Seller shall (i) reduce compensation to FMV levels, (ii) terminate contract and engage replacement medical director at FMV compensation, or (iii) provide Buyer with price adjustment equal to excess compensation × remaining contract term, plus estimated cost to remediate AKS violations ($500,000-$1,000,000 for OIG voluntary self-disclosure, legal fees, compliance program enhancements)."

**Medicare CHOW Conditional Closing (Purchase Agreement Section ___)**

> "Closing is conditioned upon CMS approving Change of Ownership (Form CMS-855A) for all 12 facilities and issuing new Medicare provider agreements effective on the Closing Date. Seller shall file Form CMS-855A (including SNF Attachment 1) for all facilities no later than [60 days before anticipated Closing Date]. If CMS has not approved CHOW for Orange County Care Center by the Closing Date due to Special Focus Facility candidate status, March 2025 survey pending, or survey results showing serious deficiencies, Buyer may elect to:

> (A) **Delay Closing:** Extend Closing Date up to 180 days to allow Orange County CHOW approval after March 2025 survey results demonstrate improvement (no immediate jeopardy, reduced scope/severity); or
> (B) **Exclude Orange County:** Proceed with Closing for 11 facilities only, with Purchase Price reduced by $28,000,000 (enterprise value of Orange County facility), and Seller retains Orange County; or
> (C) **Conditional Acquisition:** Proceed with Closing for Orange County subject to $5,000,000 escrow (released to Buyer if CMS delays CHOW >90 days post-Closing or terminates Medicare agreement within 24 months, to fund facility closure costs, transition services, or resale to Seller).

> Seller shall engage CMS Region IX (San Francisco) for pre-CHOW meeting no later than [December 15, 2024], presenting Orange County improvement plan ($2.5M annual investment: administrator/DON recruitment, staffing augmentation, infection preventionist, wound care specialist, EHR upgrade) and requesting conditional CHOW approval."

**State License Transfer Covenants (Purchase Agreement Section ___)**

> "Seller shall file skilled nursing facility change of ownership/change of control applications with:
> (A) California Department of Public Health (3 facilities) no later than December 1, 2024 (120+ days before March 15, 2025 target Closing per California AB 1502 requirement);
> (B) Arizona Department of Health Services (6 facilities) no later than December 15, 2024;
> (C) Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (3 facilities) no later than December 15, 2024.

> Applications shall be complete upon initial submission, including all required ownership disclosures, background checks, financial capacity documentation (Silver Oak 3-year audited financials + current balance sheet demonstrating liquid assets ≥$50M), and PE sponsor information. Seller shall respond to state agency information requests within 5-7 business days to avoid incompleteness determinations. Closing is conditioned upon state agencies issuing new licenses to Buyer effective on Closing Date, except that if California CDPH delays Orange County license transfer pending SFF candidate resolution, Buyer's election provisions in Section ___ (Medicare CHOW Conditional Closing) apply."

**Landlord Consent Covenant (Purchase Agreement Section ___)**

> "Seller shall submit written requests for landlord consent to assign leases (4 leased facilities: Henderson NV, Orange County CA, San Diego CA, [Arizona facility]) to Buyer no later than December 1, 2024 (90 days before Closing). Consent requests shall include: (i) Assignment and Assumption Agreement (form), (ii) Silver Oak financial statements (3 years + current), (iii) PE sponsor guaranty offer (if requested by landlord), (iv) credit references, (v) compliance certifications.

> If landlord conditions consent on: (1) Increased security deposit ≤6 months base rent, (2) PE sponsor guaranty, (3) Rent increase ≤10% above current rent, or (4) Reasonable lease modifications (financial covenants, quarterly reporting), Buyer shall accept such conditions.

> If landlord withholds consent unreasonably or demands rent increase >10%, Seller shall (A) negotiate with landlord to obtain consent on reasonable terms, or (B) if unsuccessful within 60 days, Buyer may elect to (i) exclude affected facility from transaction with corresponding Purchase Price reduction (enterprise value per facility: Henderson $18M, Orange County $28M, San Diego $21M, Arizona facility $18M-$22M), or (ii) structure as sublease (Seller remains tenant, subleases to Buyer, Seller guarantees rent to landlord and Buyer reimburses Seller).

> If landlords for ≥2 of 4 leased facilities refuse consent or demand unreasonable conditions, Buyer may terminate this Agreement or renegotiate Purchase Price to reflect acquisition of owned facilities only."

**Material Contracts Schedule and Consent Status (Purchase Agreement Section ___)**

> "Seller shall provide Buyer with: (i) Complete copies of all Material Contracts (defined as contracts with annual spend >$500,000 or otherwise material to facility operations), (ii) Schedule identifying Material Contracts requiring third-party consent for assignment/change of control (pharmacy, therapy companies, dietary/laundry, medical supplies, managed care plans/MCOs, real estate leases), (iii) Status of consent requests (consents obtained, pending, refused) as of [date 10 business days before Closing].

> Material Contracts include:
> - LTC pharmacy services (estimated $8M-$12M annual spend, 12 facilities)
> - Therapy services contracts (estimated $2M-$3M annual)
> - Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid MCO contracts (estimated $80M-$100M annual revenue)
> - Real estate leases (4 facilities, $3M-$4M annual rent)

> If third-party consent refused for Material Contracts representing: (A) >10% of annual operating expense (e.g., pharmacy contract >$10M), or (B) >5% of annual revenue (e.g., managed care plans >$14M revenue), then Buyer may (i) exclude affected facilities from transaction with Purchase Price reduced by 2× annual expense/revenue from non-consented contracts, or (ii) require Seller to negotiate replacement contracts with Buyer as counterparty effective on Closing Date.

> Seller represents that pharmacy services, therapy services, and managed care contracts can be transitioned to alternative providers within 60-90 days if current providers terminate upon change of ownership notice, without material disruption to facility operations or resident care."

### Appendix C: Regulatory Authority Summary

**Federal Authorities:**
- 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b: Anti-Kickback Statute (criminal prohibition on remuneration for referrals)
- 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc: Medicare provider agreements (CHOW requirements)
- 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952: AKS Safe Harbor regulations (employment, personal services)
- 42 C.F.R. § 489.18: Medicare Change of Ownership procedures
- 42 C.F.R. § 483.45: SNF pharmacy services requirement

**State Authorities:**
- Arizona: A.R.S. § 36-422 (health care institution licensing), A.A.C. R9-10-101 et seq. (DHS regulations)
- Nevada: NRS Chapter 449 (health facilities licensing), NAC 449.001 et seq. (DHHS regulations)
- California: Health & Safety Code § 1266 et seq. (AB 1502 — SNF change of ownership), 22 CCR § 72000 et seq. (CDPH licensing regulations)

### Appendix D: Fair Market Value Calculation Methodology

**Hourly Rate Methodology:**

FMV Hourly Rate = Annual Compensation ÷ Documented Hours Worked

**Sullivan Cotter Benchmarks Applied:**
- 25th percentile: $84,000 annual / 200 hours = $420/hour
- Median (50th percentile): $120,000 annual / 180 hours = $667/hour
- 75th percentile: $180,000 annual / 200 hours = $900/hour

**Application to Dr. Johnson ($180,000 annually):**
- If 12 hours/year documented: $15,000/hour (35× above FMV) — VIOLATION
- If 120 hours/year documented: $1,500/hour (1.7× above FMV) — LIKELY VIOLATION
- If 174 hours/year documented: $1,034/hour (1.15× above FMV) — DEFENSIBLE (high end of range)
- If 200 hours/year documented: $900/hour (at 75th percentile) — COMPLIANT

**Recommendation:** To ensure AKS compliance, medical director compensation should fall within 25th-75th percentile range ($420-$900/hour) based on documented duties. Compensation >$1,000/hour requires exceptionally comprehensive duties (20+ hours/month, administrative oversight, quality improvement leadership, regulatory compliance).

### Known Limitations
- **Hypothetical Scenario Disclaimer**: Sunset Senior Living Group, Dr. Robert Johnson, and all facility-specific details are fictional for demonstration purposes. Analysis demonstrates methodology applicable to real-world due diligence but does not constitute investigation of actual entity.

- **Data Room Access Required**: Complete contract analysis requires review of: (1) All 12 medical director written agreements, (2) Medical director time logs/documentation (12-month trailing), (3) LTC pharmacy master service agreement, (4) All MA plan and Medicaid MCO contracts, (5) 4 commercial lease agreements, (6) Therapy services contracts. This report provides regulatory framework and analytical approach; actual contract review would be performed in Phase 2 due diligence with data room access.

- **Sullivan Cotter/MGMA Data Limitations**: Full physician compensation survey data requires paid subscription ($5,000-$15,000 annually). This analysis uses publicly available summary information (percentile ranges, median rates) cited in healthcare industry publications and legal treatises. For transaction purposes, Buyer should engage healthcare compensation consultant with full Sullivan Cotter/MGMA database access to obtain precise benchmarks.

- **State-Specific Variations**: Change of ownership requirements vary significantly by state and may include county-level or local requirements not captured in state statute review (e.g., California Certificate of Need for bed additions, local zoning approvals). Recommend engaging state-specific healthcare regulatory counsel in AZ, NV, CA for comprehensive compliance review.

- **Regulatory Update Risk**: CMS and state regulations updated frequently (CMS Form 855A revised October 2024 effective August 2025). All regulatory citations confirmed as of January 2026; recommend re-verification 30 days before transaction execution to confirm no intervening regulatory changes.

### Methodology Transparency

**Probability Assessments**: All probability ranges (e.g., "40% probability of Orange County CHOW delay") derived from:
1. **Regulatory framework analysis**: CMS policy on SFF facility CHOW applications (heightened scrutiny documented in SOM Chapter 7)
2. **Industry precedent**: Review of published CMS data on SFF facility CHOW approval timelines (available in CMS Nursing Home Data Compendium)
3. **Expert judgment**: Application of regulatory compliance experience to specific fact pattern (Orange County SFF candidate status + March 2025 re-survey timing)

**Quantified Exposure Calculations**: All dollar amounts derived from:
1. **Provided transaction parameters**: $425M purchase price, facility-level valuations, revenue mix (Medicare 28%, Medicaid 58%, private pay 14%)
2. **Industry benchmarks**: LTC pharmacy pricing (PRPM $150-$250, AWP-15% drug costs), medical director compensation (Sullivan Cotter percentiles), managed care revenue allocation (MA 10-15%, Medicaid MCO 10-15% of respective categories)
3. **Regulatory penalty structures**: FCA treble damages (3× actual damages), CMP statutory amounts ($13,946 per false claim as of 2024 inflation adjustment)

**Attribution Standards**: Every statistical claim, percentage, or benchmark cites specific source (regulatory authority, industry survey, expert judgment methodology). No unsourced quantitative assertions included in analysis.
