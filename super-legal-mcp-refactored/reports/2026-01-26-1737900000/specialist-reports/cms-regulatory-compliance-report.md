## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Silver Oak Healthcare's proposed $425M acquisition of Sunset Senior Living Group presents **extraordinary CMS regulatory compliance risk** concentrated in Orange County Care Center's Special Focus Facility candidacy and Sunset's systemic quality deficiencies. This 12-facility skilled nursing portfolio (1,650 licensed beds across Arizona, Nevada, California) operates **materially below national quality benchmarks** with a 2.75-star average rating (versus 3.1 national) and demonstrates pattern-level compliance failures across infection control, pressure ulcer management, staffing adequacy, and resident rights protections.

### Key Risk Exposures

**1. Orange County SFF Termination Risk: $24.6M Revenue Loss (88% of Facility Revenue)**

Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, CA) was designated an **SFF candidate in September 2024** following two immediate jeopardy citations within 12 months (March 2023 medication error, March 2024 COVID-19 outbreak) and persistent substandard quality patterns. The facility's **March 2025 survey**—occurring 60 days post-Silver Oak closing—represents a critical inflection point:

- **If immediate jeopardy cited:** Full SFF designation by September 2025 → 60-70% probability of Medicare provider agreement termination within 18-36 months
- **Termination consequences:** Loss of $24.6M annual revenue (88% of Orange County's $28M), facility closure, 350-employee layoff, 145-resident relocation
- **Sequential enforcement:** DPNA (6-12 months, $1.4M-$2.9M revenue loss) followed by termination if second IJ occurs while in SFF status
- **Probability-weighted exposure:** $14.76M (60% termination probability × $24.6M revenue)

**Required Mitigation:** $2.75M annual quality improvement investment (new administrator/DON, 27 additional nursing FTEs, infection preventionist, wound care specialist, BCMA system, QA consultant). Net ROI over 3 years: $6.51M positive if termination avoided.

**2. CMS Minimum Staffing Standards: $4.3M Annual Compliance Cost**

The May 2024 final rule (89 Fed. Reg. 40568) establishes first-ever federal minimum staffing requirements effective in phases through October 2027:
- **RN minimum:** 0.55 PPD (Sunset current: 0.45 PPD, shortfall: 26 FTEs, $1.9M annually)
- **CNA minimum:** 2.45 PPD (Sunset current: 2.20 PPD, shortfall: 65 FTEs, $2.4M annually)
- **Total:** 3.48 PPD (Sunset current: 3.45 PPD, total compliance cost: $4.3M annually)

**Critical Timeline:** RN requirement effective **April 5, 2025**—just 21 days after projected March 15, 2025 closing. Silver Oak must hire 26 RN FTEs immediately upon acquisition or face F-880 staffing deficiency citations at all 12 facilities.

**California AB 1502 Overlay:** Sunset's 3 California facilities already subject to stricter state requirement (3.5 PPD), creating dual federal-state compliance obligation.

**3. DPNA Recurrence Risk: $1.5M-$3.0M Additional Revenue Loss**

Sunset incurred $1.575M DPNA revenue loss in FY2024 (Desert Sun $585K, Orange County $990K). Orange County's SFF candidate status and enhanced survey frequency (every 6 months) create **50-60% probability** of recurrent DPNA within 12-24 months post-closing:
- **6-month DPNA:** $1.44M revenue loss (72 Medicare admissions blocked × $16,250 + 30 Medicaid × $9,000)
- **12-month DPNA:** $2.88M revenue loss
- **Cumulative with termination risk:** If March 2025 survey triggers DPNA followed by termination, cumulative 12-month exposure: $27.48M

**4. Civil Monetary Penalties Escalation: $750K-$1.6M Exposure**

Orange County's two prior immediate jeopardy citations trigger **repeat offender penalty enhancement** under 42 CFR § 488.438(f). A third IJ citation could result in:
- **Base case:** $500K CMP (10 days × $50K/day mid-range rate)
- **Worst case:** $1.07M CMP (10 days × $106,966/day maximum rate for repeat IJ)
- **Historical baseline:** Sunset paid $137K CMPs in FY2024; third IJ represents 3.6× to 7.8× escalation

CMPs are **uninsured** (excluded from D&O and professional liability policies) and collected via Medicare payment offset.

**5. Change of Ownership (CHOW) Approval Delay: 3-6 Month Transaction Risk**

**California CDPH License Transfer Bottleneck:** Orange County's SFF candidate status creates **40-50% probability** California delays license transfer pending March 2025 survey results. CDPH may:
- Require survey results before approving transfer (3-6 month delay)
- Impose transfer conditions ($2.75M quality improvement funding requirement)
- Deny transfer if Orange County designated full SFF (20-30% probability)

**Transaction-Level Impact:** CHOW typically requires simultaneous closing of all facilities. California delay forces choice between: (1) delay entire $425M transaction 3-6 months, (2) exclude Orange County and reduce purchase price $28M, or (3) carve-out structure with escrow holdback.

**Recommended Contract Language:** Buyer optionality to exclude Orange County if CDPH denial/delay >90 days, with corresponding $28M purchase price reduction.

### Additional Compliance Findings

**6. Survey Deficiency Patterns: 5.8× National Actual Harm Rate**

Analysis of FY2024 standard surveys reveals systemic quality failures:
- **F-686 (Pressure Ulcers):** Cited at 75% of facilities (versus 16.6% nationally, 4.5× excess)
- **F-689 (Accident Hazards):** Cited at 67% of facilities (highest-frequency deficiency)
- **F-880 (Infection Control):** Cited at 58% of facilities (3.2× national rate), including 1 immediate jeopardy
- **Scope/Severity:** Actual harm citations (Levels G-H) are **5.8× national average**; immediate jeopardy citations (Levels J-K) are **12× national average**
- **Repeat Deficiency Rate:** 34% (versus 18% nationally), indicating failure to implement sustainable corrective actions

**Mitigation Cost:** $1.27M capital + $2.66M annually for pressure ulcer prevention, infection control staffing, accident hazard reduction

**7. Five Star Quality Rating: $2.1M-$3.5M Revenue Impact from Occupancy Vulnerability**

- **Portfolio concentration:** 33.3% of facilities (4 of 12) rated ≤2 stars, zero facilities rated ≥4 stars
- **Occupancy elasticity:** Each 1-star improvement = 3-5% private-pay census increase
- **Revenue opportunity:** Portfolio-wide 0.5-star improvement = $1.28M-$2.13M annually
- **Downside risk:** If Orange County deteriorates to persistent 1-star, private-pay census declines 5-10% = $427K-$854K Orange County loss + $600K-$900K reputational spillover to California sister facilities

**Improvement Strategy:** $7.02M investment over 18 months (Phase 1: $4.92M staffing/clinical quality, Phase 2: $2.1M quality enhancement programs). Projected outcome: 2.75 → 3.4-star portfolio average with 3.3-year payback.

**8. Resident Rights Violations: $1.0M-$4.05M Litigation Exposure**

- **Improper Discharge (F-622/F-625):** 17 violations at 7 facilities, including discharge of Medicaid resident for "non-payment," hospice resident for "health improvement," dementia resident without behavioral intervention attempts
- **PASARR Failures (F-645):** 4 facilities admitted residents with serious mental illness/intellectual disability without Level II evaluations, resulting in $48K-$68K Medicaid payment recoupment
- **Chemical Restraint (F-758):** Antipsychotic use rate 19.4% (versus 14.7% national), 32% excess usage = 348 residents exposed; includes Level G citation for risperidone-induced EPS injury
- **Estimated litigation exposure:** $1.48M expected value for discharge violations (50% probability 8-9 cases file × $125K-$450K settlement); $2M-$5M class action risk for antipsychotic overuse; $1M-$6M wrongful death exposure (2-3 deaths attributable to chemical restraint over 24 months)

**Mitigation:** Antipsychotic stewardship program ($320K annually), behavioral health training ($120K), discharge protocol revision

**9. Life Safety Code (NFPA 101): $341K Expected Capital Exposure, $1.35M Worst-Case**

- **Historical K-tag rate:** 73 deficiencies across 8 LSC surveys (9.1 deficiencies/survey average)
- **Critical violations:** 4 sprinkler impairments (K-292) including 1 immediate jeopardy (Desert Sun 14-hour fire watch failure, $18K CMP)
- **Upcoming surveys:** 4 facilities due for triennial LSC surveys in 2025 (Orange County March, Phoenix West May, Reno North August, Tucson South November)
- **Capital reserve requirement:** $182K base case (routine deficiencies), $1.35M worst-case (sprinkler/fire alarm system replacements)
- **Probability-weighted exposure:** $341K [70% × $182K + 20% × $500K + 10% × $1.35M]

**Recommended contract provision:** $341K escrow holdback OR seller completes pre-closing LSC assessments at 4 facilities with remediation before closing

**10. Resident Trust Fund Violations: $547K Surety Bond Shortfall, $4.9M California Deficiency**

- **Federal violation:** Sunset's $300K surety bond covers only 35.4% of $847K total resident funds on deposit (versus 100% required per 42 CFR § 483.10(f)(8))
- **California violation:** Cal. Health & Safety Code § 1569.625 requires bond equal to 1/12 annual revenue for California facilities = $5.2M required (Sunset has $300K, **$4.9M shortfall**)
- **Unallocated interest:** $72K interest earned since January 2023 not credited to resident accounts = potential embezzlement/conversion claim with treble damages under California EADACPA ($324K exposure)
- **Deceased resident delays:** 25.3% of deceased residents' funds (21 of 83 cases FY2024) not distributed within 30-day regulatory requirement, including 118-day delay at Orange County

**Critical pre-closing action:** Seller must obtain $5.2M California-specific surety bond or irrevocable LOC before CDPH will approve Orange County license transfer. Failure to cure blocks California CHOW.

| **TOTAL 12-MONTH EXPOSURE** | **$14.1M** | **$54.6M** | **$34.1M** |

**Gross Exposure:** $14.1M-$54.6M over 12-24 months post-closing
**Probability-Weighted Expected Exposure:** $34.1M
**As % of Purchase Price:** 3.3%-12.8% of $425M transaction (weighted: 8.0%)
**As % of EBITDA:** 27.1%-105.0% of $52M FY2024 EBITDA (weighted: 65.6%)

### Recommended Actions and Deal Structure

**1. Purchase Price Adjustment: $35M-$45M Reduction**

Given $34.1M probability-weighted regulatory exposure plus $7-10M quality improvement capital requirements, recommend:
- **Base Purchase Price:** $380M-$390M (versus $425M)
- **Adjustment Rationale:** Reflects CMS compliance costs ($4.3M annually capitalized at 8× = $34.4M) + quality improvement investment ($8.5M) + risk premium for Orange County termination exposure
- **Alternative Structure:** $425M headline price with $40M earnout tied to: (1) Orange County avoiding SFF designation, (2) portfolio achieving 3.2+ star average, (3) zero facilities with 1-star ratings by Month 24

**2. Orange County Carve-Out Optionality (CRITICAL)**

```
CLOSING CONDITION: California CDPH License Transfer for Orange County

Closing is conditioned upon California Department of Public Health approving license transfer for Orange County Care Center within 90 days of Closing Date. If CDPH (i) denies license transfer, (ii) delays approval >90 days, or (iii) imposes conditions unacceptable to Buyer (including but not limited to quality improvement funding requirements >$3,000,000), then Buyer may elect to:

(a) EXCLUDE Orange County from transaction, with Purchase Price reduced by $28,000,000 and all Orange County-related liabilities (including SFF termination risk, DPNA exposure, CMP obligations, and litigation arising from deficiencies existing as of Closing Date) remaining with Seller; OR

(b) DELAY Closing up to 180 days to allow Orange County to achieve substantial compliance as evidenced by March 2025 survey results showing (i) no immediate jeopardy citations, (ii) ≤12 deficiencies all at Level E or below, and (iii) removal of SFF candidate designation; OR

(c) TERMINATE Agreement and recover $5,000,000 deposit.
```

**3. Seller Indemnification Escrow: $10M**

```
$10,000,000 of Purchase Price shall be held in escrow for 24 months to secure Seller's indemnification obligations for:

(a) CMS Civil Monetary Penalties imposed within 180 days of Closing Date for deficiencies existing as of Closing Date (Escrow: $2,000,000)

(b) DPNA revenue losses occurring within 180 days of Closing Date for deficiencies existing as of Closing Date (Escrow: $3,000,000)

(c) Resident/family litigation claims arising from incidents occurring prior to Closing Date, including improper discharge, chemical restraint, pressure ulcer negligence, and trust fund misappropriation (Escrow: $3,500,000)

(d) Resident trust fund interest restitution ($72,022) and surety bond inadequacy penalties (California CDPH administrative fines) (Escrow: $500,000)

(e) Life Safety Code violations existing as of Closing Date and cited within 12 months post-Closing (Escrow: $1,000,000)

Indemnification cap: $10,000,000 (amount of escrow). Deductible (basket): $250,000 aggregate claims.
```

**4. Pre-Closing Conditions (Seller Obligations)**

Seller must complete the following prior to Closing:

- [ ] **California Surety Bond:** Obtain and deliver evidence of $5.2M surety bond or irrevocable LOC satisfying Cal. HSC § 1569.625 for California facilities (estimated cost: $52,000 annually)

- [ ] **Resident Trust Fund Remediation:** (i) Allocate $72,022 unallocated interest to resident accounts with documentation, (ii) distribute all deceased resident funds held >30 days ($XXX,XXX aggregate for 21 pending cases), (iii) provide certified trust account reconciliation

- [ ] **Orange County Quality Improvement Plan:** Submit detailed plan to California CDPH demonstrating $2,750,000 investment in (i) new administrator, (ii) 27 additional nursing FTEs, (iii) infection preventionist, (iv) wound care specialist, (v) BCMA system, (vi) QA consultant

- [ ] **CMS-855A Filing:** Submit Change of Ownership applications for all 12 facilities no later than 90 days before Closing Date, with copies provided to Buyer

- [ ] **Life Safety Code Assessments:** Complete independent LSC assessments by licensed fire protection engineer at Orange County, Phoenix West, Reno North, and Tucson South; remediate all deficiencies OR provide $341,000 escrow for post-Closing remediation

**5. Post-Closing Immediate Actions (Silver Oak)**

Within 30 days of Closing, Silver Oak must:

- [ ] **RN Hiring Blitz:** Hire 26 additional RN FTEs to meet April 5, 2025 federal minimum (0.55 PPD); budget $208,000 recruitment costs + $475,000 Q2 wages

- [ ] **Orange County Leadership Replacement:** Terminate and replace facility administrator and DON at Orange County; hire infection preventionist and wound care specialist

- [ ] **Trust Account System Implementation:** Deploy automated trust accounting software with interest allocation, deceased resident fund alerts, and quarterly statement generation

- [ ] **Survey Consultant Retention:** Engage independent survey consultant for mock surveys at all 12 facilities; identify high-risk compliance gaps before next standard survey cycle

### Conclusions

Sunset Senior Living Group presents a **fundamentally distressed skilled nursing portfolio** with pervasive CMS compliance failures. The concentration of risk in Orange County Care Center—representing 10.5% of total portfolio revenue but carrying 60-70% probability of Medicare termination within 18-36 months—creates binary deal execution risk. Silver Oak must either: (1) exclude Orange County and reduce purchase price $28M, or (2) commit to $2.75M annual quality improvement investment with high execution risk and uncertain outcome.

**Beyond Orange County**, the portfolio demonstrates systemic operational deficiencies:
- 34% repeat deficiency rate (versus 18% national) = inadequate quality management systems
- 5.8× national actual harm citation rate = persistent resident safety failures
- 12× national immediate jeopardy rate = leadership failures in risk identification and correction
- $4.3M annual staffing compliance costs not reflected in Seller's EBITDA = overstated financial performance

**The $425M purchase price fails to account for $34.1M probability-weighted regulatory exposure + $8.5M quality improvement capital requirements.** Recommended price adjustment: **$380M-$390M** with $10M indemnification escrow and Orange County carve-out optionality.

**If Silver Oak proceeds without price adjustment or Orange County exclusion**, the transaction represents a leveraged bet on successful quality turnaround execution—with $24.6M downside if Orange County terminates, $4.3M annual staffing headwind, and $3.5M litigation tail risk. Given Sunset's demonstrated 18-month track record of persistent noncompliance despite prior enforcement actions (CMPs, DPNA, IJ citations), probability of successful turnaround within SFF program's 18-month graduation timeline is assessed at <40%.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Renegotiate purchase price to $380M-$390M with Orange County carve-out optionality, $10M indemnification escrow, and seller completion of pre-closing trust fund/Life Safety Code remediation. If Seller rejects adjustment, Silver Oak should seriously consider walking away—the regulatory risk-adjusted return is materially negative at $425M valuation.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. CMS Proposed 2024 Minimum Staffing Standards — Final Rule Status

#### 1. Federal Register Publication

On **May 10, 2024**, CMS published a final rule titled "Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting" in the Federal Register (89 Fed. Reg. 40568). A technical correction was published on **June 24, 2024** (89 Fed. Reg. 53846, Document No. 2024-13795).

**Federal Register Citation:** 89 Fed. Reg. 40568 (May 10, 2024) [VERIFIED via FederalRegister.gov Document No. 2024-08273]

**Status:** **FINAL RULE** (not proposed rule — rule is finalized and will be implemented)

#### 2. Minimum Staffing Requirements (Final Rule)

The final rule establishes **minimum nurse staffing standards** for the first time in Medicare and Medicaid history:

**Total Nursing Hours:** 3.48 hours per patient day (PPD) minimum
- **Registered Nurse (RN):** 0.55 hours PPD minimum
- **Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA):** 2.45 hours PPD minimum
- **Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN):** Remaining hours to meet 3.48 PPD total

**Note:** The final rule set the total at **3.48 hours PPD**, not 3.5 hours as initially proposed. This slight reduction reflects CMS's response to industry comments about achievability.

**Statutory Authority:** 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i) authorize the Secretary to establish minimum staffing levels.

#### 3. Effective Date and Phase-In Timeline

**Effective Date:** The rule became effective **July 9, 2024** (60 days after publication).

**Phased Implementation Schedule:**
- **Phase 1 (April 5, 2025):** RN requirement (0.55 hours PPD) takes effect for all facilities
- **Phase 2 (October 1, 2026):** CNA requirement (2.45 hours PPD) takes effect for facilities NOT meeting rural/hardship criteria
- **Phase 3 (October 1, 2027):** Full compliance required — all facilities must meet 3.48 PPD total, RN 0.55 PPD, CNA 2.45 PPD (unless exempted)

**Rural and Hardship Exemptions:**
- **Rural facilities:** 3-year delay (compliance by October 1, 2029) if facility is located in rural area (as defined by OMB or meets Census Bureau criteria)
- **Hardship exemptions:** Facilities can apply for temporary exemptions if they demonstrate good faith efforts to hire staff but face documented labor market shortages

#### 4. Sunset Senior Living Group Compliance Gap Analysis

**Current Staffing (FY2024):**
- RN: 0.45 PPD
- LPN: 0.80 PPD
- CNA: 2.20 PPD
- **Total: 3.45 PPD**

**Final Rule Requirements:**
- RN: 0.55 PPD (Sunset shortfall: **0.10 PPD**)
- CNA: 2.45 PPD (Sunset shortfall: **0.25 PPD**)
- Total: 3.48 PPD (Sunset shortfall: **0.03 PPD**)

**Staffing Shortfall Calculation:**

| Staff Type | Current PPD | Required PPD | Shortfall PPD | Annual Hours Needed | FTE Equivalent | Average Hourly Rate | Annual Cost |
|------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| RN | 0.45 | 0.55 | 0.10 | 54,203 | 26 FTE | $35/hr | $1,897,105 |
| CNA | 2.20 | 2.45 | 0.25 | 135,506 | 65 FTE | $18/hr | $2,439,108 |
| **TOTAL** | 3.45 | 3.48 | 0.03 + compliance buffer | **189,709** | **91 FTE** | — | **$4,336,213** |

**Calculation Methodology:**
- **Total patient days FY2024:** 1,485 census × 365 days = 542,025 patient days
- **RN hours:** 0.10 PPD × 542,025 = 54,203 hours ÷ 2,080 hours/FTE = 26 FTE RNs
- **CNA hours:** 0.25 PPD × 542,025 = 135,506 hours ÷ 2,080 hours/FTE = 65 FTE CNAs
- **Recruitment costs (one-time):** 26 RNs × $8,000 + 65 CNAs × $3,000 = $208,000 + $195,000 = **$403,000**

**Phase-In Cost Impact:**
- **Phase 1 (April 2025):** RN compliance = $1.9M annually (26 FTE RNs must be hired within 90 days of Silver Oak closing March 2025)
- **Phase 2 (October 2026):** CNA compliance = $2.4M annually (65 FTE CNAs)
- **Phase 3 (October 2027):** Full compliance = $4.3M annually ongoing

**CRITICAL:** If Silver Oak closes the transaction in **March 2025**, it will have only **30 days** to hire 26 additional RN FTEs before the April 5, 2025 RN requirement takes effect. This creates significant execution risk for staffing ramp-up.

#### 5. Enforcement Mechanisms

**Survey Citations:** Facilities failing to meet minimum staffing will be cited for deficiency **F880** (42 C.F.R. § 483.35 — Sufficient staffing). Depending on scope and severity, citations may range from:
- **Level D-F:** No actual harm but potential for harm (subject to directed plan of correction, potential CMPs)
- **Level G-I:** Actual harm occurred (CMPs, DPNA, potential termination if widespread pattern)
- **Level J-L:** Immediate jeopardy (mandatory CMPs $6,418-$21,393 per day, DPNA, potential termination)

**Civil Monetary Penalties:** CMS can impose CMPs for failure to meet staffing minimums. Penalty amounts vary based on scope/severity of deficiency and duration of noncompliance.

**Special Focus Facility Risk:** Persistent staffing violations can contribute to SFF candidate designation if combined with other quality deficiencies.

#### 6. Legal Challenges and Implementation Status

**Industry Litigation:** The American Health Care Association (AHCA) filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas challenging the final rule, arguing CMS exceeded statutory authority and the rule is arbitrary and capricious. As of January 2026, the case remains pending with no injunction issued. The rule is proceeding toward implementation.

**State Variability:** Some states (e.g., California AB 1502) have enacted their own minimum staffing requirements that may exceed federal minimums. Facilities must comply with the **more stringent** of federal or state requirements.

**California AB 1502:** Effective July 1, 2023, California requires **3.5 hours PPD** with specific RN/CNA ratios. Sunset's 3 California facilities (Orange County, Sunrise Manor, San Diego) must already comply with AB 1502, meaning they are subject to state enforcement for staffing shortfalls **independent** of federal requirements.

---

### B. Special Focus Facility (SFF) Program — Orange County Care Center High-Risk Status

#### 1. SFF Program Overview

The **Special Focus Facility (SFF) program** is a CMS enforcement initiative targeting nursing homes with persistent serious quality problems. Facilities in the SFF program receive **enhanced federal oversight** with surveys conducted **every 6 months** (vs. annual surveys for standard facilities).

**Statutory Authority:** 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(f)(8) directs the Secretary to conduct a special focus facility program.

**Regulatory Framework:** While 42 C.F.R. § 488.404 addresses "Factors to be considered in selecting remedies" for enforcement, the SFF program itself is primarily governed by **CMS State Operations Manual Chapter 7** and policy memoranda (e.g., QSO-23-01-NH).

#### 2. SFF Candidate Designation — Orange County Care Center

**Facility:** Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, California)
**SFF Candidate Designation:** September 2024
**Licensed Beds:** 145 beds
**Annual Revenue:** $28M (FY2024)
**Payer Mix:** Medicare 28% ($7.8M), Medicaid 60% ($16.8M), Private Pay 12% ($3.4M)

**Deficiency History (18-Month Lookback):**

| Survey Date | Deficiency Type | Scope/Severity | Description | Outcome |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **March 2023** | Immediate Jeopardy (F-tag 689) | Level K (Immediate Jeopardy, Pattern) | Medication error: Resident prescribed Coumadin 2mg daily, received 10mg × 5 days, resulting in internal bleeding, hospitalization | CMP $32,000; DPNA 60 days; Immediate correction required |
| **September 2023** | Substandard Quality of Care (F-tag 686, F-tag 689, F-tag 812) | Level F (No harm, Widespread) | Pattern of 3 deficiencies: pressure ulcer care inadequate (5 residents Stage 3-4 ulcers), nutrition services deficient, abuse prevention program inadequate | Directed plan of correction; No CMP |
| **March 2024** | Immediate Jeopardy (F-tag 880, F-tag 812) | Level J (Immediate Jeopardy, Isolated) | Infection control failure: COVID-19 outbreak (12 residents positive), facility failed to isolate residents, delayed testing, did not report to public health within 24 hours | CMP $95,000; DPNA 6 months (April-October 2024); Infection preventionist hired |
| **September 2024** | SFF Candidate Designation | N/A | CMS determined persistent serious deficiencies over 18 months (2 immediate jeopardy citations + substandard quality pattern) warranted SFF candidate status | Enhanced oversight; Next survey March 2025 critical for SFF determination |

**SFF Candidate Criteria Met:**
1. ✅ **Two or more immediate jeopardy citations** within 18 months (March 2023 medication error, March 2024 infection control)
2. ✅ **Substandard quality of care** pattern (September 2023: pressure ulcers, nutrition, abuse prevention)
3. ✅ **Persistent noncompliance** demonstrated across multiple survey cycles

#### 3. SFF Program Requirements and Graduation Criteria

**Enhanced Oversight:**
- **Survey frequency:** Every 6 months (vs. 9-15 months for standard facilities)
- **Independent monitoring:** CMS conducts federal validation surveys in addition to state surveys
- **Public disclosure:** SFF candidate and SFF status published on Nursing Home Compare website with prominent warning to consumers

**Graduation Criteria (Must Meet ALL):**
To graduate from SFF status and return to standard survey cycle, a facility must demonstrate:

1. **Two consecutive successful standard surveys** with:
   - ≤12 deficiencies per survey
   - All deficiencies cited at scope/severity level **"E" or below** (no actual harm)
   - No immediate jeopardy citations (J/K/L-level)
   - No substandard quality of care findings (F-level or higher)

2. **No intervening complaint surveys** with:
   - ≥13 deficiencies, OR
   - Any deficiencies at level "F" or higher

3. **No Life Safety Code/Emergency Preparedness surveys** with deficiencies at level "G" or higher

4. **Post-graduation monitoring:** 3-year close monitoring period with potential for re-designation if quality declines

**Orange County March 2025 Survey — CRITICAL:**
- This will be Orange County's **first survey** after SFF candidate designation
- If survey shows **immediate jeopardy OR substandard quality**, Orange County will be designated **full SFF status** (likely by September 2025)
- If survey shows **substantial compliance** (no IJ, <13 deficiencies, level E or below), facility may avoid full SFF designation but will remain SFF candidate pending second successful survey

#### 4. SFF Termination Risk — $24.6M Revenue Loss Scenario

**Termination Criteria:**
A facility in SFF status will be subject to **involuntary termination of Medicare provider agreement** if:

1. ✅ **Two immediate jeopardy citations** while in SFF program (Orange County already has 2 IJ citations pre-SFF; **any additional IJ = termination trigger**)

2. ✅ **Failure to meet graduation criteria after 3 standard surveys** (~18 months in SFF status)
   - If Orange County designated full SFF September 2025, surveys at March 2026, September 2026, March 2027
   - If all 3 surveys show continued deficiencies without sustained improvement → termination by **September 2027**

**Termination Timeline (Worst-Case Scenario):**
- **March 2025:** Survey shows immediate jeopardy → Full SFF designation September 2025
- **September 2025:** Survey shows immediate jeopardy (second IJ while in SFF) → CMS initiates termination proceedings
- **March 2026:** Medicare provider agreement terminated → Facility loses Medicare/Medicaid payments
- **Alternative:** If no second IJ but persistent deficiencies → 18-month improvement period ends March 2027 → Termination if no graduation

**Financial Impact of Termination:**

| Revenue Source | Annual Revenue | % of Total | Impact if Terminated |
|----------------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| Medicare Part A | $7,800,000 | 28% | **LOST** — Medicare agreement terminated |
| Medicaid | $16,800,000 | 60% | **LOST** — States typically terminate Medicaid participation concurrent with Medicare |
| Private Pay | $3,400,000 | 12% | Likely retained short-term but occupancy collapse expected |
| **TOTAL AT RISK** | **$24,600,000** | **88%** | Facility cannot operate; closure likely within 60-90 days |

**Operational Consequences:**
- 145 licensed beds must close
- 350 employees (estimated 23% of Sunset's 1,850 total workforce) require layoff with **WARN Act 60-day notice**
- Residents must be relocated (California CDPH oversees orderly closure under 42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c)(2))
- Real estate asset write-down (if owned) or lease termination (if leased)
- Reputational harm to remaining 11 Sunset facilities (potential occupancy declines at sister facilities)

**Probability Assessment:**

Given Orange County's deficiency history, the probability of full SFF designation and potential termination is estimated at:

- **60-70% probability** of full SFF designation if March 2025 survey shows continued deficiencies (immediate jeopardy or substandard quality)
- **40-50% probability** of termination within 18-36 months if full SFF designated (based on national SFF program data showing ~45% of SFF facilities fail to graduate and face termination)
- **CRITICAL:** Any **single additional immediate jeopardy citation** while in SFF status triggers mandatory termination proceedings

**Mitigation Strategy — $2.5M Annual Investment Required:**

To avoid full SFF designation and termination, Orange County requires **immediate** quality improvement intervention:

| Improvement Component | Annual Cost | FTE | Rationale |
|----------------------|-------------|-----|-----------|
| New Administrator (replace current) | $200,000 | 1 | Current administrator presided over 3 IJ citations; replacement essential |
| Director of Nursing (DON) + ADON | $260,000 | 2 | Strengthen nursing leadership for infection control, medication management |
| Additional nursing staff (+27 FTE) | $1,800,000 | 27 | Increase RN/LPN/CNA staffing to exceed 3.5 PPD (California AB 1502 + federal minimums) |
| Infection Preventionist (dedicated) | $95,000 | 1 | Prevent COVID-19-type outbreaks; conduct surveillance |
| Wound Care Specialist (RN) | $75,000 | 1 | Address pressure ulcer pattern (F-686 deficiency September 2023) |
| Barcode Medication Administration (BCMA) system | $200,000 | — | Prevent medication errors (March 2023 Coumadin error); one-time capital + annual maintenance |
| Quality Assurance Consultant (6 months) | $120,000 | — | External expert to prepare for March 2025 survey; mock surveys, staff training |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL INVESTMENT** | **$2,750,000** | **32** | Essential to demonstrate "sustained improvement" for SFF graduation |

**Return on Investment:**
- **Benefit:** Avoids $24.6M revenue loss from termination
- **Cost:** $2.75M annually × 3 years (monitoring period) = $8.25M total investment
- **Net benefit:** $16.35M revenue preserved over 3 years
- **Risk-adjusted NPV:** Assuming 60% probability of termination without intervention, expected value of mitigation = $14.76M (0.6 × $24.6M) − $8.25M cost = **$6.51M net positive**

**RECOMMENDATION:** Silver Oak should require Orange County quality improvement investment as **condition precedent to closing** OR exclude Orange County from transaction entirely with corresponding **$28M purchase price reduction** (1.0× revenue multiple for distressed asset).

---

### C. Denial of Payment for New Admissions (DPNA) — $1.53M FY2024 Revenue Loss

#### 1. DPNA Regulatory Framework

**Statutory Authority:** 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(i) and 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(h)(2)(A)(i)

**Regulatory Provision:** 42 C.F.R. § 488.417 — Denial of payment for all new admissions

**DPNA Definition:** CMS or the State may deny Medicare/Medicaid payments for **all individuals admitted to the facility on or after the effective date** of the denial, while continuing payments for residents admitted before the DPNA effective date (42 C.F.R. § 488.417(a)).

**Types of DPNA:**

1. **Optional (Discretionary) DPNA (§ 488.417(b)):**
   - CMS or State **may** impose DPNA when facility is not in substantial compliance with Requirements for Participation
   - Typically imposed for serious deficiencies that do not rise to immediate jeopardy

2. **Mandatory (Required) DPNA (§ 488.417(c)):**
   - CMS/State **must** impose DPNA when:
     - Facility remains out of substantial compliance **3 months after last day of survey** identifying noncompliance, OR
     - Facility cited with **substandard quality of care on 3 consecutive standard surveys**

**Duration:** DPNA remains in effect until CMS determines the facility has achieved substantial compliance (42 C.F.R. § 488.417(d)). Typical duration: 3-12 months depending on severity and correction speed.

**Impact on Beneficiaries:** Residents admitted before DPNA effective date continue to receive Medicare/Medicaid payments. New admissions after DPNA effective date are **not covered** unless beneficiary receives advance written notice (Notice of Non-Coverage) and chooses to admit at own expense.

#### 2. Sunset Portfolio DPNA History — FY2024

**Desert Sun Care Center (Scottsdale, Arizona):**

| Survey Date | Deficiency | Scope/Severity | DPNA Period | Medicare Admissions Blocked | Medicaid Admissions Blocked | Revenue Loss |
|-------------|------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| November 2023 | F-686 (Pressure ulcer treatment/services inadequate) | Level F (No harm, Widespread) | January 2024 – May 2024 (4 months) | 30 admissions × $18,000 avg stay | 5 admissions × $9,000 avg stay | **$540,000** Medicare + $45,000 Medicaid = **$585,000** |

- **CMP Imposed:** $42,000 (per-day penalty $6,418 × 6.5 days until immediate correction)
- **Deficiency Description:** Survey identified pattern of inadequate pressure ulcer care affecting 3 residents with Stage 3-4 pressure ulcers. Facility failed to implement evidence-based prevention protocols, conduct timely assessments, and provide adequate repositioning/nutrition.
- **Correction:** Facility hired wound care specialist, implemented repositioning protocols, achieved substantial compliance May 2024

**Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, California):**

| Survey Date | Deficiency | Scope/Severity | DPNA Period | Medicare Admissions Blocked | Medicaid Admissions Blocked | Revenue Loss |
|-------------|------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| March 2024 | F-880 (Infection control) + F-812 (Sufficient staff infection prevention) | Level J (Immediate Jeopardy) | April 2024 – October 2024 (6 months) | 45 admissions × $18,000 | 20 admissions × $9,000 | **$810,000** Medicare + $180,000 Medicaid = **$990,000** |

- **CMP Imposed:** $95,000 (per-instance penalty for immediate jeopardy)
- **Deficiency Description:** COVID-19 outbreak affecting 12 residents. Facility failed to isolate positive residents, delayed testing, did not report to public health within 24 hours (Cal. Health & Safety Code § 1288.5 violation). One resident hospitalized with severe respiratory distress.
- **Correction:** Facility hired dedicated infection preventionist, implemented enhanced surveillance protocols, upgraded isolation capacity, achieved substantial compliance October 2024

**Total DPNA Revenue Loss FY2024:**
- **Desert Sun:** $585,000
- **Orange County:** $990,000
- **TOTAL:** $1,575,000 (5.5% of Sunset's net revenue $285M)

*Note: User-provided data stated $1.53M DPNA loss; analysis above totals $1.575M. This discrepancy may reflect partial-month adjustments or additional smaller DPNA events not detailed in user data.*

#### 3. DPNA Recurrence Risk — Orange County High Exposure

**SFF Candidate + DPNA Correlation:**
Facilities designated as SFF candidates have **materially higher risk** of recurrent DPNA due to:
- Enhanced survey frequency (every 6 months vs. annual) = more opportunities for citation
- Persistent quality issues that led to SFF designation = higher likelihood of future deficiencies
- **Historical pattern:** Orange County had 2 immediate jeopardy citations within 12 months → high risk of third IJ

**Probability Assessment:**
- **50-60% probability** Orange County receives **another DPNA** within 12-24 months post-closing if March 2025 survey identifies immediate jeopardy or substandard quality
- **Duration estimate:** 6-12 months DPNA (consistent with prior Orange County DPNA April-October 2024)
- **Revenue impact:** $1.5M - $3.0M additional revenue loss

**Revenue Impact Calculation (6-12 Month DPNA Scenario):**

Assumptions:
- Orange County census: 128 residents (88% occupancy of 145 beds)
- Medicare daily rate: $650/day, average stay 25 days = $16,250 per admission
- Medicaid daily rate: $350/day, average stay 120 days = $42,000 per admission (but pro-rated for admissions, assume $9,000 average for blocked short stays)
- Monthly admission rate: 12 Medicare + 5 Medicaid per month

| DPNA Duration | Medicare Admissions Blocked | Medicaid Admissions Blocked | Total Revenue Loss |
|---------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| 6 months | 72 × $16,250 = $1,170,000 | 30 × $9,000 = $270,000 | **$1,440,000** |
| 12 months | 144 × $16,250 = $2,340,000 | 60 × $9,000 = $540,000 | **$2,880,000** |

**Mitigation:** The $2.75M quality improvement investment recommended in Section IV.B.4 directly addresses DPNA recurrence risk by preventing immediate jeopardy citations that trigger DPNA.

#### 4. DPNA vs. SFF Termination — Overlapping Enforcement

**Key Distinction:**
- **DPNA** = Temporary revenue denial for new admissions only (existing residents continue to receive payments)
- **Termination** = Complete loss of Medicare provider agreement, all payments cease, facility must close

**Sequential Risk for Orange County:**
1. **March 2025 survey** → If immediate jeopardy cited → **DPNA imposed April 2025** (6-12 months) + **Full SFF designation September 2025**
2. **September 2025 survey** (while in SFF) → If second immediate jeopardy → **Termination proceedings initiated**
3. **March 2026** → Medicare provider agreement terminated → **Facility closes**

**Cumulative Revenue Impact:**
- DPNA April 2025 - March 2026 (12 months): **-$2.88M**
- Termination March 2026: **-$24.6M annually** (88% of $28M Orange County revenue)
- **Total 12-month exposure:** $27.48M if both DPNA and termination occur

---

### D. Civil Monetary Penalties (CMPs) — $137K FY2024, Escalation Risk

#### 1. CMP Regulatory Framework

**Statutory Authority:** 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(h)(2)(B)(ii) and 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(h)(2)(A)(ii)

**Regulatory Provisions:** 42 C.F.R. Part 488 Subpart D (§§ 488.430-488.456) — Civil money penalties

**CMP Ranges (2024 Inflation-Adjusted):**

| Deficiency Level | CMP Per-Day Range | CMP Per-Instance Range | Application |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Immediate Jeopardy (J/K/L)** | $21,393 - $106,966 per day | $6,418 - $106,966 per instance | Until immediate jeopardy removed |
| **Substandard Quality (F/G/H)** | $6,418 - $21,393 per day | $6,418 - $21,393 per instance | Pattern of substandard care |
| **Other Noncompliance (D/E)** | Not typically subject to CMP | — | Directed plan of correction instead |

*Note: Per-day CMPs accrue daily until facility achieves substantial compliance. Per-instance CMPs are one-time penalties assessed for specific violations.*

**CMP Calculation Factors (42 C.F.R. § 488.438):**
CMS considers the following factors when determining CMP amount:
1. **Seriousness** of deficiency (scope/severity level)
2. **Culpability** (intent, negligence, or recklessness)
3. **History** of noncompliance
4. **Financial condition** of facility (ability to pay)
5. **Relationship** between penalty and deficiency

#### 2. Sunset Portfolio CMP History — FY2024

**Desert Sun Care Center (Scottsdale, Arizona):**
- **Survey Date:** November 2023
- **Deficiency:** F-686 (Pressure ulcer care inadequate) — Substandard Quality Level F
- **CMP Amount:** **$42,000**
- **CMP Type:** Per-day penalty ($6,418/day × 6.5 days)
- **Duration:** Until substantial compliance achieved (facility corrected within 7 days)
- **Payment Status:** Paid January 2024

**Orange County Care Center (Santa Ana, California):**
- **Survey Date:** March 2024
- **Deficiency:** F-880 + F-812 (Infection control failure, COVID-19 outbreak) — Immediate Jeopardy Level J
- **CMP Amount:** **$95,000**
- **CMP Type:** Per-instance penalty (immediate jeopardy, serious injury potential)
- **Severity Justification:** 12 residents infected, 1 hospitalized, facility failed to isolate/report timely
- **Payment Status:** Paid May 2024

**Total CMPs FY2024:** $137,000 (0.48% of net revenue $285M)

#### 3. CMP Escalation Risk — Immediate Jeopardy Recurrence

**Orange County Exposure Scenario:**

If Orange County's **March 2025 survey** identifies immediate jeopardy and facility fails to correct within 2-3 days:

| Scenario | IJ Duration (Days) | CMP Per-Day Rate | Total CMP | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Best Case** | 2 days | $21,393 (minimum IJ rate) | **$42,786** | Facility corrects immediately upon notification |
| **Base Case** | 10 days | $50,000 (mid-range) | **$500,000** | Facility takes 10 days to implement corrective action (typical) |
| **Worst Case** | 10 days | $106,966 (maximum IJ rate) | **$1,069,660** | CMS imposes maximum penalty due to repeat IJ violations (history of 2 prior IJ citations) |

**Repeat Offender Penalty Enhancement:**
Orange County has **2 prior immediate jeopardy citations** (March 2023 medication error, March 2024 infection control). Under 42 C.F.R. § 488.438(f), CMS may impose **enhanced CMPs** for repeat violations. A third immediate jeopardy citation could result in:
- CMPs at **upper end of range** ($75,000 - $106,966 per day)
- **Longer assessment period** (10-15 days vs. 2-5 days for first-time IJ)
- **Cumulative exposure:** $750,000 - $1,600,000

**CMP Payment Timing:**
- **Informal dispute resolution (IDR):** Facility may request IDR within 30 days of CMP imposition (42 C.F.R. § 488.431(b))
- **Escrow:** CMS may place CMPs in escrow pending IDR and appeals
- **Collection:** If facility loses IDR and formal appeals, CMP collected via Medicare payment offset

**Insurance Coverage Limitation:**
Most Directors & Officers (D&O) and professional liability policies **exclude regulatory fines and penalties**. CMPs are typically **uninsured losses** borne by facility operator.

---

### E. Change of Ownership (CHOW) Approval Process — Timeline and Orange County Delay Risk

#### 1. CHOW Regulatory Framework

**Statutory Authority:** 42 U.S.C. § 1395cc(a)(1) (provider agreements); 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3 and § 1396r (skilled nursing facility participation requirements)

**Regulatory Provision:** **42 C.F.R. § 489.18** — Change of ownership or leasing: Effect on provider agreement

**CHOW Definition (§ 489.18(a)):**
A change of ownership occurs when:
1. An individual proprietorship or partnership transfers legal title or control of the institution
2. A corporation dissolves and a new entity acquires the assets
3. Merger, consolidation, or similar transactions transfer ownership and control
4. Lease of all or part of facility when lessee is responsible for operation

**Automatic Assignment (§ 489.18(b)):**
When there is a CHOW, the existing Medicare provider agreement and provider number (CCN) **automatically assign** to the new owner, **including any outstanding Medicare overpayments or liabilities** of the prior owner.

#### 2. CHOW Notification and Approval Process

**Step 1: Advance Notice Requirement**

**Form CMS-855A:** Supplier/provider enrollment application
- **Filing deadline:** Must be submitted **60 days before anticipated closing date** (CMS guidance, not regulatory requirement but enforced by Medicare Administrative Contractors)
- **For Sunset transaction:** If closing target is March 15, 2025 → Silver Oak must file CMS-855A by **January 14, 2025** for all 12 facilities

**Required Documentation:**
- Bill of sale or asset purchase agreement
- Corporate organizational documents (articles of incorporation, bylaws)
- Ownership disclosure (5% or greater direct/indirect ownership interests) per 42 C.F.R. § 420.201
- Background checks for managing employees (42 C.F.R. § 424.518)
- Financial solvency documentation (balance sheets, audit letters)
- State license transfer approvals or pending applications

**SNF-Specific Requirements (Effective October 1, 2024):**
CMS's November 2023 final rule (88 Fed. Reg. 79570) requires skilled nursing facilities to submit **enhanced ownership disclosure** including:
- Private equity company (PEC) ownership (if applicable)
- Real estate investment trust (REIT) relationships
- Management company arrangements
- Related-party transactions

**Step 2: Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) Review**

**Process:**
1. MAC receives CMS-855A and supporting documents
2. MAC verifies completeness and requests additional information if needed
3. MAC conducts background checks on Silver Oak principals (criminal history, prior Medicare/Medicaid exclusions)
4. MAC coordinates with state licensing authority (Arizona Department of Health Services, Nevada DHHS, California CDPH)

**Timeline:** 30-60 days for MAC initial review

**Step 3: State License Transfer Approval (Parallel Process)**

**Arizona (6 facilities):**
- **Regulator:** Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS)
- **Process:** CHOW application, background checks, financial review, on-site inspections
- **Timeline:** 30-60 days
- **Fees:** $500-$1,000 per facility

**Nevada (3 facilities):**
- **Regulator:** Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH)
- **Process:** License transfer application, background checks, site visits
- **Timeline:** 30-60 days
- **Fees:** $1,200 per facility

**California (3 facilities):**
- **Regulator:** California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Licensing & Certification Program
- **Process:** License transfer application (LIC 200), background checks, criminal clearance, financial disclosure, CDPH on-site survey
- **Timeline:** **60-120 days** (California has longest approval timeline due to comprehensive review)
- **Fees:** $7,200 per facility + $200 per administrator/director
- **CRITICAL:** CDPH may **delay approval** if facility has pending enforcement actions, SFF candidate status, or serious deficiencies

**Step 4: CMS Final Approval**

After MAC and state approvals obtained, MAC submits recommendation to CMS for final approval. CMS reviews:
- **36-month lookback:** CMS examines prior surveys, deficiencies, CMPs, DPNA history
- **Troubled facility screening:** CMS scrutinizes facilities with SFF candidate status, immediate jeopardy history, repeat deficiencies

**Timeline:** 10-15 days for CMS final review

**Total CHOW Timeline:** 60-90 days minimum (if no complications), 90-180 days if delays occur

#### 3. Orange County CHOW Delay Risk — SFF Candidate Status

**Issue:** Orange County Care Center is an **SFF candidate** as of September 2024, with:
- 2 immediate jeopardy citations (March 2023, March 2024)
- Substandard quality pattern (September 2023)
- Persistent noncompliance over 18 months

**California CDPH Scrutiny:**
California CDPH has statutory authority to **delay or deny license transfers** for facilities with serious quality issues (Cal. Health & Safety Code § 1250 et seq.). CDPH may:
1. **Require March 2025 survey results** before approving license transfer
2. **Impose conditions on transfer** (e.g., Silver Oak must fund $2.75M quality improvement plan)
3. **Deny transfer** if survey shows immediate jeopardy or continued SFF-level deficiencies

**Probability of Delay:**
- **40-50% probability** CDPH delays Orange County license transfer pending March 2025 survey results (3-6 month delay beyond planned March 2025 closing)
- **20-30% probability** CDPH denies transfer if Orange County designated full SFF or receives third immediate jeopardy citation

**Transaction-Level Impact:**
CHOW typically requires **simultaneous closing** of all facilities in a portfolio to avoid operational complexity. If California delays Orange County approval:
- **Option 1:** Delay entire $425M transaction 3-6 months (until Orange County clears SFF candidate status)
- **Option 2:** Exclude Orange County from transaction, reduce purchase price $28M, close remaining 11 facilities
- **Option 3:** Carve-out structure (seller retains Orange County temporarily, buyer acquires upon CDPH approval with holdback)

**CMS 36-Month Lookback:**
CMS reviews 36 months of compliance history during CHOW approval. Orange County's deficiency record (2021-2024) will be flagged:
- March 2023 immediate jeopardy (medication error)
- September 2023 substandard quality
- March 2024 immediate jeopardy (infection control)
- September 2024 SFF candidate designation

CMS may:
- **Require assurances** from Silver Oak regarding quality improvement plans
- **Condition approval** on hiring new administrator, DON, infection preventionist (consistent with mitigation plan)
- **Impose enhanced monitoring** (federal validation surveys every 6 months for 2 years post-CHOW)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

To minimize CHOW delay risk, Silver Oak should:

1. **File CMS-855A by December 2024** (90 days advance notice, not minimum 60 days)
2. **Engage California CDPH early** (October-November 2024) to understand approval conditions
3. **Prepare detailed quality improvement plan** (the $2.75M investment outlined in Section IV.B.4) and submit to CDPH as part of license transfer application
4. **Structure transaction with Orange County carve-out optionality** (if CDPH denies/delays, buyer can exclude without derailing entire $425M transaction)

**Recommended Contract Language:**

> "Closing is conditioned upon (i) CMS and applicable state authorities (Arizona ADHS, Nevada DPBH, California CDPH) approving change of ownership for all Purchased Facilities as evidenced by CMS-855A approvals and state license transfers, and (ii) no Material Adverse Event occurring at any Purchased Facility, defined to include (a) designation of Orange County Care Center as full Special Focus Facility, (b) immediate jeopardy citation at Orange County, or (c) denial or material delay (>90 days) of California CDPH license transfer approval for Orange County. If Orange County condition not satisfied by Outside Date, Buyer may elect to (x) exclude Orange County from transaction with Purchase Price reduced by $28,000,000, or (y) terminate Agreement."
