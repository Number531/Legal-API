59. Calculation: FY2024 EBITDA approximated at $580M operating income + depreciation; $304M revenue loss × 30% incremental EBITDA margin = $91M EBITDA decline; new EBITDA $489M; assuming annual debt service $200M (estimated at 7% interest on $2.8B debt), DSCR = $489M ÷ $200M = 2.45x (still above 1.25x covenant, but declining from baseline ~2.9x) [METHODOLOGY: illustrative calculation assuming standard debt service coverage ratios]

60. Standard preferred ship mortgage deed, Section 6.1(h) (borrower covenant to maintain "all licenses, permits, certificates, and governmental approvals necessary for lawful operation of mortgaged vessels") [ASSUMED: industry-standard mortgage covenant language]

380. [METHODOLOGY: Bulk carrier fuel consumption estimate—36,000 DWT bulk carrier typically consumes 40-60 tonnes/day heavy fuel oil at normal steaming speed; 2 D-rated bulk carriers + additional bulk carriers supporting 260,000 DWT capacity = 4-6 vessels × 40-60 tonnes/day × 300 days = 48,000-108,000 tonnes/year bulk carrier fuel; assume 22-vessel fleet includes container vessels consuming similar amounts = total 150,000-250,000 tonnes/year bulk carrier fuel].

381. [METHODOLOGY: 150,000-250,000 tonnes × $300/tonne VLSFO-HSFO spread = $45M-$75M annual fuel premium].

382. [METHODOLOGY: $32M-$72M capital ÷ $45M-$75M annual savings = 0.43-1.60 years simple payback; adding 8% WACC discounting extends to 2-4 years NPV breakeven].

383. [METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) California ports (LA, Long Beach, San Francisco) prohibit open-loop scrubber discharge within 24nm per CARB At-Berth Regulation; (2) EU ETS Phase IV includes maritime transport from Jan. 1, 2024, charging €80-€100/tonne CO₂ on 50% of EU-inbound voyage emissions (2024), phasing to 100% by 2026; (3) Scrubbers reduce sulfur emissions but not CO₂, so EU ETS costs apply regardless of scrubber installation].

384. [INFERRED: Typical acquirer risk-averse position—avoid capital commitment with uncertain payback in favor of operational flexibility].

385. [METHODOLOGY: If fleet renewal planned within 5-7 years (e.g., replacing aging vessels with LNG-fueled newbuilds), scrubber payback period (3-5 years) overlaps with vessel disposal timeline, stranding scrubber investment].

401. [METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment—IEE Certificates with EEXI endorsements are mandatory closing deliverables for vessel acquisition transactions involving pre-2013 vessels; absence from research plan indicates data gap].

402. [METHODOLOGY: EEXI verification should occur during first annual/intermediate/renewal survey after Jan. 1, 2023; vessels completing surveys in 2023-2025 should have EEXI endorsements; if not, vessels are non-compliant].

403. [METHODOLOGY: Assume 22-vessel fleet average age 12-15 years (typical for maritime operator); vessels built 2011-2024 = 12-16 vessels built pre-2013 (60-70% of fleet); apply 15-20% IACS non-compliance rate = 12 × 17.5% = 2.1 vessels expected non-compliant].

404. International Association of Classification Societies, *supra* note 345, at 12-15 (EPL cost $50K-$150K; energy-saving devices $500K-$3M).

405. [METHODOLOGY: 2.1 vessels (expected non-compliant) × $1.75M average compliance cost (midpoint of $500K-$3M range) = $3.7M expected value; range: 2 vessels × $500K = $1M (P10); 3 vessels × $3M = $9M (P90)].

406. [INFERRED: Typical seller defense—"we are compliant, this is speculative exposure"].

407. [METHODOLOGY: Industry practice—Classification societies (ABS, DNV, Lloyd's Register) conducted targeted EEXI verification campaigns throughout 2023-2024 to ensure fleet-wide compliance before Jan. 1, 2023 deadline; responsible operators participated proactively].

408. [METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment—Absence of EEXI compliance disclosure in research plan suggests either (1) IEE Certificates not provided by PMSC, or (2) due diligence team did not verify EEXI endorsements, both indicating process gap].

409. [METHODOLOGY: Vessels lacking DCS Statement of Compliance cannot trade in IMO-regulated waters; if PMSC vessels currently operating (evident from 4.7M TEU throughput FY2024), 80-90% probability all vessels have valid DCS Statements and therefore EEXI compliance].
