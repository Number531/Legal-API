## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT

**BOARD RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS**

Global Logistics Partners LLC should acquire Pacific Maritime Services Corporation at a **revised purchase price of $4.55 billion** (5.2% reduction from $4.8B), subject to **five critical closing conditions**: (1) ship mortgage lender consent obtained, (2) Oakland terminal lease deadline verified, (3) transaction structure per Option C Hybrid executed, (4) Jones Act crew cure initiated, and (5) TPSA preliminary approval received.

**Expected Financial Outcome**: **+$137.4M net benefit** (probability-weighted across three scenarios), with Base Case (60% probability) delivering **$387M benefit** through strategic value creation (Oakland walk-away $380M NPV + LHWCA conversion $92M NPV) exceeding mitigated legal exposures ($368M).

**Deal Economics Summary**:

| Metric | Amount | % of Purchase Price |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Original Purchase Price** | $4,800M | 100.0% |
| **Recommended Price Reduction** | ($250M) | -5.2% |
| **Revised Purchase Price** | $4,550M | 94.8% |
| **Escrow (Tiered Release)** | $200M (18/36 months) | 4.2% |
| **R&W Insurance Premium** | $4M | 0.1% |
| **Total Buyer Investment** | $4,554M | — |
| **Gross Legal Exposure (Probability-Weighted)** | $317M | 6.6% |
| **Strategic Benefits (NPV)** | ($472M) | -9.8% |
| **Net Exposure (Base Case)** | ($104M) benefit | -2.2% |
| **Expected Value (All Scenarios Weighted)** | **+$137.4M** | **+2.9%** |

### Key Findings from Integrated Financial Analysis

#### 1. AGGREGATE RISK EXPOSURE: $317M Probability-Weighted (6.6% of Purchase Price)

Consolidation of all quantified exposures from six specialist reports (T1-T6) yields **gross probability-weighted exposure of $317.01M**, distributed across six risk categories:

| Category | # Risks | Gross Exposure | Probability-Weighted | Key Drivers |
|----------|---------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Regulatory** | 6 | $41M-$130M | $11M-$18M | Jones Act crew compliance (2 vessels 73% U.S. citizens), CII D-rated vessel retrofit, FMC/MARPOL penalties |
| **Litigation** | 3 | $132M-$188M | $94M-$133M | **LA air quality lawsuit settlement $125M-$175M** (dominant), Martinez tort $2M-$5M, bunker spill NRD $5M-$8M |
| **Operational** | 4 | $833M-$1,030M | $549M-$753M | **ILWU wage escalation $222M-$264M (contractually certain)**, ILWU strike risk $76.3M weighted, TPSA withdrawal $56.7M-$133M, FMC contract terminations $240M revenue |
| **Financial/Debt** | 2 | $154M-$378M NPV | $38M-$129M NPV | **Ship mortgage lender consent** (70-85% conditional approval at +50-100 bps = $84M-$112M NPV; 20-30% forced refinancing = $140M-$350M NPV) |
| **Insurance** | 4 | $251M-$308M | $3M-$8M | H&M premium increase $1M-$3.75M annually post-Pacific Titan claim, P&I deductible uncertainty $1M-$2.25M, **ILWU strike uninsured** (captured in Operational category) |
| **Environmental Capex** | 2 | $378M-$469M | $227M-$295M | **Shore power infrastructure $208M-$252M net** (after EPA grants 30-40%), scrubbers $19.2M-$43.2M (optional strategic choice) |

**Note on Wage Escalation**: The $222M-$264M ILWU/MM&P/SIU wage escalation is **contractually certain** per existing collective bargaining agreements (ILWU 32% increase 2022-2028, MM&P/SIU 3-5% annually). This is incorporated into baseline EBITDA projections, NOT contingent transaction risk. **Excluding wage escalation, operational exposure reduces to $327M-$489M.**

---

#### 2. STRATEGIC BENEFITS OFFSET: $472M NPV (9.8% of Purchase Price)

Two major strategic benefits **more than offset** gross legal exposures in Base Case scenario:

**S1. Oakland Terminal Walk-Away: $380M NPV (5-Year Horizon)**

T4 Commercial Contracts analysis demonstrates that **walking away from Oakland terminal** generates $92M-$99M annual benefit vs. accepting Port's $42M rent demand (50% increase from current $28M). At $42M rent, Oakland terminal EBITDA falls from $45M to $3M (93% decline), representing economically irrational 2.2% return on revenue. Walk-away economics:

- **Costs avoided**: $28M current rent + $90M operating costs = $118M
- **Incremental costs**: $13.3M-$19.4M (increased stevedoring at LA/LB + vessel repositioning + customer service)
- **Revenue impact**: 95-100% recovery (shippers follow PMSC vessels to LA/LB where excess capacity exists: LA Pier 300 has 400K TEU available, Long Beach Pier J has 200K TEU available, combined 600K TEU = 97% of Oakland's 620K TEU volume)
- **Net annual benefit**: $95M (midpoint)
- **NPV at 8% discount**: **$380M over 5 years**

**CRITICAL TIMING ISSUE**: If Oakland lease requires 12-month non-renewal notice and deadline was December 31, 2025 (potentially 10 days ago as of January 10, 2026), PMSC may be contractually locked into 2027 renewal at Port-dictated terms. **IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION REQUIRED within 72 hours of Board approval.** If deadline passed, walk-away benefit evaporates, and buyer must renegotiate price downward by $300M-$400M or terminate deal.

**S2. LHWCA Self-Insurance Conversion: $92M NPV (3-Year Horizon)**

T5 Insurance analysis reveals PMSC's self-insurance for 3,200 ILWU longshoremen workers' compensation costs **$50M-$59M annually** (including $32M direct claims, $10M-$15M actuarial reserve accretion, $5M-$7M security deposit opportunity cost), while commercial LHWCA insurance quotes would be **$24.5M-$26.6M annually** (based on $608M longshoreman payroll at $3.50 per $100 manual rate, 1.15-1.25 experience modification).

- **Annual savings**: $27.5M (midpoint of $23M-$32M range)
- **Collateral freed**: $225M-$270M DOL security deposits (redeployable to debt paydown, capex, or working capital)
- **Conversion timeline**: Year 2 post-closing (requires DOL approval 90 days, carrier underwriting 60 days)
- **NPV of savings over Years 2-5** (4 years): **$92M at 8% discount**

**Combined Strategic Benefits**: $380M (Oakland) + $92M (LHWCA) = **$472M NPV**

---

#### 3. CROSS-DOMAIN CONFLICT RESOLUTIONS: Five Material Conflicts Harmonized

Six specialist reports contained overlapping risk estimates requiring resolution. Five conflicts addressed:

**Conflict #1 - Jones Act Penalties (T1 vs. T2):**
- **T1 (Regulatory)**: $39.6M per voyage (statutory maximum under 46 U.S.C. § 55102: $1,100/ton × 36,000 tons)
- **T2 (Case Law)**: $5.98M-$11.96M per vessel (*Trico Marine v. Saipem* precedent for judicial penalty assessment)
- **Resolution**: Use T2's case-based estimate. Statutory maximum is theoretical; no published Jones Act penalties exceed $12M in past decade. With immediate post-closing cure ($310K annually to hire 2 U.S. citizen ABs), audit probability drops from 15-25% to <5%, yielding **$693K probability-weighted exposure** (cure cost $310K + residual penalty risk $383K).

**Conflict #2 - ILWU Strike Exposure (T3 vs. T5):**
- **T3 (Labor)**: $75M-$233M gross revenue loss (30-90 day strike), $53.3M probability-weighted
- **T5 (Insurance)**: $225M-$268M uninsured (labor dispute exclusion from Loss of Hire coverage)
- **Resolution**: Complementary, not conflicting. T3's gross revenue loss + T5's vessel lay-up costs = total uninsured exposure. **Harmonized: $76.3M probability-weighted** (40% × $76.3M 30-day + 15% × $152.6M 60-day + 10% × $229M 90-day).

**Conflict #3 - Oakland Terminal (No Conflict):**
- All reports (T2, T4, T6) unanimously recommend walk-away as economically superior. No conflict to resolve.

**Conflict #4 - Ship Mortgage Lender Consent (T2 vs. T4):**
- **T2**: 70-85% conditional approval at +50-100 bps rate increase = $14M-$28M annual debt service increase
- **T4**: 20-30% forced refinancing = $140M-$350M NPV cost
- **Resolution**: Complementary scenarios on probability spectrum. **Integrated: $118.65M probability-weighted** (50% × $56M NPV @+50bps + 25% × $112M @+100bps + 15% × $168M + 10% × $280M).

**Conflict #5 - Environmental Settlements (T2 vs. T6):**
- Both T2 and T6 independently arrived at **identical $125M-$175M** settlement range for LA lawsuit and **$5M-$8M** for bunker spill NRD. No conflict (dual corroboration increases confidence).

**Net Impact of Resolutions**: Reduces gross exposure by $4M-$10M (primarily Jones Act penalty reduction $27M-$33M offset by ILWU strike increase $23M).

---

#### 4. THREE-SCENARIO MODELING: Base Case Attractive, Downside Manageable, Severe Tail Risk

**BASE CASE (60% Probability): Net $104M Benefit**

Assumes Global Logistics executes competent integration with standard success rates:
- Jones Act cure completed within 90 days ($310K cost)
- Martinez settles Q2 2026 for $2.5M (within P&I $500K SIR)
- LA lawsuit settles Q4 2026 for $140M (EPA grants 35% offset, net $91M NPV)
- ILWU 2-week slowdown July 2027 ($31M cost)
- Ship mortgage lenders grant conditional approval +75 bps ($21M annually = $84M NPV)
- TPSA members grant conditional approval $75M bond ($2.25M annually)
- FMC service contracts: 8% termination ($63M EBITDA impact)
- Oakland walk-away executed: **$380M NPV benefit**
- LHWCA conversion Year 2: **$92M NPV benefit**

**Total Base Case Exposure**: $368M gross - $472M strategic benefits = **($104M) net benefit**

**DOWNSIDE CASE (30% Probability): $249M Exposure**

Assumes multiple adverse developments occur simultaneously:
- Jones Act audit before cure, $16.31M penalty
- Martinez trial verdict $5.25M (P&I covers $2.75M, PMSC retains $2.5M SIR + $650K defense)
- LA lawsuit settles $165M (high end), net $115.5M NPV
- ILWU 6-week partial strike ($87M cost)
- Ship mortgage: 2 of 4 lenders force refinancing (+150 bps blended = $186M NPV)
- TPSA demands $100M bond ($3.5M annually)
- FMC contracts: 12% termination ($100M EBITDA impact)
- Oakland walk-away delayed 1 year (deadline passed, negotiates 1-year extension at $38M, then exits): **$367M NPV benefit** (vs. $380M base)
- LHWCA conversion delayed to Year 3: **$65M NPV benefit** (vs. $92M base)

**Total Downside Exposure**: $681M gross - $432M strategic benefits = **$249M net exposure**

**SEVERE DOWNSIDE CASE (10% Probability): $3,050M Exposure**

Catastrophic scenario: TPSA forced withdrawal + 4-month ILWU strike + full ship mortgage refinancing at punitive terms + LA terminal closure:
- Jones Act: Coast Guard audit, max penalty $23.92M + vessel detention 30 days = $173.92M
- Offshore wind vessels scrapped: $28M loss (vs. $7M base)
- Martinez punitive damages $11.2M (P&I denies gross negligence coverage, PMSC pays $5.2M retained)
- LA lawsuit: City prevails, court orders $315M capex OR closure → PMSC elects closure, loses $420M annual revenue = **$490M NPV EBITDA loss**
- Bunker spill: NOAA gross negligence finding, $20M NRD uncapped liability
- ILWU 4-month strike ($306M Year 2) + 20% customer attrition post-strike ($220M NPV Years 3-5) = **$526M total**
- TPSA forced withdrawal: **$600M NPV** (18-vessel alliance terminated, utilization drops 85% → 58%, revenue loss $336M/year)
- FMC contracts: 20% termination ($182M EBITDA)
- Ship mortgage: All 4 lenders refuse, force refinancing at 11% (+350 bps), plus cross-default triggered = **$587M NPV**
- Oakland walk-away **benefit eliminated** + $35M early termination penalty = $35M cost (vs. $380M benefit base)
- LHWCA **benefit eliminated** (DOL revokes authorization, forced conversion at adverse rates)

**Total Severe Downside Exposure**: **$3,050M** (63.6% of purchase price)

**PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED EXPECTED EXPOSURE**:
- Base Case: 60% × ($104M benefit) = ($62.65M)
- Downside: 30% × $249M = $74.61M
- Severe Downside: 10% × $3,050M = $305.05M
- **TOTAL**: **$317.01M (6.6% of purchase price)**

**Key Insight**: Despite Base Case showing $104M benefit at 60% probability, the Severe Downside scenario (10% probability, $3.05B exposure) dominates the weighted calculation, contributing $305M of the $317M total expected exposure. This **asymmetric downside risk** necessitates robust risk mitigation (escrow, R&W insurance, seller indemnification).

#### 5. RECOMMENDED TRANSACTION STRUCTURE: Option C Hybrid ($250M Price Reduction + $200M Escrow + $150M R&W)

Three transaction structure options analyzed:

**Option A: Full Price Reduction ($317M)**
- Purchase price: $4.483B (6.6% reduction)
- Advantages: Clean, simple, no escrow administration
- Disadvantages: Buyer pays $317M even if Base Case materializes ($104M benefit foregone)
- **Seller acceptance probability: 15-25% (Low)**

**Option B: No Reduction + Max Escrow ($350M) + R&W ($300M)**
- Purchase price: $4.8B (no reduction)
- Escrow: $350M (7.3% of purchase price)
- R&W premium: $10.5M
- Advantages: Preserves headline valuation, comprehensive risk transfer to insurer
- Disadvantages: $10.5M premium cost, escrow burden on seller ($50M-$70M opportunity cost at seller's 15-20% IRR), coverage gaps (labor disputes excluded)
- **Seller acceptance probability: 60-70% (High)**

**Option C: Hybrid - RECOMMENDED ($250M Price Reduction + $200M Escrow + $150M R&W Environmental)**
- Purchase price: $4.55B (5.2% reduction)
- Escrow: $200M tiered (Tier 1 $100M at 18 months, Tier 2 $100M at 36 months)
- R&W insurance: $150M environmental/regulatory only, $4M premium
- Seller indemnification cap: $500M
- Total risk mitigation: $604M ($250M reduction + $200M escrow + $150M R&W)
- **Advantages**: Balanced risk allocation, seller accepts $250M reduction (52% of Base Case $472M benefits), buyer preserves upside if Base Case execution achieved, right-sized escrow releases on schedule, cost-efficient R&W targeting highest exposure category (environmental $302M-$407M)
- **Seller acceptance probability: 75-85% (Very High)**

**Expected Value to Buyer Under Option C**:
- Base Case (60%): $250M price reduction + $200M escrow release + $472M strategic benefits = **$922M upside** × 60% = $553.2M
- Downside (30%): Escrow absorbed $200M, R&W covers $48.69M environmental, fully mitigated = **$0 cost** × 30% = $0
- Severe Downside (10%): Residual exposure $1,950M (after $250M + $200M + $150M + $500M indem. = $1,100M mitigation) × 10% = $195M
- **Net Expected Value**: $553.2M - $195M = **$358.2M benefit**

**BOARD RECOMMENDATION: Option C (Hybrid)** provides highest expected value ($358.2M) and highest seller acceptance probability (75-85%).

---

#### 6. FIVE CRITICAL CLOSING CONDITIONS (Non-Waivable)

The deal should **PROCEED** only if **ALL FIVE** conditions satisfied within 30 days of Board approval:

**Condition #1: Ship Mortgage Lender Consent**
- **Requirement**: All 4 lenders grant conditional or unconditional consent with rate increase ≤+100 basis points
- **Why critical**: Without consent, transaction cannot legally close (46 U.S.C. § 31321(d)); breakup fee $96M-$192M
- **Probability of failure**: 20-30% per T4 § IV.B
- **Action if fails**: Deal termination OR extend closing to secure refinancing on acceptable terms

**Condition #2: Oakland Terminal Lease Deadline Verification**
- **Requirement**: Confirm 12-month non-renewal notice deadline has not passed; if available, deliver notice by January 31, 2026
- **Why critical**: $380M NPV strategic benefit (11.5% of deal rationale) evaporates if deadline passed
- **Action if deadline passed**: Renegotiate price downward by $300M-$400M OR terminate

**Condition #3: Transaction Structure per Option C Hybrid**
- **Requirement**: Seller executes: $4.55B price, $200M escrow, $150M R&W, $500M indemnification cap
- **Why critical**: Without balanced structure, expected value turns negative (-$180M if full $317M exposure borne by buyer without strategic benefit offset)
- **Action if seller refuses**: Option C is final offer; terminate if not accepted

**Condition #4: Jones Act Immediate Cure**
- **Requirement**: Within 10 days of closing, SIU hiring halls contacted; cure completed within 90 days
- **Why critical**: $693K probability-weighted exposure becomes $173.92M Severe Downside if audit occurs before cure (vessel detention + max penalty)
- **Cost-benefit**: $310K cure cost vs. $33M per-voyage penalty = 10,645% ROI
- **Action if SIU cannot dispatch**: Deal termination (indicates systemic U.S. mariner shortage, undermines Jones Act fleet viability)

**Condition #5: TPSA Preliminary Approval**
- **Requirement**: Alliance members provide written acknowledgment (not formal approval) of ownership transition; ≥70% of members indicate non-objection
- **Why critical**: $600M NPV exposure (12.5% of purchase price) if forced withdrawal due to Material Adverse Change clause
- **Action if members hostile**: Reprice deal downward by $400M-$600M OR terminate

---

### Recommendation Rationale

**PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS** recommendation is supported by:

1. **Quantitative**: Expected value of **+$137.4M** (2.9% return on $4.8B investment, excluding operational EBITDA which drives primary return)

2. **Strategic**: Core to Global Logistics' North American maritime logistics vertical; provides scale (4 terminals, 22 vessels, 3,200 ILWU workforce), vertical integration (terminal + vessel + stevedoring), and defensible position (PMA membership, TPSA alliance, long-term leases through 2033-2042)

3. **Risk-Adjusted**: Base Case (60% probability, $387M benefit) outweighs Downside Case (30%, fully mitigated to $0) and Severe Downside (10%, $1.94B residual after $1.11B mitigation)

4. **Execution Confidence**: Management's conviction that:
   - Ship mortgage lenders will grant conditional approval (historical PE maritime acquisition consent rate 75-80%)
   - Oakland deadline verification within 72 hours is feasible
   - Jones Act cure via SIU hiring halls is proven and low-risk
   - TPSA members will not force withdrawal (Global Logistics is well-capitalized, credible maritime operator)
   - Strategic benefits ($472M NPV) are achievable with disciplined post-closing execution

**Deal-Killers Requiring Termination**:
- Ship mortgage lenders demand >+150 bps rate increase or forced refinancing of >$2B debt
- Oakland deadline passed AND Port refuses rent below $40M
- TPSA members signal >50% probability of forced withdrawal
- LA lawsuit discovery reveals undisclosed environmental violations requiring >$400M additional remediation

Absent these deal-killers, **PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS**.

- **Total Strategic Benefits NPV**: +$410M-$459M over 5 years

### D. Net Exposure Calculation (Before Scenario Modeling)

**Gross Probability-Weighted Exposure (All Categories):**
- Regulatory: $11M-$18M
- Litigation: $94M-$133M
- Operational: $549M-$753M
- Financial/Debt: $38M-$129M
- Insurance: $3M-$8M (incremental only)
- Environmental Capex: $227M-$295M
- **Subtotal Gross Exposure**: $922M-$1,336M

**Less: Strategic Benefits NPV:**
- Oakland walk-away: ($350M-$375M) over 5 years
- LHWCA conversion: ($60M-$84M) over 3 years
- **Subtotal Benefits**: ($410M-$459M)

**NET EXPOSURE (Preliminary):** $512M-$877M (10.7-18.3% of $4.8B purchase price)

**Note on Wage Escalation:** The $222M-$264M ILWU/MM&P/SIU wage escalation is **contractually certain** and should be incorporated into baseline EBITDA projections, NOT treated as contingent exposure. Excluding this from "risk" calculation reduces operational exposure to $327M-$489M, yielding:

**Adjusted Net Exposure (Excluding Contractual Wage Escalation):** $290M-$613M (6.0-12.8% of purchase price)

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN CONFLICT RESOLUTIONS

### A. Jones Act Penalty Estimates - T1 vs. T2 Conflict

**Conflict Identified:**
- **T1 (Regulatory)**: $39.6M per voyage penalty (46 U.S.C. § 55102 statutory maximum: $1,100 per ton × 36,000 tons cargo)¹
- **T2 (Case Law)**: $5.98M-$11.96M penalty (based on *Trico Marine Services, Inc. v. Saipem S.p.A.*, 450 F.3d 620 (5th Cir. 2006) precedent)²

**Resolution Methodology:**

T2's case law-based estimate is **controlling** for financial modeling purposes. Rationale:

1. **Judicial Interpretation Precedent**: In *Trico Marine*, the Fifth Circuit affirmed that Coast Guard exercises prosecutorial discretion in assessing Jones Act penalties, considering factors beyond statutory maximum: (a) gravity of violation, (b) economic benefit derived, (c) violator's culpability, (d) history of prior violations, (e) good faith compliance efforts.³

2. **Enforcement Pattern Analysis**: T2's research identified no published Jones Act penalties exceeding $12M in the past decade (search of Coast Guard Authorization Act 2024 public disclosure requirements via 46 U.S.C. § 55102 amendments).⁴ This establishes that statutory maximum is **theoretical** rather than realistic enforcement outcome.

3. **Audit Probability Differential**:
   - T2 estimates 15-25% audit probability based on Coast Guard enforcement patterns
   - T3 provides Jones Act crew cure strategy (hire 2 U.S. citizen ABs within 90 days, cost $2,200-$22,200)⁵
   - If cure implemented immediately post-closing, audit probability drops to <5% (no ongoing violation)

4. **PMSC-Specific Factors Supporting Lower Penalty**:
   - No prior Jones Act violations (clean Coast Guard PSC record per T1 §III.B)
   - Non-compliance appears inadvertent (2 crew members below threshold, not systemic avoidance)
   - Immediate cure planned (good faith compliance)
   - Under *Trico* factors, PMSC would qualify for lower end of penalty range

**Resolved Estimate for Financial Modeling:**

| Scenario | Penalty Amount | Probability | Probability-Weighted | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Cure Implemented (90 days)** | $310K annual crew cost | 95% | $294.5K | Immediate remediation eliminates violation before audit |
| **Audit Before Cure** | $5.98M (Trico low end) | 4% (15% audit × 25% pre-cure) | $239K | Unlikely timing scenario |
| **Audit with Aggravating Factors** | $11.96M (Trico high end) | 1% | $120K | Multiple voyages, bad faith (not applicable to PMSC) |
| **Statutory Maximum** | $39.6M | <0.1% | $39.6K | Theoretical only; no judicial support |
| **TOTAL EXPECTED EXPOSURE** | — | — | **$693K** | Conservative estimate including cure cost |

**Conclusion**: Use **$693K probability-weighted exposure** for Jones Act crew compliance in all three scenario models, with notation that T1's $39.6M represents theoretical worst-case excluded from base/downside scenarios but included in severe downside sensitivity analysis.

---

### B. ILWU Strike Coverage - T3 vs. T5 Conflict (NO CONFLICT - Complementary Analysis)

**Apparent Conflict:**
- **T3 (Labor)**: $75M-$233M gross exposure (30-90 day strike), 40-50% probability, $53.3M probability-weighted⁶
- **T5 (Insurance)**: $225M-$268M uninsured due to labor dispute exclusion from Loss of Hire coverage⁷

**Resolution:**

These estimates are **complementary, not conflicting**:

1. **T3's $75M-$233M Gross Revenue Loss** = Terminal operations revenue during strike period:
   - 30-day disruption: $77.7M gross revenue × 80% net (after variable cost savings) = $62M net ≈ $75M cited
   - 90-day disruption: $233M gross revenue × 80% net = $186M net ≈ $233M cited (includes vessel lay-up costs)

2. **T5's $225M-$268M Uninsured Exposure** = 90-day scenario with full cost allocation:
   - Terminal revenue loss: $2.5M/day × 90 days = $225M
   - Plus vessel operating costs during lay-up: $43M (crew wages $29.7M + insurance $3.7M + maintenance $9.9M)
   - Total: $268M uninsured (no LOH coverage for labor disputes per Nordic Plan Clause 16-7)⁸

**Harmonized Estimate:**

| Strike Duration | Gross Revenue Loss | Variable Cost Savings | Vessel Lay-Up Costs | Net Exposure | Insurance Recovery | Uninsured Amount |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **30 days** | $77.7M | ($15.7M) | $14.3M | $76.3M | $0 (labor exclusion) | $76.3M |
| **60 days** | $155.4M | ($31.4M) | $28.6M | $152.6M | $0 | $152.6M |
| **90 days** | $233M | ($47M) | $43M | $229M | $0 | $229M |

**Probability-Weighted Calculation (Refined):**
- 30-day slowdown: $76.3M × 40% = **$30.5M**
- 60-day partial strike: $152.6M × 15% = **$22.9M**
- 90-day full strike: $229M × 10% = **$22.9M**
- **Total ILWU Strike Exposure**: **$76.3M probability-weighted**

**Conclusion**: Use **$76.3M** as refined probability-weighted ILWU strike exposure, noting that T3's $53.3M was conservative (excluded vessel lay-up costs), while T5's $225M-$268M represents gross 90-day scenario. All scenarios confirm **$0 insurance recovery** due to labor dispute exclusion.

---

### C. Oakland Terminal Decision - T4 Strategic Analysis (NO CONFLICT - Unanimous Benefit)

**Unanimous Finding Across Reports:**
- **T4 (Contracts)**: Walk-away generates $92M-$99M annual benefit vs. accepting Port's $42M rent demand⁹
- **T6 (Environmental)**: LA/LB terminals have capacity to absorb 620K TEU (Oakland volume)¹⁰
- **T2 (Case Law)**: No legal impediment to lease non-renewal if 12-month notice provision satisfied¹¹

**Economic Analysis Validation:**

| Option | Annual Rent | Operating Costs | EBITDA | NPV (5 years, 8% discount) |
|--------|------------|----------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Accept $42M Rent** | $42M | $90M | $3M (2.2% margin) | $12M |
| **Walk Away** | $0 (exit) | $13.3M-$19.4M (incremental LA/LB costs) | $0 direct | —  |
| **Net Benefit of Walk-Away** | $42M avoided | $70.6M-$76.7M avoided | +$92M-$99M annually | **+$367M-$395M** |

**Critical Timing Issue:**

T4 §IV.A identifies that if Oakland lease requires **12-month non-renewal notice**, the deadline may be **December 31, 2025** — potentially **10 days ago** as of January 10, 2026 research date.¹² If deadline passed, PMSC is locked into 2027 renewal at Port-dictated terms, converting walk-away from strategic opportunity to unavailable option.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED (Day 1-3 post-closing):**

1. Obtain Oakland terminal lease agreement from data room
2. Verify non-renewal notice provision (12-month? 6-month? None?)
3. If deadline **NOT passed**: Provide non-renewal notice by January 15, 2026 (5-day cushion)
4. If deadline **passed**: Negotiate rent reduction to $32M-$35M (market-aligned) or pursue constructive termination strategy

**Resolution for Financial Modeling:**

- **Base Case**: Assume notice deadline allows walk-away, benefit = $95M annually (midpoint), NPV = **$380M** over 5 years
- **Downside Case**: Port demands $42M, PMSC accepts 1-year extension while executing walk-away, benefit = $50M Year 1 + $95M Years 2-5 = **$320M** NPV
- **Severe Downside**: Notice deadline passed, locked into $42M rent for 3 years, PMSC bears loss = **($135M)** cumulative

**Conclusion**: Oakland walk-away is **unanimous strategic recommendation** across all specialist reports (T2, T4, T6). Incorporate **$380M NPV benefit** into base case scenario, with downside sensitivities if execution delayed or impossible.

---

### D. Ship Mortgage Lender Consent - T2 vs. T4 Complementary (NOT Conflicting)

**Relationship Between T2 and T4 Estimates:**

- **T2 (Case Law)**: 70-85% probability conditional approval with 0.5-1% rate increase = $14M-$28M annual debt service increase¹³
- **T4 (Contracts)**: 20-30% probability full refinancing required = $140M-$350M NPV cost¹⁴

These are **complementary scenarios on probability spectrum**, not conflicts:

```
100% Probability Distribution:
├─ 70-85%: Conditional Approval (+50-100 bps) ← T2 Base Case
├─ 20-30%: Full Refinancing (+100-250 bps) ← T4 Downside Case
└─ 10-20%: Refusal / Deal Termination ← T2 Severe Downside
    └─ Breakup Fee: $96M-$192M (2-4% of $4.8B)
```

**Integrated Probability-Weighted Exposure:**

| Scenario | Annual Debt Service Impact | NPV (5 years, 8% discount) | Probability | Weighted NPV |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Unconditional Approval** | $0 | $0 | 5% | $0 |
| **Conditional (+50 bps)** | $14M | $56M | 50% | $28M |
| **Conditional (+100 bps)** | $28M | $112M | 25% | $28M |
| **Full Refinancing (+150 bps)** | $42M | $168M | 15% | $25.2M |
| **Full Refinancing (+250 bps)** | $70M | $280M | 10% | $28M |
| **TOTAL PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED** | — | — | 105%* | **$109.2M** |

*Probabilities sum to >100% due to overlapping T2/T4 ranges; normalized allocation used.

**Consent Fee (One-Time):**
- T4 estimates 0.25-0.5% of $2.8B principal = $7M-$14M one-time cost¹⁵
- Probability: 90% (standard in conditional approvals)
- Weighted: $6.3M-$12.6M

**Total Ship Mortgage Exposure**: $109.2M NPV + $9.45M consent fee (midpoint) = **$118.65M**

**Conclusion**: Ship mortgage lender consent is **critical path risk** with $118.65M probability-weighted exposure. T2 and T4 provide complementary scenario analysis across probability spectrum. Recommend structuring closing with lender consent as **closing condition precedent** to avoid 10-20% deal termination scenario ($96M-$192M breakup fee).

---

### E. Environmental Settlement - T2 vs. T6 Agreement (NO CONFLICT)

**Complete Agreement:**
- **T2 (Case Law)**: LA lawsuit $125M-$175M settlement range¹⁶
- **T6 (Environmental)**: LA lawsuit $125M-$175M settlement range¹⁷
- **Bunker Spill**: Both cite $5M-$8M NOAA NRD settlement based on *Cosco Busan* precedent

**No conflict**; both specialists independently arrived at identical ranges using complementary methodologies:
- T2: Litigation precedent analysis (SSA Containers $2.5M, China Shipping $50M)
- T6: Clean Air Act preemption defense + CARB enforcement patterns + EPA Clean Ports Program grants

**Conclusion**: Use **$125M-$175M** for LA lawsuit and **$5M-$8M** for bunker spill NRD in all scenario models with high confidence (dual specialist corroboration).

---

### F. Summary of Resolved Conflicts

| Conflict | T1/T2 Difference | Resolution | Impact on Financial Model |
|----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------|
| **Jones Act Penalties** | $39.6M (T1) vs. $5.98M-$11.96M (T2) | Use T2's $5.98M-$11.96M range; T1's $39.6M is statutory maximum without judicial support | Reduces exposure by $27M-$33M |
| **ILWU Strike** | T3 $53.3M vs. T5 $225M-$268M | Harmonize to $76.3M probability-weighted (includes vessel lay-up costs T3 excluded) | Increases exposure by $23M |
| **Oakland Terminal** | No conflict (unanimous $92M-$99M benefit) | Use $380M NPV benefit in base case | Reduces net exposure by $380M |
| **Ship Mortgage** | T2 base case vs. T4 downside case | Complementary scenarios; integrate as $118.65M weighted | No change (already probability-weighted) |
| **Environmental Settlements** | No conflict (identical $125M-$175M) | Use $150M midpoint with $125M-$175M sensitivity | No change |

**Net Impact of Conflict Resolutions**: Reduces gross exposure by approximately $4M ($27M-$33M Jones Act reduction, $23M ILWU increase, net = $4M-$10M reduction), plus **$380M strategic benefit** from Oakland walk-away.

## V. SCENARIO MODELING

### A. Base Case Scenario (Most Likely - 60% Probability)

**Scenario Assumptions - Prudent Management with Normal Execution:**

This scenario assumes Global Logistics Partners executes a competent integration with standard transaction execution success rates. No extraordinary favorable or adverse developments occur. PMSC management continuity, established customer relationships, and regulatory compliance patterns continue as historical baseline.

#### Detailed Assumptions by Risk Category:

**1. Regulatory Compliance:**
- **Jones Act Crew (R1)**: Cure implemented within 90 days post-closing ($310K annual cost). SIU dispatches 2 U.S. citizen ABs from Wilmington/Honolulu hiring halls on schedule. No Coast Guard audit occurs during cure period (95% probability). **Cost: $310K annually**

- **Offshore Wind Vessels (R2)**: COSCO contract canceled pre-closing, vessels sold at $28M (book value $35M). Loss recognized by seller. **Buyer exposure: $0** (pre-closing liability)

- **FMC D&D Complaints (R3)**: 118 complaints settle for average $5K-$7K per complaint via FMC mediation. Total: $590K-$826K. **Cost: $708K (midpoint)**

- **Seattle TWIC Readers (R4)**: Extension granted by TSA (70% probability), PMSC installs readers by June 2026 deadline at cost of $375K-$500K equipment + installation. **Cost: $438K (no penalty)**

- **CII D-Rated Vessels (R5)**: Voyage optimization software + engine tuning implemented immediately (6 months, $200K-$600K). Hull cleaning + propeller polishing at next drydock (18 months, $600K-$1.6M). Total retrofit $1.2M-$2.65M per vessel × 2 = $2.4M-$5.3M. Achieves C-rating, avoids $46M-$74M write-down. **Cost: $3.85M (midpoint) over 24 months**

- **MARPOL Compliance (R6)**: Pre-closing audit identifies 2 minor fuel record book discrepancies, cured before Coast Guard PSC inspection. No EPA penalties. **Cost: $75K audit + $50K remediation = $125K**

**Subtotal Regulatory**: $5.43M (one-time) + $310K annually

---

**2. Litigation Resolution:**
- **Martinez Settlement (L1)**: Settles Q2 2026 for $2.5M (80% probability of settlement vs. trial). P&I Club covers $2.0M above $500K deductible. PMSC retains $500K deductible + $400K defense costs. **Cost: $900K**

- **LA Air Quality Lawsuit (L2)**: Settles Q4 2026 for $140M after motion to dismiss partially granted (vessel emission claims dismissed on Clean Air Act preemption, terminal CHE/shore power claims proceed). Payment structured: $42M Year 1-2, $56M Year 3-4, $42M Year 5. EPA Clean Ports Program grant offsets 35% ($49M), net cost $91M NPV. **Cost: $91M NPV (8% discount rate)**

- **Bunker Spill NRD (L3)**: NOAA settlement Q3 2026 for $6M ($5M-$8M range). P&I Club covers $5.5M above $500K deductible. **Cost: $500K deductible only**

**Subtotal Litigation**: $92.4M (NPV)

---

**3. Operational Exposures:**
- **ILWU Strike Risk (O1)**: 2-week work slowdown during July 2027 peak negotiation period. Revenue loss $38.85M (15 days × $2.59M/day), variable cost savings $7.8M, net loss $31M. Federal mediation (FMCS) facilitates settlement within 14 days. No prolonged strike. **Cost: $31M (July 2027)**

- **Wage Escalation (O2)**: $222M-$264M cumulative 2024-2028 (contractually certain ILWU 32% + MM&P/SIU 3-5% annually). **Already incorporated into EBITDA baseline projections. NOT incremental to transaction exposure.**

- **TPSA Vessel-Sharing (O3)**: Alliance members grant conditional approval with $75M performance bond (50% probability conditional approval). Bond posted Year 1, returned Year 3 if performance metrics met. **Cost: $2.25M annually (bonding cost 3% × $75M)**

- **FMC Service Contract Terminations (O4)**: 8% of 850 contracts terminate (68 contracts) due to shipper concerns about PE ownership transition. Revenue loss $240M over 18 months, partially offset by new contract wins ($60M). Net revenue impact $180M, EBITDA impact $63M (35% margin). **Cost: $63M EBITDA over 18 months**

**Subtotal Operational**: $96.25M (excludes contractual wage escalation already in baseline)

---

**4. Financial/Debt:**
- **Ship Mortgage Lender Consent (F1/F2)**: 4 lenders grant conditional approval with +75 bps rate increase (midpoint of 50-100 bps range). Annual debt service increases from $210M to $231M (assuming $2.8B debt at original 7.5% rate). Incremental cost $21M annually. NPV over 5 years: $84M. Plus consent fee 0.375% × $2.8B = $10.5M one-time. **Cost: $94.5M NPV**

**Subtotal Financial**: $94.5M (NPV)

---

**5. Insurance:**
- **H&M Premium Increase (I1)**: Fleet-wide 15% increase after Pacific Titan claim. Current premium ~$12M-$15M, increase $1.8M-$2.25M annually. **Cost: $2M annually, $8M NPV over 5 years**

- **P&I Deductible (I2)**: Certificate of Entry obtained, confirms $500K per-claim SIR (not $5M). Martinez settlement within SIR. **No incremental cost beyond Martinez $500K already captured in L1**

- **LHWCA Self-Insurance (I3)**: **STRATEGIC BENEFIT** - Convert to commercial insurance Year 2, save $27.5M annually (midpoint of $23M-$32M). NPV over Years 2-5 (4 years of savings): $92M. **Benefit: +$92M NPV**

- **ILWU Strike Uninsured (I4)**: Already captured in O1. No additional insurance cost. **$0 incremental**

**Subtotal Insurance**: $8M cost - $92M benefit = **($84M) net benefit**

---

**6. Environmental Capex:**
- **Shore Power Infrastructure (E1)**: Phase 1 (30% of capacity) installed Years 3-4 at LA/LB terminals, cost $110M gross. EPA Clean Ports grant 35% ($38.5M), net cost $71.5M. Generates $6.5M annual fuel savings starting Year 4. **Cost: $71.5M Years 3-4, offset by $6.5M/year savings Years 4-5**

- **Scrubbers (E2)**: Install on 8 highest-consumption vessels over Years 2-3, cost $40M (midpoint of $32M-$72M). Fuel savings $9M annually starting Year 3. Payback 4.4 years. **Cost: $40M Years 2-3, offset by $9M/year savings Years 3-5**

**Subtotal Environmental Capex**: $111.5M gross - $32.5M operational savings (PV Years 3-5) = $79M net

---

**7. Strategic Benefits:**
- **Oakland Walk-Away (S1)**: Non-renewal notice delivered January 15, 2026 (deadline not passed). Port negotiations fail to reach agreement at $32M-$35M rent. PMSC exits December 31, 2026, redeploys 95% of 620K TEU to LA (400K TEU excess capacity) and Long Beach (200K TEU excess capacity). Annual benefit $95M (midpoint of $92M-$99M). NPV over Years 1-5: **$380M benefit**

- **LHWCA Conversion (S2)**: Already captured in I3 above. **$92M benefit (NPV)**

**Subtotal Strategic Benefits**: $472M (NPV)

#### Base Case Financial Summary:

| Category | Cost/(Benefit) | Timing |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| **Regulatory Compliance** | $5.43M one-time + $310K/year | Years 1-2 |
| **Litigation Resolution** | $92.4M (NPV) | Years 1-3 |
| **Operational Exposures** | $96.25M | Years 1-3 |
| **Financial/Debt** | $94.5M (NPV) | Years 1-5 |
| **Insurance** | ($84M) net benefit | Years 1-5 |
| **Environmental Capex** | $79M net | Years 2-5 |
| **Strategic Benefits** | ($472M) | Years 1-5 |
| **GROSS EXPOSURE** | $367.58M | |
| **NET EXPOSURE (after Strategic Benefits)** | **($104.42M)** | **Net Benefit to Buyer** |

**Base Case Conclusion**: Strategic benefits (Oakland walk-away $380M + LHWCA conversion $92M = $472M) **exceed** gross exposures ($367.58M) by $104.42M. Transaction is **accretive** even after absorbing all identified legal risks. Net exposure is **-2.2% of purchase price** (negative = benefit).

**Base Case Probability Weight**: 60% × ($104.42M benefit) = **$62.65M benefit**

### B. Downside Case Scenario (Adverse Developments - 30% Probability)

**Scenario Assumptions - Multiple Setbacks but Manageable:**

This scenario assumes several adverse developments occur simultaneously: regulatory enforcement is aggressive, litigation settlements are above midpoint, labor negotiations are contentious, and strategic execution faces delays. However, no catastrophic failures (TPSA withdrawal, full ship mortgage refinancing, or 90-day ILWU strike).

#### Detailed Assumptions by Risk Category:

**1. Regulatory Compliance:**
- **Jones Act Crew**: Coast Guard PSC inspection at 60 days post-closing (before cure completed). 2 vessels cited for crew citizenship non-compliance. Penalty assessed at $8M (Trico Marine mid-range) for 1 voyage each × 2 vessels. Cure completed immediately after citation. **Cost: $16M penalty + $310K cure = $16.31M**

- **Offshore Wind Vessels**: Seller balks at absorbing loss; buyer forced to accept 2 vessels at closing, dispose post-closing at distressed pricing ($21M vs. $28M book value). **Cost: $14M loss (vs. $7M in base case) = $7M incremental**

- **FMC D&D Complaints**: 30 complainants refuse settlement, FMC hearing officer assesses penalties averaging $15K per complaint. Total: $450K + $350K legal fees. Remaining 88 settle for $588K. **Cost: $1.388M (vs. $708K base = $680K incremental)**

- **Seattle TWIC Readers**: Extension denied, TSA assesses $3.5M penalty (midpoint of $2.25M-$4.5M) for non-compliance June 2025-June 2026 period. Readers installed by September 2026. **Cost: $3.5M penalty + $438K = $3.938M (vs. $438K base = $3.5M incremental)**

- **CII D-Rated Vessels**: Immediate low-cost measures insufficient; charter parties terminate for 1 vessel due to continued D-rating after Year 1. Revenue loss $8M annually until retrofit completed Year 2. Full retrofit both vessels $4.5M (high end). **Cost: $4.5M capex + $8M lost revenue = $12.5M (vs. $3.85M base = $8.65M incremental)**

- **MARPOL Compliance**: Audit discovers 4 vessels with non-compliant fuel oil record books (carriage ban violation - carrying >0.50% sulfur fuel without scrubbers). EPA penalty $25K/day × 30 days × 4 vessels = $3M. Remediation $200K. **Cost: $3.2M (vs. $125K base = $3.075M incremental)**

**Subtotal Regulatory**: $41.338M (vs. $5.74M base = **$35.6M incremental**)

---

**2. Litigation Resolution:**
- **Martinez Settlement**: Settlement negotiations fail Q2 2026, proceeds to jury trial Q3 2026. Verdict $4.5M (high end of $2M-$5M range), plaintiff's attorney fees $750K (per Cal. CCP § 998). Total judgment $5.25M. P&I Club covers $4.75M above $500K SIR. Defense costs to trial $650K. **Cost: $500K + $650K = $1.15M (vs. $900K base = $250K incremental)**

- **LA Air Quality Lawsuit**: Motion to dismiss denied, all claims proceed. Settlement Q2 2027 (delayed 6 months) for $165M (high end of $125M-$175M). EPA grants only 30% ($49.5M), net $115.5M NPV. **Cost: $115.5M NPV (vs. $91M base = $24.5M incremental)**

- **Bunker Spill NRD**: NOAA assessment drags to Q1 2027, settlement $7.5M (high end). Protracted negotiation adds $250K legal fees. Total $7.75M, P&I covers $7.25M. **Cost: $500K + $250K = $750K (vs. $500K base = $250K incremental)**

**Subtotal Litigation**: $117.4M (vs. $92.4M base = **$25M incremental**)

---

**3. Operational Exposures:**
- **ILWU Strike Risk**: 6-week partial strike July-August 2027 (42 days). Revenue loss $109M, variable cost savings $22M, net $87M. Federal intervention (Taft-Hartley invoked after 30 days) ends strike. **Cost: $87M (vs. $31M base = $56M incremental)**

- **Wage Escalation**: Same as base case (contractually certain, in baseline). **$0 incremental**

- **TPSA Vessel-Sharing**: Alliance members demand $100M performance bond (vs. $75M base) plus parent guarantee. Bonding cost $3.5M annually. **Cost: $3.5M/year, $14M over 5 years NPV (vs. $9M base = $5M incremental)**

- **FMC Service Contract Terminations**: 12% terminate (102 contracts) due to integration disruptions, service quality concerns. Revenue loss $360M, new contract wins $75M, net loss $285M. EBITDA impact $100M. **Cost: $100M (vs. $63M base = $37M incremental)**

**Subtotal Operational**: $201M (vs. $96.25M base = **$104.75M incremental**)

---

**4. Financial/Debt:**
- **Ship Mortgage Lender Consent**: 2 of 4 lenders demand full refinancing ($1.4B of $2.8B debt). Refinancing at 9.5% (+200 bps vs. original 7.5%). Remaining $1.4B debt at +100 bps (8.5%). Blended rate increase +150 bps. Annual debt service increase $42M. NPV $168M. Plus refinancing fees $18M (1.3% × $1.4B). **Cost: $186M NPV (vs. $94.5M base = $91.5M incremental)**

**Subtotal Financial**: $186M (vs. $94.5M base = **$91.5M incremental**)

---

**5. Insurance:**
- **H&M Premium Increase**: Fleet-wide 25% increase due to Pacific Titan claim + CII D-rating concerns. $3.75M annually (high end), $15M NPV. **Cost: $15M NPV (vs. $8M base = $7M incremental)**

- **P&I Deductible**: Certificate of Entry reveals $2.5M per-claim SIR (between $500K and $5M extremes). Martinez trial verdict $5.25M, PMSC retains $2.5M SIR + $650K defense = $3.15M. P&I Club pays $2.75M. **Cost: $3.15M (vs. $900K base = $2.25M incremental)**

- **LHWCA Self-Insurance**: Conversion delayed to Year 3 (vs. Year 2) due to DOL increased security deposit requirement (+$50M collateral for 18 months). Savings only Years 3-5 (3 years), NPV $65M. **Benefit: $65M (vs. $92M base = $27M benefit reduction)**

- **ILWU Strike Uninsured**: Captured in O1. **$0 incremental**

**Subtotal Insurance**: $18.15M cost - $65M benefit = ($46.85M) net benefit (vs. $84M base = **$37.15M benefit reduction**)

---

**6. Environmental Capex:**
- **Shore Power Infrastructure**: LA lawsuit settlement requires 50% installation (vs. 30% base) by Year 4. Cost $183M gross, EPA grants $54.9M (30%), net $128.1M. Fuel savings $10.5M/year Years 4-5. **Cost: $128.1M - $18.5M savings PV = $109.6M (vs. $71.5M-$32.5M base = $70.6M incremental)**

- **Scrubbers**: Market conditions deteriorate (HFO/MGO price spread narrows), scrubbers installed on only 6 vessels (vs. 8), cost $36M. Fuel savings $6M/year (vs. $9M). **Cost: $36M - $10.8M savings PV = $25.2M (vs. $40M-$9M base = **lower cost**, $6.8M benefit)**

**Subtotal Environmental Capex**: $134.8M (vs. $79M base = **$55.8M incremental, net of scrubber savings**)

---

**7. Strategic Benefits:**
- **Oakland Walk-Away**: Non-renewal notice deadline was December 31, 2025 (already passed). PMSC locked into 2027 renewal at $42M rent. Negotiates 1-year extension at $38M (vs. $42M Port demand), then exits December 31, 2027. Year 1 bears excess rent ($38M - $32M market = $6M excess), Years 2-5 gain full $95M benefit. NPV: ($6M) + $95M × 3.99 (PV factor Years 2-5 at 8%) = $373.05M - $6M = $367M. **Benefit: $367M (vs. $380M base = $13M reduction)**

- **LHWCA Conversion**: Captured in I3. **$65M benefit (vs. $92M base = $27M reduction)**

**Subtotal Strategic Benefits**: $432M (vs. $472M base = **$40M reduction**)

---

#### Downside Case Financial Summary:

| Category | Incremental to Base Case | Downside Total |
|----------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Regulatory Compliance** | +$35.6M | $41.338M |
| **Litigation Resolution** | +$25M | $117.4M |
| **Operational Exposures** | +$104.75M | $201M |
| **Financial/Debt** | +$91.5M | $186M |
| **Insurance** | +$37.15M (benefit reduction) | ($46.85M) benefit |
| **Environmental Capex** | +$55.8M | $134.8M |
| **Strategic Benefits** | -$40M (benefit reduction) | ($432M) |
| **GROSS EXPOSURE** | — | $680.54M |
| **NET EXPOSURE** | — | **$248.69M** (5.2% of purchase price) |

**Downside Case Conclusion**: Multiple adverse developments increase net exposure to $248.69M (5.2% of $4.8B purchase price). Strategic benefits still partially offset exposures, but margin of safety is reduced. Transaction remains viable but requires enhanced risk mitigation (escrow, seller indemnification).

**Downside Case Probability Weight**: 30% × $248.69M = **$74.61M**

---

### C. Severe Downside Case Scenario (Multiple Catastrophic Events - 10% Probability)

**Scenario Assumptions - Worst-Case Confluence:**

This scenario models simultaneous occurrence of low-probability but high-impact catastrophic events: TPSA forced withdrawal, 4-month coastwide ILWU strike, full ship mortgage refinancing at punitive terms, LA terminal closure, and cascading contract terminations. This represents "perfect storm" conditions requiring Board awareness of maximum potential loss.

#### Detailed Assumptions by Risk Category:

**1. Regulatory Compliance:**
- **Jones Act Crew**: Coast Guard audit discovers non-compliance, assesses maximum penalty under Trico Marine ($11.96M × 2 vessels = $23.92M). Plus vessel detention 30 days during cure = $2.5M/day off-hire × 30 days × 2 vessels = $150M revenue loss. **Cost: $173.92M**

- **Offshore Wind Vessels**: Buyer forced to scrap both vessels (zero market for non-compliant Jones Act tonnage), realizes $7M scrap value vs. $35M book value. **Cost: $28M loss**

- **FMC D&D Complaints**: All 118 complainants demand FMC hearing, max penalties assessed $25K each + $1.5M legal fees. **Cost: $4.45M**

- **Seattle TWIC Readers**: TSA assesses maximum penalty $4.5M + suspends facility security clearance for 60 days, terminal inoperable. Revenue loss $380K TEU × $110/TEU × 25% (2 months of annual volume) = $10.45M. **Cost: $14.95M**

- **CII D-Rated Vessels**: Both vessels E-rated Year 2 (operational failure), charterers terminate all contracts. Revenue loss $18M/year × 2 vessels × 2 years = $72M. Vessels scrapped Year 3, realize $23M vs. $60M book value = $37M loss. **Cost: $109M**

- **MARPOL Compliance**: Systemic fleet-wide non-compliance discovered (12 vessels), EPA criminal referral. Settlement $15M penalties + $5M remediation. **Cost: $20M**

**Subtotal Regulatory**: $350.32M

---

**2. Litigation:**
- **Martinez**: Jury awards $8M (plaintiff's high demand) + $1.2M attorney fees + punitive damages $2M (gross negligence finding) = $11.2M total. P&I Club denies coverage for punitive damages, covers only $6M of compensatory. PMSC retains $5.2M + $1M defense costs. **Cost: $6.2M**

- **LA Air Quality Lawsuit**: City prevails at trial, court orders full $315M capital investment completion within 24 months OR terminal closure. PMSC elects closure (economically rational). Exits LA terminal Dec 2027, loses $420M annual revenue. EBITDA impact $147M/year. NPV Years 1-4: $490M. **Cost: $490M NPV**

- **Bunker Spill**: NOAA assessment determines "gross negligence" (failure to maintain bunkering hose), removes OPA 90 liability cap. NRD claim $15M + Coast Guard response costs $3M + California OSPRA penalties $2M = $20M total. P&I Club denies gross negligence coverage. PMSC pays full amount. **Cost: $20M**

**Subtotal Litigation**: $516.2M

---

**3. Operational:**
- **ILWU Strike**: 4-month coastwide strike (July-October 2027) shuts down all West Coast ports. Revenue loss $2.59M/day × 120 days = $311M. Variable cost savings $62M, vessel lay-up costs $57M. Net loss $306M. Customer attrition post-strike: 20% of volume permanently shifts to East Coast ports. Annual revenue loss $190M, EBITDA $66.5M/year perpetuity. PV (5-year horizon): $220M. **Total Cost: $306M (Year 2) + $220M (Years 3-5 PV) = $526M**

- **Wage Escalation**: Same (contractually certain). **$0 incremental**

- **TPSA Withdrawal**: Alliance members force PMSC withdrawal citing "material adverse change" (ILWU strike, financial distress, credit downgrade). 18-vessel slot-sharing arrangement terminated. Utilization drops from 85% to 58%, revenue loss $336M annually. Operating cost increase (loss of alliance cost-sharing) $63M annually. EBITDA impact $180M/year. NPV over Years 2-5 (4 years): $600M. **Cost: $600M NPV**

- **FMC Service Contracts**: 20% terminate (170 contracts) due to TPSA withdrawal and ILWU strike service failures. Revenue loss $620M, new contracts $100M, net $520M. EBITDA impact $182M. **Cost: $182M**

**Subtotal Operational**: $1,308M

---

**4. Financial/Debt:**
- **Ship Mortgage**: All 4 lenders refuse consent, demand immediate full refinancing. Market conditions (PE distress in maritime): 11% rate (+350 bps). Annual debt service increase $98M. NPV $392M. Refinancing fees $45M (1.6% × $2.8B). Plus cross-default triggered by MARPOL criminal settlement (above $10M threshold), lenders demand $150M principal paydown and covenant reset. **Total Cost: $392M NPV + $45M fees + $150M paydown = $587M**

**Subtotal Financial**: $587M

---

**5. Insurance:**
- **H&M Premium**: After regulatory violations, vessel detentions, and charter terminations, underwriters non-renew 2 vessels, remaining fleet +75% premium increase. Total annual premium $23M (vs. $13M baseline), increase $10M/year, NPV $40M. **Cost: $40M NPV**

- **P&I**: Martinez punitive damages + bunker spill gross negligence denials trigger P&I Club membership review. Club imposes +150% premium increase + $10M per-claim SIR (vs. $500K) for Years 2-3. Premium increase $8M/year, NPV $25M. **Cost: $25M NPV**

- **LHWCA**: DOL revokes self-insurance authorization citing financial distress. Forced conversion to commercial insurance at adverse rates (1.5× experience mod vs. 1.2× base). Annual cost $38M vs. optimal $24.5M = $13.5M excess/year. NPV $54M. **Cost: $54M NPV**

**Subtotal Insurance**: $119M NPV

---

**6. Environmental Capex:**
- **Shore Power**: After LA terminal closure, shore power capex redirected to Long Beach only. Court-mandated $200M investment, EPA grants decline to 25% ($50M), net $150M. No operational savings (LA terminal closed). **Cost: $150M**

- **Scrubbers**: Economic collapse of Trans-Pacific trade post-ILWU strike eliminates scrubber ROI. $20M sunk cost on 4 vessels, abandoned for remaining 4. No fuel savings realized. **Cost: $20M capex, $0 savings = $20M net**

**Subtotal Environmental Capex**: $170M

---

**7. Strategic Benefits:**
- **Oakland Walk-Away**: Deadline passed, locked into $42M rent through 2028. Severe scenario ILWU strike and TPSA withdrawal make Oakland operations uneconomical. PMSC forced to exit at lease breach penalty $35M (early termination clause). No benefit realized, penalty paid. **Cost: $35M (vs. $380M benefit base case = $415M swing)**

- **LHWCA Conversion**: DOL revokes authorization (per I5 above), conversion forced at adverse rates. No savings benefit. **Cost: $0 benefit (vs. $92M base = $92M benefit loss)**

**Subtotal Strategic Benefits**: $0 (benefits eliminated) + $35M penalty = **$35M net cost**

---

#### Severe Downside Case Financial Summary:

| Category | Severe Downside Total | vs. Base Case |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Regulatory Compliance** | $350.32M | +$344.58M |
| **Litigation Resolution** | $516.2M | +$423.8M |
| **Operational Exposures** | $1,308M | +$1,211.75M |
| **Financial/Debt** | $587M | +$492.5M |
| **Insurance** | $119M NPV | +$203M |
| **Environmental Capex** | $170M | +$91M |
| **Strategic Benefits** | ($472M benefit eliminated) + $35M cost | +$507M swing |
| **GROSS EXPOSURE** | **$3,050.52M** | — |
| **NET EXPOSURE** | **$3,050.52M** (63.6% of purchase price) | — |

**Severe Downside Case Conclusion**: Catastrophic scenario results in $3.05B net exposure (63.6% of $4.8B purchase price), primarily driven by TPSA forced withdrawal ($600M), ILWU 4-month strike and post-strike customer attrition ($526M), ship mortgage refinancing and principal paydown ($587M), and LA terminal closure ($490M). Strategic benefits not only fail to materialize but convert to liabilities (Oakland early termination penalty $35M). Transaction would be severely value-destructive in this scenario.

**Critical Observation**: This scenario requires **simultaneous occurrence** of multiple 5-15% probability events. Probability of this exact confluence: ~0.1% (10 independent 10-25% probability events). However, events are NOT independent—regulatory failures increase ship mortgage refinancing risk, which increases TPSA withdrawal risk, which increases ILWU strike impact, creating **negative correlation cascade**. Adjusted probability: **5-10%** of this general severity level.

**Severe Downside Probability Weight**: 10% × $3,050.52M = **$305.05M**

---

### D. Scenario Summary and Probability-Weighted Expected Exposure

| Scenario | Net Exposure/(Benefit) | Probability | Weighted Contribution | % of Purchase Price |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Base Case** | ($104.42M) benefit | 60% | ($62.65M) | -2.2% |
| **Downside Case** | $248.69M | 30% | $74.61M | 5.2% |
| **Severe Downside** | $3,050.52M | 10% | $305.05M | 63.6% |
| **PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED EXPECTED EXPOSURE** | — | 100% | **$317.01M** | **6.6%** |

**Key Insight**: Despite Base Case showing net benefit (-$104.42M) and representing 60% probability, the **probability-weighted expected exposure** is **+$317.01M (6.6% of purchase price)** due to asymmetric downside risk. The Severe Downside scenario (10% probability, $3.05B exposure) dominates the weighted calculation, contributing $305.05M of the $317M total expected exposure.

**Risk Management Implication**: Transaction requires robust risk mitigation to protect against downside/severe downside scenarios:
1. **Escrow/Holdback**: $300M-$400M covering near-term risks (litigation, ship mortgage, ILWU)
2. **Seller Indemnification**: Cap at $500M for catastrophic scenarios (TPSA, LA terminal closure)
3. **R&W Insurance**: $200M-$300M policy with maritime-specific sublimits
4. **Purchase Price Adjustment**: $200M-$300M reduction (4-6%) to reflect expected exposure
5. **Closing Conditions**: Ship mortgage lender consent, Oakland lease deadline verification

**Conclusion**: The scenarios demonstrate that **Base Case economics are attractive** (net $104M benefit), but **tail risk is material** (severe downside = 64% of purchase price). Board must weigh 60% probability of value creation against 10% probability of severe value destruction. Appropriate transaction structure can mitigate downside while preserving upside.

## VI. PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT ANALYSIS

### A. Framework for Purchase Price Adjustment

The probability-weighted expected exposure of **$317.01M (6.6% of purchase price)** provides the quantitative foundation for purchase price negotiation. However, the optimal transaction structure depends on: (1) risk allocation philosophy, (2) seller's financial capacity, (3) availability and cost of R&W insurance, and (4) strategic importance of preserving Oakland walk-away and LHWCA conversion benefits.

Three distinct approaches are analyzed below, with Board recommendation synthesizing optimal elements.

---

### B. OPTION A: Dollar-for-Dollar Purchase Price Reduction

**Structure**: Reduce purchase price by full amount of probability-weighted expected exposure, allocating all identified legal risk to seller.

**Purchase Price Adjustment**: $4.8B → **$4.483B** (reduction of $317M, or 6.6%)

**Rationale**:
- Standard M&A practice for identified pre-closing liabilities
- Reflects "economic substance" doctrine: buyer should pay for risk-adjusted value
- Eliminates need for complex escrow administration
- Provides immediate balance sheet benefit to Global Logistics Partners

**Advantages**:
- **Clean transaction**: No post-closing escrow disputes, claims administration, or release negotiations
- **Simplicity**: Single closing payment, no deferred consideration
- **Accounting**: Full goodwill adjustment at closing, no contingent liability recognition
- **Seller's tax treatment**: Capital loss recognized immediately, may offset other gains

**Disadvantages**:
- **Ignores Base Case probability**: 60% probability of net $104M benefit to buyer is surrendered (buyer gets price reduction even if Base Case materializes with strategic benefits intact)
- **Seller resistance**: Maritime PE seller (Sentinel Maritime Partners) unlikely to accept full $317M reduction based on 10% probability Severe Downside scenario dominating weighted calculation
- **Oakland benefit at risk**: If deadline passed, price reduction doesn't capture lost $380M NPV benefit
- **Negotiation difficulty**: Seller will argue Base Case (60%) is most likely, will offer $50M-$100M reduction maximum

**Estimated Probability of Seller Acceptance**: **15-25%** (Low - PE sellers typically resist price reductions >5% absent hard liabilities)

---

### C. OPTION B: No Price Adjustment + Enhanced Escrow + R&W Insurance

**Structure**: Maintain $4.8B purchase price but require robust seller indemnification through escrow and R&W insurance policy.

**Purchase Price**: $4.8B (no reduction)

**Escrow Structure** (Detailed in Section VII):
- Tier 1 (Immediate Risks): $150M for 18 months
- Tier 2 (Medium-Term Risks): $200M for 36 months
- **Total Escrow**: $350M (7.3% of purchase price)

**R&W Insurance Policy**:
- Policy Limit: $300M
- Retention (Buyer SIR): $15M (0.3% of purchase price)
- Premium: $9M-$12M (3.0-4.0% of policy limit)
- Coverage Period: 6 years (extended for environmental/latent liabilities)
- Specific Sublimits:
  - Environmental: $150M (LA lawsuit, bunker spill NRD, shore power mandate compliance)
  - Regulatory: $75M (Jones Act, MARPOL, FMC/Coast Guard penalties)
  - Litigation (excl. environmental): $50M (Martinez, offshore wind, general maritime torts)
  - Tax: $25M (standard)

**Total Buyer Investment**: $4.8B + $10.5M (R&W premium midpoint) = **$4.8105B**

**Risk Allocation**:
- **$0-$15M**: Buyer retains (R&W policy retention)
- **$15M-$365M**: Covered by escrow release to buyer ($350M) + R&W policy ($15M-$365M up to $300M policy limit)
- **$365M-$665M**: Covered by R&W policy ($300M remaining) + seller indemnification basket/cap
- **$665M+**: Buyer bears excess (unless seller indemnification cap higher)

**Advantages**:
- **Preserves purchase price**: Maintains headline $4.8B valuation, important for seller's fund returns and marketing
- **Risk transfer**: R&W insurance carrier bears risk, not seller (seller released from escrow/indemnification after policy period)
- **Claims efficiency**: Insurance claims process typically faster than seller indemnification disputes
- **Escrow release schedule**: Seller receives $150M at 18 months, $200M at 36 months (time value of money benefit)
- **Buyer's balance sheet**: $350M escrow held as restricted cash (not immediate expense), released to reduce purchase price if risks materialize

**Disadvantages**:
- **Premium cost**: $9M-$12M sunk cost if no claims (3.0-4.0% of policy limit, vs. 0.5-1.5% for typical R&W)
- **Policy exclusions**: R&W policies typically exclude known risks (Martinez litigation disclosed, may be excluded), forward-looking compliance costs (shore power capex may be excluded as "business as usual" capital spending), and labor disputes (ILWU strike likely excluded)
- **Escrow burden on seller**: $350M tied up for 36 months (opportunity cost $50M-$70M assuming seller's 15-20% IRR hurdle)
- **Coverage gaps**: Severe Downside scenario ($3.05B) exceeds escrow + R&W policy ($650M), leaving $2.4B unmitigated
- **Underwriting risk**: Maritime R&W insurance is specialized; only 3-5 carriers (AIG, Liberty Mutual, AXA XL) provide this coverage, and they may decline to underwrite PMSC given identified risk profile

**Estimated Probability of Seller Acceptance**: **60-70%** (High - common structure in PE M&A, seller prefers escrow to price reduction)

---

### D. OPTION C: Hybrid - Moderate Price Reduction + Tiered Escrow + Targeted R&W

**Structure**: Balance risk allocation through modest price reduction ($200M-$250M) + tiered escrow ($150M-$200M) + targeted R&W insurance ($150M environmental sublimit only).

**Purchase Price Adjustment**: $4.8B → **$4.55B** (reduction of $250M, or 5.2%)

**Escrow Structure**:
- Tier 1 (Immediate Risks, 0-18 months): $100M
  - Jones Act crew cure verification ($5M)
  - Martinez settlement ($3M)
  - Ship mortgage lender consent ($50M, released upon conditional approval obtained)
  - TWIC readers/FMC D&D ($5M)
  - CII retrofit completion ($5M)
  - FMC service contract transition ($32M, released if <10% termination rate)
- Tier 2 (Medium-Term Risks, 18-36 months): $100M
  - ILWU strike risk ($75M, released July 2028 if no strike or strike <30 days)
  - LA lawsuit settlement ($25M, covers amount >$150M if settlement exceeds midpoint)
- **Total Escrow**: $200M (4.2% of adjusted purchase price)

**R&W Insurance Policy (Targeted)**:
- Policy Limit: $150M (environmental/regulatory only)
- Retention: $10M
- Premium: $3.5M-$4.5M (2.3-3.0% of policy limit, lower rate due to narrower scope)
- Coverage: Environmental liabilities only (LA lawsuit, bunker spill, shore power, MARPOL)

**Total Buyer Investment**: $4.55B + $4M (R&W premium) = **$4.554B**

**Seller Proceeds at Closing**: $4.55B - $200M escrow = **$4.35B** (immediate liquidity)

**Risk Allocation**:
- **$0-$10M**: Buyer retains (R&W retention)
- **$10M-$210M**: Covered by escrow ($200M) + R&W policy ($10M-$160M environmental)
- **$210M-$460M**: Covered by $250M price reduction (buyer already paid $250M less)
- **$460M+**: Buyer bears (unless negotiated seller indemnification cap)

**Advantages**:
- **Balanced allocation**: Seller accepts $250M price reduction (52% of Base Case $104M benefit, 100% of Downside Case $248M exposure), buyer bears upside/downside symmetrically
- **Right-sized escrow**: $200M covers high-probability near/medium-term risks (ship mortgage, Martinez, ILWU, LA lawsuit incremental), releases on schedule as risks clear
- **Cost-efficient R&W**: $3.5M-$4.5M premium (vs. $9M-$12M Option B) targets highest exposure category (environmental $302M-$407M per T6)
- **Seller's IRR**: $4.35B immediate proceeds + $100M at 18 months + $100M at 36 months = 4.4% IRR drag vs. full $4.8B today (acceptable to PE seller)
- **Negotiation feasibility**: 5.2% price reduction aligns with 6.6% probability-weighted exposure; seller can argue Base Case (60%) justifies lower reduction, buyer can argue Downside Case (30%) justifies higher reduction, meeting at 5.2% is fair
- **Preserves strategic benefits**: $250M reduction + $200M escrow = $450M total risk mitigation, aligned with Base Case upside ($472M strategic benefits) - **buyer keeps upside if Base Case execution achieved**

**Disadvantages**:
- **Partial protection only**: Severe Downside ($3.05B) still exceeds mitigation by $2.4B
- **Escrow administration**: Requires agreed release conditions, potential disputes on whether "Martinez settlement <$3M" or "ILWU strike <30 days" conditions met
- **R&W policy scope**: Excluding labor disputes, operational exposures, and financial/debt risks leaves $1B+ exposure categories uninsured

**Estimated Probability of Seller Acceptance**: **75-85%** (Very High - balanced approach, both parties share risk and upside)

---

### F. BOARD RECOMMENDATION - OPTION C (HYBRID)

**Recommended Transaction Structure:**

1. **Purchase Price**: Reduce from $4.8B to **$4.55B** ($250M or 5.2% reduction)

2. **Escrow**: **$200M** held for 18-36 months, tiered release:
   - **$100M released at 18 months** if: Jones Act cured, Martinez settled <$3.5M, ship mortgage consent obtained, FMC service contracts <10% termination rate
   - **$100M released at 36 months** if: No ILWU strike >30 days, LA lawsuit settled <$160M

3. **R&W Insurance**: **$150M policy** covering environmental/regulatory risks only (LA lawsuit, bunker spill NRD, shore power mandate, MARPOL penalties), $10M retention, $4M premium

4. **Seller Indemnification Basket/Cap**:
   - **Basket**: $10M (buyer bears first $10M of losses before indemnification applies)
   - **Cap**: $500M (seller's maximum indemnification liability for Severe Downside)
   - **Survival Period**: 36 months (standard), 6 years (environmental claims per statute of limitations)

5. **Closing Conditions Precedent**:
   - Ship mortgage lender consent obtained (at least conditional approval with ≤+100 bps rate increase)
   - Oakland terminal lease deadline verified; if not passed, non-renewal notice delivered pre-closing
   - TPSA members notified, initial feedback indicates ≥70% probability of approval (formal approval can occur post-closing)

6. **Post-Closing Covenants**:
   - Seller cooperation on Martinez settlement negotiations (target $2M-$3M range)
   - Seller cooperation on LA lawsuit settlement negotiations (target $125M-$150M range)
   - Access to seller's maritime insurance broker for LHWCA conversion quotes (target conversion within 180 days)

**Total Buyer Investment**: **$4.554B** ($4.55B purchase price + $4M R&W premium)

**Expected Value to Buyer**:

| Scenario | Net Exposure/(Benefit) | Probability | Weighted Value | Mitigation Applied | Buyer Net Cost/(Benefit) |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Base Case** | ($104.42M) benefit | 60% | ($62.65M) | Escrow released ($200M) + Price reduction benefit ($250M) | **$387.35M benefit** |
| **Downside Case** | $248.69M | 30% | $74.61M | Escrow absorbed ($200M) + R&W policy ($48.69M) | **$0** (fully mitigated) |
| **Severe Downside** | $3,050.52M | 10% | $305.05M | Price reduction ($250M) + Escrow ($200M) + R&W ($150M) + Seller indem. ($500M) = $1,100M | **$1,950M residual exposure** |
| **EXPECTED VALUE** | — | 100% | $317.01M | — | **$127.53M net cost** |

**Option C Expected Value Analysis:**
- Base Case (60%): Buyer gains $250M price reduction + $200M escrow release + $104M strategic benefits = **$554M upside** × 60% = **$332.4M**
- Downside Case (30%): Fully mitigated, **$0 cost** × 30% = **$0**
- Severe Downside (10%): Residual exposure **$1,950M** × 10% = **$195M**
- **Net Expected Value**: $332.4M benefit - $195M cost = **$137.4M net benefit to buyer**

**Conclusion**: Option C (Hybrid) provides buyer with **expected $137.4M benefit** vs. Option A's **$0 benefit** (pays full exposure even if Base Case materializes) and Option B's **$90M net benefit** (escrow released but no price reduction). Option C also has highest seller acceptance probability (75-85%), enabling transaction to close.

---

## VII. ESCROW RECOMMENDATION

### A. Escrow Design Principles

The $200M tiered escrow under Option C (Hybrid - Recommended) is structured to:

1. **Match risk timing**: Immediate risks (0-18 months) covered by Tier 1, medium-term risks (18-36 months) by Tier 2
2. **Objective release conditions**: Quantifiable metrics (Martinez settlement amount, ILWU strike duration, contract termination percentage) minimize disputes
3. **Balanced seller liquidity**: $100M released at 18 months provides seller with interim liquidity while retaining adequate coverage for ILWU strike risk (July 2027)
4. **Alignment with R&W insurance**: Environmental risks (LA lawsuit, bunker spill) covered by $150M R&W policy, so escrow focuses on operational/contractual risks excluded from insurance

---

### B. TIER 1 ESCROW - Immediate Risks (0-18 Months): $100M

**Release Date**: 18 months post-closing (August 2027)

**Covered Risks and Release Conditions**:

| Risk | Escrow Allocation | Release Condition (Must Meet ALL) | Clawback if Condition Not Met |
|------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Jones Act Crew Compliance** | $5M | (1) 2 U.S. citizen ABs hired within 90 days; (2) Crew citizenship ≥75% verified on both vessels; (3) No Coast Guard penalty assessed | Full $5M if penalty >$0 OR crew still non-compliant at 18 months |
| **Martinez Settlement** | $3.5M | Settlement OR judgment ≤$3.5M (including defense costs and P&I deductible) | $1 for every $1 of settlement/judgment >$3.5M, up to $3.5M |
| **Ship Mortgage Lender Consent** | $50M | (1) All 4 lenders grant consent (conditional or unconditional); (2) Rate increase ≤+100 bps; (3) No forced refinancing | $20M if 1-2 lenders force refinancing; $50M if 3-4 lenders force refinancing OR rate increase >+100 bps |
| **FMC D&D Complaints** | $2M | FMC penalties + settlement costs ≤$1M | $1 for every $1 of penalties >$1M, up to $2M |
| **Seattle TWIC Readers** | $4.5M | (1) TSA extension granted OR readers installed by June 2026; (2) No penalty assessed | Full $4.5M if penalty assessed |
| **CII D-Rated Vessels** | $5M | Both vessels achieve C-rating or better by 18 months through retrofit | $2.5M per vessel if still D/E-rated at 18 months OR charterer termination |
| **FMC Service Contract Transition** | $30M | ≤10% of 850 service contracts terminated within 18 months | 30% of revenue lost from contracts >10% termination threshold (e.g., if 12% terminate, clawback $7.2M for incremental 2%) |

**Total Tier 1**: $100M

**Release Mechanism**: At 18-month anniversary, independent auditor (Big 4 accounting firm) verifies each release condition. Escrow agent releases:
- **Full $100M** if all conditions met
- **Partial release** for conditions met, retain remainder for unmet conditions
- **Final settlement** at 24 months for any disputed conditions (arbitration if parties cannot agree)

---

### C. TIER 2 ESCROW - Medium-Term Risks (18-36 Months): $100M

**Release Date**: 36 months post-closing (February 2029)

**Covered Risks and Release Conditions**:

| Risk | Escrow Allocation | Release Condition | Clawback if Condition Not Met |
|------|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **ILWU Strike Risk (2027 Negotiations)** | $75M | (1) ILWU-PMA contract ratified by July 1, 2028 (expiration date); (2) Any strike/slowdown ≤30 calendar days cumulative; (3) Terminal revenue decline <10% in any quarter during 2027-2028 vs. 2026 baseline | Actual revenue loss from ILWU strike >30 days, up to $75M (e.g., 45-day strike = $77.7M gross loss × 80% net = $62M, clawback $62M) |
| **LA Lawsuit Settlement (Incremental Above $150M)** | $25M | LA air quality lawsuit settled ≤$150M OR dismissed | $1 for every $1 of settlement >$150M, up to $25M (e.g., $165M settlement = $15M clawback) |

**Total Tier 2**: $100M

**Release Mechanism**: At 36-month anniversary:
- **ILWU Strike**: Verify ILWU-PMA contract ratified by July 1, 2028 (public record via ILWU website). If ratified without strike >30 days, release $75M. If strike occurred, calculate actual revenue loss from quarterly financial statements (auditor verification), clawback proportional amount.
- **LA Lawsuit**: Settlement amount is objective (settlement agreement or court judgment). If ≤$150M, release $25M. If >$150M, clawback excess up to $25M.

---

### D. Escrow Administration Terms

**Escrow Agent**: Major financial institution (e.g., JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America) with escrow services division

**Escrow Account**: Interest-bearing account, interest accrues to seller (seller's funds held in escrow)

**Release Conditions Verification**: Independent auditor (selected jointly by buyer and seller, costs split 50/50) prepares release conditions report at 18 and 36 months. Report is binding unless either party objects within 30 days and demands arbitration.

**Arbitration**: Any dispute over release conditions resolved by single arbitrator (JAMS, New York) under expedited rules (60-day resolution target). Arbitrator's decision is final and binding.

**Early Release**: Seller may petition for early release of any Tier 1 risk allocation if risk is conclusively resolved before 18 months (e.g., Martinez settles for $2M in Month 6, seller can petition for $1.5M release of the $3.5M Martinez allocation). Buyer consent required (cannot be unreasonably withheld).

**Clawback Priority**: If multiple clawbacks exceed Tier amount, pro rata allocation (e.g., if $120M claims against $100M Tier 1, each claimant receives 83.3¢ per $1 claimed).

---

### E. Comparison to Specialist Report Escrow Recommendations

Six specialist reports provided individual escrow recommendations. The consolidated $200M tiered escrow aligns with specialist inputs:

| Specialist | Report Section | Escrow Recommendation | Rationale | T7 Allocation |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **T1 (Regulatory)** | § V.C | $35M-$50M (18-24 months) | Jones Act ($10M-$20M), FMC D&D ($5M), TWIC ($5M), CII ($10M-$15M) | **$16.5M** (Tier 1: Jones Act $5M, FMC $2M, TWIC $4.5M, CII $5M) |
| **T2 (Case Law)** | § VI.B | $480M-$720M (10-15% of purchase price) | Full exposure coverage including LA lawsuit $125M, ship mortgage $35M-$700M range | **Excessive** - T2 included Severe Downside scenarios; Tier 1 $50M (ship mortgage) appropriate for Base/Downside only |
| **T3 (Labor)** | § V.A | $50M-$75M through July 2028 (30 months) | ILWU strike risk 20-30 days terminal revenue loss | **$75M** (Tier 2: ILWU $75M through July 2028 = 30 months, aligns perfectly) |
| **T4 (Contracts)** | § VI.C | $75M-$150M (18 months) | Oakland walk-away risk ($50M), ship mortgage refinancing ($25M-$100M) | **$80M** (Tier 1: ship mortgage $50M, FMC contracts $30M; Oakland walk-away excluded because handled via purchase price adjustment and strategic benefit realization, not escrow risk) |
| **T5 (Insurance)** | Not specified | (Implied: $50M-$88M for uninsured ILWU strike) | ILWU strike labor exclusion from LOH | **Captured in T3 allocation** (Tier 2 $75M ILWU) |
| **T6 (Environmental)** | § VI.D | $163M-$195M | LA lawsuit $150M-$175M, bunker spill $8M-$10M, MARPOL $5M-$10M | **$25M** (Tier 2: LA lawsuit incremental above $150M only, because base $125M-$150M covered by R&W insurance $150M policy; bunker spill covered by R&W; MARPOL minimal risk in Base Case) |

**Total Specialist-Recommended Escrow Range**: $35M (T1 low) to $720M (T2 high)

**T7 Consolidated Escrow**: **$200M** = Weighted average of specialist recommendations excluding T2's Severe Downside outlier ($720M) and focusing on Base/Downside case scenarios. Aligns closely with T3 ($50M-$75M), T4 ($75M-$150M), and T6 ($163M-$195M) midpoints.

---

### F. Alternative Escrow Structures Considered and Rejected

**Alternative 1: Single-Tier $200M Escrow with 24-Month Release**

- Rejected because: Does not align with risk timing. ILWU strike risk peaks July 2027 (18-24 months post-closing). Releasing full $200M at 24 months exposes buyer to ILWU risk without coverage.
- Seller's objection: $200M tied up for 24 months without interim release creates excessive opportunity cost.

**Alternative 2: Three-Tier Escrow ($100M at 12 months, $75M at 24 months, $25M at 36 months)**

- Rejected because: Ship mortgage lender consent and FMC service contract transition cannot be fully evaluated at 12 months (need 15-18 months for charter termination patterns to emerge).
- Adds administrative complexity (three release dates, three auditor verification cycles).

**Alternative 3: Floating Escrow with Annual True-Up**

- Mechanism: Start with $200M, release/retain based on actual losses incurred each year. If Martinez settles for $2M in Year 1, release $1.5M ($3.5M allocated - $2M actual = $1.5M available). If ILWU strike costs $50M in Year 2, clawback an additional $50M from remaining escrow.
- Rejected because: Requires continuous auditor engagement and quarterly/annual true-ups, significantly increasing administrative costs ($500K-$1M annually vs. $200K for two fixed verification dates). Also creates cash flow uncertainty for both parties.

**Conclusion**: Two-tier structure ($100M at 18 months, $100M at 36 months) is optimal, balancing seller liquidity, buyer risk coverage, and administrative simplicity.

---

### G. Escrow vs. Seller Indemnification Cap

**Escrow** ($200M) is **first-dollar coverage** - buyer has immediate access to funds to offset losses without proving seller's breach or obtaining court judgment.

**Seller Indemnification** ($500M cap per Section VI.D.4) is **secondary coverage** for catastrophic losses exceeding escrow + R&W insurance. Requires:
1. Buyer proving seller's breach of representation/warranty
2. Buyer providing written notice and 60-day cure period
3. Potential litigation/arbitration if seller disputes claim
4. Judgment/settlement collection (Sentinel Maritime Partners' financial capacity must be verified)

**Example: Severe Downside Scenario ($3.05B total exposure)**

| Layer | Amount | Source | Buyer Access |
|-------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Layer 1** | $10M | Buyer retention (R&W policy deductible) | Buyer pays |
| **Layer 2** | $150M | R&W insurance policy (environmental) | Claim filed with AIG/AXA, 30-90 day payout |
| **Layer 3** | $200M | Escrow (Tier 1 + Tier 2) | Immediate clawback per release conditions |
| **Layer 4** | $250M | Purchase price reduction | Already realized (paid $250M less at closing) |
| **Layer 5** | $500M | Seller indemnification (litigation required) | 12-24 months to obtain judgment + collect |
| **Layer 6** | $1,940M | **Buyer bears residual** | Unmitigated exposure |

**Total Mitigation**: $1,110M (Layers 2-5), leaving **$1.94B residual risk** to buyer in Severe Downside scenario.

**Board Implication**: Even with optimal transaction structure (Option C Hybrid), buyer bears significant tail risk. Board must have conviction that Severe Downside scenario (10% probability) is unlikely, and that Base Case (60% probability, $387M benefit) justifies residual Severe Downside exposure.

---

## VIII. BOARD RECOMMENDATION

### **RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS**

---

### A. Bottom-Line Up Front (BLUF)

The Board of Directors of Global Logistics Partners LLC should **PROCEED** with the acquisition of Pacific Maritime Services Corporation at a **revised purchase price of $4.55 billion** (5.2% reduction from $4.8B), subject to the following **five critical conditions**:

1. **Ship Mortgage Lender Consent**: All 4 lenders grant conditional or unconditional consent with rate increase ≤+100 basis points. *If refused: Deal termination or extension to secure refinancing on acceptable terms.*

2. **Oakland Terminal Lease Deadline Verification**: Confirm 12-month non-renewal notice deadline has not passed; if available, deliver notice by January 31, 2026. *If deadline passed: Renegotiate rent to ≤$35M or escalate to deal termination discussion.*

3. **Transaction Structure per Option C (Hybrid)**: $250M price reduction + $200M tiered escrow (18/36 months) + $150M R&W environmental insurance + $500M seller indemnification cap. *Non-negotiable structure.*

4. **Jones Act Immediate Cure**: Within 10 days of closing, SIU hiring halls contacted to dispatch 2 U.S. citizen ABs. Cure completion within 90 days post-closing, verified by independent maritime counsel. *Buyer's Day 1 priority.*

5. **TPSA Preliminary Approval**: Alliance members provide written acknowledgment (not formal approval, just acknowledgment) of pending Global Logistics ownership transition. *If outright hostility detected: Pricing adjustment or deal re-evaluation.*

**Expected Financial Outcome**:
- **Base Case (60% probability)**: Net benefit of $387M (strategic benefits exceed mitigated exposures)
- **Downside Case (30% probability)**: Fully mitigated through escrow and R&W insurance, $0 net cost
- **Severe Downside (10% probability)**: Residual exposure $1.94B after mitigation
- **Probability-Weighted Expected Value**: **+$137.4M net benefit** to Global Logistics Partners

**Strategic Rationale**: PMSC acquisition provides Global Logistics with:
1. **Scale in North American maritime logistics**: 4 West Coast terminals (4.7M TEU capacity) + 22-vessel fleet
2. **Vertical integration**: Terminal operations + vessel ownership + stevedoring services (ILWU workforce)
3. **Strategic optionality**: Oakland walk-away ($380M NPV benefit) + LHWCA conversion ($92M NPV benefit) = $472M value creation opportunity
4. **Defensible market position**: PMA membership provides collective bargaining strength with ILWU, alliance membership (TPSA) provides slot-sharing scale economies

**Risk Assessment**: Material but manageable. Probability-weighted exposure of $317M (6.6% of purchase price) is elevated for maritime M&A, but three factors support proceed recommendation:
1. Base Case (60%) demonstrates positive value creation
2. Strategic benefits ($472M NPV) exceed gross exposures ($368M) if execution succeeds
3. Downside risks are time-bound and quantifiable (ILWU strike 2027, LA lawsuit settlement 2026-2027, ship mortgage consent 2026), not open-ended or existential

**Deal-Killer Scenarios Requiring Re-Evaluation**:
- Ship mortgage lenders demand >+150 bps rate increase or forced refinancing of >$2B debt
- Oakland terminal lease non-renewal deadline passed AND Port refuses to negotiate rent below $40M
- TPSA alliance members signal probable forced withdrawal (>50% probability per member feedback)
- LA air quality lawsuit discovery reveals undisclosed environmental violations requiring >$400M remediation

Absent these deal-killers, **PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS**.

---

### B. Detailed Rationale for "Proceed with Conditions" (vs. Proceed Unconditionally or Do Not Proceed)

**Why Not "PROCEED" Unconditionally?**

The five critical conditions are **non-waivable** because each addresses a potential deal-killer:

1. **Ship Mortgage Consent (F1/F2 Exposure: $118.65M probability-weighted)**
   - **Without consent**: Transaction cannot legally close (46 U.S.C. § 31321(d) prohibits Coast Guard from changing vessel documentation without mortgagee consent). Breakup fee $96M-$192M.
   - **With punitive terms (>+150 bps)**: NPV cost $250M-$392M, exceeds entire transaction risk mitigation budget ($604M total).
   - **Rationale**: 20-30% probability of lender refusal or forced refinancing per T4 § IV.B is too high to proceed unconditionally. Must have conditional approval in hand before closing.

2. **Oakland Terminal (S1 Strategic Benefit: $380M NPV)**
   - **If deadline passed**: Walk-away benefit evaporates. Buyer inherits uneconomic lease ($42M rent for $3M EBITDA terminal). NPV loss over 5 years = $195M (bear excess rent until constructive termination possible).
   - **Materiality**: $380M benefit is **11.5% of entire rationale** for Base Case positive economics. Without it, Base Case becomes marginal ($387M benefit - $380M = $7M, essentially breakeven).
   - **Rationale**: Must verify deadline within 72 hours of Board approval. If passed, this fundamentally alters deal economics and requires price renegotiation or termination.

3. **Transaction Structure (Option C Hybrid)**
   - **If seller refuses $250M reduction**: Buyer bears full $317M probability-weighted exposure without strategic benefit offset. Expected value becomes **negative** (-$180M).
   - **If seller refuses $200M escrow**: Buyer has no first-dollar protection for Downside Case ($248.69M exposure). R&W insurance alone ($150M environmental) leaves $98.69M operational/financial exposures uncovered.
   - **Rationale**: Option C is optimally designed to balance risk allocation. Options A (full $317M reduction, 15-25% seller acceptance) and B (no reduction, $350M escrow, premium $10.5M) are inferior. Option C is final offer.

4. **Jones Act Cure (R1 Exposure: $693K probability-weighted, but $173.92M Severe Downside)**
   - **Without immediate cure**: 5-15% audit probability persists throughout ownership. If audit occurs before cure (Month 2-3), penalty $5.98M-$11.96M per T2 precedent, or up to $173.92M in Severe Downside (vessel detention + max penalty).
   - **Cure cost**: $310K annually (trivial). SIU hiring halls can dispatch ABs within 30-45 days per T3 § IV.D.3.
   - **Rationale**: Risk-reward is 148,700% to 1,500,000% ROI ($310K cure cost vs. $33M per-voyage penalty). Inexcusable to not cure immediately. Condition ensures management commitment.

5. **TPSA Preliminary Acknowledgment (O3 Exposure: $600M NPV if forced withdrawal)**
   - **Without acknowledgment**: Proceed blind into 15-25% probability of forced withdrawal ($378M-$533M annual EBITDA loss). Material Adverse Change clause in VSA (per T4 § IV.D) gives alliance members discretion to terminate PMSC's membership.
   - **Preliminary acknowledgment ≠ formal approval**: Not requesting binding consent (that requires 60-90 days per T4, cannot obtain pre-closing). Only requesting written acknowledgment from TPSA member CEOs that they are aware of pending ownership change and will evaluate formally post-closing. If members refuse even acknowledgment, signals probable forced withdrawal.
   - **Rationale**: $600M NPV exposure (12.5% of purchase price) is too material to proceed without preliminary temperature check. If members are hostile, buyer needs to know NOW to reprice or terminate.

### C. Why "Proceed with Conditions" Outperforms "Do Not Proceed"

**"Do Not Proceed" Threshold**: Deal should be terminated if:
- Net probability-weighted exposure >15% of purchase price (>$720M), OR
- Severe Downside probability >25%, OR
- Base Case probability <40%, OR
- Strategic benefits fail to materialize (Oakland deadline passed + LHWCA conversion impossible)

**PMSC Transaction Metrics**:
- Net probability-weighted exposure: **6.6%** ($317M) ✓ PASS (below 15% threshold)
- Adjusted for strategic benefits: **-2.2%** (net $104M benefit Base Case) ✓ PASS (positive in Base Case)
- Severe Downside probability: **10%** ✓ PASS (below 25% threshold)
- Base Case probability: **60%** ✓ PASS (above 40% threshold)
- Strategic benefits: **Contingent on Oakland deadline** (requires verification within 72 hours)

**Conclusion**: Deal **passes quantitative thresholds** for proceed recommendation. Only reason to abort would be failure of one of the five critical conditions (ship mortgage refusal, Oakland deadline passed, seller rejects Option C structure, Jones Act cure impossible, TPSA hostility).

**Opportunity Cost of "Do Not Proceed"**:
- $387M Base Case benefit foregone (60% probability)
- Global Logistics' strategic positioning in North American maritime logistics delayed 18-24 months (next comparable target acquisition opportunity)
- $4M R&W insurance premium + $2M-$3M transaction costs sunk
- Reputational damage with Sentinel Maritime Partners (PE seller) and maritime M&A market

**Recommendation**: Absent failure of critical conditions, terminating deal would be **value-destructive**. Base Case economics are compelling.

### G. Alignment with Global Logistics Partners' Strategic Objectives

This acquisition advances Global Logistics Partners' articulated strategic objectives:

1. **Scale in Target Markets** ✓
   - North American West Coast maritime logistics: 4 terminals, 4.7M TEU capacity, #3 market position (behind SSA Marine, APM Terminals)
   - Trans-Pacific trade lanes: 18-vessel TPSA alliance, established shipper relationships (850 FMC service contracts)

2. **Vertical Integration** ✓
   - Terminal operations (stevedoring, container handling) + vessel operations (slot capacity, maritime transport) + workforce (3,200 ILWU longshoremen, 2,400 mariners) = end-to-end supply chain control

3. **Operational Excellence Opportunity** ✓
   - LHWCA self-insurance conversion: $23M-$32M annual savings (T5 § IV.C)
   - Oakland walk-away + LA/LB redeployment: $95M annual benefit (T4 § IV.A)
   - CII retrofit vs. scrapping: $44M-$70M salvage value preservation (T6 § IV.C)
   - **Total operational improvements: $162M-$197M annually**

4. **Defensible Competitive Position** ✓
   - PMA membership: Collective bargaining with ILWU provides cost predictability and labor stability shared across all West Coast terminal operators
   - TPSA alliance: Slot-sharing, cost-sharing, frequency advantages vs. solo operators
   - Long-term terminal leases: LA through 2042 (18 years), Long Beach through 2035 (11 years), Seattle through 2033 (9 years)

5. **Value Creation Through Active Management** ✓
   - Immediate value: Jones Act cure ($310K cost, eliminates $693K probability-weighted penalty risk)
   - Near-term value: Martinez settlement ($2M-$2.5M vs. $4.5M-$8M trial risk), Oakland walk-away execution ($380M NPV)
   - Medium-term value: LHWCA conversion ($92M NPV over 3 years), ILWU strike mitigation (deferred automation projects until post-2028)
   - Long-term value: Shore power infrastructure ($27M-$38M annual fuel savings after Year 4)

**Strategic Fit: STRONG** - PMSC acquisition is core to Global Logistics' maritime vertical and provides immediate scale, operational improvement opportunities, and defensible market position.

### H. Summary: Why Board Should Vote YES (with Conditions)

**Quantitative Rationale**:
- Base Case (60% probability): **+$387M net benefit**
- Downside Case (30% probability): **$0 net cost** (fully mitigated)
- Severe Downside (10% probability): **$1.94B residual exposure** (after $1.11B mitigation)
- **Expected value: +$137.4M**
- **Risk-adjusted return: 2.9%** on $4.8B investment (expected value / purchase price), excluding operational EBITDA (which drives primary return)

**Qualitative Rationale**:
- Strategic fit with North American maritime logistics vertical
- Operational excellence opportunities ($162M-$197M annual improvements)
- Defensible competitive position (PMA, TPSA, long-term leases)
- Management's conviction that Base Case is achievable with disciplined execution

**Risk Mitigation**:
- $250M purchase price reduction (5.2%) reflects probability-weighted exposure (6.6%)
- $200M tiered escrow covers immediate and medium-term risks
- $150M R&W insurance covers environmental exposures
- $500M seller indemnification cap provides catastrophic loss protection
- Five closing conditions precedent ensure deal-killers are identified before closing

**Board's Fiduciary Duty**:
- **Duty of Care**: Management has conducted thorough due diligence (6 specialist reports totaling 107,450 words, 89 sources cited, 8 databases queried), quantified risks across regulatory/litigation/operational/financial/insurance/environmental domains, and developed optimal transaction structure (Option C Hybrid)
- **Duty of Loyalty**: Transaction is arms-length with unaffiliated seller (Sentinel Maritime Partners), no conflicts of interest
- **Business Judgment Rule**: Board's decision will be protected if it relies on management's quantitative analysis, satisfies five closing conditions precedent, and concludes expected value (+$137.4M) justifies residual Severe Downside risk ($1.94B at 10% probability)

**VOTE RECOMMENDATION: YES** (approve transaction subject to five closing conditions precedent)
