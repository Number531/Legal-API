# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Project Neptune - Pacific Maritime Services Corporation Acquisition
**Prepared for**: Global Logistics Partners LLC Board of Directors
**Date**: January 11, 2026
**Purchase Price**: $4.8B (subject to recommended 5.2% adjustment)

---

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS (Option C Hybrid)

**Risk Rating**: MEDIUM - Probability-weighted exposure of $317.01M (6.6% of purchase price) is consistent with market precedent for maritime infrastructure acquisitions of this scale, and Base Case scenario yields net $104M benefit to acquirer.

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Global Logistics Partners should **proceed with this acquisition subject to five non-waivable closing conditions**, based on dual-verified aggregate exposure of $317.01M probability-weighted (independently confirmed by T7 financial analyst and V1.4 risk aggregator with 0% delta). The transaction presents a favorable risk-adjusted profile in Base Case (60% probability): strategic benefits of $472M NPV (Oakland walk-away $380M + LHWCA conversion $92M) exceed legal exposures, yielding net $104M benefit. **Immediate action required**: Verify Oakland terminal lease deadline within 72 hours (January 13, 2026) and obtain preliminary ship mortgage lender consent within 30 days.

### Rationale

The $4.8B acquisition of PMSC presents MEDIUM severity risk (6.6% of purchase price) with an asymmetric profile: favorable Base Case economics are counterbalanced by catastrophic tail risk in Severe Downside (10% probability, $3.05B exposure). Three-scenario modeling reveals that strategic benefit execution - particularly the Oakland terminal walk-away ($380M NPV) - is the critical variable determining whether this transaction creates or destroys value. See **Section IV.M** for complete scenario analysis.

The LA/LB air quality lawsuit settlement ($105.5M weighted, 70% probability) and shore power infrastructure capex ($230M NPV, 80% probability) represent the dominant exposures, comprising 71-93% of environmental capex category. ILWU 2027 contract negotiations present operational risk ($76.3M weighted strike exposure, 40-50% probability) that is **uninsured** due to standard labor exclusions. Ship mortgage lender consent uncertainty ($83.5M weighted NPV) constitutes the primary deal-blocking risk requiring 30-day resolution. See **Sections IV.I, IV.K, and IV.E** for detailed analysis.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding (5 Non-Waivable)

1. **Ship Mortgage Lender Consent** - Obtain preliminary consent from all 4 lenders within 30 days at rate increase not exceeding +100 bps - See **Section IV.I**
2. **Oakland Lease Verification** - Verify lease expiration date and non-renewal deadline within 72 hours (by January 13, 2026) - See **Section IV.J**
3. **Option C Hybrid Structure Implementation** - Execute $250M purchase price reduction + $200M tiered escrow + $150M R&W insurance - See **Section IV.M**
4. **Jones Act Crew Cure** - Complete SIU hiring hall recruitment of 4 U.S. citizen ABs within 90 days post-closing - See **Section IV.B**
5. **TPSA Alliance Approval** - Obtain alliance member consent with continuity bond not exceeding $100M - See **Section IV.J**

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO KEY LEGAL QUESTIONS

| Q# | Issue | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|-------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Does PMSC's 73% crew composition violate 46 U.S.C. Section 8103 (75% threshold)? | **Yes** | Statutory requirement is bright-line 75% U.S. citizens; 73% creates immediate violation subject to $33M/voyage penalty | IV.B |
| 2 | Can foreign-built COSCO vessels serve U.S. offshore wind installations? | **No** | Jones Act 46 U.S.C. Section 55102 requires U.S.-built; no waiver available for commercial operations per MARAD precedent | IV.B |
| 3 | Does Clean Air Act preempt LA/LB air quality lawsuit claims? | **Partial** | Vessel emissions preempted per *Engine Manufacturers Ass'n*; terminal-side truck/equipment claims survive | IV.K |
| 4 | Are ship mortgage lender consents required for change of control? | **Yes** | 46 U.S.C. Section 31321(d) mandates mortgagee written consent; non-compliance voids transaction | IV.I |
| 5 | Is ILWU strike exposure insured under Loss of Hire coverage? | **No** | Nordic Plan Clause 16-7 excludes labor disputes; $76.3M exposure fully retained | IV.L |
| 6 | Can PMSC walk away from Oakland terminal lease without penalty? | **Probably Yes** | If non-renewal deadline not passed, $380M NPV benefit available; requires 72-hour verification | IV.J |
| 7 | Does Martinez Section 905(b) claim trigger P&I coverage? | **Probably Yes** | Standard P&I covers vessel negligence; $500K-$5M SIR uncertainty requires Certificate verification | IV.H, IV.L |
| 8 | Are FMC service contracts assignable post-acquisition? | **Yes** | Stock purchase structure preserves PMSC as contracting entity; 8% baseline churn expected | IV.A |

| Jones Act Crew | IV.B | HIGH | 5-15% | $475M/yr gross | $11M-$18M | Available - $310K cure |
| Offshore Wind Assets | IV.B | HIGH | 95% | $35M book | $6.65M | Limited - sale |
| FMC Service Contracts | IV.A | MEDIUM | 100% | $304M | $21.6M incremental | Limited |
| FMC D&D Complaints | IV.A | MEDIUM | 60-70% | $805K-$1.6M | $708K | Available - settlement |
| Martinez Tort | IV.H | MEDIUM | 80% | $2M-$5M | $2.8M | Partial - P&I coverage |
| Bunker Spill NRD | IV.K | MEDIUM | 80% | $5M-$8M | $5.2M | Partial - settlement |
| H&M Premium Increase | IV.L | LOW | 90% | $1M-$3.75M/yr | $2.1M | None |
| **TOTAL WEIGHTED** | | | | | **$317.01M** | |

### Aggregate Exposure Analysis

- **Gross Potential Exposure**: $1,789M-$2,503M (includes $222M-$264M certain wage escalation)
- **Probability-Weighted Exposure**: **$317.01M** (6.6% of purchase price)
- **Dual Verification**: T7 analyst and V1.4 aggregator independently calculated identical $317.01M (0% delta)
- **Strategic Benefits Offset**: $472M NPV ($380M Oakland + $92M LHWCA)
- **Base Case Net Benefit**: ($104M) - transaction creates value

### Three-Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Net Exposure | Weighted Contribution | Board Guidance |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Base Case** | 60% | ($104M) benefit | ($62.65M) | Strategic benefits fully offset exposures |
| **Downside Case** | 30% | $249M exposure | $74.61M | Covered by $350M buyer protection package |
| **Severe Downside** | 10% | $3,050M exposure | $305.05M | Catastrophic tail risk - drives weighted total |
| **WEIGHTED TOTAL** | 100% | | **$317.01M** | |

**Critical Insight**: The 10% Severe Downside scenario contributes $305M (96%) of the $317M weighted exposure. This tail risk reflects catastrophic confluence: TPSA withdrawal + 4-month ILWU strike + ship mortgage cross-default + LA terminal closure. See **Section IV.M Section B.3** for cascade effect analysis.

### Recommended Deal Structure (Option C Hybrid)

| Component | Amount | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Purchase Price Reduction** | $250M (5.2%) | From $4.8B to $4.55B |
| **Escrow Tier 1** | $100M (18 months) | Regulatory/Jones Act/near-term litigation |
| **Escrow Tier 2** | $100M (36 months) | Environmental/ILWU/ship mortgage |
| **R&W Insurance** | $150M ($4M premium) | Environmental/regulatory sublimit |
| **Seller Indemnification Cap** | $500M | General indemnity ceiling |
| **TOTAL BUYER PROTECTION** | **$604M** | 12.6% of purchase price |

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. LA Lawsuit/Shore Power Cascade (0.85 Correlation)

The LA/LB air quality lawsuit (**Section IV.K**, $105.5M weighted) and shore power infrastructure capex (**Section IV.G/K**, $230M weighted) share high correlation (0.85) - lawsuit settlement will dictate shore power timeline and scope.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Terminal Leases (Section IV.J)**: If LA lawsuit mandates $315M capex, LA terminal becomes unviable (2.2% ROI); lease termination provisions may be invoked
- **Maritime Finance (Section IV.I)**: Judgments >$50M trigger ship mortgage cross-default; settlement must be structured to avoid acceleration
- **Insurance (Section IV.L)**: R&W $150M environmental sublimit provides partial coverage; excess exposure retained

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $335.5M (weighted, correlated)

### B. ILWU Labor Risk Cascade

The ILWU 2027 contract negotiations (**Section IV.E**, $76.3M strike exposure) create cascading impacts across operations and finance.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Insurance (Section IV.L)**: Loss of Hire coverage excludes labor disputes per Nordic Plan Clause 16-7; creates $225M-$268M uninsured gap during extended stoppage
- **Commercial Contracts (Section IV.J)**: TPSA alliance members may invoke Material Adverse Change if strike disrupts service commitments
- **Maritime Finance (Section IV.I)**: Extended strike impacts DSCR covenant compliance; potential technical default on $2.8B ship mortgages

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $76.3M-$526M depending on duration (30-day to 4-month scenarios)

### C. Ship Mortgage Consent Dependency Chain

Ship mortgage lender consent (**Section IV.I**, $83.5M NPV weighted) creates sequential dependencies affecting closing conditions.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Jones Act (Section IV.B)**: Lenders may condition consent on Jones Act crew cure completion (40% correlation); cure must precede consent request
- **Terminal Leases (Section IV.J)**: Material amendments to Oakland lease (walk-away execution) may require mortgage deed approval
- **Transaction Mechanics**: Without 4-lender consent, closing cannot occur; breakup fee exposure $96M-$192M

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $83.5M NPV (conditional approval) to $350M NPV (forced refinancing) plus $192M breakup risk

### D. Oakland Strategic Benefit Verification

The Oakland terminal walk-away (**Section IV.J**, $380M NPV benefit) is the single largest value driver, but execution depends on unverified deadline.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Financial Aggregation (Section IV.M)**: If deadline passed (December 31, 2025), Base Case benefit drops from $387M to $7M; deal becomes uneconomic at $4.8B
- **Transaction Repricing**: If deadline missed, renegotiate purchase price downward by $300M-$400M OR terminate deal
- **Fact Registry Conflict**: December 31, 2030 vs. December 31, 2026 expiration date conflict requires immediate resolution

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $0 (if executed) to $380M opportunity cost (if missed)

---

## V. DEAL-BLOCKING ISSUES

**Two issues identified** - Both MANAGEABLE per Section IV.M analysis:

### Issue 1: Ship Mortgage Lender Consent (Section IV.I)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | 46 U.S.C. Section 31321(d) requires mortgagee consent for change of control |
| **Debt at Risk** | $2.8B preferred ship mortgages across 4 lenders |
| **Probability Distribution** | 70-85% conditional approval at +50-100 bps; 20-30% forced refinancing |
| **Exposure Range** | $14M-$28M annual (consent) OR $140M-$350M NPV (refinancing) |
| **Deal Failure Risk** | 5-10% if all 4 lenders refuse AND refinancing unavailable |
| **Breakup Fee Exposure** | $96M-$192M if >=50% lenders refuse |
| **Mitigation** | Obtain preliminary consent within 30 days; accept <=+100 bps; secure backup financing |
| **Historical Precedent** | PE maritime acquisitions 2015-2024: 75-80% lender consent rate |

**Recommendation**: PROCEED with closing condition requiring preliminary consent within 30 days of Board approval.

### Issue 2: Oakland Terminal Lease Deadline Verification (Section IV.J)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Trigger** | Conflicting expiration dates in source documents (2026 vs. 2030) |
| **Strategic Benefit at Risk** | $380M NPV (11.5% of deal rationale) |
| **Critical Date** | December 31, 2025 non-renewal deadline (possibly 10 days ago) |
| **Deal Impact if Passed** | Base Case benefit drops from $387M to $7M; expected value drops from +$137.4M to -$242.6M |
| **Reprice Requirement** | $300M-$400M purchase price reduction if deadline passed |
| **Mitigation** | 72-hour verification via data room Schedule 4.12; deliver notice by January 31, 2026 if available |

**Recommendation**: VERIFY IMMEDIATELY (by January 13, 2026) before Board approval. If deadline passed, REPRICE or TERMINATE.

## VI. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section Reference |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Purchase Price | $4.55B (5.2% reduction) | $4.55B | $4.65B | Section IV.M |
| Escrow Total | $250M (5.2%) | $200M (4.2%) | $150M (3.1%) | Section IV.M |
| Escrow Survival Tier 1 | 24 months | 18 months | 12 months | Section IV.M |
| Escrow Survival Tier 2 | 42 months | 36 months | 24 months | Section IV.M |
| R&W Insurance | $200M | $150M | $100M | Section IV.M |
| Seller Indemnity Cap | $600M | $500M | $400M | Section IV.M |
| Jones Act Cure Deadline | 60 days | 90 days | 120 days | Section IV.B |
| Oakland Walk-Away | Immediate notice | Notice by 1/31/26 | Extension negotiation | Section IV.J |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **ILWU 2027 Strike Risk ($76.3M Uninsured)**: Seller cannot transfer this exposure post-closing; supports escrow Tier 2 retention through July 2028 CBA ratification - See **Section IV.E**
2. **Oakland Deadline Uncertainty**: If verification reveals passed deadline, buyer has significant repricing leverage ($300M-$400M) - See **Section IV.J**
3. **Jones Act Existing Violation**: 73% crew composition is current violation, not future risk; supports aggressive cure covenant - See **Section IV.B**

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| Expected Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence Basis |
|--------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| "Base Case shows net benefit; price reduction unwarranted" | HIGH | Severe Downside (10%) drives $305M weighted exposure; prudent buyer protects against tail risk | Section IV.M scenario analysis |
| "8% FMC contract churn is baseline, not deal risk" | HIGH | Acquisition-driven incremental churn adds 1.5% ($48M); escrow should cover first-year attrition | Section IV.A analysis |
| "Oakland walk-away is 95%+ certain" | MEDIUM | Deadline conflict creates genuine 50% uncertainty; verification required before closing | Fact-registry.md Conflict #2 |
| "Ship mortgage consent is routine" | MEDIUM | 20-30% forced refinancing probability is material; closing condition essential | Section IV.I precedent analysis |

---

## VII. TIMELINE & CRITICAL PATH

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Risk Level | Section Reference |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Oakland Lease Verification | January 13, 2026 | Data room Schedule 4.12 access | **CRITICAL** | Section IV.J |
| Board Approval | January 15, 2026 | Oakland verification complete | HIGH | This Summary |
| Oakland Non-Renewal Notice | January 31, 2026 | Verification confirms availability | HIGH | Section IV.J |
| Ship Mortgage Lender Outreach | February 14, 2026 | Board approval | HIGH | Section IV.I |
| Preliminary Lender Consent | February 28, 2026 | Lender negotiations | **CRITICAL** | Section IV.I |
| Transaction Closing | February 28, 2026 | All closing conditions | HIGH | All Sections |
| Jones Act Cure Completion | May 29, 2026 | SIU hiring hall dispatch | HIGH | Section IV.B |
| Escrow Tier 1 Release | August 28, 2027 | LA lawsuit settled <$140M; Jones Act cure verified | MEDIUM | Section IV.M |
| ILWU 2028 CBA Ratification | July 1, 2028 | Labor negotiations | HIGH | Section IV.E |
| Escrow Tier 2 Release | February 28, 2029 | ILWU CBA ratified; TPSA stable; shore power initiated | MEDIUM | Section IV.M |

### Critical Path Risks

- **Oakland Verification Delay**: If data room access delayed beyond January 13, Board approval must be deferred; closing timeline at risk
- **Ship Mortgage Lender Refusal**: If >2 lenders refuse consent, forced refinancing adds 60-90 days to closing; $96M-$192M breakup fee exposure if deal terminated
- **ILWU 2027 Strike**: Extended work stoppage (>30 days) during first 24 months post-closing creates $76.3M+ uninsured exposure with no mitigation available

## IX. DECISION REQUIRED

```
DECISION REQUIRED: Board Authorization to Proceed by January 15, 2026

OPTIONS:

Option A: PROCEED UNCONDITIONALLY
- Risk: Severe Downside tail risk ($3.05B) unmitigated
- Benefit: Fastest closing timeline
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED

Option B: TERMINATE TRANSACTION
- Risk: Forfeits $137.4M expected value; strategic opportunity lost
- Benefit: Eliminates all transaction risk
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED

Option C: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS (HYBRID STRUCTURE)
- Risk: Closing delayed if lender consent not obtained or Oakland deadline passed
- Benefit: $604M buyer protection package covers Downside Case; preserves strategic benefits
- Status: RECOMMENDED

RECOMMENDED: Option C (Proceed with Conditions)

Rationale: Transaction creates $137.4M expected value with $604M buyer protection covering
Downside Case exposure. Severe Downside (10% probability) remains unmitigated but represents
acceptable tail risk for maritime infrastructure acquisition of this scale.
