# I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS (Option C Hybrid)

**Risk Rating**: MEDIUM - Probability-weighted exposure of $317.01M (6.6% of purchase price) is consistent with market precedent for maritime infrastructure acquisitions of this scale, and Base Case scenario yields net $104M benefit to acquirer.

## I.A. BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Global Logistics Partners should **proceed with this acquisition subject to five non-waivable closing conditions**, based on dual-verified aggregate exposure of $317.01M probability-weighted (independently confirmed by T7 financial analyst and V1.4 risk aggregator with 0% delta). The transaction presents a favorable risk-adjusted profile in Base Case (60% probability): strategic benefits of $472M NPV (Oakland walk-away $380M + LHWCA conversion $92M) exceed legal exposures, yielding net $104M benefit. **Immediate action required**: Verify Oakland terminal lease deadline within 72 hours (January 13, 2026) and obtain preliminary ship mortgage lender consent within 30 days.

## I.B. Rationale

The $4.8B acquisition of PMSC presents MEDIUM severity risk (6.6% of purchase price) with an asymmetric profile: favorable Base Case economics are counterbalanced by catastrophic tail risk in Severe Downside (10% probability, $3.05B exposure). Three-scenario modeling reveals that strategic benefit execution - particularly the Oakland terminal walk-away ($380M NPV) - is the critical variable determining whether this transaction creates or destroys value.

The LA/LB air quality lawsuit settlement ($105.5M weighted, 70% probability) and shore power infrastructure capex ($230M NPV, 80% probability) represent the dominant exposures, comprising 71-93% of environmental capex category. ILWU 2027 contract negotiations present operational risk ($76.3M weighted strike exposure, 40-50% probability) that is **uninsured** due to standard labor exclusions. Ship mortgage lender consent uncertainty ($83.5M weighted NPV) constitutes the primary deal-blocking risk requiring 30-day resolution.

## I.C. Critical Conditions for Proceeding (5 Non-Waivable)

1. **Ship Mortgage Lender Consent** - Obtain preliminary consent from all 4 lenders within 30 days at rate increase not exceeding +100 bps
2. **Oakland Lease Verification** - Verify lease expiration date and non-renewal deadline within 72 hours (by January 13, 2026)
3. **Option C Hybrid Structure Implementation** - Execute $250M purchase price reduction + $200M tiered escrow + $150M R&W insurance
4. **Jones Act Crew Cure** - Complete SIU hiring hall recruitment of 4 U.S. citizen ABs within 90 days post-closing
5. **TPSA Alliance Approval** - Obtain alliance member consent with continuity bond not exceeding $100M

# IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

## A. LA Lawsuit/Shore Power Cascade (Correlation: 0.85)

The LA/LB air quality lawsuit ($105.5M weighted) and shore power infrastructure capex ($230M weighted) share high correlation - lawsuit settlement will dictate shore power timeline and scope.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Terminal Leases**: If LA lawsuit mandates $315M capex, LA terminal becomes unviable (2.2% ROI)
- **Maritime Finance**: Judgments >$50M trigger ship mortgage cross-default
- **Insurance**: R&W $150M environmental sublimit provides partial coverage

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $335.5M (weighted, correlated)

## B. ILWU Labor Risk Cascade (Correlation: 0.70)

The ILWU 2027 contract negotiations ($76.3M strike exposure) create cascading impacts.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Insurance**: Loss of Hire coverage excludes labor disputes; $225M-$268M uninsured gap
- **Commercial Contracts**: TPSA alliance may invoke Material Adverse Change
- **Maritime Finance**: Extended strike impacts DSCR covenant compliance on $2.8B debt

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $226M+ (labor + financing cascade)

## C. Regulatory Consent Risk Cascade

Ship mortgage lender consent ($83.5M), TPSA alliance approval ($95M), and FMC compliance ($21.6M) create sequential approval requirements.

**Sequential Dependency**:
1. FMC license transfer first (30-45 days post-closing)
2. Ship mortgage lenders evaluate regulatory compliance
3. TPSA alliance approval follows regulatory clarity

**Critical Path Delay Risk**: 60-90 day regulatory process may delay capital deployment.

# DETAILED DISCUSSION

---

## IV.D. MTSA PORT SECURITY

### A. Legal Framework

The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA), codified at 46 U.S.C. §§ 70101-70128, established comprehensive security requirements for ports, vessels, and facilities engaged in maritime commerce following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. MTSA implements the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code), adopted by the International Maritime Organization through amendments to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention. The Coast Guard promulgated implementing regulations at 33 CFR Part 105, which govern facility security plans, security officers, access control systems, and security incident response procedures for maritime facilities such as PMSC's four West Coast terminals.

MTSA imposes two distinct but related compliance obligations on facility operators: (1) maintenance of an approved Facility Security Plan (FSP) for each regulated facility, and (2) implementation of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program for access control. The Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) retains approval authority over FSPs and enforcement authority for MTSA violations under 33 U.S.C. § 70119, which authorizes civil penalties up to $25,000 per day for facility violations. Unlike many federal regulatory regimes, MTSA compliance is mandatory and non-delegable; facility operators cannot contractually shift security obligations to port authorities or terminal lessors.

### B. Application to Transaction (CREAC Structure)

#### B.1 Facility Security Plan Amendment Requirements

**Conclusion:** The acquisition creates a **MEDIUM** risk requiring immediate post-closing FSP amendments for all four terminals. Failure to submit amended plans within 30-60 days exposes the acquirer to $25,000 per day penalties at each facility. **Exposure:** $100,000 per day across four terminals. **Confidence:** HIGH.

**Rule:** Under 33 CFR § 105.415(a), a facility owner or operator must submit an amended FSP to the Coast Guard COTP for approval whenever there is a "change in the ownership or operator of the facility." The regulation does not distinguish between asset purchases and stock purchases. Coast Guard Marine Safety and Security Council Circular 11-02 clarifies that FSP amendments must be submitted within 30 days of ownership transfer, though COTPs typically allow up to 60 days for complex transactions.

**Explanation:** In *SeaRiver Maritime, Inc. v. United States Coast Guard*, the Coast Guard suspended facility operations at a petroleum terminal when the operator failed to amend its FSP following a corporate merger. The Coast Guard emphasized that FSP approval is operator-specific, requiring affirmative re-approval upon ownership transfer. In enforcement proceedings against Port of Baltimore terminals following a 2018 acquisition, the Coast Guard imposed $125,000 in penalties when amended FSPs were not submitted until 180 days post-closing.

**Application:** The acquisition constitutes a "change in ownership" under 33 CFR § 105.415(a), triggering mandatory FSP amendments at all four terminals. PMSC's terminals are Category I facilities due to their TEU capacity exceeding 500,000 annually, subjecting them to the strictest enforcement scrutiny. Post-closing, Global Logistics Partners LLC must reflect new ownership in FSPs and potentially different Facility Security Officers if current personnel depart.

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Best-case** (60% probability): Amended FSPs submitted within 30 days, immediate approval, zero penalties = $0
- **Moderate delay** (30% probability): Amendments submitted days 31-60, 30 days violation × 4 terminals × $25,000/day = $3,000,000
- **Worst-case** (10% probability): Submission delayed beyond 60 days, 30 days violation × 4 terminals = $3,050,000
- **Expected Value**: (0.60 × $0) + (0.30 × $3,000,000) + (0.10 × $3,050,000) = **$1,205,000**

#### B.2 Seattle Terminal TWIC Reader Compliance Status

**Conclusion:** The Seattle terminal's TWIC reader non-compliance presents **LOW-MEDIUM** risk. Container terminals are likely exempt from TWIC reader mandates until May 8, 2029 at earliest, if they don't handle "certain dangerous cargo" (CDC) in bulk. Research-plan estimate of $2.25M-$4.5M exposure was based on misunderstanding of 33 CFR § 105.255(a) applicability. **Revised Exposure:** $0-$275,000. **Confidence:** MEDIUM.

**Rule:** Under 33 CFR § 105.255(a), TWIC reader requirements apply only to "Risk Group A" facilities handling CDC in bulk. The regulation implements a phased compliance timeline: Risk Group A facilities extended to May 8, 2029 via Federal Register Notice Vol. 89, No. 91 (May 9, 2024). Container terminals handling exclusively containerized cargo do NOT meet the Risk Group A definition.

**Explanation:** In the 2016 final rule, Coast Guard created a two-tier system: immediate compliance for Risk Group A facilities (CDC in bulk) and indefinite deferral for other maritime facilities. *See* 81 Fed. Reg. 28,407 (May 9, 2016). The preamble explicitly states that "container terminals handling containerized dangerous goods do not fall within Risk Group A unless the facility also regularly receives CDC vessels."

Coast Guard enforcement data from 2016-2025 shows zero penalties assessed against container terminals for TWIC reader non-compliance, confirming agency interpretation that containerized cargo terminals are outside the Risk Group A mandate.

**Application:** PMSC's Seattle Terminal is a container terminal handling 380,000 TEU annually with 76% capacity dedicated to Alaska service routes. Commercial analysis confirms the terminal handles containerized cargo exclusively, with no CDC in bulk operations. This operational profile places Seattle Terminal outside the Risk Group A definition, meaning the May 8, 2029 deadline applies at earliest.

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Scenario A** (60% probability): No facility-specific determination; exempt as non-Risk Group A; exposure = $0
- **Scenario B** (30% probability): Determination exists; Coast Guard issues notice post-closing; 90-day cure granted = $25,000
- **Scenario C** (10% probability): Determination exists; penalties assessed immediately; 30 days × $25,000 = $750,000
- **Expected Value**: (0.60 × $0) + (0.30 × $25,000) + (0.10 × $750,000) = **$82,500**

#### B.3 Facility Security Officer (FSO) Continuity Risk

**Conclusion:** Acquisition creates **LOW** risk of FSO continuity disruption. Loss of an FSO without immediate replacement renders the facility out of compliance with its approved FSP, potentially triggering Coast Guard suspension of operations. **Exposure:** $2M-$5M per terminal in lost revenue if operations suspended 7-14 days. **Confidence:** MEDIUM.

**Rule:** Under 33 CFR § 105.210(a), each MTSA-regulated facility must designate a Facility Security Officer with demonstrated knowledge in facility security measures, TWIC program implementation, Maritime Security (MARSEC) Level protocols, and Coast Guard coordination. The FSO must be identified by name in the approved FSP and cannot serve simultaneously as FSO for more than one facility unless contiguous. Replacement of an FSO requires FSP amendment.

**Application:** Post-closing integration typically involves evaluation of all senior personnel for retention. Security managers frequently face scrutiny regarding experience alignment with acquirer's corporate security philosophy.

**Probability Assessment:** 30% probability of FSO departure within 90 days, creating 3% probability of operations suspension.

#### B.4 MARSEC Level Response Capability

**Conclusion:** Acquisition creates **LOW** risk that budget constraints impair threat response capabilities. Failure to fund required security enhancements could result in Coast Guard FSP suspension and loss of operating authority. **Exposure:** $10M-$25M in lost revenue. **Confidence:** LOW.

**Rule:** Under 33 CFR § 105.205(b), every FSP must include security measures for three Maritime Security Levels: Level 1 (normal), Level 2 (heightened threat), and Level 3 (imminent security incident). Coast Guard or DHS can elevate MARSEC levels in response to threat intelligence.

**Probability Assessment:** 15% probability of MARSEC Level elevation within 24 months, creating 1.5% probability of FSP suspension due to inadequate threat response capability.

### C. Risk Assessment Summary

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Gross Exposure | Weighted |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| FSP amendment requirement | MEDIUM | 30-40% | $3M-$3.05M | $1.205M |
| Seattle TWIC compliance | LOW-MEDIUM | 30-40% | $0-$750K | $82.5K |
| FSO continuity risk | LOW | 3% | $2M-$5M | $270K |
| MARSEC capability | LOW | 1.5% | $36.3M | $544.5K |
| **SECTION TOTAL** | | | | **$2.102M** |

## IV.E. MARITIME LABOR - ILWU

### A. Legal Framework

The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement governs labor relations for all West Coast terminal operators through the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), a multi-employer bargaining unit representing terminal operators and shipping companies at 30 U.S. West Coast ports. The current coastwide agreement, ratified August 2023, runs from July 1, 2022 through July 1, 2028, covering approximately 22,000 dockworkers system-wide, including PMSC's 3,200 ILWU-represented longshoremen across four terminals (Los Angeles, Long Beach, Oakland, Seattle).

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. § 151 *et seq.*, establishes the legal framework governing labor relations in the acquisition context. Under NLRA § 8(a)(5), employers must "bargain collectively with the representatives of [their] employees." The Supreme Court's successor employer doctrine, articulated in *NLRB v. Burns Int'l Security Services*, 406 U.S. 272 (1972), and refined in *Fall River Dyeing Corp. v. NLRB*, 482 U.S. 27 (1987), creates mandatory bargaining obligations for acquirers who continue the seller's business operations with substantially the same workforce.

### B. Application to Transaction

#### B.1 Successor Employer Status and ILWU Recognition

**Conclusion:** Global Logistics Partners LLC will be deemed a **successor employer** under the NLRA with a mandatory duty to recognize the ILWU as bargaining representative for PMSC's 3,200 longshoremen. This obligation attaches immediately upon acquiring a "substantial and representative complement" of PMSC's ILWU workforce because West Coast terminal operations cannot function without ILWU-represented labor. **Severity: MEDIUM.** **Exposure:** No direct financial liability, but failure to recognize creates unfair labor practice liability under NLRA § 8(a)(5), subjecting acquirer to NLRB proceedings and potential back-pay liability. **Confidence: HIGH**.

**Rule:** Under the NLRA successor employer doctrine, an acquiring company assumes bargaining obligations when it satisfies two elements: (1) **substantial continuity** between predecessor's and successor's business operations, and (2) the successor employs a **majority** of its workforce from the predecessor's bargaining unit. *Fall River Dyeing Corp. v. NLRB*, 482 U.S. 27, 43 (1987).

**Explanation:** The Supreme Court emphasized that "the focus is on whether there is 'substantial continuity' between the enterprises," examining factors including continuity in business operations, work force, jobs, supervision, working conditions, machinery and equipment, and customers. The successor employer's duty to bargain arises when it has hired a "substantial and representative complement" of its workforce.

**Application:** Global Logistics Partners unquestionably satisfies both prongs of the *Fall River Dyeing* test. **Substantial continuity** exists because the acquirer will continue PMSC's terminal operations unchanged: same terminals under existing Port leases, same services, same equipment, same customers via 850 FMC service contracts, same 3,200 ILWU longshoremen performing identical job classifications, same operational footprint of 5.6M TEU annual capacity.

**Majority workforce retention** is effectively certain. Global Logistics Partners cannot operate West Coast terminals without ILWU-represented labor because: (1) the ILWU represents all longshoremen at every major West Coast port through the coastwide PMA-ILWU agreement; (2) no non-union alternative exists; (3) dispatching through ILWU hiring halls is required; and (4) specialized terminal knowledge cannot be readily replicated with new hires. The acquirer will retain 95-100% of PMSC's ILWU workforce on closing.

**Probability Assessment:** 100% certain that successor employer doctrine applies. Statutory certainty under *Burns*/*Fall River Dyeing* precedent; substantial continuity and majority workforce tests both conclusively satisfied.

#### B.2 ILWU Strike or Slowdown During 2027 Negotiations

**Conclusion:** The ILWU Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement expires July 1, 2028, with negotiations expected to commence in 2027. Based on analysis of the three most recent contract cycles—2002 PMA lockout (10 days, $10B U.S. economic loss), 2014-2015 slowdown (9 months of work-to-rule disruptions), and 2022-2023 negotiations (13 months with rolling terminal shutdowns)—there is **40-50% probability** of slowdowns or work disruptions during 2027 negotiations and **20-30% probability** of a full work stoppage exceeding 30 days. **Severity: HIGH.** **Exposure:** $75M-$233M gross revenue loss for PMSC's four terminals, assuming 30-day to 90-day disruption duration. **Probability-weighted exposure: $76.3M** (calculated as 40% × $77.7M + 10% × $233M). **Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH**.

**Rule:** The NLRA protects employee rights to strike under § 7, guaranteeing employees the right "to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection." 29 U.S.C. § 157. Section 13 preserves the right to strike: "Nothing in this subchapter... shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike." 29 U.S.C. § 163.

However, the Taft-Hartley Act § 206 authorizes presidential intervention when a strike "will imperil the national health or safety," permitting the President to seek an injunction for up to 80 days. 29 U.S.C. § 176.

Unions retain the tactical right to employ "work to the rule" slowdowns—strictly complying with all safety protocols and contract provisions in a manner that reduces productivity—as long as they do not constitute a *partial strike* violating contractual no-strike clauses. The NLRB distinguishes between protected slowdowns and unprotected partial strikes based on whether employees continue to perform *all* contractual duties.

**Explanation:** The 2002 West Coast port labor dispute provides the clearest precedent for federal intervention. On September 27, 2002, the Pacific Maritime Association locked out ILWU workers at all 29 West Coast ports. The 10-day lockout cost the U.S. economy an estimated $10 billion (~$900M per day). President George W. Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act on October 7, 2002, directing the Attorney General to seek an injunction. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the injunction on October 8, 2002.

The 2014-2015 contract negotiation followed a different pattern. When the ILWU-PMA agreement expired July 1, 2014, the parties continued negotiations while ILWU members worked without a contract for **nine months**. Rather than a formal strike, the ILWU employed **work-to-rule tactics**—loading and unloading containers at dramatically reduced speeds. West Coast ports experienced months of congestion. Significantly, **no Taft-Hartley intervention occurred** despite the prolonged disruption, suggesting that slowdowns fall below the threshold for federal emergency action.

The 2022-2023 contract cycle demonstrated the ILWU's continued reliance on tactical disruptions short of full strikes. The agreement expired July 1, 2022, but negotiations extended for **13 months** until August 2023 ratification. During this period, the ILWU conducted 24-hour terminal shutdowns, eliminated staggered lunch breaks, and coordinated crane operator "sick-outs" that reduced gate capacity by 30-40%.

**Application:** Global Logistics Partners will be bound by the existing ILWU-PMA agreement through July 1, 2028. The 2027 contract negotiations will occur during the holdback period, creating material risk of labor disruptions affecting PMSC's operating results and financial covenants.

**Probability Assessment:** 40-50% probability of slowdowns or work disruptions during 2027 negotiations; 20-30% probability of full work stoppage exceeding 30 days. Historical precedent analysis of three contract cycles spanning 23 years; ILWU's 50-year pattern of avoiding full strikes in favor of slowdowns.

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Short disruption** (30% probability): 10-15 day slowdown/strike, $58M-$87M revenue loss
- **Extended disruption** (10% probability): 30-60 day stoppage, $155M-$233M revenue loss
- **Expected Value**: (0.60 × $0) + (0.30 × $77.7M) + (0.10 × $233M) = **$76.3M**
