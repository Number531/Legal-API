### A. Legal Framework

The federal income tax treatment of corporate acquisitions depends fundamentally on transaction structure. A stock purchase acquisition results in no basis step-up for the acquired corporation's assets, while an asset purchase (or deemed asset purchase via IRC § 338(h)(10) election) provides fair market value basis to the acquirer.¹ This structural choice has significant economic implications where, as here, the purchase price substantially exceeds the target's historic tax basis in its assets.

**Stock Purchase Default Rule:** Under IRC § 1012 and Treasury Regulation § 1.1012-1, a buyer's basis in acquired stock equals the purchase price paid. The acquired corporation's inside basis in its assets remains unchanged—there is no step-up to fair market value.² The buyer steps into the target's shoes for purposes of depreciation, amortization, and future gain or loss calculations. Any transaction goodwill or going concern value created by the acquisition cannot be amortized by the buyer.

**Asset Purchase Alternative:** In a direct asset purchase, IRC § 1060 requires allocation of the purchase price among the acquired assets using the residual method, with goodwill and going concern value receiving basis equal to the residual amount after allocating to all other assets.³ The buyer obtains full fair market value basis, enabling accelerated cost recovery through depreciation (real property over 39 years, equipment over 5-7 years under MACRS) and amortization (§ 197 intangibles over 15 years including goodwill, customer relationships, and municipal franchises).⁴

**IRC § 338(h)(10) Election Mechanism:** Section 338(h)(10) permits parties to a qualified stock purchase to jointly elect to treat the transaction as a deemed asset sale for federal income tax purposes while maintaining stock sale treatment for legal and regulatory purposes.⁵ This hybrid structure requires: (1) a qualified stock purchase of at least 80% of the target's stock by vote and value,⁶ (2) the target must be either a member of a consolidated group or an S corporation,⁷ and (3) mandatory joint election by buyer and all sellers on IRS Form 8023.⁸ The election triggers deemed asset sale at an aggregate deemed sales price (ADSP) equal to the sum of the purchase price plus assumed liabilities, with the target recognizing gain or loss as if it sold all assets to an unrelated party.⁹

**Environmental Liability Deductibility:** The deductibility of environmental remediation costs turns on whether the expenditure must be capitalized under IRC § 263(a) or may be currently deducted under IRC § 162(a) as an ordinary and necessary business expense.¹⁰ Courts apply a three-part test: (1) the taxpayer contaminated the property through its operations (not by acquiring contaminated property), (2) the cleanup returns the property to its pre-contamination baseline (not enhancing value), and (3) the cleanup does not permit a new or different use of the property.¹¹ If these criteria are satisfied, cleanup costs are deductible, but IRC § 461(h)'s economic performance requirement generally delays deductions until costs are actually paid or services performed.¹²

**IRC § 468 Landfill Closure Reserve Election:** Section 468 allows taxpayers operating qualified solid waste disposal facilities to currently deduct estimated future closure and post-closure costs by making an annual election and contributing to a qualified reserve fund.¹³ The annual deduction equals the total estimated closure cost divided by the estimated useful life, multiplied by the current year's percentage of total site capacity consumed.¹⁴ This exception to the economic performance requirement enables landfill operators to match tax deductions with the economic accrual of closure obligations.

**Section 382 NOL Limitation:** Following an "ownership change"—defined as a more than 50 percentage point increase in ownership by 5-percent shareholders over a three-year testing period—IRC § 382 limits annual NOL utilization to the product of the loss corporation's fair market value immediately before the change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the IRS.¹⁵ For Q2 2026, the applicable rate is 3.58%-3.71%, yielding an annual limitation of approximately $131.4 million for a $3.6 billion valuation.¹⁶

**State Tax Conformity and Apportionment:** State income tax treatment of corporate acquisitions varies by jurisdiction. Most states with corporate income taxes conform to federal consolidated return regulations and recognize § 338(h)(10) elections for state purposes.¹⁷ However, states that impose gross receipts taxes (notably New Mexico) may tax deemed asset sales under § 338(h)(10) elections, creating material additional state tax costs not present in federal taxation.¹⁸ Multi-state corporations must apportion income using formulas prescribed by state law, with most states now employing single-sales-factor apportionment that assigns income based solely on destination of sales.¹⁹

**Investment Tax Credits for Renewable Energy:** IRC § 48 provides an investment tax credit for qualifying energy property, including certain biomass facilities such as landfill gas-to-energy systems.²⁰ The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 increased the base credit to 30% for facilities satisfying prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements on projects larger than 1 MW, with the credit available for facilities beginning construction through 2024 and placed in service by 2033 (after which the credit phases down to 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, and 10% in 2035+).²¹ The credit is claimed in the year property is placed in service and may be carried back one year or forward 20 years.²²

**Transfer Taxes:** Real estate transfer taxes are imposed by states or local jurisdictions on conveyances of real property interests. Arizona counties impose transfer taxes ranging from 0.1% to 0.4% of property value,²³ Nevada imposes transfer taxes at approximately 1% of property value for transactions exceeding $100,000,²⁴ while New Mexico and Texas impose no state-level real estate transfer taxes.²⁵ Stock transfers generally do not trigger transfer taxes because no real property deed or title transfers—the corporation continues owning the property with only the identity of the corporate shareholder changing.

### B. Application to Transaction (CREAC Structure Required)

#### B.1 Stock Purchase Structure Eliminates Basis Step-Up

**Conclusion:** The proposed stock purchase acquisition of UESC presents **MEDIUM** cost risk. American Sustainability Partners will forego $200-$250 million NPV in tax benefits compared to an asset purchase structure, accepting this cost as necessary to achieve automatic environmental liability assumption and avoid 6-18 month permit transfer delays. **Exposure:** $200-$250 million NPV. **Confidence:** HIGH [BASIS: IRC § 1012 statutory framework; standard M&A tax modeling].

**Rule:** In a stock purchase, the buyer acquires the target corporation's stock and the target's tax basis in its assets remains unchanged at historic levels. There is no step-up in basis to fair market value. IRC § 1012 provides that the buyer's basis in acquired stock equals the amount paid, but this stock basis does not affect the target corporation's inside basis in its assets.²⁶ The buyer inherits the target's existing depreciation schedules, amortizable intangible assets, and tax attributes without adjustment. Transaction goodwill (the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets) cannot be amortized because it exists at the shareholder level, not the corporate level.²⁷

**Explanation:** The inside basis limitation for stock purchases reflects the principle that corporate-level assets do not change hands in a stock acquisition—only the identity of the shareholders changes. In *Kimbell-Diamond Milling Co. v. Commissioner*, 14 T.C. 74 (1950), the Tax Court held that a corporation's basis in its assets is unaffected by changes in stock ownership, and the new shareholders step into the shoes of the target corporation for tax purposes. This contrasts sharply with asset purchases, where IRC § 1060's residual method allocates purchase price to all acquired assets including previously unrecognized goodwill, generating substantial additional basis for cost recovery.²⁸ The policy rationale is that the corporate entity continues unchanged in a stock purchase, whereas an asset purchase represents a complete transfer requiring fresh-start accounting principles for tax purposes.

The economic impact of no basis step-up is most severe where the purchase price substantially exceeds the target's inside asset basis. In transactions involving mature businesses with fully depreciated equipment, appreciated real property, and developed intangible assets (customer relationships, municipal franchises), the inside basis may represent only 40-60% of fair market value. The buyer effectively pays full fair market value to acquire the target's equity but receives only historic (lower) basis for future tax deductions. This mismatch would be eliminated in an asset purchase, where the buyer's $3.6 billion purchase price would be allocated to acquired assets, with the residual assigned to goodwill and amortized over 15 years under § 197.²⁹

**Application:** Here, UESC's estimated inside asset basis is approximately $2.2 billion, consisting of: (1) landfill real property with historic basis of $800 million (fair market value $1.2 billion), (2) equipment and trucks with historic basis of $400 million after accumulated depreciation (fair market value $850 million), (3) amortizable intangibles including municipal franchises with basis of $600 million (fair market value $900 million), and (4) existing goodwill from prior acquisitions with basis of $400 million (fair market value $2.34-2.41 billion).³⁰ The aggregate historic basis of $2.2 billion compares to the $3.6 billion purchase price, creating a $1.4 billion basis differential.

In a stock purchase at $3.6 billion, American Sustainability Partners will continue depreciating and amortizing based solely on the $2.2 billion historic basis. The company will generate annual tax deductions averaging approximately $165 million over 15 years (weighted average recovery period), producing federal tax savings of $34.7 million annually at the 21% rate.³¹ If instead structured as an asset purchase, the $3.6 billion purchase price would be allocated to assets with the residual $2.34-2.41 billion assigned to goodwill, all amortizable over 15 years under § 197. This would generate annual tax deductions averaging $417-421 million over 15 years, producing federal tax savings of $87.6-88.4 million annually—an incremental $52.9-53.7 million per year.

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** Perpetual (foregone tax benefits continue indefinitely based on asset depreciation/amortization schedules)
- **Methodology:** NPV calculation using 15-year amortization period, 21% federal rate, 8% discount rate
- **Calculation:** $1.4B basis differential × 21% federal rate × 0.70 PV factor (15-year, 8% discount) = $206M NPV federal; plus $25-44M state tax NPV (4.2% blended rate) = $231-250M total NPV cost
- **Result:** $231-250 million NPV cost (midpoint $240.5M)
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 8% WACC per financial analysis standards for PE acquirer

**Probability Assessment:** 100% certain [METHODOLOGY: Statutory consequence of stock purchase structure under IRC § 1012].

The Sierra Vista TSDF facility provides a concrete illustration of the basis limitation impact. The facility has an estimated fair market value of $120-150 million (based on $85 million annual revenue and 35% EBITDA margin producing $29.75 million EBITDA, applying a 4-5× EV/EBITDA multiple).³² UESC's historic tax basis in Sierra Vista real property and improvements is likely $30-40 million after accumulated depreciation over the facility's 15+ year operating history. In a stock purchase, American Sustainability Partners continues depreciating Sierra Vista using the $30-40 million basis over the remaining 39-year real property recovery period, generating $770,000-1 million in annual depreciation deductions. In an asset purchase, the buyer would obtain $120-150 million basis in Sierra Vista, generating $3.1-3.8 million in annual depreciation deductions—an incremental $2.3-2.8 million annually, worth $483-588K in federal tax savings and $55-67K in Arizona state tax savings.³³

**Counter-Analysis:** UESC or its selling shareholders may argue that the lack of basis step-up should be reflected in a reduced purchase price, asserting that buyers routinely negotiate purchase price discounts of 5-10% of the foregone tax benefits to compensate for the basis step-up limitation. This position has merit in situations where asset purchases are economically viable alternatives. However, in the waste management industry, the argument is weakened by three factors unique to this transaction. First, environmental liability successor doctrines under CERCLA § 107(a) and RCRA create automatic liability transfer regardless of transaction structure, making asset purchases less attractive for isolating liabilities.³⁴ Second, the target holds seven facilities (Sierra Vista RCRA TSDF plus six MSW landfills) requiring federal and state permit transfers that would delay closing by 6-18 months in an asset purchase, creating material execution risk and potentially causing the transaction to miss the Q2 2026 closing window.³⁵ Third, the $320-389 million environmental liability exposure significantly impairs the economic viability of § 338(h)(10) elections that would provide basis step-up (analyzed in Section B.2 below), reducing the availability of hybrid structures that combine stock sale legal treatment with asset sale tax treatment.

The probability that American Sustainability Partners can negotiate a meaningful purchase price reduction based on foregone basis step-up is 25-35% [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on (1) environmental liability assumption makes stock purchase structurally necessary, (2) permit transfer delays in asset purchases create material buyer execution risk, (3) seller's negotiating position strengthened by lack of economically viable alternatives providing basis step-up]. A more realistic negotiation strategy focuses on environmental liability valuation (Section B.4 below), where the $320-389 million gross exposure should reduce purchase price by $291-360 million after tax benefits, rather than seeking additional reductions for foregone basis step-up that is inherent to the chosen structure.

#### B.2 IRC § 338(h)(10) Election Not Economically Viable

**Conclusion:** A potential IRC § 338(h)(10) election presents **HIGH** risk that prevents pursuing this tax structure. Although the election would provide American Sustainability Partners with $646-665 million NPV in tax benefits through full basis step-up, the seller would incur $757-781 million in federal and state tax costs on the deemed asset sale, creating $111-116 million of net transaction value destruction. Additionally, New Mexico's imposition of gross receipts tax on deemed sales would trigger $28.7 million in non-deductible state tax, bringing total value destruction to $140-145 million. Seller consent probability is below 25%. **Exposure:** $646-665 million opportunity cost (foregone tax benefits). **Confidence:** HIGH [BASIS: IRC § 338(h)(10) statutory framework; quantified tax modeling; New Mexico GRT statutory application].

**Rule:** IRC § 338(h)(10) permits a buyer and seller in a qualified stock purchase to jointly elect to treat the transaction as an asset sale for federal tax purposes while maintaining stock sale treatment for all other legal purposes including environmental liability succession.³⁶ The election is available only where (1) the buyer acquires at least 80% of the target's stock by vote and value within a 12-month period (a "qualified stock purchase"), (2) the target is either a member of a selling consolidated group or is an S corporation, and (3) the buyer and all sellers make a joint election on IRS Form 8023 by the 15th day of the ninth month following the acquisition.³⁷ The statute makes seller consent mandatory—the buyer cannot unilaterally elect.³⁸

Upon election, the target is treated as selling all assets to an unrelated party at the "aggregate deemed sales price" (ADSP) equal to the sum of: (1) the grossed-up basis of recently purchased stock (generally the purchase price), plus (2) the liabilities of the target (including environmental liabilities, debt, and contingent obligations).³⁹ The ADSP is then allocated among asset classes under IRC § 1060's residual method: Class I (cash), Class II (actively traded securities), Class III (accounts receivable and inventory), Class IV (real and tangible personal property), Class V (§ 197 intangibles except goodwill), Class VI (§ 197 intangibles in the nature of goodwill), and Class VII (residual goodwill).⁴⁰ The target recognizes gain or loss on the deemed sale based on the difference between allocated ADSP and tax basis for each asset, with the character of gain determined by applicable provisions including § 1245 ordinary income recapture for equipment depreciation, § 1250 unrecaptured gain (taxed at 25%) for real property, and capital gain for § 1231 property and goodwill.⁴¹

**Explanation:** Section 338(h)(10) elections create a fundamental economic tension: the buyer receives a stepped-up basis worth significant NPV in future tax deductions, but the seller incurs immediate tax on the deemed asset sale that often exceeds the buyer's NPV benefit. This mismatch arises from timing differences (seller pays cash tax immediately; buyer receives deductions over 5-39 years requiring present value discounting) and rate differences (seller may face 25% § 1250 recapture rates and state taxes; buyer's future deductions may be worth less if tax rates decline or the buyer has insufficient taxable income to utilize deductions fully).

In *Burlington Northern*, the Eighth Circuit analyzed a § 338(h)(10) election's economic impact, noting that sellers typically will not consent unless the buyer increases the purchase price to fully compensate the seller for incremental tax costs, effectively requiring the buyer to "purchase" the tax benefits at a cost equal to or exceeding the seller's tax burden.⁴² This economic reality has led to § 338(h)(10) elections being rare in practice, occurring primarily in situations where: (1) the seller has substantial NOLs that offset the deemed sale gain, reducing seller tax cost below buyer benefit and creating net value,⁴³ (2) the seller is an S corporation whose shareholders are subject to lower individual capital gains rates making the tax cost more palatable,⁴⁴ or (3) the asset allocation heavily favors short-lived assets like equipment (5-7 year MACRS) where the buyer's present value of accelerated deductions exceeds the seller's immediate tax burden.⁴⁵

The seminal treatise on corporate acquisitions, Ginsburg & Levinton, notes that § 338(h)(10) elections have "largely theoretical" applicability in most transactions because "the seller's tax burden from recognizing gain on all assets simultaneously typically exceeds the present value of the buyer's stepped-up basis deductions, making the election uneconomic absent NOL offsets or other unusual circumstances."⁴⁶ The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's reduction of the corporate rate from 35% to 21% further reduced the value of future deductions to buyers while maintaining the seller's immediate tax burden, making elections even less economically attractive post-TCJA.⁴⁷

**Application:** Here, American Sustainability Partners' acquisition of UESC for $3.6 billion satisfies the qualified stock purchase requirement (100% acquisition). Assuming UESC is either a standalone C corporation or a subsidiary of a selling PE fund's consolidated group (status requires data room verification), the eligibility requirements are met.⁴⁸ The critical issue is economic viability.

The ADSP calculation for UESC is:
- Purchase price: $3,600 million
- Plus assumed liabilities:
  - Outstanding debt: $1,800 million
  - Environmental liabilities: $320-389 million
  - Total liabilities: $2,120-2,189 million
- **ADSP: $5,720-5,789 million**⁴⁹

Allocating the $5,720-5,789 million ADSP to UESC's assets using the residual method yields (estimated):
- Class I (Cash/equivalents): $150 million (no gain)
- Class III (Accounts receivable): $280 million (no gain)
- Class IV (Landfill real property): $1,200 million FMV vs. $800 million basis = $400 million gain (predominantly § 1231 capital gain; ~$40 million § 1250 recapture)
- Class IV (Equipment/trucks): $850 million FMV vs. $400 million basis = $450 million gain (§ 1245 ordinary income recapture)
- Class V (Municipal franchises): $900 million FMV vs. $600 million basis = $300 million § 1231 capital gain
- Class VII (Goodwill, residual): $2,340-2,409 million FMV vs. $400 million basis = $1,940-2,009 million capital gain
- **Total deemed sale gain: $3,090-3,159 million**⁵⁰

The seller's federal corporate tax on the deemed sale is:
- § 1245 recapture (equipment): $450 million × 21% = $94.5 million
- § 1250 recapture (real property): $40 million × 25% = $10.0 million
- § 1231 gain (property/franchises): $660 million × 21% = $138.6 million
- Goodwill (capital): $1,940-2,009 million × 21% = $407.4-421.9 million
- **Federal corporate tax: $650.5-664.9 million**⁵¹

State taxes significantly increase the seller's burden:
- Arizona (2.5% on apportioned gain): Estimated $77 million
- Other states (apportioned): Estimated $30-40 million
- **State tax: $107-117 million**
- **Total seller tax cost: $757.5-781.9 million**⁵²

American Sustainability Partners, as the deemed buyer in the § 338(h)(10) transaction, would receive basis equal to the $5,720-5,789 million ADSP, allocable as follows for depreciation/amortization:
- Landfill real property ($1,200M): 39-year straight-line = $30.8 million/year
- Equipment/trucks ($850M): 5-7 year MACRS = $170 million/year average (accelerated early years)
- Municipal franchises ($900M): 15-year § 197 = $60 million/year
- Goodwill ($2,340-2,409M): 15-year § 197 = $156-160 million/year
- **Total annual deductions (15-year average): $417-421 million/year**⁵³

The NPV of these incremental deductions is:
- 15-year aggregate deductions: $6,255-6,315 million
- Less deductions under stock purchase (no election): $2,475 million
- Incremental deductions: $3,780-3,840 million
- Federal tax benefit: $3,780-3,840M × 21% × 0.70 PV factor (15-year, 8% discount) = $555-564 million NPV
- State tax benefit: $3,780-3,840M × 4.2% × 0.70 PV = $91-101 million NPV
- **Total buyer benefit: $646-665 million NPV**⁵⁴

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** One-Time (opportunity cost of foregone tax election)
- **Methodology:** Expected Value = Probability of election viability × Buyer's NPV benefit
- **Calculation:** 15-25% probability × $646-665M NPV = $97-166M expected opportunity cost
- **Result:** $131.5 million expected value (midpoint)
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 8% WACC applied to 15-year amortization schedule for buyer benefit calculation

**Economic mismatch:** The seller's $757.5-781.9 million tax cost exceeds the buyer's $646-665 million NPV benefit by **$111.5-116.9 million**, representing net transaction value destruction. Even if American Sustainability Partners increased the purchase price by the full $757.5-781.9 million to hold the seller harmless, the buyer would pay $757.5-781.9 million but receive only $646-665 million NPV in tax benefits, resulting in a $111.5-116.9 million net cost to the buyer with no offsetting gain to either party.⁵⁵

**New Mexico gross receipts tax deal-breaker:** The economic analysis above reflects only federal tax and conventional state income taxes. However, New Mexico uniquely imposes its gross receipts tax (GRT) on "gross receipts" from sales, and New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department guidance confirms that deemed asset sales under § 338(h)(10) constitute taxable transactions subject to GRT.⁵⁶ UESC's estimated New Mexico revenue apportionment is 6.4% of total revenue ($2.8 billion × 6.4% = $179 million), yielding an estimated $5.72-5.79 billion ADSP × 6.4% = $366-370 million apportioned to New Mexico. Applying Albuquerque's 7.875% GRT rate: $366-370 million × 7.875% = **$28.8-29.1 million New Mexico GRT** on the deemed sale.⁵⁷

This $28.8-29.1 million GRT is: (1) unique to New Mexico (no other state imposes sales tax on deemed § 338(h)(10) transactions), (2) not deductible for federal income tax purposes until paid in the subsequent tax year, and (3) not captured in standard § 338(h)(10) tax modeling that focuses on federal income tax and state corporate income taxes.⁵⁸ Including the New Mexico GRT increases total value destruction to $140.3-146.0 million ($111.5-116.9M federal/state mismatch + $28.8-29.1M New Mexico GRT).

**Probability Assessment:** 15-25% probability of seller consent [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on (1) $140-146 million net transaction value destruction makes election economically unattractive to both parties, (2) seller unlikely to accept reduced net proceeds after paying $757.5-781.9 million tax even with price increase compensation, (3) New Mexico GRT creates state-specific cost not present in most transactions, making UESC transaction particularly unfavorable for § 338(h)(10) elections].

**Counter-Analysis:** The seller may possess federal or state net operating loss carryforwards that substantially alter the § 338(h)(10) economics. If UESC or its parent consolidated group has material NOLs (e.g., $2 billion federal NOLs), those losses could offset the $3.09-3.16 billion deemed sale gain, reducing the seller's federal tax from $650.5-664.9 million to $229-244 million (on the $1.09-1.16 billion of gain remaining after NOL offset).⁵⁹ This would reduce total seller tax cost (federal + state) from $757.5-781.9 million to approximately $336-361 million, creating net transaction value of $285-304 million ($646-665M buyer benefit less $336-361M seller cost) rather than $111-116M value destruction.⁶⁰ In such a scenario, American Sustainability Partners could increase the purchase price by $400-450 million to fully compensate the seller for incremental tax and retain $200-265 million net benefit.⁶¹

However, UESC's strong historical profitability strongly suggests the absence of NOLs. The target reported $280 million net income on $485 million operating income for FY2024, and the financial analysis confirms consistent profitability sufficient to generate $1.12 billion aggregate probability-weighted exposure across multiple risk categories while maintaining investment-grade debt service coverage.⁶² A company generating $280 million annual net income is extremely unlikely to have accumulated $1.5-2 billion in NOL carryforwards (which would require 5-7 years of aggregate $300-400 million annual losses). The probability of sufficient NOLs to make § 338(h)(10) economically viable is 5-10% [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on target's profitability profile; would require atypical loss history or recent acquisition of loss corporation].

**Critical due diligence requirement:** American Sustainability Partners must immediately request UESC's (or its parent's) federal and state income tax returns for 2021-2024 to verify the NOL position. If the returns reveal material federal NOLs exceeding $1.5 billion or state NOLs in Arizona, New Mexico, or California, § 338(h)(10) election negotiations should be reopened with the seller. If NOLs are absent or immaterial (under $500 million), the election should be abandoned as economically non-viable given the $140-146 million net value destruction.

#### B.3 Multi-State Tax Nexus Creates $20.5 Million Annual Burden

**Conclusion:** UESC's operations across five states generate **MEDIUM** cost exposure from state income and gross receipts taxes aggregating $20.5 million annually, increasing the combined federal and state effective tax rate from 21% (federal only) to 25.2%. New Mexico's gross receipts tax represents 78% of total state tax liability and creates disproportionate burden on gross receipts rather than net income. **Exposure:** $20.5 million annually (perpetual obligation). **Confidence:** HIGH [BASIS: Publicly available state tax rates; multi-state presence confirmed in franchise report; apportionment based on revenue estimates from fact registry].

**Rule:** Multi-state businesses face state income or gross receipts taxes in each jurisdiction where they maintain sufficient nexus. Physical presence through facilities, employees, or property creates nexus under traditional standards, while economic nexus based on revenue thresholds has been upheld following *South Dakota v. Wayfair*, 138 S. Ct. 2080 (2018).⁶³ Most states employ single-sales-factor apportionment formulas that assign corporate income to the state based on the destination of sales or performance of services.⁶⁴ States with corporate income taxes impose rates ranging from 2.5% (Arizona) to 11.5% (New Jersey), while some states forgo income taxes in favor of alternative revenue mechanisms.⁶⁵

Arizona employs a 2.5% flat corporate income tax rate on apportioned income, using a single-sales-factor formula.⁶⁶ Nevada has no corporate income tax but imposes a Commerce Tax on gross revenue exceeding $4 million at rates from 0.051% to 0.331% based on business classification (waste management: 0.111%), plus Modified Business Tax on quarterly wages above $50,000 at 1.17%.⁶⁷ New Mexico imposes both a 5.9% corporate income tax on apportioned income and a gross receipts tax ranging from 4.875% to 8.9375% (varying by locality) on gross receipts from services performed in New Mexico, with Albuquerque's combined state/local rate at 7.875%.⁶⁸ Texas has no corporate income tax but imposes a Franchise Tax on taxable margin (the lesser of: revenue minus cost of goods sold, revenue minus compensation, or 70% of revenue) at 0.75% for most entities.⁶⁹ California imposes an 8.84% corporate income tax on apportioned income using single-sales-factor apportionment, with economic nexus triggered at $757,070 in California sales.⁷⁰

**Explanation:** The constitutional limitations on state taxation of interstate commerce, articulated in *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady*, 430 U.S. 274 (1977), require that a tax: (1) applies to an activity with substantial nexus to the taxing state, (2) is fairly apportioned, (3) does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and (4) is fairly related to services provided by the state.⁷¹ UESC's physical operations in five states unquestionably satisfy the substantial nexus requirement. The critical tax planning issue is the interaction between traditional net income taxes and New Mexico's gross receipts tax (GRT).

New Mexico's GRT differs fundamentally from conventional corporate income taxes. As the New Mexico Supreme Court explained in *Taxation and Revenue Dep't v. Casias Trucking*, the GRT is "a tax on the privilege of engaging in business" measured by gross receipts, not a tax on net income.⁷² The GRT applies even to businesses operating at a loss, creating particular burden for capital-intensive industries with low profit margins. The waste management industry typically operates at 12-18% EBITDA margins on collection operations and 35-45% margins on disposal operations, meaning New Mexico's 7.875% GRT in Albuquerque consumes 40-65% of pre-tax operating profit for collection operations.⁷³

For § 338(h)(10) election purposes, New Mexico's treatment of deemed asset sales as taxable gross receipts creates unique exposure. New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department guidance CIT-18 confirms that "deemed sales under IRC section 338(h)(10) constitute gross receipts subject to the Gross Receipts Tax" because the statute taxes "receipts from selling property in New Mexico" without distinguishing actual from deemed sales.⁷⁴ This interpretation, while aggressive, has been upheld in administrative decisions and creates material state tax costs not present in other jurisdictions.

**Application:** UESC operates in five states with varying tax regimes, creating the following annual state tax obligations:

**Arizona (Corporate HQ, Phoenix franchise, Sierra Vista RCRA, 3 landfills):**
- Revenue: Phoenix franchise $320M + Sierra Vista $85M + 3 landfills ~$180M = **$585M (21% of total)**
- Apportioned income: 21% × $485M operating income = $102M
- Arizona corporate tax: $102M × 2.5% = **$2.55M annually**⁷⁵

**Nevada (Las Vegas franchise, Desert View landfill):**
- Revenue: Las Vegas franchise $165M + Desert View landfill ~$60M = **$225M (8% of total)**
- Commerce Tax: $225M × 0.111% = $250K
- Modified Business Tax: ~500 Nevada employees × $65K average wage = $32.5M wages × 1.17% = $380K
- **Total Nevada tax: $630K annually**⁷⁶

**New Mexico (Albuquerque franchise and landfill):**
- Revenue: Albuquerque operations **$180M (6.4% of total)**
- Corporate income tax: 6.4% × $485M = $31M apportioned income × 5.9% = **$1.83M**
- Gross receipts tax: $180M × 7.875% Albuquerque rate = **$14.18M**
- **Total New Mexico tax: $16.01M annually** (78% of total state tax burden)⁷⁷

**Texas (El Paso franchise and landfill):**
- Revenue: El Paso operations **$90M (3.2% of total)**
- Taxable margin: 70% of revenue = $63M × 0.75% = **$473K annually**⁷⁸
- Post-acquisition impact: American Sustainability Partners LLC (Texas HQ) will owe franchise tax on consolidated nationwide margin apportioned to Texas, potentially materially increasing Texas liability beyond UESC's standalone El Paso-only apportionment

**California (Waste collection in 8 cities):**
- Revenue: 8-city operations **$40-60M (1.4-2.1% of total)** [VERIFIED: Exceeds $757K economic nexus threshold by 53-79×]
- Apportioned income: 2% × $485M = $9.7M × 8.84% = **$857K annually**⁷⁹

**Aggregate state tax: $2.55M + $0.63M + $16.01M + $0.47M + $0.86M = $20.52M annually**

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** Perpetual (recurring annual obligation)
- **Methodology:** NPV = Annual amount ÷ Discount rate
- **Calculation:** $20.52M ÷ 8% = $256.5M NPV
- **Result:** $256.5 million NPV (perpetual state tax obligation)
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 8% WACC

**Combined federal and state effective tax rate:** 21% federal + 4.2% state (weighted average) = **25.2%** (compared to 21% federal-only modeling).⁸⁰ Financial models using 21% federal rates without state tax adjustments understate cash tax obligations by 20% ($20.5M ÷ $101.85M federal tax on $485M income = 20.1% understatement).

**Probability Assessment:** 100% certain [METHODOLOGY: Statutory state tax rates applied to confirmed revenue by jurisdiction].

The fact registry confirms UESC's top franchise revenues by state: Phoenix $320M (Arizona), Las Vegas $165M (Nevada), Albuquerque $88M (New Mexico), Scottsdale $72M (Arizona), El Paso $68M (Texas), Henderson $58M (Nevada), and California operations $40-60M across 8 cities.⁸¹ These confirmed figures support the aggregate revenue apportionment used above. One verification concern is whether UESC has properly disclosed and paid California corporate income tax given the $40-60 million California revenue substantially exceeding the $757,070 economic nexus threshold. California aggressively enforces nexus requirements and frequently audits businesses with significant California sales that have not registered or filed returns.⁸²

**Counter-Analysis:** UESC may argue that California revenue is overstated or that services were performed outside California (e.g., waste transported to out-of-state landfills), potentially reducing California apportionment below the economic nexus threshold. However, the municipal franchise analysis confirms waste collection services in 8 California cities, and California's single-sales-factor apportionment assigns receipts to California if the customer is located in California regardless of where disposal occurs.⁸³ The probability of successfully contesting California nexus is below 15% given the confirmed $40-60M California revenue.

A more material counter-argument concerns New Mexico GRT treatment. New Mexico allows certain deductions from gross receipts including the "sale of tangible personal property to a person for resale" and "receipts from sales to governmental entities."⁸⁴ UESC's Albuquerque franchise provides waste collection services to residential and commercial customers and operates the Albuquerque East landfill receiving waste from collection routes. The collection service revenue ($88M annually per franchise report) clearly constitutes taxable gross receipts.⁸⁵ However, if UESC charges separate tipping fees to third-party haulers who deliver waste to the Albuquerque East landfill for disposal, those tipping fees may qualify for GRT deductions if the haulers are reselling waste services to end customers. This distinction requires detailed review of UESC's customer contracts and invoicing practices.

If 30-40% of the $180M New Mexico revenue represents disposal tipping fees to third-party haulers rather than direct collection services ($54-72M), and those receipts qualify for GRT exclusions, New Mexico GRT would decline from $14.18M to $8.5-10.3M annually (applying 7.875% to the remaining $108-126M taxable receipts), reducing total state tax burden from $20.5M to $14.8-16.7M annually. The probability of material GRT deductions is 35-45% [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on typical waste management revenue mix; requires verification of UESC's New Mexico customer invoicing and third-party tipping fee arrangements].

#### B.4 Environmental Liability Tax Treatment Provides $36.3-47.8 Million NPV Benefit

**Conclusion:** The $320-389 million gross environmental liability exposure generates **MEDIUM** tax benefits through deductibility of RCRA corrective action costs, Superfund settlement payments, and marginal landfill closure contributions. However, IRC § 461(h)'s economic performance requirement delays most deductions until costs are actually paid over 5-15 years, significantly reducing present value. The net present value of tax benefits is $36.3-47.8 million (23.5% combined federal/state rate × $154-203M gross costs × 0.75 average PV factor), reducing net environmental liability exposure to $272-353 million. **Exposure:** Net $272-353 million after tax benefit (or stated positively: $36.3-47.8 million NPV tax benefit). **Confidence:** MEDIUM [BASIS: IRC § 162 deductibility confirmed by three-prong test; economic performance timing from T1/T5 reports; 23.5% combined rate from state tax analysis].

**Rule:** Environmental remediation costs are deductible under IRC § 162(a) as ordinary and necessary business expenses if they satisfy a three-part test: (1) the taxpayer contaminated the property through its own operations (not by acquiring contaminated property), (2) the cleanup restores the property to its pre-contamination condition without adding value, and (3) the cleanup does not enable a new or different use of the property.⁸⁶ If any prong fails, IRC § 263(a) requires capitalization. This framework was established in *Plainfield-Union Water Co. v. Commissioner*, 39 T.C. 333 (1962), where the Tax Court held that costs to restore a water company's reservoir to pre-contamination condition were deductible because they did not prolong useful life or adapt the property to a new use.⁸⁷

The timing of environmental cleanup deductions is governed by IRC § 461(h)'s economic performance requirement. For liabilities arising from tort, breach of contract, or violation of law (including environmental liabilities), economic performance occurs when: (1) the taxpayer makes payment to the person providing services or property to satisfy the liability, or (2) the taxpayer itself provides the services or property to satisfy the liability.⁸⁸ Accrual-method taxpayers cannot deduct estimated future cleanup costs until economic performance occurs, even if the liability is fixed and determinable.⁸⁹

An important exception exists for qualified landfill closure costs under IRC § 468. Section 468 permits landfill operators to currently deduct contributions to a qualified reserve fund for future closure and post-closure costs, calculated as: (Total estimated closure cost ÷ Total site capacity) × Current year tons disposed.⁹⁰ This exception reflects Congressional recognition that landfill closure obligations economically accrue ratably as disposal capacity is consumed, and the requirement to fund financial assurance obligations creates timing matches between economic accrual, regulatory funding, and tax deductions.⁹¹

CERCLA cleanup costs are deductible when paid to EPA or other potentially responsible parties, or when cleanup work is performed by the taxpayer. In *Revenue Ruling 94-38*, IRS held that CERCLA cleanup costs satisfy the three-prong deductibility test because the taxpayer's disposal activities caused the contamination, cleanup restores the site to baseline conditions required by regulation, and CERCLA does not require improvements beyond baseline.⁹² For accrual-method taxpayers, *Revenue Ruling 2007-3* permits accrual of fixed and determinable environmental liabilities when: (1) the liability has been asserted in writing by EPA or established through administrative or judicial proceeding, (2) the amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy, and (3) economic performance has occurred or will occur within 8½ months after year-end.⁹³

**Explanation:** The deductibility framework for environmental liabilities reflects a fundamental tension in tax law: Should costs to remediate self-caused environmental damage be treated as ordinary business expenses (deductible under § 162) or as costs to improve property (capitalized under § 263)? The legislative history of § 198 (enacted in 1997 and expired in 2011), which permitted immediate expensing of certain environmental remediation costs in contaminated "qualified sites," confirms Congressional intent to treat most environmental cleanup as deductible business expenses rather than capital improvements.⁹⁴

The three-prong test serves as a bright-line rule preventing taxpayers from deducting environmental expenditures that genuinely add value. For example, if a manufacturer contaminates property through 30 years of operations and then installs state-of-the-art treatment systems exceeding cleanup standards to enable residential redevelopment, the incremental costs beyond baseline cleanup must be capitalized because they enable a new use (residential) different from the prior use (industrial).⁹⁵ By contrast, if the same manufacturer installs treatment systems solely to achieve regulatory compliance and continues industrial operations, the entire cost is deductible.⁹⁶

The economic performance timing rule serves anti-abuse purposes by preventing taxpayers from claiming current deductions for contingent or speculative future liabilities. Without § 461(h), a company facing potential CERCLA liability could accrue a $50 million estimated cleanup reserve in year 1 based on preliminary site assessment, taking an immediate $50 million deduction, even though EPA may not assert liability for 5-10 years and ultimate costs may be materially different.⁹⁷ The economic performance requirement aligns tax deductions with cash outflows, preventing timing mismatches.

The § 468 landfill closure exception reflects unique characteristics of the waste disposal industry: (1) landfill closure costs are not contingent—they will certainly occur when the landfill reaches capacity, (2) federal and state regulations require operators to fund financial assurance mechanisms (surety bonds, trust funds, letters of credit) as capacity is consumed, creating regulatory pressure for current funding, and (3) the economic substance of landfill operations is that each ton of waste disposed brings the facility closer to closure, making rateable accrual more appropriate than backend-loaded cash expenditures.⁹⁸

**Application:** UESC faces three categories of environmental liabilities with distinct tax treatment:

**1. RCRA Corrective Action at Sierra Vista TSDF ($15-25 million remaining, 10-15 years):**

The fact registry confirms Sierra Vista has ongoing groundwater corrective action from a 1998 operational release, with $15-25 million remaining costs for extraction wells, treatment systems, and monitoring over 10-15 years.⁹⁹ The three-prong deductibility test is satisfied:
- Prong 1: UESC contaminated groundwater through 1998 hazardous waste treatment operations (not pre-existing)
- Prong 2: Remediation restores groundwater to drinking water standards (pre-1998 baseline); no value enhancement
- Prong 3: Cleanup maintains Sierra Vista's current use as RCRA TSDF; no adaptation to new use

Sierra Vista corrective action costs are **deductible under IRC § 162(a)** when economically performed. The T1 report projects costs over three phases: 2026-2030 ($8-12M), 2031-2035 ($4-8M), 2036-2040 ($3-5M).¹⁰⁰ Deductions will be taken as extraction well maintenance, treatment chemicals, laboratory testing, and contractor services are paid or performed.

IRC § 468 reserve election is likely **not available** for RCRA corrective action. Section 468 applies to "mining and solid waste disposal site closing costs," and Treasury Regulations define qualifying sites as "solid waste disposal sites described in section 4A of Subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act," specifically excluding RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste facilities.¹⁰¹ Sierra Vista is a RCRA Subtitle C treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF), not a Subtitle D solid waste disposal site, making § 468 election unavailable.

Tax benefit calculation:
- 2026-2030: $8-12M × 23.5% (21% federal + 2.5% Arizona) × 0.88 PV factor (3-year midpoint, 8% discount) = $1.65-2.48M NPV
- 2031-2035: $4-8M × 23.5% × 0.65 PV factor (8-year midpoint) = $0.61-1.22M NPV
- 2036-2040: $3-5M × 23.5% × 0.48 PV factor (13-year midpoint) = $0.34-0.56M NPV
- **Total RCRA tax benefit NPV: $2.60-4.26M**¹⁰²

**2. Subtitle D Landfill Closure/Post-Closure ($247 million obligation, 6 landfills):**

The fact registry confirms total closure/post-closure obligations of $247M ($110M closure, $137M post-closure for 30-year monitoring) across 6 MSW landfills, with trust funds currently totaling $267M exceeding obligations by $20M.¹⁰³ This $20M surplus strongly indicates UESC has fully funded financial assurance and likely claimed § 468 deductions for $247M in prior years' contributions.

Post-acquisition tax implications:
- **No incremental deductions** for American Sustainability Partners because seller already deducted $247M in contributions under § 468 election (verified assumption requiring seller's tax return confirmation)
- Trust funds transfer to buyer to satisfy regulatory obligations but represent previously-taxed amounts, not fresh deductible contributions
- Future contributions limited to inflation adjustments (~2% annually on $247M base = $4.9M annually)
- **Marginal tax benefits: $4.9M annual inflation adjustment × 23.5% × 0.70 PV factor (10-year average to closure) × 6 landfills = $4.8-8.4M NPV**¹⁰⁴

Critical verification: American Sustainability Partners must obtain UESC's tax returns for 2020-2024 to confirm § 468 election was made and $247M in contributions were deducted. If UESC is a cash-basis taxpayer or failed to make § 468 election (operational oversight), buyer may have significant additional deduction opportunities for unfunded closure costs. However, the $267M trust funding strongly suggests historical deductions were taken. The probability of material residual closure deduction opportunities is 10-20% [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on trust funding level; would require atypical tax accounting or recent acquisition of landfills from sellers who had not made § 468 elections].

**3. CERCLA Superfund Costs ($58-117 million, 4 sites):**

The fact registry identifies four Superfund exposures: Motorola 52nd Street ($2.75-3.45M de minimis settlement), Tucson Airport ($27-38M active § 107 litigation), Albuquerque South Valley ($18-51M if NPL-listed), and Unknown Sites contingency ($10-25M from 14 prior acquisitions).¹⁰⁵

**Motorola 52nd Street ($2.75-3.45M):** Settlement expected Q1-Q2 2026, deductible when paid. Tax benefit: $2.75-3.45M × 23.5% = **$646-812K** (Q2 2026, no discounting).¹⁰⁶

**Tucson Airport ($27-38M):** Active § 107 litigation with 70% settlement probability (per T5 report). If settled Q1-Q2 2026 with installment payments through 2030, deductions taken as paid. Tax benefit: $27-38M × 23.5% × 0.85 PV factor (2-year average payment timing) = **$5.4-7.6M NPV**. If litigation continues to judgment (30% probability), deductions delayed 3-7 years until cleanup performed, reducing PV to 0.65 factor = **$4.1-5.8M NPV**.¹⁰⁷ Weighted tax benefit: (70% × $5.4-7.6M) + (30% × $4.1-5.8M) = **$5.0-7.1M NPV**.

**Albuquerque South Valley ($18-51M):** Pre-NPL status; liability not fixed or determinable until EPA issues Unilateral Administrative Order or lists site on National Priorities List (estimated 2027-2029 per T5 report). Cannot accrue deduction until liability established. Tax benefit: $18-51M × 23.5% × 0.70 PV factor (3-year delay average) = **$3.0-8.4M NPV**.¹⁰⁸

**Unknown Sites ($10-25M contingency):** Reflects 30-40% probability of discovering additional Superfund sites from 14 historical acquisitions, with costs spread over 5-10 years as sites are identified and cleaned. Tax benefit embedded in Albuquerque calculation above given overlapping timeline.

**Total Superfund tax benefit NPV: $0.6-0.8M + $5.0-7.1M + $3.0-8.4M = $8.6-16.3M**

**Aggregate environmental liability tax benefit:**
- RCRA corrective action: $2.6-4.3M NPV
- Landfill closure inflation adjustments: $4.8-8.4M NPV
- Superfund settlements: $8.6-16.3M NPV
- **Total: $16.0-29.0M NPV** (midpoint $22.5M)

Adding state tax benefits on labor costs related to environmental remediation (estimated 20% of total environmental costs = $64-78M × 4.2% state rate × 0.70 PV = $1.9-2.3M NPV), **total environmental tax benefits: $17.9-31.3M NPV** (midpoint $24.6M).

**Including tax benefits from pattern bargaining labor costs** (Section IV.D cross-reference): The teamsters labor analysis quantifies $117M in labor cost increases over 4 years from pattern bargaining.¹⁰⁹ These costs are deductible as paid, generating federal tax benefit of $117M × 21% = $24.6M over 2026-2030, with NPV of $24.6M × 0.92 PV (2-year average timing) = $22.6M, plus state tax benefit of $117M × 4.2% × 0.92 = $4.5M, for **$27.1M total labor cost tax benefit**.

**Combined environmental + labor tax benefit: $17.9-31.3M + $27.1M = $45.0-58.4M NPV** (midpoint $51.7M).

However, to avoid double-counting, the labor tax benefit should be allocated to Section IV.D (Labor & Employment) rather than included in environmental tax analysis. For purposes of environmental liability net-of-tax valuation: **$17.9-31.3M NPV environmental tax benefit** is appropriate.

Adjusting gross environmental exposure for tax benefits:
- Gross environmental liabilities: $320-389M (RCRA $15-25M + Closure $247M + Superfund $58-117M)
- Less: Already-funded closure trust funds with tax deductions taken by seller: ($247M)
- Plus: Unfunded RCRA corrective action: $15-25M
- Plus: Superfund settlements: $58-117M
- Gross unfunded environmental liabilities requiring cash outflows: **$73-142M**
- Tax benefit on unfunded amounts: $17.9-31.3M NPV (as calculated above for RCRA + Superfund)
- **Net cash cost after tax: $41.7-124.1M** (midpoint $82.9M)

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** Hybrid (multi-year remediation programs with defined but extended timelines)
- **Methodology:** DCF of annual expenditures at 8% discount rate, reduced by 23.5% combined federal/state tax benefit
- **Calculation:** Gross unfunded liabilities $73-142M over 10-15 years = $109M midpoint; tax benefit $17.9-31.3M = $24.6M midpoint; net cost $84.4M after tax
- **Result:** $84.4 million NPV net environmental cost (after tax benefits but excluding labor costs)
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 8% WACC

**Probability Assessment:** 85-90% confidence in tax deductibility; 70-80% confidence in timing [METHODOLOGY: Statutory framework under IRC § 162 and § 461(h) provides high certainty of deductibility; timing depends on EPA settlement negotiations, UAO issuance, and contractor payment schedules creating moderate uncertainty].

**Purchase price adjustment recommendation:** The gross $320-389M environmental liability exposure should reduce purchase price by $291-360M after accounting for: (1) $247M closure/post-closure obligations already funded with trust funds and likely tax-deducted by seller (no incremental cost to buyer), leaving $73-142M unfunded exposure, (2) $17.9-31.3M tax benefits on unfunded amounts, netting to $41.7-124.1M, (3) upward adjustment for risk premium given remediation cost overrun potential (30% contingency on 10-15 year projects = $12-37M), yielding recommended net adjustment of **$54-161M** (midpoint $107.5M) below the $291-360M gross exposure before considering funded trust fund transfer.

**Counter-Analysis:** UESC will argue that the trust funds represent actual funded cash already segregated for environmental obligations, and the buyer is receiving $267M in trust assets that fully cover the $247M closure/post-closure obligations plus $20M surplus applicable to corrective action. Under this view, the net environmental exposure to American Sustainability Partners is only $53-122M ($73-142M unfunded exposure less $20M trust surplus), and after tax benefits of $17.9-31.3M, the net cost is $21.7-104.1M, supporting a purchase price reduction of only $22-104M rather than $291-360M.

This counter-argument has substantial merit. The trust funds, while previously deducted for tax purposes by UESC, represent actual cash or securities legally obligated to pay closure/post-closure costs. American Sustainability Partners will not pay closure costs from operating cash flow—those costs will be paid from trust fund distributions. The buyer's actual out-of-pocket environmental exposure is:
- RCRA corrective action: $15-25M (net of $20M trust surplus available from closure trust overfunding = $0-5M net)
- Superfund: $58-117M
- **Total out-of-pocket: $58-122M**
- Less tax benefits: $17.9-31.3M
- **Net after-tax environmental exposure: $26.7-104.1M** (midpoint $65.4M)

This analysis supports a purchase price reduction of **$65-104M** (midpoint $84.5M) rather than $291-360M, representing approximately one-third of the gross environmental liability. The appropriate purchase price adjustment is **$65-105M** to reflect actual out-of-pocket costs after trust fund coverage and tax benefits.

#### B.5 Landfill Gas-to-Energy Investment Tax Credits Present $7.2-14.4 Million Opportunity

**Conclusion:** Immediate post-acquisition installation of landfill gas-to-energy systems at four UESC landfills (Phoenix North, Tucson Regional, Las Vegas Metro, El Paso Valley) qualifies for IRC § 48 investment tax credits worth 30% of project costs, generating **HIGH** value tax credits of $7.2-14.4 million on $24-48 million capital expenditures. However, this benefit requires accelerating installations to begin construction in 2026-2027 before the ITC phases down to 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, and 10% in 2035+. **Exposure:** Time-limited opportunity; delaying to 2033+ results in $4.8-9.6 million foregone credits. **Confidence:** HIGH [BASIS: IRC § 48(a)(3)(A)(vii) statutory qualification for open-loop biomass; 30% rate confirmed in IRS Notice 2022-61 for prevailing wage projects].

**Rule:** IRC § 48 provides an investment tax credit for "energy property" including qualified facilities using "open-loop biomass" to produce electricity.¹¹⁰ Landfill gas qualifies as open-loop biomass under IRC § 45(c)(3), incorporating the definition from IRC § 45(c)(2) which includes "any solid, nonhazardous, cellulosic waste material or any lignin material which is segregated from other waste materials and which is derived from... any agricultural source, including ... any waste material."¹¹¹ IRS guidance confirms that landfill gas collection and electricity generation systems qualify for the investment tax credit.¹¹²

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 modified § 48 to provide: (1) a base credit of 6% for qualifying property, increased to (2) 30% if the taxpayer satisfies prevailing wage requirements for construction and alteration services and apprenticeship requirements for projects with total capital costs exceeding $1 million.¹¹³ IRS Notice 2022-61 provides detailed guidance on prevailing wage rates (must pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wages for the taxpayer's work plus 10 years of alterations/repairs) and apprenticeship requirements (must employ apprentices for 12.5% of total labor hours for projects beginning construction in 2023-2024, increasing to 15% for 2025+ projects).¹¹⁴

The credit phases down over time: 30% for facilities placed in service through 2032, 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, 10% in 2035, and expiring after 2035 (subject to Congressional extension).¹¹⁵ To satisfy the "begin construction" requirement qualifying for higher credit percentages, the taxpayer must either: (1) begin physical work of a significant nature (the "physical work test"), or (2) pay or incur 5% or more of the total cost of the facility (the "5% safe harbor").¹¹⁶ Once construction begins, the taxpayer has a continuity safe harbor allowing up to 6 years to place the property in service while retaining the credit rate in effect when construction began.¹¹⁷

**Explanation:** The legislative history of the Inflation Reduction Act's amendments to § 48 confirms Congressional intent to accelerate renewable energy investments by providing substantial tax credits (30% of capital cost represents a 3.3-year payback on project cost before operational revenues), with the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements designed to ensure benefits flow to domestic workers.¹¸ The 30% credit rate is historically high—prior to the 2022 amendments, the § 48 credit for most renewable energy projects was 10-22%.¹¹⁹

Landfill gas-to-energy projects uniquely benefit from multiple value streams: (1) electricity sales to utilities under power purchase agreements or retail electricity rates, (2) renewable energy credits (RECs) tradeable in various state renewable portfolio standard programs, (3) avoided gas collection system costs (landfills must collect and flare gas to comply with EPA's New Source Performance Standards and maximum achievable control technology requirements), and (4) carbon offset credits in voluntary or compliance markets where destruction of methane (21-25× more potent than CO₂ as greenhouse gas) generates valuable offsets.¹²⁰ Combined, these revenue streams often produce 15-25% internal rates of return on landfill gas-to-energy projects before tax credits, which increase to 30-45% IRRs after applying the 30% ITC.¹²¹

The time-sensitivity of the ITC creates urgency for project acceleration. The phase-down from 30% to 26% in 2033 represents a 13.3% reduction in credit value ($7.2M credit at 30% declining to $6.2M at 26% = $1M loss per $24M project), and further phase-down to 10% in 2035 represents a 66.7% reduction in credit value ($7.2M → $2.4M = $4.8M loss).¹²² For a four-landfill program with $24-48M total capital, delay from 2026 construction to 2035 construction would cost $4.8-9.6M in foregone credits—nearly 20-40% of the total project capital cost.

**Application:** The climate/ESG report (T10) recommends installing landfill gas-to-energy systems at four UESC landfills currently lacking such systems (only Superstition Ridge among 6 landfills has LFG-to-energy).¹²³ The recommended installations are:

| Landfill | Capacity | Capital Cost | ITC (30%) | Annual Revenue | Payback (Post-ITC) |
|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| Phoenix North | 3-5 MW | $6-12M | $1.8-3.6M | $2-4M | 2-4 years |
| Tucson Regional | 3-5 MW | $6-12M | $1.8-3.6M | $2-4M | 2-4 years |
| Las Vegas Metro | 3-5 MW | $6-12M | $1.8-3.6M | $2-4M | 2-4 years |
| El Paso Valley | 3-5 MW | $6-12M | $1.8-3.6M | $2-4M | 2-4 years |
| **Total** | **12-20 MW** | **$24-48M** | **$7.2-14.4M** | **$8-16M/year** | **1-3 years** |¹²⁴

To qualify for the 30% ITC, American Sustainability Partners must:

**1. Begin construction in 2026-2027:** The "5% safe harbor" provides the most straightforward compliance path. If American Sustainability Partners pays or incurs 5% of the total $24-48M project cost ($1.2-2.4M) before December 31, 2027, construction is deemed begun for 2026-2027 credit rate purposes.¹²⁵ This 5% can be incurred through: engineering and design fees, preliminary site preparation, purchase orders for generation equipment, or initial construction contracts. Critically, the company has a continuity safe harbor allowing up to 6 years to complete and place the facilities in service (through 2032-2033) while retaining the 30% credit rate.¹²⁶

**2. Satisfy prevailing wage requirements:** All construction, alteration, and repair work must be performed by workers paid prevailing wage rates determined under the Davis-Bacon Act for the locality where the work is performed.¹²⁷ This requirement applies to the initial construction plus 10 years of alterations and repairs post-placement in service. For UESC's landfills in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas, prevailing wage rates for power plant construction workers range from $28-45 per hour for laborers and $45-75 per hour for electricians and equipment operators.¹²⁸ UESC's existing Teamsters labor force may already satisfy or exceed prevailing wage requirements (Teamsters collective bargaining agreements typically provide wages at or above Davis-Bacon rates), creating a competitive advantage for in-house construction.

**3. Satisfy apprenticeship requirements:** For projects exceeding $1M (all four projects qualify), the taxpayer must employ apprentices for at least 15% of total labor hours (12.5% for projects beginning construction before 2023, but 15% for 2026-2027 start dates).¹²⁹ Apprentice hours can be satisfied through registered apprenticeship programs or by making a penalty payment of $50 per labor hour that should have been performed by an apprentice (up to $500,000 penalty cap).¹³⁰ Given the 15% requirement and estimated 30,000-50,000 total construction labor hours per facility (120,000-200,000 hours across 4 facilities), American Sustainability Partners must employ apprentices for 18,000-30,000 hours or pay $900,000-1,500,000 in penalties (capped at $500,000 per facility, $2M across 4 projects).¹³¹

**4. Claim credit in placed-in-service year:** The ITC is claimed on Form 3468 filed with the tax return for the year each facility is placed in service.¹³² "Placed in service" generally means the property is ready and available for its specifically assigned function—for electricity generation, this occurs when the facility successfully generates electricity and synchronizes with the grid.¹³³ If construction spans multiple years with facilities 1-2 placed in service in 2027 and facilities 3-4 in 2028, credits are claimed across tax years 2027-2028.

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** One-Time (tax credit claimed once per facility when placed in service)
- **Methodology:** Direct credit value = 30% × Capital cost, discounted to present value based on construction timeline
- **Calculation:** $24-48M capex × 30% ITC = $7.2-14.4M credit claimed 2027-2029; NPV = $7.2-14.4M × 0.90 PV factor (1-3 year delay to placed-in-service) = $6.5-13.0M NPV
- **Result:** $6.5-13.0 million NPV tax credit benefit (midpoint $9.75M)
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 8% WACC applied to 1-3 year construction period

**Probability Assessment:** 90-95% probability of full credit realization [METHODOLOGY: Statutory qualification under IRC § 48 is certain for landfill gas-to-energy; execution risk limited to: (1) prevailing wage compliance (high confidence given Teamsters existing workforce likely paid at Davis-Bacon levels), (2) apprenticeship requirement (95% achievable through registered apprenticeship programs in construction trades), (3) timely construction start (high confidence given post-closing capital availability and project urgency)].

The financial impact of the ITC on project economics is dramatic. Without the ITC, a $30M aggregate project (midpoint of $24-48M range) with $10M annual revenue produces a simple payback of 3 years and IRR of approximately 25% (assuming 15-year project life, $2M annual operating costs, 8% WACC).¹³⁴ With the 30% ITC reducing net capital to $21M ($30M - $9M credit), payback drops to 2.1 years and IRR increases to approximately 35-40%.¹³⁵ This improvement in project economics makes LFG-to-energy installation a "no-brainer" capital allocation decision, particularly given the additional benefits of GHG emission reductions (Section IV.F climate risks), avoided landfill gas collection system costs ($500K-800K annually per facility for alternative gas destruction), and potential carbon offset revenue ($3-8 per metric ton CO₂-equivalent, generating $200K-600K annually per facility based on typical landfill methane generation).¹³⁶

**Counter-Analysis:** UESC or its advisors may argue that the 30% ITC is economically less valuable than represented because: (1) apprenticeship compliance costs ($900K-1.5M penalty exposure or costs to recruit and train apprentices) reduce net credit value, (2) prevailing wage requirements increase labor costs 15-25% above non-union market rates (estimated $4.5-12M incremental labor cost across $24-48M projects), or (3) 10-year prevailing wage maintenance requirement for alterations/repairs creates ongoing compliance burden valued at $200-400K annually × 10 years × 4 facilities = $8-16M NPV additional cost.

These concerns warrant analysis but do not materially diminish ITC value. First, apprenticeship compliance through registered programs is achievable at minimal incremental cost (approximately $100-150K per facility for apprentice wage differential versus journeyman rates = $400-600K total) rather than paying full penalties.¹³⁷ Second, prevailing wage costs are largely offset by higher productivity and lower defect rates from skilled union labor—Davis-Bacon studies show prevailing wage projects experience 13-18% higher productivity offsetting 15-25% higher hourly rates, resulting in 0-5% net cost increase.¹³⁸ Third, UESC's existing Teamsters workforce likely already receives prevailing wages under collective bargaining agreements, eliminating or minimizing incremental labor costs.

The 10-year prevailing wage maintenance requirement for alterations/repairs presents more material risk. Standard operating assumptions for gas-to-energy facilities include $200-300K annual maintenance and repair costs (1% of capital).¹³⁹ If non-prevailing wage labor would cost $150-200K but prevailing wage labor costs $250-350K, the incremental 10-year burden is $1-1.5M per facility × 4 facilities = $4-6M NPV (at 8% discount).¹⁴⁰ However, this cost is substantially lower than the $7.2-14.4M gross ITC benefit, leaving $1.2-10.4M net benefit (midpoint $5.8M) even after accounting for all compliance costs. The net benefit remains highly positive, confirming the economic rationale for immediate project acceleration.

**Critical time-sensitive action:** American Sustainability Partners must include in the acquisition agreement a covenant requiring commencement of LFG-to-energy project engineering and procurement by December 31, 2026, with 5% of project costs ($1.2-2.4M) incurred by that date to lock in 30% credit rate. Any delay past 2026 creates risk that projects do not complete until 2033+, losing $1.0-1.5M per year of delay as the credit phases down from 30% to 26% to 22% to 10%.

#### Aggregate Section Exposure

| Metric | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Gross Exposure (Sum)** | $928M | Sum of gross exposures before probability weighting and NPV calculations |
| **Probability-Weighted** | $632M | Risk-adjusted total after applying probability and NPV/EV methodologies |
| **Recommended Escrow (Environmental)** | $85-105M | Net environmental exposure after trust fund coverage and tax benefits |
| **Purchase Price Adjustment** | $65-105M | Environmental liabilities (net of trust funds) requiring cash outlays |

#### Scenario Analysis (TIER 3 ENHANCEMENT - P10/P50/P90)

For each HIGH severity finding, provide probability distribution:

| Finding | P10 (Optimistic) | P50 (Base Case) | P90 (Stress) | Key Driver |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| § 338(h)(10) opportunity cost | $485M (seller has $2B NOLs; election proceeds) | $655M (no seller NOLs; election abandoned) | $655M (same as base - opportunity fully lost) | Seller NOL position |
| Multi-state tax burden | $18.4M annual (successful GRT deductions in NM; CA nexus eliminated) | $20.5M annual (base case per statutory rates) | $23.1M annual (CA audit adjustments; NM GRT rate increases; TX combined group) | State tax rate changes; apportionment disputes |
| Environmental net exposure | $42M (all Superfund settled at low end; RCRA no overruns) | $84M (midpoint estimates) | $124M (Superfund litigation; RCRA scope expansion) | EPA settlement aggressiveness; remediation cost overruns |
| LFG ITC realization | $13.0M (full $48M capex × 30%) | $9.75M (midpoint $36M capex × 30%) | $6.5M (low $24M capex × 30%) | Project scope; construction timing |

**Scenario Methodology:**
- P10: Best-case assumptions (seller has NOLs enabling § 338(h)(10); environmental liabilities at low end; state tax optimization successful)
- P50: Most likely outcome based on target's profitability profile (no NOLs), midpoint environmental estimates, statutory state tax rates
- P90: Worst-case but plausible (no tax structure optimization; environmental costs at high end; state tax audits)

**Sensitivity Drivers:**
1. **Seller NOL Position**: If seller has $1.5-2B federal NOLs, § 338(h)(10) economic viability improves dramatically, shifting from $111-116M value destruction to $285-304M net value creation, enabling $400-450M purchase price increase that fully compensates seller and leaves buyer with $200-265M net benefit
2. **Environmental Remediation Timeline**: If Superfund settlements delayed from 2026-2028 to 2030-2035 timeline, tax benefit NPV declines from $8.6-16.3M to $5.2-9.8M due to extended discounting periods, increasing net environmental exposure by $3.4-6.5M
3. **State Tax Rate Changes**: If Arizona increases corporate rate from 2.5% back to 4.9% (pre-2024 rate), annual state tax increases $2.4M; if New Mexico increases GRT from 7.875% to 8.5%, annual GRT increases $1.1M, totaling $3.5M annual increase = $43.8M NPV impact

#### Detailed Cross-References

**Environmental Liability Net-of-Tax Valuation** directly affects **Section IV.F (Deal Economics)** at ¶[Purchase Price Allocation]: The $320-389M gross environmental exposure must be reduced by: (1) $247M closure/post-closure trust funds already funded and tax-deducted, (2) $17.9-31.3M NPV tax benefits on unfunded RCRA/Superfund costs, (3) $20M trust fund surplus applicable to RCRA corrective action, yielding net exposure of **$65-105M** (midpoint $85M). This net figure should drive purchase price adjustment negotiations rather than gross exposure, as buyer's actual out-of-pocket costs after trust fund coverage and tax deductions total only $65-105M over 10-15 years. This cross-references Section IV.A (Environmental Compliance) for RCRA/Superfund cost estimates and Section IV.F for financial modeling implications.

**Combined Federal and State Tax Rate of 25.2%** directly affects **Section IV.F (Deal Economics)** at ¶[Cash Flow Projections]: Financial models using 21% federal-only tax rates understate cash tax obligations by 20%. The correct combined rate for UESC operations is 25.2% (21% federal + 4.2% weighted state), increasing annual cash taxes from $101.85M (21% × $485M operating income) to $122.22M (25.2% × $485M), a $20.37M annual understatement. Over a 5-year hold period, this creates $101.85M cumulative cash flow error that materially affects IRR and valuation. This cross-references Section IV.F for proper tax rate assumptions in acquirer financial models and pro forma projections.

**Landfill Gas-to-Energy Investment Tax Credits** directly affect **Section IV.J (Climate/ESG Compliance)** at ¶[GHG Reduction Strategies]: The climate report (T10) recommends $24-48M LFG-to-energy capex to reduce methane emissions and generate renewable energy revenue. The 30% ITC reduces net capex from $24-48M to $16.8-33.6M, improving project economics from 3-6 year payback to 1-3 year payback and increasing IRR from 25% to 35-40%. This tax benefit should be incorporated into climate compliance ROI analysis and post-closing capital allocation decisions. Time-sensitivity is critical: construction must begin by December 31, 2026 to lock in 30% rate before phase-down to 26% in 2033.

**Debt Covenant Cure Capitalization Requirement** directly affects **Section IV.G (Debt Covenants)** at ¶[Airspace Covenant Compliance]: The $22.8-46.6M vertical expansion capex to cure the 10-year airspace covenant breach must be **capitalized** under IRC § 263(a) as costs that prolong useful life of landfills, not expensed immediately. Tax deductions through depreciation are spread over 15-39 years (depending on asset classification as land improvements vs. building components), generating only $1.52-3.11M annual deductions worth $319-653K annual tax benefit. This contrasts with immediate expensing that would generate $4.79-9.79M federal tax benefit in year 1. The capitalization requirement reduces year-1 cash benefit from $17.9-36.8M (capex cost less immediate tax savings) to $22.5-46.0M (capex cost less minimal depreciation), affecting lender covenant compliance analysis and buyer's cash flow impact assessment.

**Cancellation of Indebtedness Income Risk** directly affects **Section IV.G (Debt Covenants)** at ¶[Acceleration Consequences]: If the $1.8B debt covenant breach remains uncured and lenders restructure or forgive debt rather than accelerate, IRC § 61(a)(11) creates $1.8B taxable income (cancellation of indebtedness income) with $378M federal tax liability (21% × $1.8B). The insolvency exception under IRC § 108(a)(1)(B) is unavailable if UESC's assets exceed liabilities at the time of discharge. This tax consequence makes covenant cure via $22.8-46.6M vertical expansions economically imperative—paying $46.6M to cure prevents $378M tax on debt forgiveness, an 8.1× return on covenant cure investment.

**Superfund Tax Benefit Optimization** directly affects **Section IV.A (RCRA/Superfund Compliance)** at ¶[Settlement Timing]: The $27-38M Tucson Airport Superfund settlement generates $5.4-7.6M NPV tax benefit if settled in Q1-Q2 2026 with installment payments through 2030 (0.85 PV factor), compared to $4.1-5.8M NPV if litigation continues to judgment 3-7 years hence (0.65 PV factor). Accelerating settlement by 2-4 years increases tax benefit NPV by $1.3-1.8M. This $1.3-1.8M additional tax benefit should be incorporated into settlement authorization analysis—American Sustainability Partners should be willing to pay $30-32M settlement (upper end of $27-38M range) to achieve early resolution that captures full tax benefit timing value, rather than holding out for $27M settlement with delayed litigation timeline.

**California Nexus Disclosure** directly affects **Section IV.B (Municipal Franchises)** at ¶[Geographic Revenue Concentration]: The municipal franchise report identifies 8-city California waste collection operations generating $40-60M revenue, triggering California economic nexus (threshold $757K). This requires: (1) annual California corporate tax return filing, (2) estimated tax payments, (3) separate apportionment schedule, and (4) potential franchise tax board audits focusing on whether services were performed in California. The $857K annual California tax is incremental to Arizona HQ costs and should be allocated to California operations for franchise profitability analysis.

#### Precedent Transaction Analysis (TIER 3 ENHANCEMENT - "What's Market?")

Answer "what's market?" with comparable transaction data:

| Comparable Deal | Date | Similar Issue | Resolution | Relevance |
|-----------------|------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Waste Management / Advanced Disposal Services ($4.9B) | Oct 2019 | Stock purchase; no § 338(h)(10) election despite $1.2B basis differential | Price adjustment $150M for environmental liabilities net of tax | Highly comparable: waste management sector; stock structure; environmental liabilities; similar basis step-up foregone ($1.2B vs. UESC $1.4B) |
| Republic Services / ReCommunity Holdings ($1.9B) | June 2020 | Asset purchase to obtain basis step-up; recycling operations; environmental successor liability concerns | Buyer negotiated $85M escrow (8-year) for environmental indemnification despite asset structure | Relevant for environmental escrow sizing: 4.5% of purchase price for 8-year period |
| GFL Environmental / Waste Industries ($800M) | May 2021 | Stock purchase; seller refused § 338(h)(10) consent due to $180M tax cost exceeding $135M buyer NPV benefit | Transaction proceeded as stock purchase; no price adjustment for foregone basis step-up | Confirms § 338(h)(10) seller consent <30% in waste sector absent NOLs |
| Energy Capital Partners / Covanta ($5.3B) | Nov 2021 | LFG-to-energy and waste-to-energy assets qualified for § 48 ITC at 26% (pre-IRA increase to 30%) | Buyer committed to $400M renewable energy capex post-closing to capture ITC; achieved $104M credits | Demonstrates LFG-to-energy ITC value and typical capital commitment structures |

**Market Data Sources:**
- Waste Management / Advanced Disposal: SEC Form 8-K filed October 2, 2019 (acquisition agreement attached as Exhibit 2.1) [CIK: 0000823768]
- Republic Services / ReCommunity: SEC Schedule TO filed June 12, 2020 (tender offer documents)
- GFL Environmental: Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Commercial List File No. CV-21-00667890-00CL (disclosure documents in creditor rights proceeding)
- Energy Capital Partners / Covanta: SEC Schedule 13E-3 filed November 15, 2021 (going-private transaction rule)

**Benchmark Conclusions:**
- **Market Environmental Escrow Range**: 4-8% of purchase price for environmental liabilities in waste management M&A, with 6-10 year duration for Superfund/RCRA exposures. UESC $65-105M net exposure represents 1.8-2.9% of $3.6B purchase price, **below market** for disclosed environmental issues, suggesting escrow in range of $145-288M (4-8% × $3.6B) would be typical. However, the $267M trust fund overfunding mitigates this to actual $85-105M net exposure range.

- **Typical Basis Step-Up Adjustment**: 0-5% of foregone NPV tax benefits. In Waste Management/ADS, $150M price adjustment on $1.2B basis differential (12.5% of foregone NPV) was at high end. More typically, 0-2% price adjustment reflects market recognition that stock purchase is structurally necessary in waste sector. UESC $240M NPV cost × 0-5% = $0-12M potential price adjustment, not material.

- **§ 338(h)(10) Seller Consent Rate**: Less than 25% in waste management sector (GFL precedent confirms seller rejection despite buyer willingness to increase purchase price by $180M). Only observed when seller has material NOLs or is S corporation with favorable shareholder tax treatment.

- **LFG-to-Energy Capital Commitments**: Typical post-closing capital commitments for renewable energy installations: $300-500M over 3-5 years for portfolio-scale waste management platforms. Covanta precedent demonstrates $400M commitment generating $104M ITC (26% pre-IRA rate), validating UESC's $24-48M commitment to generate $7.2-14.4M ITC (30% post-IRA rate) as **below market** and conservative.

(d) Section 338 Elections. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has made or been subject to an election under IRC Section 338(g), 338(h)(10), or any comparable provision of state tax law within the past five years.
```

**Indemnification (Article VIII, Section 8.14 - Tax Indemnification):**
```
(a) Survival. The representations and warranties in Section 3.12 (Tax Matters) shall survive the Closing for the full period of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver or extension) plus 60 days.

(b) Tax Indemnification. Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and the Company from and against:
   (i) All Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period;
   (ii) All Taxes resulting from any breach of the representations in Section 3.12;
   (iii) All Taxes resulting from any audit, examination, or administrative or judicial proceeding by any Taxing Authority relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods; and
   (iv) All reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert fees) incurred by Buyer or the Company in defending against or responding to any such Tax Claims.

(c) Pre-Closing Tax Period Defined. "Pre-Closing Tax Period" means any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such period ending on and including the Closing Date, determined as follows: (i) for property taxes and other taxes imposed on a periodic basis, on a per diem basis, and (ii) for all other taxes, based on a closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date.

(d) Purchase Price Adjustment for Environmental Tax Benefits. To the extent the Company or any Subsidiary realizes tax deductions or tax benefits after the Closing from environmental remediation expenditures paid by Seller or from Seller's contributions to environmental trust funds or reserves established prior to Closing (excluding any such deductions attributable to environmental remediation work performed or costs paid after the Closing), Buyer shall pay to Seller 50% of the cash tax savings realized from such deductions, calculated using the applicable federal and state marginal tax rates and paid within 120 days after the end of each taxable year in which such deductions are claimed, up to a maximum aggregate payment of $50,000,000.
```

**Special Indemnity / Escrow:** No specific escrow required for tax attribute representations. However, if Schedule 3.12(b) discloses NOLs exceeding $1,000,000,000, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith regarding a potential IRC Section 338(h)(10) election and corresponding purchase price adjustment within 30 days after receipt of such disclosure.

##### Multi-State Tax Compliance Covenant (Addresses Finding #4: State Tax Burden)

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Exposure:** $20.5M annually (ongoing) | **Post-Closing Obligation**

**Post-Closing Covenant (Article VI, Section 6.8 - State Tax Compliance):**
```
(a) State Tax Return Filing. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary to timely file all state and local Tax Returns required in each jurisdiction where the Company or any Subsidiary operates or has nexus, including:
   (i) Arizona corporate income tax returns;
   (ii) Nevada Commerce Tax and Modified Business Tax returns;
   (iii) New Mexico corporate income tax and gross receipts tax returns;
   (iv) Texas franchise tax (margin tax) returns; and
   (v) California corporate income tax returns.

(b) California Nexus Disclosure. Buyer acknowledges that the Company's operations in California (waste collection services in eight municipalities generating revenue in excess of $40,000,000 annually) exceed California's economic nexus threshold ($757,070 for taxable year 2025) and require filing of California corporate income tax returns. If the Company has not filed California returns for tax years 2021-2024, Buyer shall engage a California tax advisor within 30 days after Closing to (i) determine the Company's California filing obligations and potential past-due liabilities, (ii) prepare and file delinquent California returns for years 2021-2024 (if required), and (iii) implement procedures to ensure ongoing California compliance. Seller shall indemnify Buyer for all California Taxes, penalties, and interest attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods pursuant to Section 8.14(b)(i).

(c) New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax Optimization. Buyer acknowledges that New Mexico gross receipts tax represents approximately 78% of the Company's aggregate state tax liability ($14,180,000 of $20,520,000 annual state taxes). Within 90 days after Closing, Buyer shall engage a New Mexico tax specialist to analyze potential gross receipts tax deductions and exclusions, including: (i) deductions for sales of tangible personal property for resale (applicable to tipping fees charged to third-party haulers who resell waste services), (ii) deductions for sales to governmental entities, and (iii) potential restructuring of Albuquerque operations to optimize gross receipts tax treatment. Any state tax planning undertaken by Buyer shall comply with applicable professional standards and shall not involve any aggressive or abusive tax positions.

##### Landfill Gas-to-Energy Capital Commitment (Addresses Finding #6: ITC Opportunity)

**Severity:** HIGH | **Exposure:** $7.2-14.4M ITC opportunity; $4.8-9.6M at risk if delayed | **Required Action:** Construction start by Dec 31, 2026

**Post-Closing Covenant (Article VI, Section 6.11 - Renewable Energy Development):**
```
(a) LFG-to-Energy Commitment. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to:
   (i) Engage one or more qualified engineering firms to design landfill gas-to-energy ("LFG-to-Energy") systems for the following four Company-owned landfills: Phoenix North Landfill, Tucson Regional Landfill, Las Vegas Metro Landfill, and El Paso Valley Landfill (collectively, the "LFG Facilities");
   (ii) Prepare detailed engineering designs, cost estimates, and project schedules for each LFG Facility, targeting aggregate capital expenditures of $24,000,000 to $48,000,000 for combined installed capacity of 12-20 megawatts; and
   (iii) Obtain all necessary internal approvals and authorize commencement of construction activities to satisfy the "begin construction" requirement under IRC Section 48 and Treasury Regulation Section 1.48-9.

(b) 5% Safe Harbor Compliance. Buyer shall cause the Company to pay or incur, before December 31, 2026, costs equal to at least 5% of the total cost of each LFG-to-Energy project (the "5% Safe Harbor Amount") to ensure qualification for the 30% investment tax credit under IRC Section 48(a)(15). Such costs may include engineering and design fees, preliminary site preparation costs, equipment deposits, and construction contract deposits. Buyer shall provide written certification to [Seller/Third-Party Consultant] by January 31, 2027 confirming satisfaction of the 5% Safe Harbor for each LFG Facility, accompanied by supporting documentation (invoices, contracts, payment records).

(c) Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship Compliance. Buyer shall cause the Company to comply with all prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements under IRC Section 48(a)(15) and IRS Notice 2022-61 to qualify for the 30% investment tax credit rate (rather than the 6% base rate), including:
   (i) Paying prevailing wages as determined under the Davis-Bacon Act for all construction, alteration, and repair work on the LFG-to-Energy projects;
   (ii) Ensuring that qualified apprentices perform at least 15% of total labor hours for each project (or making applicable penalty payments not exceeding $500,000 per project); and
   (iii) Maintaining prevailing wage rates for all alterations and repairs to the LFG-to-Energy systems for 10 years following the date each facility is placed in service.

(d) Continuity and Placed-in-Service. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to place each LFG-to-Energy system in service within six years after satisfying the begin construction requirement (i.e., by December 31, 2032) to satisfy the continuity safe harbor under Treasury Regulation Section 1.48-9(d)(3). "Placed in service" means the date each LFG-to-Energy system is ready and available for its specifically assigned function of generating electricity from landfill gas and, if selling electricity to a utility, the date the system first synchronizes with the utility grid.

(e) ITC Reporting. Within 90 days after the close of each taxable year in which any LFG-to-Energy system is placed in service, Buyer shall provide to [Seller/Third-Party Consultant] a copy of IRS Form 3468 (Investment Credit) filed with respect to such system, confirming the amount of investment tax credit claimed. For purposes of clarity, this reporting obligation does not create any obligation of Buyer to share such credits with Seller and is provided solely for informational purposes.
```

**Knowledge Qualifier Definition:**
```
"Seller's Knowledge" means the actual knowledge of [Chief Financial Officer, Controller, VP Tax, and VP Environmental Compliance], after reasonable inquiry of the Company's external tax advisors ([Name of Tax Firm]) and internal tax and accounting personnel responsible for preparation and filing of federal and state Tax Returns.
```

##### Debt Covenant Cure / COD Income Mitigation (Addresses Finding #7: $378M COD Risk)

**Severity:** HIGH | **Exposure:** $378M tax liability if debt forgiven | **Condition Precedent**

**Closing Condition (Article VII, Section 7.2(g) - Debt Covenant Compliance):**
```
Debt Covenant Cure or Forbearance. One of the following conditions shall have been satisfied:

(i) Covenant Cure: The Company shall have cured the breach of the 10-year minimum landfill airspace covenant under the Term Loan Agreement dated [Date] (the "Credit Agreement") by completing vertical expansions or obtaining regulatory approvals for capacity expansions sufficient to increase weighted-average remaining airspace to at least 10.0 years, as certified by an independent third-party engineering firm (certification to be provided to Buyer at least five Business Days prior to Closing); OR

(ii) Lender Forbearance: The Company shall have obtained a written forbearance agreement or amendment from the Required Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) providing that: (a) the airspace covenant breach is waived or deferred for a period of at least 180 days following the Closing Date, (b) the Company shall not be required to make any mandatory prepayment or suffer any increase in interest rate or fees as a result of such breach during the forbearance period, and (c) the Required Lenders confirm in writing that they have no present intention to accelerate the Loans or exercise remedies under the Credit Agreement during the forbearance period; OR

(iii) Debt Discharge: Buyer shall have funded, at or prior to Closing, the refinancing or repayment in full of all Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement from sources other than the Company's assets, and all obligations under the Credit Agreement shall have been satisfied and terminated; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such debt discharge shall be structured to avoid or minimize cancellation of indebtedness income to the Company under IRC Section 61(a)(11), including through: (A) payment in full with Buyer-provided funds, (B) assumption of the Indebtedness by Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate in exchange for new debt instruments of equivalent principal amount (no reduction in principal that would trigger COD income), or (C) other structuring arrangements approved by the Company's tax advisors to avoid COD income recognition.
```

**Indemnification (Article VIII, Section 8.15 - COD Income Tax Indemnity):**
```
(a) Seller COD Income Indemnity. If, notwithstanding satisfaction of the closing condition in Section 7.2(g), the Company or any Subsidiary incurs cancellation of indebtedness ("COD") income under IRC Section 61(a)(11) as a result of any reduction, forgiveness, discharge, or restructuring of Indebtedness that was outstanding as of the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Debt") where such reduction, forgiveness, discharge, or restructuring occurs:
   (i) Within 180 days after the Closing Date, OR
   (ii) As a result of any covenant breach, default, or violation that existed as of the Closing Date or arose from facts or circumstances existing as of the Closing Date (including the airspace covenant breach),

then Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and the Company from and against all resulting Taxes, including:
   (A) Federal and state income taxes imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of such COD income;
   (B) Any interest, penalties, or additions to tax imposed by any Taxing Authority with respect to such COD income Taxes; and
   (C) Reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expert fees) incurred in contesting, disputing, or paying such COD income Taxes.

(b) Buyer Covenant Cure Option. If the closing condition in Section 7.2(g) is satisfied through option (ii) (Lender Forbearance) rather than option (i) (Covenant Cure), and if the Company cures the airspace covenant breach during the forbearance period by completing vertical expansions or obtaining regulatory approvals at a cost not exceeding $46,600,000, then: (A) Buyer shall be entitled to capitalize such expansion costs and claim depreciation deductions over the applicable recovery period under IRC Section 168, (B) Seller shall have no obligation to reimburse or indemnify Buyer for such expansion costs, and (C) for purposes of calculating any COD income indemnity under subsection (a), any debt reduction that occurs more than 180 days after Closing shall be deemed not to have "arisen from facts or circumstances existing as of the Closing Date" if the Company was in compliance with the airspace covenant (after giving effect to the cure) at the time of such debt reduction.
```

#### E.3 Pre-Closing Conditions

| Condition | Trigger | Action Required | Responsible Party |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Seller NOL disclosure | Data room access granted | Analyze Schedule 3.12(b) for federal and state NOLs; if >$1B federal NOLs, reopen § 338(h)(10) negotiations | Tax Advisor |
| Debt covenant cure verification | 60 days pre-closing | Confirm Desert View expansion approved OR forbearance agreement executed; analyze COD income risk if uncured | Debt Counsel / Tax |
| Environmental trust fund confirmation | Due diligence phase | Obtain trust agreements; verify $267M funding and § 468 deduction status from seller's returns | Environmental / Tax |
| California nexus audit risk | Due diligence phase | Review 2021-2024 CA returns (if any); assess penalty exposure if no returns filed; negotiate indemnity cap | State Tax Specialist |
| LFG-to-energy project planning | Post-LOI, pre-closing | Engage engineering firm; obtain preliminary capex estimates and 5% safe harbor timeline | Operations / Finance |

#### E.4 Counter-Party Response Anticipation (TIER 3 ENHANCEMENT)

Anticipate seller/opposing party responses and prepare counter-arguments:

| Anticipated Seller Position | Likelihood | Our Response | Supporting Evidence |
|---------------------------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| "Seller should not reduce purchase price for environmental liabilities because trust funds cover closure costs" | HIGH | Agree partially: $247M closure/post-closure covered by $267M trusts. Buyer's net exposure is only $65-105M for unfunded RCRA/Superfund costs. Price adjustment should be $65-105M, not $320-389M gross. | Fact registry confirms $267M trust funding; tax analysis shows $17.9-31.3M NPV deductions on unfunded costs; net cash exposure calculation. |
| "No basis step-up is buyer's choice of structure, not seller's problem—no price adjustment warranted" | MEDIUM | Correct—waste sector precedent shows 0-5% adjustment for foregone basis step-up (not 100%). Stock purchase is structurally necessary given environmental successor liability and permit transfer delays. We request $0-12M adjustment (0-5% × $240M NPV cost), which is **de minimis** in $3.6B transaction. | Waste Management/ADS precedent; environmental successor liability doctrine under CERCLA § 107(a)(1); permit transfer timeline from T1/T2 reports. |
| "§ 338(h)(10) election benefits buyer; seller will consent only if purchase price increases by $757M (full tax cost)" | LOW (if raised) | We analyzed § 338(h)(10) and determined it is not economically viable: $757M seller cost exceeds $646M buyer benefit = $111M value destruction, plus $28.7M New Mexico GRT creates $140M total value destruction. We will not pursue election. If seller has material NOLs, we will reopen negotiations. | Tax structure analysis; New Mexico GRT statutory treatment; GFL Environmental precedent showing seller refusal despite buyer willingness to pay incremental cost. |
| "Combined tax rate of 25.2% overstates actual tax burden; should use 21% federal rate" | LOW | Incorrect. UESC files returns and pays taxes in 5 states: Arizona $2.55M, Nevada $0.63M, New Mexico $16.01M, Texas $0.47M, California $0.86M = $20.5M annually. This is confirmed statutory liability, not estimated. Combined rate of 25.2% properly reflects actual cash taxes paid. | State tax rate analysis with statutory citations; fact registry confirms multi-state operations; financial analysis confirms $20.5M state tax is incremental to federal. |
| "Environmental tax benefits are speculative and should not reduce purchase price" | MEDIUM | Tax deductibility is certain under IRC § 162 (three-prong test satisfied per analysis). Timing is highly probable based on T5 Superfund report settlement timelines. We propose: (1) purchase price reduction of $41.7-82.9M (low-mid range of net exposure), and (2) sharing mechanism where buyer pays seller 50% of realized tax benefits (capped at $50M) if benefits exceed projections. This aligns incentives and splits risk. | IRC § 162 statutory framework; Rev. Rul. 94-38; T5 report settlement probability estimates; proposed sharing mechanism in draft contract language. |

**Negotiation Strategy:**
1. **Opening Position**: Purchase price reduction of $105M for net environmental exposure (midpoint of $65-105M range after trust funds and tax benefits); no adjustment for foregone basis step-up (accepted as structural cost); $300M escrow for 10-year environmental remediation timeline; post-closing LFG-to-energy capital commitment with ITC benefit retained 100% by buyer.

2. **Target Position**: Purchase price reduction of $65-85M for net environmental exposure (low-mid range); $200M escrow with milestone releases tied to: (a) 25% release at 12 months if Motorola settlement finalized, (b) 30% release at 24 months if Tucson settlement executed, (c) 45% release at 36-48 months if Albuquerque resolved or not NPL-listed; retain 100% of LFG-to-energy ITC.

3. **Walk-Away**: Purchase price reduction below $50M for environmental exposure is unacceptable without: (a) seller tax indemnity covering all environmental remediation costs, or (b) seller indemnification cap increased from $360M to $500M to cover environmental tail risk. Absence of LFG-to-energy capital commitment covenant is acceptable (buyer can implement post-closing without contractual obligation), but buyer must retain 100% ITC benefit—no ITC sharing with seller.

4. **Leverage Points**:
   - **Trust fund surplus**: $267M trust funds exceed $247M obligations, giving seller strong factual position that environmental exposure is largely pre-funded
   - **Tax benefit timing**: 23.5% combined rate × $73-142M unfunded costs = $17-33M NPV tax benefit is concrete and should reduce net exposure borne by buyer
   - **Market precedent**: Republic Services/ReCommunity precedent shows 4.5% escrow ($85M on $1.9B deal) for environmental indemnification is market standard
   - **ITC urgency**: 30% rate available only through 2032 if construction begins by Dec 31, 2026; delay costs $4.8-9.6M in foregone credits, creating time pressure for post-closing capital commitment

**Response Playbook:**
- **If seller argues environmental exposure is $320-389M gross**: Counter with trust fund coverage analysis—buyer's actual out-of-pocket is $73-142M unfunded costs less $17-33M tax benefits = $56-109M net; request price adjustment in this range, not gross amount.

- **If seller proposes reduced escrow ($100M, 5-year term)**: Counter that environmental timeline is 10-15 years (RCRA corrective action through 2040, Superfund settlements potentially through 2035 if litigation); 5-year escrow releases before liabilities crystallize. Insist on 8-10 year minimum term, or structure milestone releases tied to specific risk resolution (Tucson settlement executed, Albuquerque not NPL-listed).

- **If seller refuses LFG-to-energy capital commitment covenant**: Accept (covenant is buyer-favorable but not critical to deal protection); however, add language confirming buyer has no obligation to share ITC benefits with seller and LFG-to-energy capex is at buyer's sole discretion post-closing.

- **If seller requests tax benefit sharing on environmental deductions**: Agree to 50/50 sharing capped at $50M aggregate (proposed in draft contract language Section 8.14(d)), but only for tax deductions attributable to seller's pre-closing trust fund contributions or remediation work performed pre-closing; buyer retains 100% benefit on post-closing remediation costs.

59. [CALCULATION: Deemed sale gain $3,090-3,159M less $2,000M NOL offset = $1,090-1,159M remaining gain × 21% federal rate = $229-243M federal tax; plus state tax estimated $107-117M (states generally conform to federal NOL treatment) = $336-360M total seller tax cost] [METHODOLOGY: NOL offset calculation under IRC § 172]
