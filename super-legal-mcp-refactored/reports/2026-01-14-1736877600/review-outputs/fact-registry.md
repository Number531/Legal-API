### Liability Type Classification

**Perpetual (use NPV):**
- Pattern Bargaining Labor Cost: $117M ÷ 4 years = $29.25M annually → NPV = $29.25M ÷ 8% WACC = $365M (but finite 4-year obligation, so DCF more appropriate)

**Contingent (use EV):**
- Phoenix Franchise Loss: 35-40% probability × $320M = $112M-$128M EV
- Debt Acceleration: 10-15% probability × $1,800M = $180M-$270M EV
- Davis-Bacon Debarment: 25-35% probability × $670M-$1,100M = $167M-$385M EV range

**Hybrid (use DCF):**
- RCRA Corrective Action: $15M-$25M over 10-15 years → DCF at 8% = $8M-$13.4M PV
- Tucson Superfund Settlement: $27M-$35M installments 2026-2030 → DCF at 8% = $22.9M-$29.8M PV

## CRITICAL CONFLICTS TO INVESTIGATE

**NO MATERIAL CONFLICTS DETECTED** across 173 extracted facts from 14 specialist reports.

All quantitative facts (revenues, costs, probabilities, dates) are internally consistent. Where ranges exist (e.g., $15M-$25M), they reflect uncertainty in estimation rather than conflicting data.

Minor variations in probability estimates are within acceptable expert judgment ranges (e.g., Phoenix franchise 60-65% vs. 55-60% in different contexts reflect different scenario assumptions).

## DATA GAPS REQUIRING VERIFICATION

1. **Actual Phoenix Franchise Agreement Terms**: Consent standard (ministerial vs. discretionary) requires data room review
2. **Sierra Vista EPA Deficiency Response**: September 2024 letter contents and UESC's response not independently verified
3. **UESC Federal Tax Returns (2021-2024)**: NOL carryforward status unverified (assumed $0 based on profitability)
4. **Seller's Tax Basis in UESC Assets**: Required for definitive Section 338(h)(10) modeling
5. **DOL Davis-Bacon Investigation Timeline**: Current status and settlement discussions require DOL liaison
6. **Lender Debt Covenant Forbearance Status**: Whether preliminary discussions initiated for airspace waiver
