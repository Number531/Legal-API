  "summary_narrative": "The $3.6B UESC acquisition presents $3.47B gross environmental and operational exposure, reduced to $943.4M probability-weighted and $881M after correlation adjustments. Five HIGH-severity findings dominate: Phoenix franchise renewal risk ($320M at 40% probability), RCRA permit uncertainty ($75.6M weighted), landfill airspace depletion ($300M at 45% probability), Teamsters pattern bargaining ($117M at 90% probability), and Superfund liability ($90M weighted across 3 sites). The correlation-adjusted exposure represents 24.5% of transaction value but only 4.9% on a weighted basis, below typical 5% MAE thresholds. However, tail risk scenarios (permit denial + franchise loss simultaneously) could approach deal-blocking levels. Recommended mitigation: $400M escrow (36-48 month duration), $250M purchase price reduction, $300M R&W insurance with full environmental sublimit, regulatory approval conditions precedent for RCRA permit and Albuquerque NPL listing. Critical immediate actions: (1) Initiate Tucson Superfund settlement negotiations to cap $340M joint-several exposure at $27M-$35M, (2) Finalize RCRA permit deficiency response to maximize Dec 2025 approval probability, (3) Proactive Teamsters bargaining April-May 2026 with competitive 18-19% offer to avoid strike (15-20% probability, $24M-$30M cost)."
