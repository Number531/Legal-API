- Focus areas:
  - Western Refinery Superfund Site (El Paso TX, $45M contract, 5-year performance warranty 2028-2033)
  - Warranty risk (if contamination rebounds after treatment ceases, UESC must re-remediate at own cost $5-10M)
  - Fort Huachuca performance (cost overruns, soil excavation volumes 50K CY estimated vs. 85K CY actual, UESC absorbed $8M overrun)
  - Hanford performance (on schedule, no safety incidents, radiation worker training, NRC oversight)

  - Total debt $1.8B (term loan $950M, senior notes $850M)
  - Airspace covenant (minimum 10 years remaining capacity, weighted average across all landfills by disposal volume)
  - Current status (8.0 years = breach, below 10-year minimum)
  - Cure period (180 days from breach, lenders allow cure via expansions or acquire additional capacity)
  - Expansion plan (Superstition Ridge approved +4.3 years, Desert View pending +10.9 years if approved, post-expansion 12.1 years if both approved)
  - Covenant calculation (weighted average: Superstition 4.0 years, Desert View 5.0 years if approved, Red Rock 1.6 years, others 1.5 years)
  - Lender negotiation (waiver request, covenant amendment reduce 10 → 8 years temporarily)
- Key authorities: Credit agreement covenants, debt acceleration provisions, UCC Article 9 (secured lending)
- Critical issues: Covenant breach, $1.8B debt acceleration risk, cure via expansions (Desert View 50-60% probability), alternative cures if denied
- Cross-reference with: T2 (landfill expansions required for cure), T3 (Phoenix franchise requires capacity proof)

**T12 (insurance-coverage-analyst) - Insurance & Financial Assurance:**
- Focus areas:

**T13 (Combine with T2) - Real Estate:**
- Covered by environmental-compliance-analyst T2 (landfill properties, transfer stations, MRFs, title issues, environmental liens, deed restrictions)

**T14 (tax-structure-analyst) - Tax Structure:**
- Focus areas:
  - Asset vs. stock purchase (likely stock to assume environmental liabilities, but tax inefficient)
  - Section 338(h)(10) election (deemed asset sale for tax, stock sale for legal, requires seller consent)
  - Environmental liabilities tax treatment (cleanup costs deductible when incurred, trust fund contributions)
  - State tax (Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, California operations, apportionment, nexus)
  - Transfer taxes (Arizona real estate transfer tax on landfills, local transfer taxes)
- Key authorities: IRC § 338(h)(10), § 162 (ordinary deductions), state tax codes
- Critical issues: Stock purchase tax inefficient (no step-up), but necessary to assume liabilities, Section 338(h)(10) requires seller consent
- Cross-reference with: T1 (RCRA liabilities), T2 (landfill properties transfer), T5 (Superfund liabilities)

**T15 (financial-analyst) - Financial Impact Aggregation:**
- Invoked AFTER T1-T14 complete IF total quantified exposure >$1M

## RESEARCH QUALITY STANDARDS

### For Each Specialist Report:
- [ ] Executive Summary: 2,000-5,000 words, self-contained
- [ ] All critical issues from checklist addressed (or noted as N/A with reason)
- [ ] Quantified exposure ranges for material findings
- [ ] Cross-domain impacts flagged with target section references
- [ ] Bluebook citations with database provenance (CFR, U.S.C., case reporters, EPA databases)
- [ ] Recommendations: specific, actionable, tied to legal authority

### Citation Density Targets:
| Report Type | Target Citations | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Regulatory | 60-100 | Heavy CFR/statutory (RCRA, Subtitle D) |
| Case Law | 40-80 | Focus on holdings (Interstate Commerce, CERCLA case law) |
| Employment | 50-90 | NLRA + case law + CBAs |
| Contracts | 30-60 | Contract + statutory (franchise agreements, government contracts) |

---

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| EPA databases accessible (RCRA Info, Envirofacts) | Standard assumption | Would require alternative research methods |
| State environmental databases accessible (AZ DEQ, NV DEP, NM) | Standard assumption | State-specific limitations if unavailable |
| CERCLA databases accessible (NPL sites, SEMS) | Standard assumption | Superfund research incomplete |
| DOL databases accessible (Davis-Bacon, debarment) | Standard assumption | Government contract risk assessment limited |
| UESC data room documents available | User-provided assumption | Cannot verify specific contract terms without |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual debt agreement terms (assume standard airspace covenant from user description)
- Specific franchise agreement termination provisions (will generalize from Phoenix example)
- Teamsters CBA wage scales (use user-provided ranges)

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:**
- T1-T12 execute in parallel (no dependencies)
- T14 (tax) depends on T1-T5 (liability findings)
- T15 (financial aggregation) depends on T1-T14 (all quantified exposures)

**Potential Issues:**
- Sierra Vista permit denial (5-10% probability) = potential deal-blocker ($85M revenue loss)
- Desert View expansion denial (40-50% probability) = cannot cure airspace covenant without alternative
- Phoenix franchise loss (35-40% probability) = material impact $320M revenue, but not deal-blocker if disclosed

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If Sierra Vista permit DENIED (EPA decision Q2-Q3 2025), flag immediately as potential MAE
- If airspace covenant cannot be cured within 180 days (Desert View + alternatives fail), flag debt acceleration risk
- If combined quantified exposure >$500M, consider purchase price adjustment
