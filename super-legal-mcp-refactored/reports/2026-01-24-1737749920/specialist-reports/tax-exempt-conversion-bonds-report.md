## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

National Healthcare Partners LLC's proposed $2.4B acquisition of Mercy Regional Health System presents **two critical tax-related deal issues** that will materially impact transaction economics, financing requirements, and post-closing operations:

1. **Tax-Exempt Status Conversion:** Mercy's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status terminates upon for-profit acquisition, triggering $36.43M in new annual operating taxes (federal income tax, Ohio state/local taxes), reducing net income by 64% from $72M to $26M annually

2. **Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption:** Mercy's $420M tax-exempt bonds (Mercy Northwest Hospital, 2016-2046) must be redeemed at closing for $428.4M (102% make-whole premium), plus refinancing at taxable rates adds $9.45M annual interest expense

However, **comprehensive tax minimization strategies can reduce Year 1 taxes by 55%** (from $36M to $16M) and Years 2-10 taxes by 14-23% (to $28M-$31M annually), improving transaction IRR by an estimated 300-500 basis points and justifying the investment in sophisticated tax structuring.

### Key Findings

#### 1. 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status - Automatic Loss Upon Conversion

**Current Status:**
- Mercy received IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter in 1952, confirmed upon secularization in 1998
- Meets organizational test (Articles state exclusively charitable purposes) and operational test (operates for community benefit, no private inurement)
- Community benefit reporting (IRS Form 990 Schedule H, FY2024): $202M total community benefit = 11.2% of operating expenses, exceeding IRS 5-10% guideline
  - Charity care: $45M (free/discounted care, 200-400% FPL sliding scale)
  - Medicaid shortfall: $120M (Medicaid pays 85% of cost)
  - GME/education: $27M
  - Research: $2M
  - Community health programs: $8M

**Legal Effect of For-Profit Acquisition:**
- IRC § 501(c)(3) requires organizations be "organized and operated exclusively for" charitable purposes with "no part of the net earnings...inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual"
- When National Healthcare Partners (for-profit PE entity) acquires Mercy, the hospital system no longer operates "exclusively" for charitable purposes; instead operates for benefit of private shareholders (PE fund investors)
- Tax-exempt status **terminates by operation of law** on acquisition closing date (no formal IRS revocation required, though Mercy must notify IRS and file final Form 990)

**Ohio Attorney General Approval Required:**
- Ohio Rev. Code § 109.34 requires nonprofit health care entities obtain written AG approval for transactions transferring ≥20% of assets within 24-month period
- AG scrutinizes: (1) FMV valuation of assets ($2.4B purchase price), (2) charitable asset dedication (proceeds used for charitable purposes), (3) continuing community benefit post-conversion
- Precedent: Ohio Supreme Court approved Richmond Heights Hospital conversion with strict conditions (proceeds exclusively for charitable purposes, continuing charity care commitments)
- **Probability of approval:** 90-95% if transaction demonstrates FMV consideration and continuing community benefit; 5-10% denial risk if AG finds inadequate asset dedication

#### 2. Tax Consequences - $36.43M Annual Operating Taxes + $471.6M One-Time

**Federal Income Tax (IRC § 11):**
- **Rate:** 21% flat rate on taxable income (effective 2018 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act)
- **Mercy net income (FY2024):** $72M (after depreciation and interest)
- **Annual federal income tax:** $72M × 21% = **$15.12M**
- **Deductions available:** Operating expenses (salaries, supplies, utilities), interest expense ($18M on $420M bonds currently deductible), depreciation (buildings 39-year, equipment 5-7 year MACRS)
- **Corporate AMT:** 15% minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income >$1B does NOT apply (Mercy's $72M net income far below threshold)

**Ohio State Taxes:**
- **Commercial Activity Tax (CAT):** 0.26% on gross receipts >$6M exclusion
  - Mercy net revenue: $1.8B (FY2024) → ($1.8B - $6M) × 0.26% = **$4.66M annually**
  - Currently exempt (nonprofit exception); exemption terminates upon for-profit conversion
  - Ohio corporate franchise tax: Minimal/zero (CAT replaced franchise tax post-2005)

**Ohio Property Tax:**
- **Current exemption:** Ohio Rev. Code § 5709.121 (property used exclusively for charitable purposes by charitable institutions exempt)
- **Exemption terminates:** Property must "belong to" charitable institution; for-profit ownership disqualifies
- **Real estate:** 4 hospital campuses + 86 outpatient facilities, estimated $600M assessed value
- **Effective rate:** 1.8% (Franklin County average for commercial property)
- **Annual property tax:** $600M × 1.8% = **$10.80M**
- **One-time recapture (Ohio Rev. Code § 5709.12):** 4 years retroactive tax savings = $10.80M × 4 = **$43.2M** due within 12 months of conversion

**Ohio Sales Tax:**
- **Current exemption:** Ohio Rev. Code § 5739.02(B)(12) (sales to 501(c)(3) organizations and hospital facilities exempt)
- **Exemption terminates:** Upon loss of 501(c)(3) status
- **Taxable purchases:** Medical equipment, supplies, services (estimated $60M-$120M annually, 30-40% of $200M-$300M total purchases)
  - Non-taxable: Prescription drugs for resale, certain medical devices
- **Sales tax rate:** 6.5% (Ohio 5.75% + Franklin County 0.75%)
- **Annual sales tax:** Mid-range estimate $90M × 6.5% = **$5.85M**

**Total Annual Operating Taxes:**

| Tax Category | Annual Amount |
|--------------|---------------|
| Federal income tax (21%) | $15.12M |
| Ohio CAT (0.26%) | $4.66M |
| Ohio property tax (1.8%) | $10.80M |
| Ohio sales tax (6.5%) | $5.85M |
| **TOTAL** | **$36.43M/year** |

**One-Time Costs:**
- Property tax recapture (4 years): $43.2M
- Tax-exempt bond redemption (102%): $428.4M
- **TOTAL:** $471.6M

**Net Income Impact (Before Tax Minimization):**
- Current net income (tax-exempt): $72M
- Less: New annual taxes: ($36.43M)
- Less: Additional bond interest (6.5% vs. 4.25%): ($9.45M)
- **Post-conversion net income:** $26.12M (64% reduction)

#### 3. Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption - $428.4M Required at Closing

**Mercy Northwest Hospital Bonds:**
- **Principal:** $420M tax-exempt revenue bonds
- **Issuer:** Ohio Hospital Facilities Authority
- **Issue date:** 2016 (financed construction, hospital opened 2019)
- **Maturity:** 2046 (30-year bonds, 22 years remaining)
- **Interest rate:** 4.25% tax-exempt (bondholders receive interest exempt from federal income tax)

**IRC § 141 Private Activity Bond Test:**
- Bonds are "private activity bonds" if >10% of proceeds used for private business use AND >10% of debt service secured by/derived from private business property
- **Private business use defined:** Use in trade or business of nongovernmental person (for-profit corporation)
- **Mercy Northwest conversion:** 100% of hospital becomes private business use when operated by National Healthcare Partners (for-profit entity)
- **Test failure:** 100% private business use >> 10% threshold → bonds lose tax-exempt status immediately upon closing

**Bond Indenture Mandatory Redemption:**
- Typical hospital bond indentures require extraordinary redemption upon events jeopardizing tax-exempt status (change of ownership from nonprofit to for-profit, private business use >10%)
- **Redemption timing:** Within 6 months of disqualifying event (acquisition closing)
- **Failure to redeem:** Retroactive loss of tax-exempt status (bondholders owe back taxes on interest received), bondholder lawsuits, SEC/MSRB enforcement

**Redemption Price:**
- **Make-whole call provision:** Compensates bondholders for lost future tax-exempt income (typical premium 102-105% of principal)
- **Assumed redemption:** $420M × 102% = **$428.4M**
- **Make-whole premium:** $8.4M (compensates for 22 years lost tax-exempt interest at below-market rates)

**Financing Options:**

| Option | Structure | Cost |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **A: PE Equity** | National Healthcare Partners provides $428.4M cash at closing (increases total cash required from $2.4B to $2.828B) | $428.4M one-time |
| **B: Taxable Bond Refinancing (RECOMMENDED)** | Issue $420M taxable hospital revenue bonds at 6.5%, use proceeds to redeem tax-exempt bonds | $9.45M/year additional interest (6.5% - 4.25% = 2.25% × $420M) |
| **C: Seller Financing** | Mercy holds note for $428M | Not feasible (Ohio AG asset dedication requirements prohibit nonprofit providing seller financing) |

**Recommended Financing:** Option B (taxable bond refinancing)
- **Rationale:** Spreads cost over 22 years vs. $428M cash at closing; preserves PE equity for operations
- **Market context (January 2026):** BBB-rated corporate bonds yield 4-5% range; healthcare sector may price at premium due to regulatory/reimbursement risks; estimated taxable hospital bond rate **6.5%** for 30-year maturity
- **NPV of additional interest:** $9.45M/year × 22 years = $207.9M nominal; PV at 6.5% discount rate ≈ **$110M-$125M**

#### 4. Tax Minimization Strategies - Reduce Burden by 45-55% (Year 1)

**Strategy 1: IRC § 338(h)(10) Election (Asset Acquisition Tax Treatment)**

Current transaction structure is stock purchase (National Healthcare Partners buys Mercy stock). Stock purchases provide **no step-up in asset basis** (Mercy continues depreciating assets at historical basis).

**IRC § 338(h)(10) election** allows parties to jointly elect to treat stock purchase as asset acquisition for tax purposes only (legal form remains stock purchase):
- **Buyer benefit:** Step-up asset basis to $2.4B (purchase price allocated to assets at FMV)
- **Seller benefit:** Mercy (as nonprofit with $0 tax basis) pays $0 tax on deemed asset sale
- **One level of tax** (vs. double taxation in typical corporate asset sales)

**Purchase Price Allocation (IRC § 1060 Residual Method):**
- Land: $200M (non-depreciable)
- Buildings: $1,500M (39-year MACRS, annual depreciation $38.5M vs. $25M-$30M historical basis)
- Equipment: $300M (5-7 year MACRS, eligible for bonus depreciation)
- Inventory: $100M (currently deductible COGS)
- Intangibles (contracts, patient relationships): $200M (15-year amortization)
- Goodwill: $100M (15-year amortization)

**Tax benefits:**
- Additional depreciation/amortization: $50M-$100M Years 1-5
- Cumulative tax savings: $50M-$100M × 21% = **$10.5M-$21M** (5-year total)

**Trade-offs:**
- **Complexity:** Asset acquisition requires transfer of Medicare provider agreements, state licenses, Joint Commission accreditation, payer contracts (consent/assignment)
- **Transaction costs:** Higher legal/accounting fees
- **Timing:** May delay closing 60-90 days

**Solution:** § 338(h)(10) election provides asset acquisition tax benefits while maintaining stock purchase legal simplicity (same regulatory approvals as stock deal)

**Strategy 2: 100% Bonus Depreciation (IRC § 168(k))**

**One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) - January 2025:**
Permanently restored **100% bonus depreciation** for qualified property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025 (reversing prior phase-down schedule: 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, 0% thereafter)

**Qualifying property:**
- Tangible assets with useful life ≤20 years
- Equipment, machinery, improvements
- Both new and used assets (if not previously used by taxpayer, acquired in arm's-length transaction)

**Application to Mercy (if § 338(h)(10) election made):**
- **Medical equipment:** $300M allocated basis (MRI/CT/PET scanners, surgical equipment, lab equipment, IT systems)
- **Bonus depreciation:** 100% expensing in Year 1
- **Tax savings:** $300M × 21% federal rate = **$63M Year 1** (eliminates federal income tax Year 1, creates NOL carryforward)

**Strategic timing:** Close acquisition **after January 19, 2025** to qualify for permanent 100% bonus depreciation (expected closing Q2-Q3 2025 satisfies requirement)

**Strategy 3: Ohio Job Creation Tax Credit (JCTC)**

**Program:** CAT credit for businesses creating jobs and making capital investment in Ohio

**Eligibility:**
- Create ≥10 FTE within 3 years
- Pay wages ≥175% federal minimum wage ($12.69/hour)
- Generate ≥$660K annual payroll in first 3 years
- Make capital investment

**Credit terms:** 50-75% of CAT liability for 5-10 years (negotiated with JobsOhio)

**Mercy qualifications:**
- Job retention: 8,500 current employees
- Job creation: 150 new (50-bed expansion tower construction/operation)
- Wages: $50K-$75K average (far exceeds minimum)
- Capital investment: $125M tower construction

**Application strategy:**
Commit to: (1) Retain 8,500 employees × 5 years, (2) Create 150 net new jobs, (3) Invest $125M capital, (4) Total payroll >$400M annually

**Projected credit:**
- Mercy CAT liability: $4.66M/year
- Credit at 75% × 10 years: $4.66M × 75% = **$3.50M annual savings**
- Cumulative savings (10 years): $35M

**Strategy 4: REIT Lease-Back (Partial Implementation)**

**Structure:**
1. National Healthcare Partners forms REIT subsidiary
2. REIT purchases outpatient facilities ($100M of $600M total real estate)
3. REIT leases back to Mercy for FMV rent (triple-net: tenant pays taxes/insurance/maintenance)

**REIT tax benefits:**
- REITs distributing 90%+ income as dividends exempt from federal corporate income tax (IRC § 856)
- Avoids double taxation (corporate + shareholder levels)

**Operating company (Mercy) benefits:**
- **Rent deduction:** $7M-$10M annual rent (7-10% cap rate on $100M property) fully deductible under IRC § 162
- **No interest limitation:** Unlike interest (IRC § 163(j) cap), rent has no deduction limit (other than reasonableness)

**Property tax implications:**
- REIT ownership generally taxable in Ohio (no blanket exemption)
- Potential assessment reduction if structured to avoid reassessment at higher FMV
- **Estimated savings:** $1.5M-$2M/year (vs. potential reassessment at proportion of $2.4B enterprise value)

**Concerns:**
- Recent research: Hospitals that sold buildings to REITs 5× more likely to close or file bankruptcy
- Long-term triple-net leases with annual escalators reduce financial flexibility
- Tenant responsible for maintenance/improvements but landlord may restrict renovations

**Recommendation:** REIT lease-back for **outpatient facilities only** ($100M of $600M, testing structure while retaining core hospital campus ownership); provides $1.5M-$2M annual tax savings while mitigating operational risks

**Strategy 5: Charitable Contributions (Deductible Charity Care)**

**IRC § 170(b)(2) limit:** Corporations deduct charitable contributions up to 10% of taxable income; effective 2026, new 1% floor (contributions deductible only to extent exceeding 1% of taxable income, capped at 10%)

**Mercy charity care (current):** $45M annually (free/discounted care, 200-400% FPL sliding scale)

**Post-conversion structure:**
- Donate funds to separate 501(c)(3) charitable foundation
- Foundation uses funds to pay for qualifying patient care
- Mercy provides care, bills foundation at cost

**Limitation calculation:**
- Taxable income (before charitable deduction): ~$150M
- 1% floor: $150M × 1% = $1.5M (contributions below not deductible)
- 10% ceiling: $150M × 10% = $15M (maximum deductible)
- Deductible amount: $45M - $1.5M = $43.5M, capped at $15M = **$15M deductible**
- Excess: $30M (carries forward 5 years, subject to 10% annual limitation)

**Tax savings:**
- Federal: $15M × 21% = **$3.15M/year**
- State: Minimal (CAT is gross receipts tax, unaffected by charitable deductions)

**Alternative:** Reduce charity care to $10M-$15M (within 10% limit, typical for for-profit hospitals)

**Recommendation:** Continue $45M charity care (maintain community reputation/payer relationships), structure as contributions to 501(c)(3) foundation, deduct $15M annually, carry forward $30M excess

**Combined Tax Impact Summary:**

**Year 1 (With All Strategies):**

| Tax | Base | Strategy | Savings | Net |
|-----|------|----------|---------|-----|
| Federal income tax | $15.12M | Bonus depreciation $63M | ($15.12M) | $0 |
| Ohio CAT | $4.66M | JCTC 75% | ($3.50M) | $1.16M |
| Ohio property tax | $10.80M | REIT partial | ($1.50M) | $9.30M |
| Ohio sales tax | $5.85M | None | $0 | $5.85M |
| **TOTAL** | **$36.43M** | | **($20.12M)** | **$16.31M** |

**Savings:** 55% reduction (Year 1)

**Years 2-10 (With Strategies, After Bonus Depreciation Expires):**

| Tax | Base | Strategy | Savings | Net |
|-----|------|----------|---------|-----|
| Federal income tax | $15.12M | Charitable contributions | ($3.15M) | $11.97M |
| Ohio CAT | $4.66M | JCTC 75% (Years 2-10) | ($3.50M) | $1.16M |
| Ohio property tax | $10.80M | REIT partial | ($1.50M) | $9.30M |
| Ohio sales tax | $5.85M | None | $0 | $5.85M |
| **TOTAL** | **$36.43M** | | **($8.15M)** | **$28.28M** |

**Savings:** 22% reduction (Years 2-10)

**Net Income Impact (With Tax Minimization):**
- Current net income (tax-exempt): $72M
- Less: Taxes Year 1: ($16.31M)
- Less: Bond refinancing interest: ($9.45M)
- **Post-conversion net income Year 1:** $46.24M (36% reduction vs. 64% without planning)
- **Years 2-10 net income:** $37.0M-$41.0M (43-49% reduction vs. 64% without planning)

#### 5. Private Inurement Risk - STARK/AKS Violations Threaten Retroactive Revocation

**Cross-Domain Finding:**
The Healthcare Regulatory Compliance Report identifies STARK Law and Anti-Kickback Statute violations:
- **Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC** (ASC): 50% Mercy + 50% owned by 12 gastroenterologists (8 employed by Mercy)
- **Financial relationship:** Employed physicians receive ownership distributions ($35K annually) AND refer DHS (colonoscopies/endoscopies) to ASC
- **STARK violation:** No exception applies (in-office ancillary requires same building, whole hospital requires hospital not ASC)
- **AKS violation:** Remuneration (distributions) paid to induce referrals (85% of ASC cases from owners); safe harbor not satisfied

**Connection to Private Inurement:**
IRC § 501(c)(3) prohibits "no part of the net earnings...inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual." Conduct that violates STARK/AKS can also constitute private inurement:
- Physician-owners receive $280K/year total distributions ($35K × 8 physicians)
- Distributions based on referral volume/value (85% cases from owners)
- Mercy (exempt organization) enables arrangement by employing physicians and allowing competing ASC ownership

**IRS Position:**
IRS has warned hospitals that joint ventures fostering kickback schemes may jeopardize tax-exempt status. Kickback payments constitute private inurement because physician-owners receive excess benefit at expense of charitable organization's exempt purposes.

**Retroactive Revocation Risk:**
If IRS discovers STARK/AKS violations (through OIG investigation, qui tam whistleblower, audit):
- **Retroactive 501(c)(3) revocation** for years ASC operated (2016-2024 = 8 years)
- **Back taxes:** 21% × 8 years × $72M average net income = **$120M**
- **Penalties/interest:** $30M-$50M (late payment penalty 0.5%/month up to 25%, interest ~6-8%)
- **Total exposure:** $150M-$170M

**Probability:**
- **10-15%** if violations undisclosed, no government investigation
- **60-80%** if OIG investigates STARK/AKS and refers to IRS, or qui tam whistleblower files FCA lawsuit

**Timing Considerations:**
- **Pre-acquisition discovery:** If IRS revokes status BEFORE closing, Mercy owes $120M+ back taxes, reducing enterprise value → purchase price adjustment or escrow
- **Post-acquisition discovery:** National Healthcare Partners inherits $120M tax liability as successor to Mercy's obligations

**Remediation Impact:**
If STARK/AKS violations remediated BEFORE conversion:
- **Option A:** Unwind ASC (Mercy buys physician 50% for FMV $1.5M-$2M)
- **Option B:** OIG voluntary disclosure (settle $2M-$5M + Corporate Integrity Agreement)

**Remediation benefit:**
- Demonstrates good faith efforts to correct private inurement
- IRS less likely to pursue retroactive revocation
- **Probability reduction:** 10-15% → 2-5%
- **Exposure reduction:** $120M+ → <$10M

**CRITICAL RECOMMENDATION:** Remediate STARK/AKS violations IMMEDIATELY (within 90 days, before definitive agreement execution) to eliminate $120M+ IRS retroactive revocation risk.

### Finding Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| 501(c)(3) status loss automatic upon conversion | **HIGH** | IRC § 501(c)(3) statutory text, IRS guidance (Rev. Rul. 69-545), legal precedent |

### Recommendations (Priority Order)

**IMMEDIATE (Within 30 Days):**
1. Engage Big 4 tax advisors (PwC/EY/Deloitte/KPMG) to model § 338(h)(10) election and bonus depreciation impact
2. Remediate STARK/AKS ASC violations (unwind or OIG voluntary disclosure) to eliminate $120M retroactive revocation risk
3. Secure bond redemption financing commitment ($428M PE equity or taxable bond underwriting)
4. Notify Ohio Attorney General (Ohio Rev. Code § 109.34 approval required)

**PRE-CLOSING (60-120 Days):**
5. File Ohio Job Creation Tax Credit application ($3.5M/year × 10 years = $35M savings)
6. Negotiate § 338(h)(10) election in Stock Purchase Agreement (step-up basis to $2.4B)
7. Structure REIT lease-back for outpatient facilities only ($100M partial implementation)
8. Establish 501(c)(3) charitable foundation for $15M annual deductible charity care

**AT CLOSING:**
9. Execute tax elections (IRS Form 8023 for § 338(h)(10), file final Form 990, begin Form 1120 filings)
10. Redeem tax-exempt bonds ($428.4M from PE equity or taxable bond proceeds)
11. Pay Ohio property tax recapture ($43.2M one-time)

**POST-CLOSING (Within 12 Months):**
12. Monitor Ohio JCTC compliance (quarterly employment reports, investment verification)
13. File annual tax returns with minimization strategies (bonus depreciation Year 1, charitable contributions, JCTC credit)

**Expected After-Tax Returns:**
- **Year 1 net income:** $46.2M (with tax planning) vs. $26.1M (without) = +77% improvement
- **Years 2-10 net income:** $37M-$41M (with planning) vs. $26M-$36M (without) = +42-50%
- **10-year cumulative taxes:** $754M (with planning) vs. $835M (without) = $81M savings
- **Transaction IRR impact:** +300-500 basis points estimated improvement

### Outstanding Questions

1. What is exact bond redemption price? (Obtain indenture from EMMA to verify 102% vs. other premium)
2. Will Ohio counties reassess property at $2.4B enterprise value? (Each $100M increase = $1.8M/year additional tax)
3. Are there additional tax-exempt bonds outstanding? (Search EMMA for all Mercy bonds)
4. What is Mercy's actual tax basis in assets? (Obtain fixed asset ledger to quantify § 338(h)(10) step-up benefit)
5. Can National Healthcare Partners use Mercy NOLs? (IRC § 382 limitation on post-ownership change NOL utilization)

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Mercy Regional Health System Tax-Exempt Status

**501(c)(3) Determination:**
- **Original IRS determination:** Issued 1952 (Mercy Regional Hospital recognized as charitable organization under IRC § 501(c)(3))¹
- **Confirmed 1998:** When Mercy secularized from Catholic (Sisters of Mercy) to non-sectarian non-profit organization
- **Organizational test (IRC § 501(c)(3)(i)):** Articles of Incorporation state exclusively charitable purposes (providing healthcare to community regardless of ability to pay)²
- **Operational test (IRC § 501(c)(3)(ii)):** Actually operates for exempt purposes through community benefit, charity care, and no private inurement to individuals³

**Community Benefit Reporting (IRS Form 990 Schedule H, FY2024):**
- **Charity care:** $45M (unreimbursed cost of free/discounted care to patients unable to pay, financial need policy: 200% FPL free, 200-400% FPL sliding scale)
- **Medicaid shortfall:** $120M (Medicaid reimbursement at 85% of cost, shortfall counted as community benefit)
- **Community health programs:** $8M (health fairs, smoking cessation classes, diabetes education, community clinics)
- **Health professions education:** $27M (GME resident training costs not fully covered by Medicare GME payments)
- **Research:** $2M (clinical trials, research studies)
- **Total community benefit:** $202M (11.2% of $1.8B operating expenses)⁴
- **IRS guideline:** 5-10% community benefit demonstrates charitable purposes; Mercy's 11.2% exceeds this threshold⁵

### B. Tax-Exempt Bond Financing

**Mercy Northwest Hospital - $420M Tax-Exempt Revenue Bonds:**
- **Issuer:** Ohio Hospital Facilities Authority
- **Issue date:** 2016 (financed construction of Mercy Northwest, opened 2019)
- **Maturity:** 2046 (30-year bonds)
- **Interest rate:** 4.25% (fixed rate, bondholders receive interest exempt from federal income tax)
- **IRC § 141 private activity test:** Bonds must meet public use test; >10% private business use violates tax exemption⁶
- **Current compliance:** Mercy Northwest owned/operated by Mercy (non-profit 501(c)(3)), no private business use, hospital serves general public⁷
- **Post-issuance compliance:** Annual certifications to bond trustee that bond proceeds used for qualified purposes, facility used for exempt purposes, no private business use >10%⁸

### C. Proposed Transaction Structure

**Acquisition by National Healthcare Partners LLC:**
- **Acquirer:** For-profit, PE-backed healthcare services company
- **Purchase price:** $2.4B
- **Structure:** Stock acquisition (National Healthcare Partners buys Mercy stock, Mercy becomes taxable subsidiary of for-profit parent)
- **Expected closing:** Q2-Q3 2025

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Loss of 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status

#### 1. Automatic Revocation Upon For-Profit Conversion

**Legal Standard:**
IRC § 501(c)(3) requires that an organization be "organized and operated exclusively for" charitable purposes, and that "no part of the net earnings...inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."⁹ When a for-profit entity acquires a non-profit hospital, the acquired entity no longer meets these requirements.

**For-Profit Ownership Triggers Loss of Exemption:**
When National Healthcare Partners (a for-profit PE-backed entity) acquires Mercy, the hospital system will no longer operate "exclusively" for charitable purposes. Instead, it will operate for the benefit of private shareholders (the PE fund investors), which constitutes private inurement prohibited under IRC § 501(c)(3).¹⁰

**Revocation Process:**
The IRS does not "automatically" revoke 501(c)(3) status upon ownership change, but the organization's tax-exempt status terminates by operation of law when it ceases to meet the requirements.¹¹ National Healthcare Partners must:
- Notify the IRS of the change in tax status
- File final Form 990 as a tax-exempt organization
- Begin filing Form 1120 (U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return) as a taxable C corporation¹²

**Effective Date:**
The revocation is effective on the date of acquisition closing (the date ownership transfers to the for-profit entity).¹³

#### 2. Ohio Attorney General Approval Required

**Ohio Statutory Requirement:**
Ohio Revised Code § 109.34 requires nonprofit health care entities to obtain written approval from the Ohio Attorney General before entering into any transaction that transfers at least 20% of assets within a 24-month period.¹⁴

**Asset Dedication Doctrine:**
Under Ohio law, healthcare nonprofits hold their assets in trust for the benefit of the public. When converting to for-profit status, the nonprofit must ensure that charitable assets are appropriately valued and dedicated to continuing charitable purposes.¹⁵

**Richmond Heights Hospital Precedent:**
The Ohio Supreme Court approved a nonprofit hospital sale but imposed strict conditions requiring proceeds be used exclusively for charitable purposes and the hospital maintain commitment to providing charity care in the community.¹⁶ This precedent suggests the Ohio AG will scrutinize:
- Fair market valuation of Mercy's assets ($2.4B purchase price)
- Use of proceeds (if any remain with charitable entity)
- Continuing community benefit obligations post-conversion

### B. Federal Income Tax Consequences

#### 1. Corporate Income Tax Rate (IRC § 11)

**Flat 21% Rate:**
IRC § 11(a) imposes a tax on the taxable income of every corporation at a rate of 21%.¹⁷ This flat rate replaced the previous graduated rate structure (maximum 35%) effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.¹⁸

**Application to Mercy:**
- **Current status:** Mercy pays $0 federal income tax as a 501(c)(3) exempt organization
- **Post-conversion:** Mercy will pay 21% federal income tax on taxable income
- **Mercy net income (FY2024):** $72M (after depreciation and interest expense)
- **Estimated federal income tax:** $72M × 21% = **$15.12M annually**

#### 2. Deductions Available to For-Profit Hospital

**Operating Expense Deductions:**
As a taxable C corporation, Mercy can deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses under IRC § 162, including:¹⁹
- Employee compensation (salaries, wages, benefits for 8,500 employees)
- Interest expense on debt (bond interest on $420M bonds is deductible)²⁰
- Depreciation and amortization (buildings, equipment, intangibles)
- Medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, utilities, insurance premiums
- Marketing, administrative, and operational costs

**Depreciation:**
Mercy can continue to deduct depreciation on existing assets using their current tax basis and recovery periods under IRC § 168:²¹
- Buildings: 39-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)
- Equipment: 5-7 year MACRS for medical equipment
- Land: Not depreciable

**Interest Expense Limitation (IRC § 163(j)):**
For tax years beginning after 2017, business interest expense deductions are limited to:
- Business interest income, PLUS
- 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI)²²

For large hospital systems with substantial debt like Mercy ($420M bonds), this limitation may cap interest deductions. However, the $18M annual bond interest ($420M × 4.25%) represents only 1% of Mercy's $1.8B net revenue, so the limitation likely does not apply.

#### 3. Step-Up in Asset Basis (Asset vs. Stock Acquisition)

**Stock Acquisition (No Step-Up):**
If National Healthcare Partners purchases Mercy stock (current transaction structure), there is **no step-up** in the tax basis of Mercy's underlying assets. Mercy continues to depreciate assets using their historical tax basis.²³

**Asset Acquisition Alternative (Step-Up Available):**
If the transaction were structured as an asset acquisition, National Healthcare Partners would receive a step-up in asset basis to fair market value ($2.4B purchase price allocated to assets), allowing:²⁴
- Higher depreciation deductions on stepped-up building basis
- Immediate expensing or accelerated depreciation on equipment (see Section IV.D below)
- Amortization of goodwill and intangibles over 15 years under IRC § 197²⁵

**IRC § 338(h)(10) Election:**
National Healthcare Partners could make a joint IRC § 338(h)(10) election with Mercy to treat the stock purchase as an asset acquisition for tax purposes only (legal form remains stock purchase).²⁶ This provides:
- Buyer benefit: Step-up in asset basis to $2.4B
- Seller consideration: Mercy (as a non-profit) has $0 tax basis in its assets and pays no tax on the deemed asset sale
- One level of tax (vs. double taxation in typical corporate asset sales)²⁷

#### 4. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax

**15% Minimum Tax (IRC § 55):**
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on corporations with average annual adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) exceeding $1 billion over a three-year period.²⁸

**Application to Mercy:**
Mercy's net patient revenue of $1.8B exceeds the $1 billion threshold, but AFSI is based on financial statement income (book income), not gross revenue. Mercy's net income of $72M (FY2024) is well below the threshold, so **CAMT does not apply**.

**Estimated Annual Federal Income Tax: $15M**

### C. State Tax Consequences (Ohio)

#### 1. Ohio Commercial Activity Tax (CAT)

**Tax Structure:**
Ohio's Commercial Activity Tax is imposed at a rate of 2.6 mills (0.26%) on business gross receipts in excess of the exclusion threshold.²⁹ The CAT is a gross receipts tax levied on the entirety of a company's Ohio business receipts, without deductions for compensation, costs of goods sold, or other expenses.³⁰

**Exemptions:**
Nonprofit organizations are excepted from the CAT.³¹ As a 501(c)(3) organization, Mercy currently pays $0 CAT. Upon conversion to for-profit status, this exemption terminates.

**Exclusion Threshold (2025-2026):**
- Starting in 2025, businesses with taxable gross receipts of **$6 million or less** are exempt from the CAT³²
- Mercy's net patient revenue ($1.8B) far exceeds this threshold

**Application to Mercy:**
- **Gross receipts (net revenue):** $1.8B (FY2024, after contractual adjustments)
- **CAT calculation:** ($1.8B - $6M exclusion) × 0.26% = $1,794M × 0.0026 = **$4.66M annually**

#### 2. Ohio Corporate Franchise Tax

**Historical Context:**
Ohio previously imposed a corporate franchise tax based on net income, but the CAT largely replaced the franchise tax for most entities after 2005.³³ The corporate franchise tax is now minimal or zero for most corporations subject to the CAT.

**Estimated Ohio State Taxes: $4.7M annually (CAT)**

#### 3. Ohio Property Tax

**Current Exemption:**
Ohio Revised Code § 5709.121 provides that property "used exclusively for charitable purposes" by charitable institutions is exempt from real property taxation.³⁴ Property must "belong to" a charitable institution to qualify for exemption.³⁵

**Loss of Exemption Upon For-Profit Conversion:**
When Mercy converts to for-profit ownership:
- Property no longer "belongs to" a charitable institution³⁶
- Property is no longer used "exclusively for charitable purposes" (now operated for profit/shareholder benefit)
- Exemption terminates automatically

**Ohio Supreme Court Precedent:**
The Ohio Supreme Court has held that property owned by a for-profit entity does not qualify for charitable exemption, even if leased to and used by a charitable tenant for charitable purposes.³⁷ Ownership by the charitable organization itself is required.

**Mercy Real Estate:**
- **4 hospital campuses:** Mercy Regional Medical Center (Columbus), Mercy Northwest (Dublin), Mercy East (Reynoldsburg), Mercy South (Lancaster)
- **86 outpatient facilities:** 45 primary care clinics, 18 specialty clinics, 8 imaging centers, 3 ASCs, 12 urgent care locations
- **Estimated assessed value:** $600M (hospital buildings $400M + outpatient facilities $100M + land $100M)

**Property Tax Calculation:**
- **Effective property tax rate (Ohio):** 1.5-2.0% of assessed value (varies by county)³⁸
- **Franklin County rate:** Approximately 1.8%
- **Annual property tax:** $600M × 1.8% = **$10.8M annually**

**Reassessment Risk:**
The $2.4B acquisition price suggests the fair market value of Mercy's total enterprise value exceeds the current $600M assessed value of real property. However, property tax is based on assessed value (not purchase price), and Ohio assesses real property separately from business enterprise value. The county auditor may reassess property following the ownership change, potentially increasing the assessed value and corresponding tax liability.

**Recapture Provision:**
Ohio Rev. Code § 5709.12 requires that when exempt property is sold, the property sold "shall be restored to the tax list for the year following the year of the sale and a charge shall be levied against the sold property in an amount equal to the tax savings during the four tax years preceding the year the property is placed on the tax list."³⁹ This means Mercy may owe:
- **4 years of retroactive property taxes** (approximately $10.8M × 4 = $43.2M one-time charge)

#### 4. Ohio Sales Tax

**Current Exemption:**
Ohio Revised Code § 5739.02(B)(12) exempts from sales tax "sales to offices administering one or more hospital facilities exempt under section 140.08 of the Revised Code" and "sales to...organizations exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code."⁴⁰

**Loss of Exemption:**
Upon conversion to for-profit status, Mercy is no longer:
- A 501(c)(3) organization
- Administering a hospital facility "exempt under section 140.08" (which incorporates 501(c)(3) status)

Therefore, the sales tax exemption terminates, and Mercy must pay Ohio sales tax on taxable purchases.

**Taxable Purchases:**
- **Medical equipment:** MRI/CT/X-ray machines, surgical instruments, IT hardware
- **Supplies:** Medical/surgical supplies, pharmaceuticals (non-340B), office supplies
- **Services:** Consulting services, maintenance contracts (if involving tangible personal property)
- **Annual purchases:** Estimated $200M-$300M

**Non-Taxable Items:**
- Prescription drugs for resale to patients (exempt under Ohio Rev. Code § 5739.02)
- Certain medical equipment exemptions (prosthetic devices, durable medical equipment for home use)⁴¹
- Services not involving tangible personal property

**Taxable Portion:**
Approximately 30-40% of purchases subject to sales tax, estimated at $60M-$120M taxable purchases annually.

**Sales Tax Rate:**
- **Ohio state rate:** 5.75%
- **Local rates (county/transit):** 0.75% to 1.25% (Franklin County 0.75% = 6.5% total)⁴²
- **Average combined rate:** 6.5%

**Sales Tax Calculation:**
- Mid-range estimate: $90M taxable purchases × 6.5% = **$5.85M annually**
- Conservative estimate: $60M × 6.5% = $3.9M
- High estimate: $120M × 6.5% = $7.8M

**Estimated Ohio Property Tax: $10.8M annually + $43.2M one-time recapture**
**Estimated Ohio Sales Tax: $5.9M annually**

### D. Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption Requirements

#### 1. IRC § 141 Private Activity Bond Test

**10% Private Business Use Test:**
IRC § 141(b)(1) provides that a bond is a "private activity bond" if both:
- More than 10% of the proceeds are used for any private business use, AND
- More than 10% of the debt service is secured by or derived from private business property⁴³

**Private Business Use Defined:**
Private business use means use in a trade or business of a nongovernmental person (including for-profit corporations).⁴⁴ When Mercy converts from 501(c)(3) non-profit to a for-profit subsidiary of National Healthcare Partners:
- **100% of Mercy Northwest Hospital** becomes private business use (entire facility operated by for-profit entity)
- The bonds immediately fail the 10% private business use test
- The bonds lose their tax-exempt status⁴⁵

**Modified Rules for 501(c)(3) Bonds:**
Qualified 501(c)(3) bonds receive special treatment under IRC § 145, which modifies the private activity bond tests. Under these modified rules, use by a 501(c)(3) organization in an activity related to its charitable purposes is treated as governmental use (not private business use).⁴⁶ However, this favorable treatment terminates when the organization ceases to qualify as a 501(c)(3) entity.

#### 2. Bond Indenture Call Provision

**Typical Change of Control Provisions:**
Tax-exempt hospital bond indentures typically require mandatory redemption upon events that jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the bonds, including:⁴⁷
- Change of ownership from non-profit to for-profit entity
- Failure to maintain 501(c)(3) status
- Private business use exceeding 10% of financed property
- Sale or lease of financed property to non-qualified persons

**Remedial Action Requirements:**
When a 501(c)(3) hospital engages in a deliberate action that causes private activity bond tests to be failed (such as converting to for-profit), the organization must cure that action using prescribed remedial actions, which generally consist of redemption or defeasance of bonds.⁴⁸

**Mandatory Redemption Timing:**
Bond documents typically require redemption within 6 months of the disqualifying event (the closing of the acquisition).⁴⁹ Failure to redeem timely results in:
- Retroactive loss of tax-exempt status (bondholders owe back taxes on interest received)
- Bondholder lawsuits against issuer and borrower
- Potential SEC/MSRB enforcement action

#### 3. Redemption Price and Make-Whole Premium

**Extraordinary Redemption Provision:**
Tax-exempt bonds commonly include extraordinary optional redemption provisions permitting early par redemptions upon the occurrence of certain specified extraordinary events, such as a "tax call" when interest on the bonds becomes taxable.⁵⁰

**Make-Whole Call Premium:**
While par redemption (100% of principal) is common for tax calls, some bond indentures require a make-whole premium to compensate bondholders for lost future tax-exempt income streams. The make-whole premium typically ranges from **102% to 105%** of principal.⁵¹

**Mercy Northwest Bonds - Assumed 102% Redemption:**
- **Principal amount:** $420M
- **Redemption price:** $420M × 102% = **$428.4M**
- **Make-whole premium:** $8.4M (compensates bondholders for loss of 22 years of tax-exempt interest at below-market rates)

#### 4. Financing the Redemption

**Option A: PE Equity Contribution**
National Healthcare Partners provides $428.4M as part of acquisition financing (increases total cash required at closing from $2.4B to $2.828B).

**Option B: Refinancing with Taxable Bonds**
Issue $420M taxable hospital revenue bonds to redeem existing tax-exempt bonds:
- **Taxable bond rate (estimated):** 6.5% (30-year BBB-rated hospital revenue bonds)⁵²
- **Current tax-exempt rate:** 4.25%
- **Rate differential:** 2.25% (225 basis points)
- **Additional annual interest:** $420M × 2.25% = **$9.45M annually**

**BBB Credit Rating Assumption:**
Hospital systems with $1-2B revenue typically carry BBB/BBB+ credit ratings from Moody's and S&P. Mercy's financial metrics support this rating:
- Operating margin: 5.3% ($95M operating income / $1.8B net revenue)
- Debt service coverage ratio: Estimated 2.5× to 3.0× (adequate for investment-grade rating)

**Market Context (January 2026):**
- ICE BofA BBB US Corporate Index Effective Yield: 4% to mid-5% range⁵³
- Healthcare sector bonds may price at premium to general BBB corporates due to regulatory/reimbursement risks
- Estimated taxable hospital bond rate: **6.5%** for 30-year maturity

**NPV of Additional Interest Expense:**
- **Remaining term:** 22 years (2046 maturity - 2024 current)
- **Additional interest:** $9.45M annually × 22 years = $207.9M nominal
- **Present value (discounted at 6.5%):** Approximately **$110M to $125M NPV**

**Option C: Seller Financing**
Mercy (or successor charitable entity) holds promissory note for $428M, payable by National Healthcare Partners over time. However, as a non-profit converting assets to charitable use, Mercy cannot provide seller financing (must receive full cash consideration to satisfy Ohio AG asset dedication requirements).

**Recommended Financing:** Option B (refinance with taxable bonds), which spreads the cost over 22 years and preserves PE equity for operations.

### E. Tax Minimization Strategies

#### 1. Asset Acquisition vs. Stock Acquisition

**Current Transaction Structure:**
Stock purchase (National Healthcare Partners buys Mercy stock, Mercy continues as legal entity with for-profit owner).

**Tax Consequences:**
- **No step-up in asset basis:** Mercy continues to depreciate assets using historical tax basis
- **Limited tax benefits:** Cannot capitalize on accelerated depreciation or bonus depreciation for existing assets

**Asset Acquisition Alternative:**
National Healthcare Partners buys Mercy's assets (hospitals, real estate, equipment, inventory, contracts) rather than stock.

**Tax Benefits of Asset Acquisition:**
- **Step-up in asset basis:** Purchase price ($2.4B) allocated to acquired assets at fair market value⁵⁴
- **Allocation methodology:** IRC § 1060 residual method allocates purchase price to asset classes in following order:⁵⁵
  1. Cash and cash equivalents
  2. Marketable securities and certificates of deposit
  3. Accounts receivable and other current assets
  4. Inventory
  5. Buildings, land, and equipment
  6. Intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
  7. Goodwill and going concern value (residual)

**Estimated Allocation for Mercy:**
- Land: $200M (non-depreciable)
- Buildings: $1,500M (39-year MACRS)
- Equipment: $300M (5-7 year MACRS, eligible for bonus depreciation)
- Inventory: $100M (currently deductible as cost of goods sold)
- Intangibles (contracts, patient relationships, non-compete): $200M (15-year IRC § 197 amortization)
- Goodwill: $100M (15-year IRC § 197 amortization)

**Accelerated Depreciation Benefits:**
- **Buildings:** $1,500M / 39 years = $38.5M annual depreciation (vs. approximately $25M-$30M under historical basis)
- **Equipment:** $300M eligible for bonus depreciation (see Section IV.E.2 below)
- **Intangibles:** $300M ($200M intangibles + $100M goodwill) / 15 years = $20M annual amortization

**Estimated Tax Savings (Years 1-5):**
- Additional depreciation/amortization: $50M-$100M over 5 years
- Tax savings: $50M-$100M × 21% federal rate = **$10.5M-$21M cumulative tax savings**

**Trade-Offs:**
- **Complexity:** Asset acquisition requires transfer of:
  - Medicare provider agreements (CMS change of ownership approval for 4 hospitals)
  - State hospital licenses (Ohio Department of Health approval)
  - Joint Commission accreditation
  - Payer contracts (may require consent/assignment)
  - Vendor contracts
- **Transaction costs:** Legal, accounting, and filing fees higher for asset acquisitions
- **Timing:** Asset transfers may delay closing by 60-90 days

**IRC § 338(h)(10) Election (Hybrid Approach):**
Make joint election to treat stock purchase as asset acquisition for tax purposes only:⁵⁶
- **Legal form:** Stock purchase (simpler regulatory approvals)
- **Tax treatment:** Asset purchase (step-up in basis)
- **Seller consideration:** Mercy (as non-profit) has $0 tax basis, pays $0 tax on deemed asset sale
- **Buyer benefit:** Full step-up to $2.4B allocated basis

**Recommendation:** Pursue IRC § 338(h)(10) election to obtain asset acquisition tax benefits while maintaining stock purchase legal simplicity.

#### 2. Accelerated Depreciation (IRC § 168(k) Bonus Depreciation)

**One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) - January 2025:**
The OBBBA permanently restored **100% bonus depreciation** for qualified property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025.⁵⁷

**Qualifying Property:**
- Tangible assets with useful life of 20 years or less
- Includes equipment, machinery, and certain improvements
- Both new and used assets qualify (if not previously used by taxpayer and acquired in arm's-length transaction)⁵⁸

**Application to Mercy Equipment:**
If Mercy is acquired via asset acquisition (or § 338(h)(10) election) after January 19, 2025:
- **Medical equipment:** $300M allocated basis (MRI/CT/PET scanners, surgical equipment, lab equipment, IT systems)
- **Bonus depreciation:** 100% expensing in Year 1
- **Tax savings:** $300M × 21% federal rate = **$63M tax savings in Year 1**

**Phased Down Rates for Pre-OBBBA Property:**
Property acquired before January 20, 2025 follows the prior phase-down schedule:⁵⁹
- 2025: 40% bonus depreciation
- 2026: 20% bonus depreciation
- 2027+: 0% (expires)

**Strategic Timing:**
Close acquisition **after January 19, 2025** to qualify for permanent 100% bonus depreciation (expected closing Q2-Q3 2025 satisfies this requirement).

#### 3. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Lease-Back Structure

**Structure Overview:**
1. National Healthcare Partners forms REIT subsidiary
2. REIT purchases Mercy hospital real estate for $600M (buildings + land)
3. REIT leases property back to Mercy (operating company) for fair market value rent
4. Mercy operates hospitals as tenant; REIT owns real estate⁶⁰

**REIT Tax Benefits:**
- **Corporate tax exemption:** REITs that distribute 90%+ of income as dividends are exempt from federal corporate income tax on distributed income (IRC § 856)⁶¹
- **Pass-through structure:** Avoids double taxation at corporate and shareholder levels⁶²
- **Depreciation benefits:** REIT depreciates building basis over 39 years, reducing taxable income before distribution

**Operating Company (Mercy) Benefits:**
- **Rent deduction:** Rent payments to REIT are fully deductible operating expenses under IRC § 162⁶³
- **No interest deduction limitation:** Unlike interest expense (subject to IRC § 163(j) limitation), rent expense has no cap (other than reasonableness)
- **FMV rent:** $600M real estate × 7-10% capitalization rate = $42M-$60M annual rent (deductible)

**Property Tax Implications (Ohio):**
- **REIT ownership generally taxable:** Ohio does not provide blanket property tax exemptions for REIT-owned property⁶⁴
- **Potential assessment reduction:** Carefully structured sale-leaseback may avoid reassessment at higher FMV (maintain $600M assessed value vs. potential increase based on $2.4B enterprise value)
- **Triple-net lease:** Mercy (tenant) pays property taxes, insurance, and maintenance under lease terms

**Estimated Property Tax Savings:**
- If REIT ownership avoids reassessment: $0 savings (still pay $10.8M on $600M assessed value)
- If structured to challenge assessed value: Potential $3M-$5M savings through valuation appeals

**Concerns and Risks:**
- **Recent research:** Hospitals that sold buildings to REITs were more than 5× as likely to close or file for bankruptcy as hospitals that kept their real estate⁶⁵
- **Lease obligations:** Long-term triple-net leases (typically 10-15 years) with annual escalators create fixed obligations that reduce financial flexibility⁶⁶
- **Capital expenditures:** Tenant responsible for maintenance and improvements, but landlord (REIT) may restrict major renovations

**Recommendation:** Consider REIT lease-back for outpatient facilities ($100M of $600M total real estate) to test structure while retaining ownership of core hospital campuses ($500M). Provides rent deduction benefits ($7M-$10M annual rent on $100M property, fully deductible = $1.5M-$2M annual tax savings) while mitigating operational risks.

#### 4. Ohio Job Creation Tax Credit

**Program Overview:**
The Ohio Job Creation Tax Credit (JCTC) provides a Commercial Activity Tax (CAT) credit for businesses that expand or locate in Ohio, creating new jobs and making capital investment.⁶⁷

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Create at least 10 new full-time equivalent employees within 3 years
- Pay wages at least 175% of federal minimum wage ($12.69/hour or approximately $26,400 annually)
- Generate at least $660,000 in total annual payroll during first 3 years
- Make capital investment in Ohio facilities⁶⁸

**Credit Terms:**
- **Credit amount:** 50-75% of CAT liability for 5-10 years⁶⁹
- **Negotiated with JobsOhio:** Specific percentage and duration depend on job creation, payroll, and investment commitments

**Mercy's Qualifications:**
- **Job retention:** 8,500 current employees (commit to maintain)
- **Job creation:** 150 new employees for 50-bed expansion tower (construction and operation)
- **Wages:** Average hospital wages $50,000-$75,000 (far exceeds 175% federal minimum wage)
- **Capital investment:** $125M expansion tower construction (far exceeds minimum requirements)

**Application Strategy:**
Submit JCTC application to JobsOhio committing to:
- Retain 8,500 existing employees for 5 years
- Create 150 net new jobs (tower expansion + growth)
- Invest $125M in capital improvements (tower + equipment)
- Total payroll exceeding $400M annually (8,650 employees × $50K average)

**Projected Credit:**
- **Mercy CAT liability:** $4.66M annually (see Section IV.C.1)
- **Credit at 75% for 10 years:** $4.66M × 75% = **$3.5M annual savings**
- **Cumulative savings (10 years):** $35M

**Alternative: Job Retention Tax Credit (JRTC):**
For larger employers (1,000+ employees at project site) retaining significant workforces.⁷⁰ Mercy qualifies with 8,500 employees. JRTC provides similar CAT credits for job retention commitments.

**Recommendation:** Apply for JCTC immediately upon transaction announcement, emphasizing job retention (8,500 employees), job creation (150 new), and capital investment ($125M). Target 75% CAT credit for 10 years = $3.5M annual savings.

#### 5. Charitable Contributions (Deductible Charity Care)

**IRC § 170(b)(2) Corporate Deduction Limit:**
Corporations can deduct charitable contributions up to 10% of taxable income.⁷¹ For taxable years beginning after 2025, a new **1% floor** applies: contributions are deductible only to the extent they exceed 1% of taxable income, subject to the 10% ceiling.⁷²

**Mercy's Current Charity Care:**
- **Charity care (FY2024):** $45M (free/discounted care to patients unable to pay, 200% FPL free, 200-400% FPL sliding scale)
- **Medicaid shortfall:** $120M (not deductible as charitable contribution; this is a business loss from below-cost reimbursement)

**Post-Conversion Deductibility:**
As a for-profit entity, Mercy can structure charity care as deductible charitable contributions by:
- Donating funds to separate 501(c)(3) charitable foundation
- Foundation uses funds to pay for free/discounted care for qualifying patients
- Mercy provides care and bills foundation at cost (or reduced rates)

**Limitation Calculation:**
- **Taxable income (before charitable deduction):** Approximately $150M ($72M net income + $45M charity care + depreciation/other adjustments)
- **1% floor (effective 2026):** $150M × 1% = $1.5M (contributions below this amount are not deductible)
- **10% ceiling:** $150M × 10% = $15M (maximum deductible contribution)
- **Deductible charity care:** $45M contributions - $1.5M floor = $43.5M, but capped at $15M ceiling = **$15M deductible**
- **Excess contribution:** $45M - $15M = $30M (non-deductible in current year)
- **Carryforward:** $30M excess carries forward up to 5 years, subject to 10% limitation each year⁷³

**Tax Savings:**
- **Deductible contribution:** $15M
- **Federal tax savings:** $15M × 21% = **$3.15M annually**
- **State tax savings:** Minimal (CAT is gross receipts tax, not affected by charitable deductions)

**Alternative Strategy - Reduce Charity Care:**
For-profit hospitals typically provide less charity care than non-profits. National Healthcare Partners may reduce charity care from $45M to $10M-$15M annually:
- Eliminates excess contributions above 10% limitation
- Reduces community benefit, but no longer required for tax-exemption
- Deductible amount: $10M-$15M (within 10% ceiling)
- Tax savings: $10M-$15M × 21% = $2.1M-$3.15M

**Recommendation:** Continue $45M annual charity care (maintain community reputation and payer relationships), structure as contributions to separate 501(c)(3) foundation, deduct $15M annually (maximum allowable), carry forward $30M excess over 5 years.

#### 6. Combined Tax Impact Summary

**Annual Tax Burden (No Tax Minimization Strategies):**

| Tax Category | Annual Amount |
|--------------|---------------|
| Federal income tax (21%) | $15.12M |
| Ohio CAT (0.26% gross receipts) | $4.66M |

---

**Annual Tax Burden (With Tax Minimization Strategies):**

| Tax Category | Base Amount | Strategy | Savings | Net Amount |
|--------------|-------------|----------|---------|------------|
| Federal income tax | $15.12M | § 338(h)(10) + bonus depreciation (Year 1) | ($63M) | $0 (Year 1)⁷⁴ |
| Federal income tax | $15.12M | Charitable contributions (Years 2-5) | ($3.15M) | $11.97M |
| Ohio CAT | $4.66M | Job creation tax credit (75%) | ($3.50M) | $1.16M |
| Ohio property tax | $10.80M | REIT lease-back (partial) | ($1.50M) | $9.30M |
| Ohio sales tax | $5.85M | No mitigation strategy | $0 | $5.85M |
| **TOTAL (Year 1)** | **$36.43M** | | **($68.15M)** | **$16.31M** |
| **TOTAL (Years 2-5)** | **$36.43M** | | **($8.15M)** | **$28.28M** |
| **TOTAL (Years 6-10)** | **$36.43M** | | **($5.00M)** | **$31.43M** |

**Notes:**
⁷⁴ Year 1 federal tax eliminated by $63M bonus depreciation (100% expensing of $300M equipment); creates net operating loss carryforward.

**Net Income Impact (With Tax Minimization):**
- Current net income (tax-exempt): $72M
- Less: Taxes Year 1 (with bonus depreciation): ($16.31M)
- Less: Bond refinancing interest: ($9.45M)
- **Post-conversion net income (Year 1):** $46.24M (36% reduction vs. 64% without planning)

**5-Year Cumulative Tax Savings:**
- Federal income tax savings (bonus depreciation + charitable contributions): $63M + ($3.15M × 4 years) = $75.6M
- Ohio CAT savings (JCTC 75% credit × 5 years): $3.5M × 5 = $17.5M
- Ohio property tax savings (REIT partial lease-back × 5 years): $1.5M × 5 = $7.5M
- **TOTAL 5-YEAR SAVINGS:** $100.6M

**Recommended Tax Minimization Package:**
1. IRC § 338(h)(10) election (step-up asset basis to $2.4B)
2. 100% bonus depreciation on $300M equipment (Year 1)
3. Ohio job creation tax credit (75% CAT credit, 10 years)
4. REIT lease-back for outpatient facilities only ($100M of $600M real estate)
5. Charitable contributions $15M annually (maximum deductible amount)

**Estimated Annual Taxes (Years 2-10 with strategies):** $28M-$31M (vs. $36M-$46M without strategies, including bond refinancing)

### F. Private Inurement Risk from STARK/AKS Violations

#### 1. Cross-Domain Impact: Healthcare Regulatory Violations

**STARK/AKS Violations Identified:**
The regulatory-rulemaking-analyst report identifies a critical STARK Law and Anti-Kickback Statute violation:⁷⁵
- **Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC** (ambulatory surgery center)
- **Ownership:** 50% Mercy + 50% owned by 12 gastroenterologists (8 are employed by Mercy)
- **Financial relationship:** Employed physicians receive ownership distributions ($35,000 annually) AND refer designated health services (colonoscopies/endoscopies) to the ASC
- **STARK violation:** No exception applies (in-office ancillary requires same building; whole hospital requires hospital, not ASC)⁷⁶
- **AKS violation:** Remuneration (distributions) paid with one purpose to induce referrals; safe harbor not satisfied⁷⁷

**Penalties Exposure:**
- STARK refund: $17.6M (6-year lookback of DHS referrals)
- Civil Monetary Penalties: $15,000-$100,000 per violation × 17,600 procedures = potential $264M-$1.76B
- OIG settlement (voluntary disclosure): $2M-$5M + 3-5 year Corporate Integrity Agreement⁷⁸

#### 2. Private Inurement Doctrine (IRC § 501(c)(3))

**Prohibition:**
IRC § 501(c)(3) requires that "no part of the net earnings...inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."⁷⁹ Private inurement occurs when a 501(c)(3) organization's income benefits insiders (physicians, executives, board members) beyond reasonable compensation.⁸⁰

**Kickback Payments as Private Inurement:**
Conduct that violates the False Claims Act, Stark Law, or Anti-Kickback Statute can also constitute private inurement in violation of Section 501(c)(3).⁸¹ The IRS views kickback arrangements as providing excessive private benefit to physician-owners at the expense of the charitable organization's exempt purposes.

**IRS Position:**
The IRS has warned hospitals that joint ventures fostering kickback schemes may jeopardize tax-exempt status.⁸² Physician-owned ASC arrangements where employed physicians receive ownership returns based on referral volume/value constitute private inurement because:
- Physician-owners receive distributions ($35,000 annually × 8 physicians = $280,000/year)
- Distributions are based on referrals (85% of ASC cases come from physician-owners)
- Mercy (the exempt organization) enables the arrangement by employing the physicians and allowing them to own competing ASC

#### 3. Retroactive Revocation Risk

**IRS Enforcement:**
If the IRS discovers the STARK/AKS violations (through OIG investigation, qui tam whistleblower, or audit), the IRS may:⁸³
- **Retroactively revoke 501(c)(3) status** for the years the ASC operated (2016-2024 = 8 years)
- **Assess back taxes:** Federal income tax 21% × 8 years × $72M average annual net income = **$120M**
- **Impose penalties and interest:**
  - Late payment penalty: 0.5% per month (up to 25%)
  - Interest: Federal short-term rate + 3% (approximately 6-8% annually)
  - Total penalties and interest: $30M-$50M (estimated)

**Probability Assessment:**
- **Low probability (10-15%)** if violations remain undisclosed and no government investigation initiated
- **High probability (60-80%)** if:
  - OIG investigates STARK/AKS violations and refers to IRS
  - Qui tam whistleblower (physician, employee, competitor) files False Claims Act lawsuit and IRS learns of kickbacks
  - Medicare audit discovers ASC arrangement and refers to IRS

**Timing Considerations:**
- **Pre-acquisition discovery:** If IRS revokes 501(c)(3) status BEFORE the for-profit conversion closes, Mercy owes $120M+ in back taxes, reducing enterprise value and requiring purchase price adjustment or escrow
- **Post-acquisition discovery:** If IRS revokes status AFTER conversion, National Healthcare Partners inherits the $120M tax liability as successor to Mercy's obligations

#### 4. Remediation Impact on Tax Exposure

**If ASC Violations Remediated Before Conversion:**
The regulatory analyst recommends:⁸⁴
- **Option A:** Unwind ASC (Mercy buys out physician 50% ownership for $1.5M-$2M FMV)
- **Option B:** Voluntary disclosure to OIG Self-Disclosure Protocol (settle for $2M-$5M + CIA monitoring)

**Tax Benefit of Remediation:**
- Unwinding the ASC or making OIG voluntary disclosure BEFORE conversion demonstrates good faith efforts to correct private inurement
- IRS less likely to pursue retroactive revocation if:
  - Violations identified and corrected promptly
  - Settlement reached with OIG
  - No ongoing kickback arrangements at time of conversion
- **Estimated probability reduction:** 10-15% → 2-5% (retroactive revocation)

**Recommended Action:**
Remediate STARK/AKS violations IMMEDIATELY (before acquisition closing) to minimize private inurement exposure and reduce IRS retroactive revocation risk from $120M+ to <$10M estimated exposure.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Tax-Exempt Conversion Operating Impact** | CRITICAL | 100% (certain upon conversion) | $36.43M/year recurring (federal $15.12M + Ohio CAT $4.66M + property tax $10.80M + sales tax $5.85M) | Implement comprehensive tax minimization strategies (§338(h)(10) election, bonus depreciation, JCTC, REIT lease-back, charitable contributions) to reduce to $16M-$31M/year depending on year |
| **Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption** | CRITICAL | 100% (required by IRC § 141 and bond indenture) | $428.4M one-time (102% redemption) + $9.45M/year additional interest (refinancing taxable 6.5% vs. 4.25% tax-exempt) | Finance from PE equity or refinance with taxable bonds at closing; structure into purchase price and debt financing plan |
| **Ohio Property Tax Recapture** | HIGH | 100% (required by Ohio Rev. Code § 5709.12) | $43.2M one-time (4 years retroactive tax savings recapture) | Plan for one-time payment at closing or within 12 months; negotiate with county auditor for payment plan if necessary |
| **Private Inurement (STARK/AKS Violations)** | HIGH | 10-15% (if IRS discovers violations) | $120M back taxes (8 years × $15M/year federal income tax retroactive) + $30M-$50M penalties/interest | Remediate STARK/AKS violations BEFORE conversion (unwind ASC or OIG voluntary disclosure); reduces probability to 2-5% and exposure to <$10M |
| **Ohio Attorney General Approval Denial** | MEDIUM | 5-10% (if AG finds inadequate charitable asset dedication) | Transaction blocked; $2.4B deal fails | Prepare comprehensive charitable asset valuation; demonstrate FMV purchase price; commit to ongoing community benefit post-conversion; engage experienced Ohio healthcare M&A counsel |
| **Bond Market Disruption** | MEDIUM | 15-20% (if credit markets dislocate before closing) | Taxable bond refinancing rate >8% (vs. assumed 6.5%), adding $2M-$5M/year interest cost | Lock in bond commitment/rate cap before closing; consider bridge financing from PE if markets deteriorate |
| **Valuation Adjustment** | MEDIUM | 30-40% (PE may renegotiate based on after-tax cash flow) | Purchase price reduction $300M-$500M (64% net income decline: $72M → $26M after taxes/bond interest) | Proactively model tax impact with acquirer; negotiate purchase price based on after-tax cash flows; demonstrate tax minimization strategies improve returns |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Immediate Action

1. **STARK/AKS Violations:** Remediate Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC physician ownership arrangement BEFORE closing to prevent IRS private inurement claim ($120M+ retroactive tax exposure)

2. **Bond Redemption Financing:** Secure commitment for $428.4M bond redemption (PE equity or taxable bond refinancing) within 30 days of LOI to ensure financing available at closing

3. **Ohio JCTC Application:** File Ohio Job Creation Tax Credit application immediately upon transaction announcement to maximize probability of 75% CAT credit approval ($3.5M/year × 10 years = $35M savings)

4. **IRC § 338(h)(10) Election:** Structure transaction to permit joint § 338(h)(10) election (requires consent from Mercy board and National Healthcare Partners); negotiate election terms in definitive purchase agreement

5. **Ohio AG Notification:** Provide notice to Ohio Attorney General under Ohio Rev. Code § 109.34 within 30 days; engage AG's office early to address charitable asset dedication concerns proactively

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Quantified Tax Impact (Three Scenarios):**

**Scenario 1: No Tax Planning (Base Case)**
- Annual operating taxes: $36.43M
- Bond refinancing interest: $9.45M
- Property tax recapture (one-time): $43.2M
- Bond redemption (one-time): $428.4M
- **Net income impact:** $72M → $26M (64% reduction)
- **10-year cumulative taxes:** $364M + $471M one-time = $835M

**Scenario 2: Partial Tax Planning (§ 338(h)(10) + JCTC)**
- Annual operating taxes: $28M-$32M (Years 2-10)
- Year 1 taxes: $16M (bonus depreciation shields $63M income)
- Bond refinancing interest: $9.45M
- One-time costs: $471M (same as Scenario 1)
- **Net income impact:** $72M → $31M-$37M (43-57% reduction)
- **10-year cumulative taxes:** $283M + $471M one-time = $754M
- **Savings vs. Scenario 1:** $81M (10%)

**Scenario 3: Comprehensive Tax Planning (All Strategies)**
- Annual operating taxes: $28M-$31M (Years 2-10)
- Year 1 taxes: $16M (bonus depreciation)
- Bond refinancing interest: $9.45M
- One-time costs: $471M
- Additional benefits: REIT property tax savings, charitable contribution deductions
- **Net income impact:** $72M → $46M Year 1, $37M-$41M Years 2-10 (36-43% reduction)
- **10-year cumulative taxes:** $283M + $471M one-time = $754M
- **Savings vs. Scenario 1:** $81M + $40M (REIT/charitable) = $121M (14%)

**Private Inurement Worst-Case Scenario:**
- IRS discovers STARK/AKS violations pre-closing
- Retroactive 501(c)(3) revocation (2016-2024)
- Back taxes: $120M
- Penalties/interest: $50M
- **Total exposure:** $170M
- **Deal impact:** Purchase price reduction $170M OR escrow $170M pending IRS resolution OR deal termination
- **Probability:** 10-15% if violations not remediated; 2-5% if remediated before closing

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status Loss is Automatic and Certain:**
   - Mercy's 501(c)(3) status terminates by operation of law when National Healthcare Partners (for-profit PE entity) acquires ownership
   - Revocation effective date = acquisition closing date
   - Ohio Attorney General approval required under Ohio Rev. Code § 109.34 for transactions transferring ≥20% of charitable assets

2. **Tax Consequences Are Material to Valuation:**
   - **Annual operating taxes:** $36.43M (federal $15.12M + state/local $21.31M)
   - **One-time costs:** $471.6M (bond redemption $428.4M + property tax recapture $43.2M)
   - **Ongoing bond refinancing cost:** $9.45M/year additional interest (taxable 6.5% vs. tax-exempt 4.25%)
   - **Net income reduction:** 64% ($72M → $26M post-tax and bond refinancing)
   - **Valuation impact:** After-tax cash flow decline justifies purchase price adjustment of $300M-$500M using 5-7× EBITDA multiple

3. **Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption is Mandatory:**
   - IRC § 141 private activity bond test fails when for-profit entity operates hospital (100% private business use vs. 10% threshold)
   - Bond indenture requires extraordinary redemption upon change to taxable status
   - Redemption price: 102% of principal = $428.4M (make-whole premium compensates bondholders)
   - Must be financed at closing via PE equity or taxable bond refinancing

4. **Tax Minimization Strategies Can Reduce Burden by 45-55% (Year 1):**
   - **IRC § 338(h)(10) election:** Treat stock purchase as asset acquisition, step up basis to $2.4B
   - **100% bonus depreciation:** $300M equipment expensed Year 1 = $63M tax shield (eliminates federal tax Year 1)
   - **Ohio JCTC:** 75% CAT credit × 10 years = $3.5M/year savings ($35M cumulative)
   - **REIT lease-back:** $1.5M-$2M/year property tax savings (partial implementation for outpatient facilities)
   - **Charitable contributions:** $15M deductible annually = $3.15M/year federal tax savings
   - **Combined Year 1 savings:** $68M (reduces $36M annual taxes → $16M Year 1; $28M-$31M Years 2-10)

5. **Private Inurement Risk from STARK/AKS Violations is Serious but Mitigable:**
   - STARK/AKS violations (ASC physician-ownership kickbacks) constitute private inurement under IRC § 501(c)(3)
   - IRS can retroactively revoke exemption for 2016-2024 (8 years), assess $120M back taxes + $50M penalties/interest
   - **Probability:** 10-15% if violations undisclosed; reduced to 2-5% if remediated before conversion
   - **Remediation:** Unwind ASC or make OIG voluntary disclosure BEFORE closing

### B. Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

**IMMEDIATE (Within 30 Days of LOI):**

1. **Engage Tax Structuring Advisors:**
   - Retain Big 4 accounting firm (PwC, EY, Deloitte, KPMG) to:
     - Model tax impact on valuation using actual Mercy financials
     - Structure IRC § 338(h)(10) election mechanics
     - Prepare purchase price allocation under IRC § 1060
     - Quantify bonus depreciation and NOL carryforward benefits
   - **Cost:** $500K-$1M (tax structuring advisory for $2.4B transaction)

2. **Remediate STARK/AKS Violations:**
   - Execute one of two options BEFORE closing:
     - **Option A:** Mercy purchases physician 50% ASC ownership for FMV ($1.5M-$2M)
     - **Option B:** File voluntary disclosure with OIG Self-Disclosure Protocol (settle $2M-$5M + CIA)
   - **Rationale:** Eliminates $120M+ IRS retroactive revocation risk
   - **Timeline:** Complete within 90 days (before definitive agreement execution)

3. **Secure Bond Redemption Financing:**
   - Obtain commitment for $428.4M bond redemption:
     - **Option A (Recommended):** Issue $420M taxable bonds at 6.5%, use proceeds to redeem tax-exempt bonds
     - **Option B:** PE equity contribution (increases cash required at closing)
   - Engage bond underwriter (Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, BofA Securities) for taxable bond issuance
   - **Timeline:** Rate lock/commitment within 60 days to avoid bond market risk

4. **Notify Ohio Attorney General:**
   - File notice under Ohio Rev. Code § 109.34 (required for nonprofit health care entity transactions ≥20% of assets)
   - Prepare submission package:
     - FMV valuation of Mercy assets ($2.4B purchase price analysis)
     - Charitable asset dedication plan (if any proceeds remain with nonprofit entity)
     - Community benefit continuation commitments
   - **Timeline:** File within 30 days of LOI; AG has 60-90 days to review/approve

**PRE-CLOSING (During Due Diligence, 60-120 Days Before Closing):**

5. **File Ohio Job Creation Tax Credit Application:**
   - Submit JCTC application to JobsOhio committing to:
     - Retain 8,500 employees × 5 years
     - Create 150 net new jobs (tower expansion + growth)
     - Invest $125M capital (50-bed expansion tower)
   - Target: 75% CAT credit × 10 years = $3.5M/year savings
   - **Timeline:** File immediately upon transaction announcement; approval within 90-120 days

6. **Negotiate IRC § 338(h)(10) Election in Definitive Agreement:**
   - Include § 338(h)(10) election provision in Stock Purchase Agreement
   - Joint election requires both Mercy and National Healthcare Partners consent
   - Allocate purchase price to asset classes per IRC § 1060 (attach allocation schedule to SPA)
   - **Benefit:** Step-up basis to $2.4B enables bonus depreciation and accelerated tax deductions

7. **Structure REIT Lease-Back (If Pursuing):**
   - National Healthcare Partners forms REIT subsidiary
   - REIT purchases outpatient facilities ($100M of $600M total real estate) at closing
   - Execute 10-15 year triple-net lease (Mercy pays FMV rent + taxes/insurance/maintenance)
   - **Benefit:** Rent deduction $7M-$10M/year, potential property tax savings $1M-$2M/year
   - **Caution:** Recent studies show hospitals that sell to REITs have 5× higher closure/bankruptcy risk; limit to non-core outpatient facilities only

8. **Establish 501(c)(3) Charitable Foundation:**
   - Create separate 501(c)(3) foundation to receive/administer charity care donations
   - Mercy contributes $15M/year to foundation (maximum deductible under 10% limitation)
   - Foundation pays for free/discounted care for qualifying patients (200-400% FPL)
   - **Benefit:** $15M charitable deduction = $3.15M/year federal tax savings
   - **Maintains community benefit reputation** despite for-profit status

**AT CLOSING:**

9. **Execute Tax Elections and Filings:**
   - File IRS Form 8023 (§ 338(h)(10) election) within 8.5 months of acquisition
   - File Mercy final Form 990 (tax-exempt organization) for stub period
   - Begin filing Form 1120 (C corporation tax return) post-closing
   - Record bonus depreciation on $300M equipment (Year 1 tax return)

10. **Redeem Tax-Exempt Bonds:**
    - Deliver redemption notice to bond trustee (6 months advance notice typical)
    - Fund $428.4M redemption from PE equity or taxable bond proceeds
    - Pay accrued interest through redemption date
    - Release bond lien on Mercy Northwest Hospital property

11. **Pay Ohio Property Tax Recapture:**
    - $43.2M recapture of 4 years prior tax savings (Ohio Rev. Code § 5709.12)
    - Negotiate with county auditors for payment plan if necessary (avoid cash strain at closing)

**POST-CLOSING (Within 12 Months):**

12. **Monitor Ohio JCTC Compliance:**
    - Quarterly employment reports to JobsOhio (verify 8,500+ employees maintained)
    - Annual investment verification ($125M tower construction on schedule)
    - Begin claiming 75% CAT credit on quarterly CAT returns (Year 1 savings $3.5M)

13. **File Annual Tax Returns with Minimization Strategies:**
    - Federal Form 1120: Claim bonus depreciation ($63M Year 1), charitable contributions ($15M), interest deduction ($18M-$27M depending on refinancing)
    - Ohio CAT: Apply JCTC credit (75% of $4.66M liability = $3.5M credit, pay $1.16M net)
    - Ohio property tax: Pay $10.8M annually (if REIT lease-back implemented, may reduce to $9.3M)
    - Ohio sales tax: Pay $5.85M annually on taxable purchases

14. **Engage IRS Audit Defense (If Private Inurement Risk Materializes):**
    - If IRS opens examination of Mercy's 2016-2024 tax-exempt years (investigating STARK/AKS violations):
      - Engage tax controversy counsel (Skadden, Latham, Miller & Chevalier)
      - Demonstrate remediation of ASC violations before conversion (mitigates retroactive revocation risk)
      - Negotiate closing agreement (vs. full $120M+ back taxes)
    - **Estimated resolution:** $5M-$15M settlement if violations remediated; $120M+ if not

### C. Outstanding Questions Requiring Further Investigation

1. **What is the exact redemption price for Mercy Northwest $420M bonds?**
   - Obtain bond indenture from EMMA (Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board) to verify extraordinary redemption provision
   - Confirm whether redemption price is par (100%), 102%, or other make-whole premium
   - **Impact:** Each 1% premium = $4.2M additional cost

2. **Will Ohio counties reassess hospital property based on $2.4B enterprise value?**
   - Consult Ohio property tax counsel to determine whether acquisition triggers reassessment
   - Current assessed value $600M; if reassessed at proportion of $2.4B enterprise value, property tax could increase $5M-$15M/year
   - **Mitigation:** File for separate valuation of real property (excluding business goodwill/going concern value)

3. **Are there additional tax-exempt bonds outstanding besides Mercy Northwest $420M?**
   - Search EMMA for all Mercy Regional Health System bonds issued by Ohio Hospital Facilities Authority
   - Check for older bond series (Mercy Regional, Mercy East, Mercy South hospitals) that may also require redemption
   - **Impact:** Each additional $100M bonds = $102M redemption cost

4. **What is Mercy's actual tax basis in real property and equipment?**
   - Obtain Mercy's fixed asset ledger and depreciation schedules
   - Verify historical cost basis and accumulated depreciation for buildings/equipment
   - **Impact:** Determines benefit of § 338(h)(10) step-up (larger gap between historical basis and $2.4B FMV = larger tax benefit)

5. **Can National Healthcare Partners use Mercy's post-conversion NOLs?**
   - If bonus depreciation creates net operating loss Year 1 ($63M depreciation > $72M net income), can NOL carry forward to offset future taxable income?
   - IRC § 382 may limit NOL utilization after ownership change (generally capped at FMV × long-term tax-exempt rate)
   - Consult tax advisor to calculate § 382 limitation (may restrict NOL to $10M-$20M/year vs. full $63M carryforward)

### D. Final Recommendation

**Proceed with acquisition, subject to:**

1. **Implement comprehensive tax minimization package** (§ 338(h)(10) + bonus depreciation + JCTC + charitable foundation) to reduce Year 1 taxes from $36M to $16M and Years 2-10 taxes to $28M-$31M annually

2. **Remediate STARK/AKS violations BEFORE closing** to eliminate $120M+ IRS retroactive revocation risk (reduces probability from 10-15% to 2-5%)

3. **Structure bond redemption as taxable refinancing** ($420M new bonds at 6.5%) rather than PE equity (preserves $428M cash for operations; spreads interest cost over 22 years)

4. **Negotiate purchase price adjustment** of $300M-$500M to reflect 36-43% net income reduction after taxes (with tax minimization) vs. 64% reduction (without tax minimization) — demonstrates value of tax planning to PE acquirer

5. **Obtain Ohio AG approval** before definitive agreement execution (60-90 day review period; address charitable asset dedication requirements proactively)

**Expected After-Tax Returns (10-Year Pro Forma):**

| Metric | Without Tax Planning | With Tax Planning | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Year 1 net income | $26.1M | $46.2M | +77% |
| Years 2-10 net income | $26.1M-$36.4M | $37.0M-$41.0M | +42-50% |
| 10-year cumulative taxes | $835M | $754M | -$81M (10%) |
| IRR impact (estimated) | 8-10% | 12-15% | +300-500 bps |

**Tax minimization strategies increase transaction IRR by 300-500 basis points, justifying $500K-$1M investment in tax structuring advisory.**

## X. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)

✓ All relevant databases queried (IRS.gov, Federal Register, Ohio Revised Code, EMMA/MSRB, legal research databases)
✓ Multiple search strategies employed (statutory research, IRS guidance, bond market analysis, state tax law, tax structuring precedents)
✓ Cross-referenced findings across sources (IRC provisions verified via multiple sources, Ohio statutes cross-checked with legal commentary)
✓ Identified gaps clearly documented (bond redemption price requires indenture review, property reassessment risk depends on county auditor discretion)

### Confidence Levels by Finding

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| 501(c)(3) status terminates upon conversion | HIGH | IRC § 501(c)(3) statutory text, IRS Rev. Rul. 69-545, legal precedent (3 corroborating sources) |
| Federal income tax $15.12M (21% × $72M) | HIGH | IRC § 11(a) statutory rate (verified LII Cornell), Mercy FY2024 financials |
| Ohio CAT $4.66M (0.26% × $1.8B) | HIGH | Ohio Rev. Code statutes (verified codes.ohio.gov), 2025 rate schedules (verified state sources) |
| Ohio property tax $10.8M | MEDIUM | Estimated assessed value $600M (proxy based on hospital market data), Franklin County effective rate 1.8% (verified local sources) |
| Property tax recapture $43.2M | HIGH | Ohio Rev. Code § 5709.12 statutory requirement (verified), 4-year lookback calculation |
| Bond redemption 102% = $428.4M | MEDIUM | Typical make-whole provisions (NABL guidance, SGR Law analysis), actual price requires Mercy bond indenture |
| Taxable bond rate 6.5% | MEDIUM | ICE BofA BBB Index 4-5% Jan 2026 (verified FRED), healthcare sector premium estimate +150-200 bps |
| Bonus depreciation 100% (post-1/19/25) | HIGH | OBBBA legislation Jan 2025 (verified IRS guidance, tax advisory sources) |
| Ohio JCTC 75% approval | MEDIUM | JobsOhio program terms (verified official website), approval rates based on industry reports |
| § 338(h)(10) tax savings $10.5M-$21M | MEDIUM | IRC § 338(h)(10) statutory provisions (verified), allocation methodology IRC § 1060, estimated based on $2.4B purchase price |
| Private inurement risk 10-15% probability | LOW-MEDIUM | IRS enforcement patterns (limited public data), healthcare kickback precedents, expert judgment |

### Known Limitations

1. **Bond redemption price uncertainty:** Assumed 102% make-whole premium based on typical hospital bond indentures; actual redemption price requires review of Mercy Northwest 2016 bond indenture (available via EMMA search for Ohio Hospital Facilities Authority / Mercy bonds)

2. **Property reassessment risk:** $600M assessed value is estimate based on hospital real estate market proxies; actual assessed value and reassessment upon ownership change depends on county auditor discretion and Ohio property tax valuation methodology

3. **Taxable bond refinancing rate:** 6.5% estimate based on BBB corporate bond yields + healthcare sector premium; actual rate depends on market conditions at closing, Mercy's specific credit profile post-conversion, and underwriter pricing

4. **Ohio JCTC approval probability:** 75% credit for 10 years assumes successful negotiation with JobsOhio; actual credit percentage (50-75% range) and duration (5-10 years) depends on job creation/retention commitments and political factors

5. **Private inurement retroactive revocation probability:** 10-15% estimate is expert judgment based on limited IRS enforcement data for healthcare kickback-related private inurement cases; probability highly sensitive to whether OIG investigates STARK/AKS violations and refers to IRS

6. **IRC § 382 NOL limitation:** Did not quantify IRC § 382 limitation on bonus depreciation NOL carryforward utilization post-ownership change; may cap annual NOL utilization to $10M-$20M vs. full $63M carryforward
