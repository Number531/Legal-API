## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

National Healthcare Partners LLC's $2.4 billion acquisition of Mercy Regional Health System presents **significant employment and labor law compliance risks** stemming from (1) probable WARN Act obligations for PE-driven workforce reductions, (2) physician retention challenges with change-of-control termination rights, (3) potential union successorship obligations (pending verification), and (4) ERISA benefit plan transition complexities. Total quantified employment exposure ranges from **$19 million one-time** (worst-case scenario) plus **$4.2 million annually ongoing** if integration mismanaged. However, most risks are **highly mitigable** through proactive compliance planning, physician retention strategies, and phased benefit plan transitions.

### Workforce Composition

Mercy employs **8,500 total employees** across 4 hospitals and 86 outpatient locations:

| Employee Category | Count | Key Considerations |
|-------------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Physicians (W-2 employed)** | 650 | Mercy Medical Group PC; specialties include primary care (250), medical specialties (150), surgical specialties (100), OB/GYN (60), emergency medicine (50), hospitalists (40); **change of control termination rights** in employment agreements create $21M-$33M severance/tail exposure if 20-50 physicians exercise |
| **Nurses** | 2,800 | RNs, LPNs, nurse practitioners; **potential union representation** (National Nurses United, Ohio Nurses Association) requires NLRB verification; most likely to be unionized if any bargaining units exist |
| **Allied Health Professionals** | 1,200 | Respiratory therapists, radiology technologists, lab technicians, pharmacists, physical/occupational/speech therapists |
| **Support Staff** | 3,850 | Environmental services, food service, administration, IT, finance, HR; **highest layoff risk** in PE integration (300-1,000 positions estimated for consolidation/outsourcing) |

### WARN Act Compliance (CRITICAL - HIGH SEVERITY)

**Status:** LIKELY TRIGGERED by PE integration workforce reductions

**Legal Framework:**
- Federal WARN Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109) requires 60-day advance written notice before mass layoffs or plant closings
- **Covered employer:** Mercy 8,500 employees exceeds 100-employee threshold ✓
- **Mass layoff trigger:** 500+ employees OR 50-499 employees (33%+ of single site) during 30-day period
- **Ohio Mini-WARN Act:** Effective September 29, 2025 (after expected closing Q2-Q3 2025), supplements federal requirements

**PE Integration Scenarios:**

Based on private equity healthcare acquisition patterns (UPMC 1,000 layoffs, Texas Children's Hospital 1,000, Mass General Brigham 1,500 in 2024), National Healthcare Partners likely to implement cost-cutting affecting **500-1,000 employees (6-12% of workforce)**:

| Function Category | Estimated Reduction | Rationale |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Administration (corporate) | 300-400 | Centralize to Nashville PE headquarters (finance, HR, legal, procurement) |
| IT/Finance/HR/Payroll | 100-150 | Consolidate to PE shared services center |
| Environmental Services | 100-150 | Outsource to Sodexo/Aramark contract vendors |
| Food Services | 50-100 | Outsource to contract vendors |
| Outpatient Clinic Staff | 100-200 | Close low-performing/unprofitable clinic locations |
| **TOTAL** | **650-1,000** | **7.6-11.8% workforce reduction** |

**WARN Act Trigger Analysis:**
- **Single-Site Scenario:** If 500+ laid off at Mercy Regional Medical Center (3,000+ employees, flagship) → **Mass layoff triggered**
- **Multi-Site Aggregation:** If layoffs across 4 hospitals within 30-day period result from single PE integration decision AND geographically proximate (all Franklin County/adjacent counties) → DOL may aggregate → **Mass layoff triggered at 500+ total**
- **Probability Assessment:** **75-85% likelihood** WARN Act triggered if PE executes typical integration plan

**Compliance Requirements:**
- **60-day notice** to: (1) affected employees, (2) Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (state dislocated worker unit), (3) Columbus Mayor/Franklin County Commissioners (local government)
- **Notice content:** Layoff vs. plant closing, expected date, permanent vs. temporary, bumping rights, contact information
- **Exceptions (UNLIKELY):** Faltering company, unforeseeable business circumstances, natural disaster - **NONE apply** to planned PE integration

**Non-Compliance Penalties:**
- **Back pay + benefits:** Each affected employee entitled to 60 days maximum
- **Calculation (500 employees):** 500 × $137/day ($50K average salary) × 60 days = **$4.11M** + benefits 25-30% = **$1.0-$1.2M** → **Total $5.1-$5.3M**
- **Civil penalty:** Up to $500/day to local government × 60 days = **$30,000**
- **Attorney's fees:** If employees sue, employer pays prevailing party costs
- **TOTAL EXPOSURE: $5.1-$5.4 million**

**Recent Ohio Healthcare WARN Precedents (2024):**
- ProMedica Employment (Sylvania): 122 employees
- McLaren St. Luke's Hospital (Maumee): 743 employees
- Aultman Hospital (Canton): 97 employees
- **Observation:** Ohio healthcare employers routinely comply with WARN; non-compliance risk high due to state transparency

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Provide 60-day WARN notice** before any layoffs ≥50 employees (conservative threshold)
- **Stagger layoffs** across >30-day periods to avoid aggregation (if feasible without operational disruption)
- **Engage employment counsel** to draft compliant notices, determine single-site vs. aggregation
- **Timeline:** Provide notice Months 3-4 post-closing, implement layoffs Months 5-6

---

### Physician Employment Agreements (HIGH SEVERITY)

**Status:** 650 employed physicians; **change of control termination provisions** create substantial severance/tail insurance exposure

**Standard Hospital Physician Employment Terms (Industry):**
- **Term:** 3 years, automatically renewable
- **Compensation:** Base salary + productivity bonus (wRVU) + quality metrics
- **Benefits:** Health insurance, malpractice insurance (claims-made), CME, vacation, 401(k) match 3-6%
- **Restrictive Covenants:**
  - **Non-compete:** 1-2 years, 10-15 miles from hospital/clinic locations, specialty-specific
  - **Non-solicitation:** 1-2 years, patients/employees/referral sources
- **Termination:**
  - **For cause:** Immediate, no severance (misconduct, license revocation, breach)
  - **Without cause:** 90-120 days notice, severance 6-12 months base + benefits + **tail malpractice insurance**
  - **Change of control:** "Good reason" termination within 60-90 days if material compensation reduction, relocation >30 miles, adverse duties change

**Non-Compete Enforceability (Ohio Law):**

Ohio courts enforce physician non-competes if **reasonable** under *Raimonde v. Van Vlerah*, 42 Ohio St. 2d 21 (1975):
- **Geographic scope:** 10-15 miles likely enforceable; statewide overly broad
- **Duration:** 1-2 years reasonable; 5+ years excessive
- **Specialty restriction:** Physician's specialty only (cardiology); not all medical practice
- **Public interest scrutiny:** Heightened review for healthcare access impacts on community

**Ohio Modification Rule:** Courts may **modify** overly broad restrictions (not strict blue pencil) - reduce 5 years to 2 years, 50 miles to 15 miles

**Legislative Developments:**
- **FTC Non-Compete Ban (April 2024):** Blocked by federal court (Texas) August 2024 - **NOT IN EFFECT**
- **Ohio Senate Bill 11 (February 2025):** Proposed ban on all non-competes - **PENDING** (not yet enacted)

**Change of Control Termination Risk:**

| Probability Scenario | Likelihood | Physicians Exercising | Severance + Tail Exposure |
|----------------------|------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Low** (PE maintains status quo: compensation, autonomy, facilities) | 5-10% | 5-10 physicians | $5M-$10M |
| **Medium** (PE imposes productivity quotas, administrative burdens, call schedule changes) | 20-30% | 20-30 physicians | $16M-$25M |
| **High** (PE reduces compensation, centralizes decisions to Nashville, eliminates services) | 40-60% | 40-60 physicians | $30M-$50M |

**Base Case Exposure (50 physicians, 7.7% of 650):**

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Severance** (6-12 months base salary + benefits) | 50 × $400K average × 0.5-1.0 multiple + 25% benefits | **$16M-$28M** |
| **Tail Malpractice Insurance** (claims-made ERP coverage) | 15 primary care × $25K + 20 medical specialists × $75K + 10 surgical × $200K + 5 high-risk (neuro, OB/GYN) × $300K | **$5.4M** |
| **TOTAL** | | **$21M-$33M** |

**Tail Insurance Standards:**
- **Cost:** 200-300% of annual claims-made premium (industry standard)
- **Payment obligation:** Change of control treated as "without cause" termination → **Employer pays tail**
- **Primary care:** $12K-$36K per physician
- **Medical specialists:** $30K-$120K per physician
- **High-risk (neurosurgery, OB/GYN, cardiac surgery):** $150K-$450K per physician

**Physician Retention Strategies (CRITICAL):**

| Strategy | Cost | Effectiveness | Implementation |
|----------|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Retention Bonuses** | $3M-$7.5M (50 physicians × $60K-$150K) | **HIGH** - Financial incentive counters uncertainty | Offer letters Month 1, payable Month 12 if employed |
| **Compensation Guarantees** | Revenue neutral (status quo) | **HIGH** - Eliminates income reduction concern | Written assurance no wRVU changes 12-24 months |
| **Clinical Autonomy Assurances** | No cost | **MEDIUM** - Requires PE cultural commitment | CEO town halls, department chair meetings, governance documentation |
| **Selective Non-Compete Waivers** | Competitive harm (physicians join OhioHealth, Mount Carmel) | **MEDIUM** - Reduces litigation hostility, goodwill gesture | Waive for voluntary terminations, enforce for high-value specialties only |

---

### Union Representation and Successorship (MEDIUM SEVERITY - Pending Verification)

**Current Research Status:**
- NLRB case database search (January 24, 2026) for "Mercy Regional Health System" + "Columbus Ohio" + healthcare unions → **NO RESULTS FOUND**
- Suggests **non-union status**, but requires **data room verification** (employee handbooks, labor relations files, HR records)

**Common Ohio Healthcare Unions:**
- SEIU District 1199 WV/KY/OH (healthcare/social service workers)
- Ohio Nurses Association (AFT Local 5903)
- National Nurses United (NNU)
- AFSCME (public hospital employees)
- Teamsters (service/technical workers)

**If Unions Exist: Successorship Obligations**

**Legal Standard:** *Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB*, 482 U.S. 27 (1987)

New employer (successor) must recognize and bargain with union if:
1. **Majority continuity:** Majority of successor's workforce were predecessor's employees ✓ (7,500-8,000 of 8,500 retained = 88-94%)
2. **Substantial continuity:** Same business operations, same locations ✓ (4 hospitals, acute care, Columbus area)

**Conclusion:** If unions exist, National Healthcare Partners is **Burns successor** obligated to:
- **Recognize union** as bargaining representative (no new election required)
- **Bargain in good faith** (not required to adopt predecessor's CBA, but must negotiate new terms)
- **Effects bargaining** for layoffs: severance, bumping rights, recall rights, benefits continuation
- **Successor bar:** Union protected from challenge 6-12 months (recent 2024 Supreme Court remand under *Loper Bright* may affect doctrine)

**2024 NLRB Developments:**
- *Tramont Manufacturing*: Successor required to bargain over **effects** of layoffs even if not required to bargain over **decision** to lay off
- Supreme Court remand of successor bar case for reconsideration under *Loper Bright* (Chevron deference overturned) - may signal future changes

**Union Presence Impact on PE Integration:**
- **Constrains flexibility:** Seniority-based layoff procedures (last hired, first fired)
- **Increases costs:** CBA wage/benefit enhancements, effects bargaining severance negotiations, legal fees
- **Extends timeline:** Effects bargaining 30-90 days before layoffs, grievance procedures for disputes
- **Estimated exposure (if unions exist):** $2M-$5M (CBA compliance, enhanced severance, legal fees)

**WARN Act + Union Interaction:**
- CBA notice requirements **supplement** WARN Act (if CBA requires 90 days, must provide 90 not 60)
- Union consultation required during WARN Act process
- Effects bargaining over severance, bumping rights, recall rights

**Verification Actions Required (Week 1 Due Diligence):**
1. Data room: Employee handbooks, labor relations files, HR policies
2. Management questionnaire: CBAs, union elections, organizing campaigns, NLRB charges (past 5 years)
3. NLRB expanded search: Mercy-affiliated entities, predecessor names, facility-specific searches

### ERISA Employee Benefit Plans (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Assumed Mercy Benefit Plans (Industry Standard):**

| Plan Type | Participants | Annual Cost | Transition Considerations |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **401(k) Retirement Plan** | 8,500 (full-time eligible) | $15M-$30M employer match (3-6%) | Termination triggers **100% accelerated vesting** ($8.5M cost) |
| **Health Insurance** (medical/dental/vision) | 8,500 + dependents | $50M-$80M (employer portion) | Mid-year transition causes network disruption, deductible restart; **COBRA 18 months** if terminated |
| **Life Insurance** (group term 1-2× salary) | 8,500 | $2M-$4M premiums | Portable (employees can convert to individual) |
| **Disability Insurance** (STD + LTD) | 8,500 | $3M-$5M premiums | Claims-made vs. occurrence coverage transition issues |
| **Pension Plan (Defined Benefit)** | 0-500 (legacy only, if exists) | $5M-$15M annual funding (if underfunded) | **High-risk:** $5M-$50M underfunding liability if exists |

**401(k) Plan Transition Options:**

**Option A: Terminate Mercy 401(k), Transition to National Healthcare Partners' Plan**
- **Advantage:** Simplifies administration, reduces costs (single plan, economies of scale)
- **Disadvantage:** **Accelerated vesting** = $8.5M one-time cost (20% employees × $5,000 average unvested employer contributions = 1,700 × $5,000)
- **Process:** Board resolution, 60-day participant notice (ERISA § 4041), IRS/DOL approval, 100% vesting, distribution/rollover, 6-12 months timeline
- **When triggered:** Employer discontinues contributions to Mercy plan (IRS treats as plan termination for vesting purposes)

**Option B: Continue Mercy 401(k) as Subsidiary Plan (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Advantage:** No accelerated vesting cost, employee continuity, less disruption
- **Disadvantage:** Duplicate administration costs (two plans, two audits, two Form 5500 filings)
- **Timeline:** Continue 12-24 months post-closing, then evaluate merger after integration stabilizes

**Recommendation:** **Continue Mercy 401(k) plan 12-24 months** to avoid $8.5M accelerated vesting cost and reduce employee disruption during uncertain integration period.

**Health Insurance Transition Options:**

**Option A: Terminate Mercy Plan, Transition to National Healthcare Partners' Plan**
- **COBRA obligations:** 18 months continuation at 102% premium (expensive for employees: $1,500-$2,500/month family coverage)
- **ACA compliance:** National Healthcare Partners' plan must meet affordability (employee contribution ≤9.12% household income) and minimum value (≥60% cost coverage); non-compliance = $2,970/FTE penalty
- **Network disruption:** Columbus-area providers may not be in-network for National Healthcare Partners' insurer (Anthem vs. UnitedHealthcare)
- **Deductible restart:** Employees who met Mercy plan deductible lose credit, start over (frustrating mid-year)

**Option B: Continue Mercy Health Plan Temporarily (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Timeline:** Continue through December 31, 2025 (current plan year), transition effective January 1, 2026
- **Advantage:** Aligns with natural open enrollment cycle, maintains network access, no deductible restart
- **Disadvantage:** Duplicate administration costs (two health plans, two insurers/TPAs)

**Recommendation:** **Continue Mercy health plan through calendar year-end 2025**, transition January 1, 2026 to minimize mid-year disruption.

**Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Low Probability, High Impact):**

**Industry Context:** Most U.S. hospitals froze or terminated defined benefit pension plans 1990s-2000s due to funding volatility, PBGC premiums, accounting changes (FAS 87, FAS 158). Mercy likely **401(k)-only** for employees hired post-2000.

**If Legacy Pension Exists:**
- **Standard termination:** Plan must be fully funded (assets ≥ present value of accrued benefits), PBGC approves, benefits paid as lump sums/annuities
- **Underfunding liability:** If plan 80-95% funded, National Healthcare Partners inherits shortfall (**$5M-$50M+** depending on plan size, interest rates, actuarial assumptions)
- **PBGC guarantee limits (2024):** Maximum $7,108/month ($85,295/year) for age 65 retirement; excess benefits paid only if assets sufficient

**Due Diligence Action:** Request **Form 5500 Schedule SB** (single-employer defined benefit actuarial information) to verify pension existence and funding status. If underfunded >$10M, negotiate purchase price adjustment or escrow for funding obligation.

**ERISA Fiduciary Risks:**
- **Prohibited transactions (ERISA § 406):** Cannot use plan assets for PE benefit, engage in self-dealing with parties in interest
- **Prudent expert standard:** PE-driven investment changes must prioritize participant benefits (not PE returns)
- **Recommendation:** Engage independent ERISA counsel to review benefit plan amendments, mergers, asset transfers

### Cross-Domain Impacts (CRITICAL for Memorandum Synthesis)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Issue | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| **PE Integration Layoffs (500-1,000 employees)** | Tax (Ohio Job Creation Credit) | tax-structure-analyst | Ohio job creation tax credit requires retention of 8,500 employees + creation of 150 new jobs; layoffs violate retention commitment, forfeit $2.5M-$3.75M/year state tax credit (50-75% of state tax liability) | **HIGH** |
| **ASC Joint Venture Unwind (STARK/AKS Remediation)** | Healthcare Regulatory → Employment | regulatory-rulemaking-analyst | If Mercy buys out 8 gastroenterologist physician-owners' 50% ASC stake ($1.5M-$2M FMV) to remediate STARK/AKS violation, physicians may exercise change of control termination (severance $2.4M + tail $1.2M = $3.6M total) | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |
| **Physician Departures (20-50 terminate)** | Commercial Contracts (MA/MCO Network Adequacy) | commercial-contracts-analyst | Medicare Advantage contracts require network adequacy; if 20-50 physicians (especially primary care, surgical specialties) terminate, MA plans may invoke change of control termination rights, lose $8M-$17M annual MA revenue (10-20% of $86M Medicare revenue) | **MEDIUM** |

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Tax Credit Coordination:** Structure layoffs **after** securing Ohio job creation tax credit (negotiate with Ohio Development Services Agency for credit effective 12 months post-closing, then implement layoffs Year 2); OR exclude layoff positions from 8,500 baseline (argue 500 laid-off support staff not part of retention commitment, retain 8,000 core clinical staff)
2. **ASC Physician Retention:** Offer retention bonuses $100K-$200K per gastroenterologist (8 physicians × $150K = $1.2M), increase wRVU compensation to offset $35K annual ASC distribution loss
3. **MA Contract Compliance:** Proactive communication with MA plans (Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna) regarding physician retention strategies, demonstrate network adequacy maintenance

### Risk Assessment Summary

**Finding Confidence Levels:**

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **WARN Act triggered by 500-1,000 employee layoffs** | **HIGH** | Statutory certainty (29 U.S.C. § 2101 mass layoff definition 500+), PE acquisition pattern analysis (2024 healthcare WARN notices: UPMC 1,000, Texas Children's 1,000, MGBrigham 1,500) |
| **Physician change of control termination exposure $21M-$33M** | **MEDIUM** | Industry-standard hospital physician employment agreement terms, tail insurance 200-300% premium benchmark (MEDPLI, Horton Group sources), 30-40% probability 20-50 physicians exercise based on PE healthcare M&A patterns |
| **Non-union status** | **MEDIUM** | NLRB database search no results for Mercy, Ohio hospital unionization lower than Northeast/West Coast; requires data room verification (employee handbooks, labor relations files) |
| **401(k) accelerated vesting $8.5M** | **HIGH** | Statutory certainty (IRS plan termination = 100% vesting), calculation based on 20% employees unvested (industry average), $5,000 average employer contribution |
| **Physician non-compete enforceability (Ohio 10-15 miles, 1-2 years)** | **HIGH** | Ohio Supreme Court *Raimonde* reasonableness standard (1975), recent 2024 Ohio case law (McDonald Hopkins, BMD LLC analyses) confirming narrow physician non-competes enforceable |
| **No defined benefit pension plan exists** | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Industry trend (hospitals froze/terminated pensions 1990s-2000s due to FAS 87/158 accounting, PBGC costs); requires Form 5500 verification |

**Quantified Total Exposure:**

| Risk Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Probability-Weighted | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| **ONE-TIME COSTS** |
| WARN Act Violation (if no notice) | $5.1M | $5.4M | $3.6M (70% probability) | **Highly avoidable** with 60-day notice compliance |
| Physician Change of Control Terminations | $21M | $33M | $8.4M (30% probability) | Assumes 50 physicians (7.7% of 650) exercise; **mitigable** with retention bonuses + compensation guarantees |
| 401(k) Accelerated Vesting | $8.5M | $8.5M | $4.25M (50% probability) | **Avoidable** by continuing Mercy plan 12-24 months |
| Union Successorship (if CBAs exist) | $2M | $5M | $0.4M (10% probability) | Low likelihood based on NLRB search, but pending verification |
| Accrued Vacation Payout | $1.2M | $1.2M | $1.2M (100% certain) | Ohio law requires payment at termination |
| Physician Non-Compete Litigation | $1M | $3M | $0.6M (20% probability) | Selective enforcement (high-value specialties only) |
| **Subtotal One-Time** | | | **$18.4M** | |
| **ANNUAL ONGOING COSTS** |
| Ohio Tax Credit Forfeiture | $2.5M | $3.75M | $0.75M (25% probability) | **Mitigable** by structuring layoffs after credit secured or excluding from baseline |
| UI Tax Rate Increase (3 years) | $382K | $1.15M | $1.15M (100% certain) | Unavoidable consequence of mass layoff experience rating |
| **Subtotal Annual** | | | **$1.9M/year × 3 years = $5.7M total** | |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE (3-YEAR HORIZON)** | | | **$24M** | Represents realistic probability-weighted scenario |

**Worst-Case Scenario (No Mitigation):** $19M one-time + $4.2M/year ongoing = **$31M over 3 years**

**Best-Case Scenario (Proactive Mitigation):** $1.2M accrued vacation (unavoidable) + $1.15M/year UI tax (3 years) = **$4.7M over 3 years**

**Realistic Outcome (Partial Mitigation):** **$15M-$25M** over 3 years (WARN compliance, partial physician retention, 401(k) plan continuation, tax credit coordination)

---

### Key Takeaways for Investment Committee

1. **WARN Act compliance is mandatory** - 60-day notice avoids $5.1M-$5.4M liability; highly manageable with proper planning

2. **Physician retention is material revenue risk** - 650 employed physicians drive DHS referrals, admissions, surgical volume; $21M-$33M severance/tail exposure if 20-50 (3-8%) terminate; retention bonuses $3M-$7.5M are cost-effective insurance

3. **Union status requires immediate verification** - NLRB search suggests non-union, but data room review critical; if unions exist, successorship obligations constrain PE integration flexibility

4. **ERISA benefit plan transitions avoid unnecessary costs** - Continue Mercy 401(k) and health plans 12-24 months saves $8.5M accelerated vesting and minimizes employee disruption

5. **Cross-domain coordination essential** - Employment decisions impact Ohio tax credit ($2.5M-$3.75M/year), ASC physician retention ($3.6M), MA contract network adequacy ($8M-$17M revenue risk)

6. **Total employment exposure $15M-$25M realistic** (probability-weighted) vs. $31M worst-case - **manageable through proactive planning**

| **Support Staff** | 3,850 | Environmental services, food service, administration, IT, finance, HR, marketing, billing/coding, medical records, security, facilities/maintenance |

### C. PE Integration Risk Factors

Private equity acquirers typically implement cost-cutting measures post-acquisition:
- Centralize administration functions to PE parent (Nashville)
- Consolidate support functions (IT, finance, HR, payroll, purchasing)
- Outsource environmental services and food service to third-party vendors
- Close low-performing outpatient clinics

**Estimated workforce reduction:** 500-1,000 employees (6-12% of total workforce)

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. WARN ACT COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

#### 1. Statutory Framework and Applicability

**Federal WARN Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109)**

The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires covered employers to provide 60 days' advance written notice before conducting plant closings or mass layoffs.¹

**Covered Employers:**
- Private-sector employers with 100+ employees (excluding part-time)
- OR 100+ employees working at least 4,000 hours/week (exclusive of overtime)²

**Mercy Regional Health System Status:** With 8,500 employees, Mercy is a covered employer under the WARN Act. [VERIFIED: Transaction facts provided]

**Triggering Events:**

**Plant Closing:** Permanent or temporary shutdown of a single employment site causing 50+ employees to lose jobs during any 30-day period.³

**Mass Layoff:** Employment loss at a single site during any 30-day period for:
- 500+ employees (regardless of percentage), OR
- 50-499 employees if they constitute at least 33% of the active workforce⁴

**Employment Loss Definition:** Termination (other than for cause, voluntary quit, or retirement), layoff exceeding 6 months, or reduction in work hours >50% in each month of a 6-month period.⁵

#### 2. PE Integration Scenarios and WARN Triggers

Based on private equity acquisition patterns in healthcare, National Healthcare Partners LLC is likely to implement cost-cutting measures affecting 500-1,000 employees (6-12% of Mercy's workforce).⁶

**Common PE Healthcare Integration Strategies:**

| Function | Reduction Scenario | Estimated Headcount Impact |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Administration (corporate functions) | Centralize to Nashville PE headquarters | 300-400 positions |
| IT, Finance, HR, Payroll | Consolidate to PE shared services center | 100-150 positions |
| Environmental Services | Outsource to Sodexo/Aramark vendors | 100-150 positions |
| Food Services | Outsource to contract vendors | 50-100 positions |
| Outpatient Clinic Staff | Close low-performing locations | 100-200 positions |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED REDUCTION** | | **650-1,000 positions** |

**WARN Act Trigger Analysis:**

**Scenario A: Single-Site Reduction at Flagship Hospital**
- Mercy Regional Medical Center employs approximately 3,000+ employees (525 beds, flagship hospital)⁷
- If PE lays off 500 employees at this single site = 16.7% of site workforce
- **CONCLUSION:** Triggers mass layoff (500+ employees threshold met)

**Scenario B: Multi-Site Aggregation**
- Mercy operates 4 hospitals + 86 outpatient locations = 90 separate sites⁸
- WARN Act applies to "single site of employment"
- **Aggregation Rule (29 U.S.C. § 2102(b)):** If employment losses at 2+ sites within 30 days result from single action/transaction AND sites are geographically close, may constitute single site⁹
- All 4 Mercy hospitals + most outpatient locations are in Franklin County/adjacent counties (Columbus metropolitan area)
- If PE lays off across multiple sites within 30-day period from single integration decision:
  - Regional: 200 employees
  - Northwest: 150 employees
  - East: 100 employees
  - South: 50 employees
  - Outpatient locations: 150 employees
  - **TOTAL: 650 within 30 days = likely aggregated as mass layoff**¹⁰

**HIGH PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:** Any PE integration plan reducing 500+ employees triggers WARN Act obligations (75-85% probability based on typical PE integration timelines and headcount reductions).

#### 3. WARN Act Compliance Requirements

**60-Day Notice Obligation:**

Employer must provide written notice at least 60 calendar days before termination date to:
1. **Affected employees** or their union representatives (if unionized)
2. **State dislocated worker unit** (Ohio Department of Job and Family Services)
3. **Chief elected official** of local government where facility is located¹¹

**Notice Content Requirements:**

For employees:
- Statement whether action is plant closing or mass layoff
- Expected date of first separation and anticipated schedule
- Whether layoffs are expected to be permanent or temporary (if temporary, expected duration)
- Name and telephone number of company official to contact for further information
- Statement of any bumping rights (union seniority-based displacement)¹²

**Exceptions to 60-Day Notice (Rarely Applicable):**

| Exception | Requirements | Applicability to PE Acquisition |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **Faltering Company** | Company actively seeking capital/business; reasonable belief giving notice would prevent obtaining capital | **LOW** - Exception rarely applies post-acquisition when PE already secured financing |
| **Unforeseeable Business Circumstances** | Sudden, dramatic, unexpected circumstances not reasonably foreseeable 60 days prior | **LOW** - Planned PE integration is foreseeable at closing |
| **Natural Disaster** | Flood, earthquake, tornado, etc. | **NOT APPLICABLE** |

#### 4. Penalties for WARN Act Violations

**Back Pay and Benefits:**
- Each affected employee entitled to back pay + value of benefits for each day of violation
- Maximum: 60 days¹³
- **Calculation Example (500 employees):**
  - Average salary: $50,000/year = $137/day
  - 500 employees × $137/day × 60 days = **$4.11 million**
  - Plus benefits (health insurance, 401(k) match): estimated 25-30% of wages = **$1.0-$1.2 million**
  - **TOTAL EXPOSURE: $5.1-$5.3 million**

**Civil Penalty to Local Government:**
- Up to $500 per day of violation, maximum 60 days = **$30,000**¹⁴

**Attorney's Fees and Costs:**
- If employees bring lawsuit, employer liable for prevailing party's attorney's fees + court costs¹⁵

**Total Potential WARN Act Violation Exposure (500 employees, no notice):** **$5.1-$5.4 million**

#### 5. Ohio Mini-WARN Act (Effective September 29, 2025)

**New State Law:** Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed House Bill 96 on July 1, 2025, adding state-specific WARN Act requirements effective September 29, 2025.¹⁶

**Key Provisions:**
- Mirrors federal 60-day notice requirement
- Notice to Ohio Director of Job and Family Services (state dislocated worker unit)
- Applies to same covered employers (100+ employees)
- Supplements federal WARN Act (employers must comply with BOTH)¹⁷

**Impact on Mercy Acquisition:**
- Expected closing Q2-Q3 2025 = after Ohio Mini-WARN effective date
- National Healthcare Partners must comply with both federal WARN Act AND Ohio Mini-WARN
- No substantive differences, but ensures state enforcement mechanism

#### 6. Recent Healthcare WARN Act Notices in Ohio (2024)

**Precedent Layoffs Filed:**

| Healthcare Employer | Location | Employees Affected | Date | Type |
|---------------------|----------|-------------------|------|------|
| ProMedica Employment | Sylvania, OH | 122 | December 2024 | Healthcare services |
| McLaren St. Luke's Hospital | Maumee, OH | 743 | 2024 | Hospital closure |
| Aultman Alliance Community Hospital | Alliance, OH | 56 | 2024 | Hospital layoffs |
| Aultman Hospital | Canton, OH | 97 | 2024 | Hospital layoffs |
| Crothall Healthcare | Youngstown, OH | 88 | 2024 | Healthcare services |
| McLaren WellCare Clinics | Ohio | 118 | 2024 | Clinic closures |¹⁸

**Key Observations:**
1. Ohio healthcare employers routinely file WARN notices for layoffs 50+ employees
2. Hospital closures/consolidations trigger WARN compliance
3. Ohio Department of Job and Family Services actively tracks and publishes WARN notices¹⁹
4. Non-compliance risk is high due to state transparency and enforcement

### B. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS AND UNION REPRESENTATION

#### 1. Union Representation Research

**NLRB Database Search Results:**

Search conducted of NLRB case database (www.nlrb.gov/search/case) for "Mercy Regional Health System" and "Columbus Ohio" healthcare unions (January 24, 2026).²⁰

**Result:** No specific NLRB cases, representation petitions, or unfair labor practice charges found for "Mercy Regional Health System" in Columbus, Ohio.²¹

**Common Healthcare Unions in Ohio:**
- **SEIU District 1199 WV/KY/OH** (Service Employees International Union) - represents healthcare and social service workers²²
- **Ohio Nurses Association** (ONA) (affiliated with American Federation of Teachers, AFT Local 5903)²³
- **National Nurses United** (NNU) / National Nurses Organizing Committee (NNOC)²⁴
- **AFSCME** (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees) - represents some public hospital employees
- **Teamsters** - represents some service/technical workers in healthcare

**Ohio Healthcare Union Context:**
- Hospital unionization in Ohio less common than Northeast (New York, Massachusetts) or West Coast (California)
- Public hospitals (county/municipal) more likely unionized than private non-profit hospitals
- Mercy Regional Health System (private non-profit) = lower unionization probability²⁵

**ASSUMPTION FOR DILIGENCE:** Based on research, Mercy workforce appears **NON-UNION**. However, this requires verification through:
1. **Data room review:** Employee handbooks, HR policies, personnel files
2. **Mercy management representations:** Any CBAs, union election petitions, organizing campaigns
3. **NLRB records search:** Expanded search for any Mercy-affiliated entities, predecessor names

[PENDING VERIFICATION - If unions exist, analysis below applies]

#### 2. Union Successorship Obligations (If Applicable)

**Legal Standard: Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB, 482 U.S. 27 (1987)**

A new employer (successor) must recognize and bargain with an incumbent union if:
1. **Majority continuity:** Majority of successor's workforce in same bargaining unit were employees of predecessor, AND
2. **Substantial continuity:** Successor continues substantially same business operations in same location²⁶

**Application to Mercy Acquisition:**
- National Healthcare Partners continues operating 4 hospitals, same locations, same business (acute care)
- Majority of 8,500 employees retained (even if 500-1,000 laid off, 7,500-8,000 remain = 88-94% continuity)
- **CONCLUSION:** If unions exist at Mercy, National Healthcare Partners is a **Burns successor** obligated to recognize unions²⁷

**Burns Successorship Bargaining Obligations:**

**1. Recognition Obligation:**
- Successor must recognize union as collective bargaining representative
- Union retains certification/recognition status
- No need for new union election²⁸

**2. Bargaining Obligation:**
- Successor must bargain in good faith with union
- **NOT required to adopt predecessor's CBA terms** (wages, benefits, working conditions)
- May implement new terms and conditions, but must bargain to impasse first²⁹

**3. Successor Bar Doctrine:**
- Union entitled to represent employees for "reasonable period" (6-12 months) without challenge to representative status
- Successor cannot withdraw recognition or file decertification petition during successor bar period³⁰
- **2024 Development:** Supreme Court remanded NLRB successor bar case to D.C. Circuit for reconsideration under *Loper Bright* (Chevron deference overturned) - doctrine may be subject to future challenge³¹

#### 3. Effects Bargaining for Layoffs

**NLRB Tramont Manufacturing Decision (2024):**

Even if successor not required to bargain over **decision** to lay off employees, successor **MUST bargain over effects** of layoffs, including:
- Severance pay amounts
- Bumping rights (seniority-based displacement)
- Recall rights (priority for future openings)
- Benefits continuation (health insurance, vacation payout)
- Advance notice period (beyond WARN Act 60 days)³²

**Application to PE Integration:**
- If Mercy unionized, National Healthcare Partners must engage in effects bargaining before implementing 500-1,000 employee layoffs
- Union may negotiate enhanced severance, recall rights, job placement assistance
- Failure to bargain = unfair labor practice under NLRA § 8(a)(5)³³

#### 4. WARN Act + Union Interaction

If CBAs exist, WARN Act notice requirements **supplement** (not replace) union contractual notice requirements:
- Many CBAs require **90-180 days notice** for mass layoffs (longer than WARN 60 days)
- CBAs may require **seniority-based layoff order** (last hired, first fired)
- CBAs may require **union consultation** before finalizing layoff decisions³⁴

**Compliance Strategy:**
- Provide whichever notice period is LONGER (WARN 60 days vs. CBA 90 days = use 90 days)
- Comply with CBA seniority/bumping provisions
- Bargain with union over effects even if decision to lay off is management prerogative

---

### C. PHYSICIAN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS (650 Physicians)

#### 1. Standard Hospital Physician Employment Terms

**Typical Agreement Structure (Industry Standard):**

| Provision | Standard Terms |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Term** | 3 years, automatically renewable unless terminated |
| **Compensation** | Base salary + productivity bonus (wRVU-based) + quality metrics |
| **Benefits** | Health insurance, malpractice insurance (claims-made), CME allowance, vacation/sick leave, 401(k) match |
| **Restrictive Covenants** | Non-compete, non-solicitation (patients/employees/referral sources) |
| **Termination** | For cause (immediate), without cause (90-120 days notice) |
| **Change of Control** | Some agreements allow physician "good reason" termination within 90 days of ownership change |

#### 2. Restrictive Covenants: Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation

**Ohio Legal Standard for Enforceability:**

Ohio courts enforce physician non-compete agreements if restrictions are:
1. **No greater than necessary** to protect employer's legitimate business interests
2. **Do not impose undue hardship** on employee
3. **Not injurious to public** (healthcare access in community)³⁵

**Raimonde v. Van Vlerah (1975) - Ohio Supreme Court:**
Non-compete agreements enforced to extent necessary to protect employer's legitimate interests (patient relationships, referral sources, confidential information). Ohio **rejects strict "blue pencil" test** - courts may modify overly broad restrictions to make reasonable.³⁶

**Reasonable Physician Non-Compete Parameters (Ohio Case Law 2020-2024):**

| Factor | Reasonable Range | Likely Enforceable | Likely Unenforceable |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Geographic Scope** | 10-15 miles from hospital/clinic locations | 10-15 miles within Mercy service area | Statewide, entire county |
| **Duration** | 1-2 years | 1-2 years | 5+ years |
| **Specialty Restriction** | Physician's specialty only (e.g., cardiology) | Cardiology, interventional cardiology | All medical practice |
| **Patient Restriction** | Patients seen by physician during employment | Patients treated in last 2 years | All hospital patients |³⁷

**Mercy Physician Non-Competes (Assumed Standard):**
- **Likely enforceable** if 10-15 miles, 1-2 years, specialty-specific
- Protects Mercy's investment in patient relationships, referral network, credentialing
- Physicians cannot immediately join competitor (OhioHealth, Mount Carmel) or open private practice within restricted area³⁸

**2024-2025 Legislative Developments:**
- **FTC Non-Compete Ban (April 2024):** Final rule banning non-competes, blocked by federal court (Texas) August 2024 - **NOT IN EFFECT**³⁹
- **Ohio Senate Bill 11 (February 2025):** Proposed ban on non-competes for all workers (pending) - if enacted, would void physician non-competes prospectively⁴⁰

#### 3. Change of Control Provisions

**"Good Reason" Termination Triggers (Common in Hospital Physician Agreements):**

Physicians may terminate employment within **60-90 days** of ownership change if:
1. **Material reduction in compensation** (>10-15% decrease in base salary or productivity formula)
2. **Relocation requirement** (>30-50 miles from current practice location)
3. **Adverse change in duties/responsibilities** (reduction in clinical autonomy, administrative burdens)
4. **Breach by employer** (failure to pay compensation, provide malpractice insurance, maintain facilities)⁴¹

**Severance Obligation if Change of Control Exercised:**
- Treated as **"without cause" termination** by employer
- Triggers severance payment: typically **6-12 months base salary + benefits**
- Triggers **tail malpractice insurance** payment obligation (see below)⁴²

**Mercy Acquisition Risk Assessment:**

**Probability Physicians Exercise Change of Control Termination:**
- **Low Risk (5-10%):** If National Healthcare Partners maintains compensation, clinical autonomy, facility quality
- **Medium Risk (20-30%):** If PE imposes administrative burdens (productivity quotas, electronic charting mandates, call schedule changes)
- **High Risk (40-60%):** If PE reduces compensation, centralizes decision-making to Nashville, eliminates services/departments⁴³

**Quantified Exposure (50 Physicians Terminate):**

| Calculation Component | Amount per Physician | 50 Physicians Total |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Base Salary** (average) | $300,000-$500,000 | $15M-$25M (average $400K) |
| **Severance Multiple** | 6-12 months = 0.5-1.0× base | $15M-$25M |
| **Benefits Continuation** | Health insurance, 401(k) match (6-12 months) | $1.5M-$3M |
| **Tail Malpractice Insurance** | $75,000-$250,000 (see below) | $3.75M-$12.5M |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | | **$20M-$40M** |⁴⁴

#### 4. Tail Malpractice Insurance

**Claims-Made Coverage Requirement:**

Most hospital-employed physicians covered by **claims-made** malpractice policies:
- Coverage only for claims **made** during policy period for incidents **occurring** during policy period
- If employment terminates, physician needs **Extended Reporting Endorsement (ERP) / "Tail" Coverage**
- Tail coverage protects physician for claims filed **after** policy ends for incidents during employment⁴⁵

**Tail Insurance Cost:**

**Industry Standard:** 200-300% of annual claims-made policy premium⁴⁶
- **Primary care physicians:** Annual premium $6,000-$12,000 → Tail cost **$12,000-$36,000**
- **Medical specialists** (cardiology, gastroenterology): Annual premium $15,000-$40,000 → Tail cost **$30,000-$120,000**
- **High-risk specialties** (neurosurgery, OB/GYN, cardiac surgery): Annual premium $75,000-$150,000 → Tail cost **$150,000-$450,000**⁴⁷

**Who Pays Tail Coverage? (Contract Negotiation)**

| Termination Scenario | Typical Tail Payment Obligation |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Physician terminates without good reason** (voluntary quit) | Physician pays tail |
| **Employer terminates without cause** | Employer pays tail (or 50/50 split negotiated) |
| **Employer terminates for cause** (misconduct) | Physician pays tail |
| **Change of control / Good reason termination** | Employer pays tail (treated as without cause) |
| **Retirement after long service** (10+ years) | Employer pays tail (retention incentive) |⁴⁸

**Mercy Acquisition Tail Exposure (50 Physicians Change of Control Termination):**

| Specialty Mix | Physicians | Average Tail Cost | Total Tail Exposure |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Primary care | 15 | $25,000 | $375,000 |
| Medical specialists | 20 | $75,000 | $1,500,000 |
| Surgical specialists | 10 | $200,000 | $2,000,000 |
| High-risk (neurosurgery, OB/GYN) | 5 | $300,000 | $1,500,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **50** | | **$5.4M** |⁴⁹

**Combined Physician Termination Exposure (50 physicians):**
- Severance (6-12 months salary + benefits): **$16M-$28M**
- Tail malpractice insurance: **$5.4M**
- **TOTAL: $21M-$33M**⁵⁰

#### 5. Physician Retention Strategies

**Recommendations to Minimize Change of Control Terminations:**

| Strategy | Description | Cost | Effectiveness |
|----------|-------------|------|--------------|
| **Retention Bonuses** | Pay-to-stay bonuses $50K-$150K per physician, payable 6-12 months post-closing if remain employed | $3M-$7.5M (50 physicians × $60K-$150K average) | HIGH - financial incentive counters uncertainty |
| **Compensation Guarantees** | Maintain current compensation formulas for 12-24 months, no productivity quota increases | Revenue neutral (status quo) | HIGH - eliminates income reduction concern |
| **Clinical Autonomy Assurances** | Written commitment to physician-led governance, no administrative burden increases, preserve call schedules | No cost | MEDIUM - requires PE cultural shift |
| **Selective Non-Compete Waivers** | Waive non-competes for physicians who voluntarily terminate (allows joining competitors without litigation) | Competitive harm (physicians join OhioHealth, Mount Carmel) | MEDIUM - reduces legal hostility, shows good faith |
| **Enhanced Benefits** | Improve 401(k) match, CME allowance, vacation time, malpractice coverage (occurrence vs. claims-made) | $1M-$3M annually (8,500 employees) | LOW-MEDIUM - benefits alone insufficient if culture/comp concerns |⁵¹

### D. ERISA EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

#### 1. ERISA Statutory Framework

**Employee Retirement Income Security Act (29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.)**

ERISA regulates employer-sponsored employee benefit plans:
- **Retirement plans:** 401(k), 403(b), defined benefit pensions
- **Welfare plans:** Health insurance, life insurance, disability insurance⁵²

**Fiduciary Duties (ERISA § 404):**
- Plan sponsor (employer) must act prudently and solely in best interests of participants
- Cannot engage in prohibited transactions (self-dealing, conflicts of interest)⁵³

#### 2. Mercy Employee Benefit Plans (Assumed Standard)

| Plan Type | Description | Participants | Annual Cost |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **401(k) Retirement Plan** | Defined contribution, employer match 3-6% of salary | 8,500 employees (full-time eligible) | $15M-$30M employer contributions |
| **Health Insurance** | Medical, dental, vision (likely self-insured for 8,500 employees) | 8,500 employees + dependents | $50M-$80M (employer portion) |
| **Life Insurance** | Group term life (1-2× salary) | 8,500 employees | $2M-$4M premiums |
| **Disability Insurance** | Short-term + long-term disability | 8,500 employees | $3M-$5M premiums |
| **Pension Plan** | Defined benefit (UNLIKELY for hospital post-2000; legacy employees only if exists) | 0-500 employees (if any) | $5M-$15M annual funding (if underfunded) |⁵⁴

#### 3. 401(k) Plan: Termination vs. Continuation

**Option A: Terminate Mercy 401(k) Plan, Transition to National Healthcare Partners' Plan**

**Process:**
1. **Board resolution** to terminate Mercy 401(k) plan
2. **Notice to participants** 60 days before termination (ERISA § 4041)
3. **100% vesting** of all employer contributions (accelerated vesting upon plan termination)⁵⁵
4. **Distribution options:** Roll over to National Healthcare Partners' plan, roll over to IRA, or take cash distribution (taxable)
5. **IRS/DOL approval** - standard termination requires plan fully funded, all benefits distributed
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months to complete termination process⁵⁶

**Advantages:**
- Simplifies administration (single plan for all National Healthcare Partners entities)
- Reduces costs (economies of scale, lower recordkeeping fees)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Accelerated vesting** = increased cost if employees <100% vested (employees gain immediate ownership of employer contributions they would otherwise forfeit)
- Employee disruption (new fund menu, new provider, new website/app)
- Morale impact (change perceived negatively during integration uncertainty)

**Accelerated Vesting Cost Example:**
- Assume 20% of 8,500 employees (1,700) not fully vested in employer contributions
- Average unvested employer contribution: $5,000 per employee
- Accelerated vesting cost: 1,700 × $5,000 = **$8.5 million one-time cost**⁵⁷

**Option B: Continue Mercy 401(k) Plan as Subsidiary Plan**

**Process:**
- National Healthcare Partners adopts Mercy 401(k) plan as subsidiary/affiliated plan
- Maintains separate plan document, trust, recordkeeping
- No accelerated vesting (employees continue vesting per existing schedule)
- Less disruption to employees

**Advantages:**
- No accelerated vesting cost
- Employee continuity (same fund menu, provider, account access)
- Gradual transition option (continue 12-24 months, then merge)

**Disadvantages:**
- Duplicate administration costs (two plan sponsors, two audits, two Form 5500 filings)
- Complexity for National Healthcare Partners (must maintain expertise in Mercy plan terms)

**Recommendation:** **Continue Mercy 401(k) plan 12-24 months** post-closing, then evaluate merger after integration stabilizes. Avoids accelerated vesting cost, reduces employee disruption.⁵⁸

#### 4. Health Insurance: Continuation vs. Transition

**Option A: Terminate Mercy Health Plan, Transition to National Healthcare Partners' Plan**

**COBRA Obligations:**
- Federal COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) requires 18 months continuation coverage for employees who lose coverage due to plan termination
- Employees pay **102% of full premium** (employer no longer subsidizes)
- Expensive for employees (family coverage $1,500-$2,500/month)⁵⁹

**ACA Compliance:**
- If National Healthcare Partners' plan has different terms (higher deductibles, narrower network, higher premiums), must still meet Affordable Care Act standards:
  - **Affordability:** Employee contribution for self-only coverage ≤9.12% of household income (2024)
  - **Minimum value:** Plan covers ≥60% of total allowed costs
- If not affordable/minimum value, large employer faces ACA penalties ($2,970 per FTE for 2024)⁶⁰

**Transition Challenges:**
- Network disruption (Mercy providers may not be in-network for National Healthcare Partners' insurer)
- Deductible restart (employees who met Mercy plan deductible lose credit, start over with National Healthcare Partners' plan)
- Prior authorization headaches (ongoing treatments require new approvals)

**Option B: Continue Mercy Health Plan Temporarily (6-12 Months)**

**Advantages:**
- Maintains network access (Columbus-area providers remain in-network)
- No deductible restart (employees who met deductible retain credit through plan year)
- Less disruption during integration period

**Disadvantages:**
- Duplicate administrative costs (two health plans, two insurers/TPAs, two employee communication platforms)
- Complexity harmonizing plans for open enrollment

**Recommendation:** **Continue Mercy health plan through current plan year** (likely December 31, 2025), transition effective January 1, 2026. Aligns with natural open enrollment cycle, minimizes mid-year disruption.⁶¹

#### 5. Defined Benefit Pension Plan (If Any - Low Probability)

**Research Finding:** Most hospitals terminated or froze defined benefit pension plans 1990s-2000s due to high costs and funding volatility. Mercy likely has **401(k)-only** retirement program for employees hired post-2000.⁶²

**If Legacy Pension Plan Exists:**

**Standard Termination (PBGC):**
- Plan must be **fully funded** (assets ≥ present value of all accrued benefits)
- PBGC (Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) reviews and approves termination
- Benefits paid out as lump sums or annuities (participant choice within limits)⁶³

**Underfunding Liability:**
- If pension underfunded at acquisition, **National Healthcare Partners inherits liability**
- Must make additional contributions to reach fully funded status before termination
- Liability range: $5M-$50M+ depending on plan size, actuarial assumptions, interest rates⁶⁴

**PBGC Guarantee Limits (2024):**
- Maximum guaranteed benefit for plans terminating 2024: **$7,108/month ($85,295/year)** for participants retiring at age 65
- Benefits exceeding guarantee paid only if plan assets sufficient⁶⁵

**Recommendation:** **Data room priority** - request actuarial valuation, Form 5500 Schedule SB (single-employer defined benefit plan) to determine if pension exists and funding status. If underfunded >$10M, negotiate purchase price adjustment or escrow for funding obligation.⁶⁶

#### 6. ERISA Fiduciary Risk

**Prohibited Transactions (ERISA § 406):**

Plan sponsor cannot:
- Use plan assets for own benefit (e.g., acquire employer stock at inflated price)
- Engage in transactions with "parties in interest" (affiliates, service providers) unless exempt⁶⁷

**Acquisition Context Risk:**
- If Mercy 401(k) plan holds Mercy employer securities (unlikely for non-profit), sale to National Healthcare Partners may require independent fiduciary approval
- If pension plan exists, PE-driven investment strategy changes must comply with prudent expert standard (cannot prioritize PE returns over participant benefits)⁶⁸

**Recommendation:** Engage independent ERISA counsel to review all benefit plan amendments, transitions, and asset transfers to ensure no prohibited transactions or fiduciary breaches.⁶⁹

---

### E. STATE EMPLOYMENT LAW (OHIO)

#### 1. Final Paycheck Timing

**Ohio Revised Code § 4113.15:**
- No specific statute requiring immediate final paycheck upon termination
- **General rule:** Employer must pay final wages by **next regular payday** (or within 30 days)
- If employer fails to pay, employee may file wage complaint with Ohio Department of Commerce⁷⁰

#### 2. Accrued Vacation/PTO Payment

**Ohio Law - "Deferred Payment of Earned Benefit":**

Accrued unused vacation is considered **earned compensation** that employee has legal entitlement to:
- **Default rule:** Employer must pay accrued vacation upon termination (treated as wage)
- **Exception:** Employer may adopt written "use-it-or-lose-it" forfeiture policy, IF:
  1. Policy clearly communicated to employees (employee handbook, signed acknowledgment)
  2. Policy applied prospectively (not retroactive to forfeit already-accrued time)⁷¹

**Application to PE Integration:**
- If Mercy pays out accrued vacation at termination (no forfeiture policy), PE must honor for 500-1,000 laid-off employees
- Average accrued vacation: 10-15 days (2-3 weeks)
- **Calculation (500 employees):**
  - 500 employees × 12.5 days average × $192/day (50K salary ÷ 260 work days) = **$1.2 million**⁷²

#### 3. Unemployment Insurance

**Mass Layoff UI Impact:**
- Employers pay UI taxes based on "experience rating" (higher claims = higher tax rate)
- If 500-1,000 employees laid off file UI claims, Mercy's (now National Healthcare Partners') Ohio UI tax rate increases
- UI tax rate increase: 0.5-1.5% of taxable wage base ($9,000 per employee in Ohio)
- **Cost increase:** 8,500 employees × $9,000 × 0.5-1.5% rate increase = **$382,500-$1.15 million annually**⁷³

**Misconduct Disqualification:**
- Employees terminated for cause (misconduct) disqualified from UI benefits
- Reduces employer UI tax impact
- PE should document performance issues, attendance violations, policy breaches for any "for cause" terminations to support misconduct disqualification⁷⁴

#### 4. Ohio COBRA (State Continuation)

**Federal COBRA:** 18 months continuation for employers 20+ employees (Mercy covered)
**Ohio State Continuation:** Ohio does not have separate state continuation law beyond federal COBRA (unlike California, Massachusetts, Connecticut)⁷⁵

---

### F. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACTS

#### 1. Employment → Tax (Ohio Job Creation Tax Credit)

**Issue:** Ohio job creation tax credit (see Tax section) requires commitment to **RETAIN 8,500 employees + CREATE 150 new jobs**.⁷⁶

**Impact:**
- If PE lays off 500-1,000 employees, **violates job retention commitment**
- Forfeiture of tax credit: **$2.5M-$3.75M per year** savings (50-75% of state tax liability)⁷⁷

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Structure layoffs AFTER securing tax credit** (negotiate with Ohio Development Services Agency for credit effective 12 months post-closing, then implement layoffs in Year 2)
- **Exclude layoff positions from retention count** (argue 500 laid-off support staff not part of 8,500 baseline; retention measured against remaining 8,000 core clinical staff)
- **Create offsetting new jobs** (if lay off 500 but hire 500 in different functions, net zero job change may satisfy credit)⁷⁸

#### 2. Employment → Healthcare Regulatory (STARK/AKS - ASC Physician Terminations)

**Issue:** If ASC joint venture unwound (see Healthcare Regulatory section), 8 gastroenterologist physician-owners may terminate employment via change of control provisions.⁷⁹

**Impact:**
- 8 physicians exercise change of control termination
- Severance: 8 × $400K average × 0.75 years = **$2.4 million**
- Tail insurance: 8 × $150K average (gastroenterology specialty) = **$1.2 million**
- **Total: $3.6 million**⁸⁰

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Negotiate ASC unwind physician retention bonuses ($100K-$200K per physician, payable if remain employed 12 months post-unwind)
- Offer enhanced compensation (increase wRVU rate, signing bonus) to offset ASC distribution loss ($35K annually per physician)⁸¹

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure Range | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **WARN Act Violation** (failure to provide 60-day notice before 500+ employee layoffs) | **HIGH** | 60-70% (if PE integration without proper notice) | **$5.1M-$5.4M** (500 employees × 60 days back pay + benefits + $30K civil penalty) | Provide 60-day notice to employees, Ohio DJFS, local government before layoffs; consult employment counsel; stagger layoffs to avoid aggregation |
| **Physician Change of Control Terminations** (20-50 physicians exercise within 90 days of closing) | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | 30-40% (if PE imposes productivity quotas, reduces autonomy) | **$21M-$33M** (severance $16M-$28M + tail insurance $5.4M for 50 physicians) | Offer retention bonuses $50K-$150K per physician; maintain compensation guarantees 12-24 months; communicate clinical autonomy preservation |
| **Union Successorship Obligations** (if unions exist - pending verification) | **MEDIUM** | 10-20% (unions exist) | **$2M-$5M** (CBA wage/benefit enhancements, effects bargaining severance, legal fees) | Verify union status via NLRB search + data room; recognize unions as successors; bargain in good faith over layoff effects; maintain status quo during transition |
| **401(k) Accelerated Vesting** (plan termination triggers 100% vesting) | **MEDIUM** | 50% (if PE terminates Mercy plan) | **$8.5M** (1,700 employees × $5,000 unvested employer contributions) | Continue Mercy 401(k) plan 12-24 months as subsidiary plan; delay termination until natural transition point |
| **Physician Non-Compete Enforcement Costs** (litigation if physicians violate after termination) | **LOW-MEDIUM** | 20-30% (if 10-20 physicians violate) | **$1M-$3M** (legal fees, injunctions, damages if physicians join competitors) | Enforce non-competes selectively (high-value specialties only); consider waiving non-competes for voluntary terminations to reduce litigation hostility |
| **Ohio Job Creation Tax Credit Forfeiture** (layoffs violate retention commitment) | **LOW-MEDIUM** | 20-30% (if layoffs structured poorly) | **$2.5M-$3.75M/year** (tax credit loss, see Tax section) | Structure layoffs after credit secured; exclude layoff positions from retention baseline; create offsetting new jobs |
| **Accrued Vacation Payout** (Ohio requires payment at termination) | **LOW** | 90%+ (certain if layoffs occur) | **$1.2M** (500 employees × 12.5 days × $192/day) | Budget for accrued vacation payout in severance calculations; no mitigation (Ohio law requires payment) |
| **UI Tax Rate Increase** (mass layoff claims increase experience rating) | **LOW** | 90%+ (certain if layoffs occur) | **$382K-$1.15M/year** (ongoing higher UI taxes) | Document "for cause" terminations to support misconduct disqualification; minimize UI tax impact |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Union Representation Status (CRITICAL):**
   - NLRB database search returned no results for "Mercy Regional Health System" Columbus Ohio
   - **Action Required:** Data room review of employee handbooks, HR policies, labor relations files
   - **Management representations:** Any CBAs, union election petitions, organizing campaigns (past 5 years)
   - **If unions exist:** Immediate legal strategy required for successorship, effects bargaining, layoff procedures

2. **Physician Employment Agreement Terms:**
   - **Action Required:** Data room review of physician employment agreements (sample of 50-100)
   - **Key provisions to identify:**
     - Change of control termination rights (percentage with "good reason" provisions)
     - Severance multiples (6 months vs. 12 months)
     - Tail malpractice payment allocation (employer vs. physician)
     - Non-compete geographic scope (10 vs. 15 vs. 20 miles)
     - Non-compete duration (1 vs. 2 years)

3. **Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Unlikely but High-Impact):**
   - **Action Required:** Request Form 5500 filings (past 3 years) to verify pension existence
   - **If pension exists:** Request actuarial valuation report, funding status (assets vs. liabilities)
   - **Threshold concern:** If underfunded >$10M, negotiate purchase price adjustment or escrow

4. **Prior WARN Act Violations or Lawsuits:**
   - **Action Required:** Search Ohio DJFS WARN notices (past 5 years) for any Mercy filings
   - **Litigation search:** Court records for wage/hour, discrimination, wrongful termination cases (past 5 years)
   - **Pattern concerns:** If prior WARN violations or systemic labor issues, increased scrutiny required

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Quantified Employment & Labor Liabilities:**

| Liability Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Probability-Weighted |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| WARN Act Violation (if no notice) | $5.1M | $5.4M | $3.6M (70% probability) |
| Physician Change of Control Terminations (50) | $21M | $33M | $8.4M (30% probability) |
| Union Successorship (if CBAs exist) | $2M | $5M | $0.4M (10% probability) |
| 401(k) Accelerated Vesting (if terminate plan) | $8.5M | $8.5M | $4.25M (50% probability) |
| Accrued Vacation Payout (500 employees) | $1.2M | $1.2M | $1.2M (100% certain) |
| Physician Non-Compete Litigation | $1M | $3M | $0.6M (20% probability) |
| Ohio Tax Credit Forfeiture (annual) | $2.5M | $3.75M | $0.75M (25% probability) |
| UI Tax Rate Increase (annual, 3 years) | $1.15M | $3.45M | $3.45M (100% certain) |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE (One-Time)** | | | **$19M** |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE (Annual Ongoing)** | | | **$4.2M/year** |

**Notes:**
- WARN Act exposure assumes PE implements layoffs without 60-day notice (highly avoidable with proper planning)
- Physician termination exposure assumes 50 physicians (7.7% of 650) exercise change of control rights (conservative mid-range estimate)
- 401(k) accelerated vesting avoidable by continuing Mercy plan 12-24 months
- **Total exposure range $19M one-time + $4.2M/year ongoing** represents **worst-case scenario** if PE mismanages workforce integration

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **WARN Act Compliance is Mandatory and High-Risk:**
   - PE integration likely triggers WARN Act (500-1,000 employee layoffs = 6-12% workforce reduction)
   - 60-day notice required to employees, Ohio DJFS, local government
   - Failure to provide notice = $5.1M-$5.4M liability (back pay + benefits + penalties)
   - Ohio Mini-WARN Act (effective September 29, 2025) supplements federal requirements
   - **No exceptions apply** to planned PE integration layoffs (faltering company, unforeseeable circumstances inapplicable)

2. **Physician Retention is Critical to Revenue Continuity:**
   - 650 employed physicians generate substantial DHS referrals, surgical volume, admissions
   - Change of control provisions allow physicians to terminate within 60-90 days of closing
   - If 20-50 physicians (3-8%) exercise termination rights, severance + tail exposure = $21M-$33M
   - Physician departure also impacts patient relationships, referral networks, service line viability (especially surgical specialties, OB/GYN, cardiology)
   - **Retention strategies essential:** Bonuses, compensation guarantees, autonomy assurances

3. **Union Status Requires Immediate Verification:**
   - NLRB database search returned no results for Mercy (suggests non-union)
   - If unions exist (SEIU, ONA, NNU), National Healthcare Partners is Burns successor
   - Successorship obligations: recognize union, bargain in good faith, effects bargaining for layoffs
   - Union presence significantly constrains PE integration flexibility (seniority-based layoffs, severance negotiations, grievance procedures)
   - **Data room priority:** Employee handbooks, labor relations files, CBA copies

4. **ERISA Benefit Plans Require Careful Transition Planning:**
   - 401(k) plan termination triggers accelerated vesting ($8.5M cost) - **avoidable by continuing plan 12-24 months**
   - Health insurance transition mid-year causes network disruption, deductible restart - **continue through calendar year-end**
   - Defined benefit pension unlikely but high-impact if exists ($5M-$50M underfunding liability) - **verify via Form 5500 review**
   - ERISA fiduciary duties require prudent expert standard - **engage independent ERISA counsel**

5. **Ohio Employment Law Creates Additional Costs:**
   - Accrued vacation payment required at termination ($1.2M for 500 employees)
   - UI tax rate increase from mass layoff claims ($382K-$1.15M annually for 3 years)
   - No Ohio-specific WARN Act enhancements beyond federal (unlike CA, NY, IL)
   - Final paycheck timing flexible (next regular payday) - less restrictive than CA immediate payment

6. **Cross-Domain Coordination Required:**
   - **Employment ↔ Tax:** Layoffs violate Ohio job creation tax credit retention commitment ($2.5M-$3.75M/year forfeiture)
   - **Employment ↔ Healthcare Regulatory:** ASC unwind triggers 8 gastroenterologist terminations ($3.6M severance + tail)
   - **Employment ↔ Commercial Contracts:** MA/MCO contracts may have change of control termination rights if workforce reductions harm network adequacy

### B. Recommended Next Steps

**Pre-Closing Due Diligence (Weeks 1-4):**

1. **Union Verification (CRITICAL - Week 1):**
   - Data room: Request all employee handbooks, HR policies, labor relations files (past 5 years)
   - Management questionnaire: Any CBAs, union elections, organizing campaigns, NLRB charges
   - NLRB expanded search: Mercy-affiliated entities, predecessor names, facility-specific searches
   - Legal strategy: If unions found, prepare successorship memorandum, CBA term analysis, effects bargaining plan

2. **Physician Employment Agreement Review (HIGH PRIORITY - Week 2):**
   - Data room: Request all physician employment agreements (650 total), prioritize sample of 100
   - Key term extraction: Change of control provisions, severance multiples, tail payment allocation, non-compete scope/duration
   - Exposure modeling: Quantify termination risk by specialty, compensation level, tenure
   - Retention strategy: Design tiered retention bonuses ($50K-$150K by specialty), compensation guarantee terms

3. **ERISA Benefit Plan Audit (Week 3):**
   - Data room: Request all ERISA plan documents, SPDs (Summary Plan Descriptions), Form 5500 filings (3 years)
   - 401(k) review: Vesting schedule, employer contribution formula, participant loan balances
   - Pension verification: Form 5500 Schedule SB (if exists), actuarial valuation, funding status
   - Health insurance: Self-insured vs. fully-insured, stop-loss coverage, claims experience, network contracts

4. **Employment Litigation Search (Week 4):**
   - Court records: Federal (PACER) and state (Ohio county courts) searches for wage/hour, discrimination, wrongful termination
   - EEOC/OCRC charges: Request list of all pending/resolved charges (5 years)
   - WARN Act history: Ohio DJFS database search for any prior Mercy WARN notices
   - Pattern assessment: Systemic issues (sexual harassment, retaliation, disability accommodation) requiring remediation

**Post-Closing Integration (Months 1-12):**

5. **WARN Act Compliance Protocol (Month 1-2 before layoffs):**
   - Identify positions for elimination: Administration 300-400, IT 100-150, environmental services 100-150, food service 50-100
   - Aggregate across sites: Calculate whether single-site or multi-site aggregation triggers WARN (500+ threshold)
   - Draft WARN notice: 60-day advance notice to employees, Ohio DJFS Director, Columbus Mayor/County Commissioners
   - Legal review: Employment counsel review of notice content, timing, delivery method
   - **Timeline:** Provide WARN notice Months 3-4, implement layoffs Months 5-6 (after 60-day period)

6. **Physician Retention Campaign (Month 1-3):**
   - Communication plan: CEO town halls, 1-on-1 meetings with department chairs, written commitment to clinical autonomy
   - Retention bonus rollout: Offer letters with $50K-$150K stay bonuses (payable Month 12 if employed)
   - Compensation guarantees: Written assurance no wRVU formula changes, productivity quota increases for 12-24 months
   - Non-compete strategy: Waive non-competes for physicians who voluntarily terminate (reduce litigation hostility, goodwill gesture)

7. **ERISA Benefit Transition (Months 1-12):**
   - 401(k) plan: Continue Mercy plan as subsidiary (no termination, no accelerated vesting)
   - Health insurance: Continue Mercy plan through December 31, 2025; transition to National Healthcare Partners' plan effective January 1, 2026
   - Open enrollment: Joint communication (Mercy + National Healthcare Partners) comparing plans, addressing network/cost concerns
   - COBRA administration: If any employees lose coverage, provide 18-month COBRA election notice within 44 days

8. **Union Relations (If Applicable - Months 1-6):**
   - Union recognition: Formal letter recognizing union as successor bargaining representative
   - Effects bargaining: Negotiate over severance, bumping rights, recall rights for laid-off employees
   - Status quo maintenance: No unilateral changes to wages, benefits, working conditions until bargain to impasse
   - CBA negotiation: If Mercy CBA expires during Year 1, negotiate new agreement (wage increases, benefit continuation)

### C. Outstanding Questions for Management

1. **Union Status:**
   - Are any Mercy employees represented by unions (SEIU, ONA, NNU, AFSCME, Teamsters)?
   - Any union organizing campaigns or election petitions (past 5 years)?
   - Any pending NLRB unfair labor practice charges?

2. **Physician Employment Terms:**
   - What percentage of 650 physician employment agreements include change of control termination provisions?
   - What are standard severance multiples (6 months vs. 12 months base salary)?
   - Who pays tail malpractice insurance if physician terminates (employer vs. physician vs. 50/50)?

3. **ERISA Plans:**
   - Does Mercy sponsor a defined benefit pension plan (for any legacy employees)?
   - If pension exists, what is current funded status (assets vs. liabilities)?
   - What is 401(k) plan vesting schedule (immediate, 3-year cliff, 6-year graded)?

4. **Prior WARN Act Notices:**
   - Has Mercy filed any WARN Act notices (past 5 years)?
   - Any prior workforce reductions >50 employees at single site?

5. **Employment Litigation:**
   - Any pending or threatened wage/hour class actions?
   - Any pending EEOC or Ohio Civil Rights Commission discrimination charges?
   - Any physician non-compete litigation (past 5 years)?

## IX. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)
✓ All relevant statutory authorities researched (WARN Act, NLRA, ERISA, Ohio employment law)
✓ Multiple search strategies employed (federal statutes, case law, NLRB database, state WARN notices, industry benchmarks)
✓ Cross-referenced findings across sources (WARN Act statute + DOL regulations + 2024 healthcare precedents)
✓ Identified gaps clearly documented (union status pending data room verification, physician employment agreement terms assumed from industry standards)

### Confidence Levels
| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| WARN Act statutory requirements (60-day notice, 500+ threshold, penalties) | **HIGH** | Federal statute 29 U.S.C. § 2101, DOL regulations 20 CFR Part 639, Congressional Research Service analysis |
| PE integration triggers mass layoff (500-1,000 employees) | **HIGH** | 2024 healthcare WARN Act precedents (UPMC 1,000, Texas Children's 1,000, MGBrigham 1,500), PE acquisition cost-cutting patterns |
| Physician change of control termination exposure ($21M-$33M for 50 physicians) | **MEDIUM** | Industry-standard employment agreement terms (AAFP, Little Health Law), tail insurance 200-300% premium benchmark (MEDPLI, Horton Group) |
| Non-union status (pending verification) | **MEDIUM** | NLRB database search no results, Ohio hospital unionization lower than Northeast/West Coast; requires data room confirmation |
| 401(k) accelerated vesting ($8.5M if plan terminated) | **HIGH** | IRS statutory requirement (plan termination = 100% vesting), calculation based on 20% employees unvested (industry average) |
| Ohio physician non-compete enforceability (10-15 miles, 1-2 years) | **HIGH** | Ohio Supreme Court *Raimonde* (1975), recent 2024 Ohio case law (McDonald Hopkins, BMD LLC), reasonableness standard consistently applied |

### Known Limitations
1. **Union status unverified:** NLRB database search suggests non-union, but data room review required (employee handbooks, labor relations files, HR records) to confirm absence of CBAs
2. **Physician employment agreement terms assumed:** Used industry-standard hospital physician agreements as proxy; actual Mercy agreements may vary (change of control provisions, severance multiples, tail payment allocation)
3. **ERISA plan details unavailable:** Assumed industry-standard 401(k) 3-6% match, self-insured health insurance; actual vesting schedule, employer contribution formula, pension existence requires Form 5500 review
4. **Accrued vacation/PTO balances unknown:** Calculated $1.2M exposure based on 12.5 days average per employee; actual balances may differ
5. **PE integration timeline/scope uncertain:** Estimated 500-1,000 employee layoffs based on healthcare PE acquisition patterns; actual National Healthcare Partners integration plan unknown
