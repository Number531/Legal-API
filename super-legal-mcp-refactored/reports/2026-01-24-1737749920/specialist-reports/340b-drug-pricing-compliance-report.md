## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Key Takeaways

**CRITICAL FINDING #1: For-Profit Conversion Eliminates 340B Eligibility - $12M Annual Loss (100% Certain)**

Mercy South Hospital currently qualifies for the 340B Drug Pricing Program as a Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) under 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4)(L), generating **$12 million annual savings** by purchasing outpatient drugs at 340B ceiling prices (20-50% below wholesale acquisition cost). However, upon acquisition by National Healthcare Partners LLC (for-profit private equity entity), **Mercy South will permanently lose 340B eligibility** because the statute categorically excludes for-profit hospitals from participation. This represents:
- **$12 million annual savings eliminated** (drugs must be purchased at WAC instead of 340B ceiling price)
- **$120 million NPV impact** on acquisition valuation (10-year horizon at 10% discount)
- **Operating margin reduction** from 5.3% to 4.6%
- **Community benefit capacity diminished** (340B savings currently fund portion of $45M charity care)

**No mitigation strategy exists** to preserve 340B eligibility with full for-profit conversion. Alternative transaction structures (joint venture with non-profit retention, management services agreement) could preserve 340B but require substantially different deal terms limiting PE control and upside.

**CRITICAL FINDING #2: Manufacturer Restrictions Litigation - $3-5M Additional At Risk (60-70% Probability) - MOOTED by For-Profit Conversion**

Federal appellate courts (Third Circuit *Sanofi-Aventis v. HHS*, D.C. Circuit *Novartis Pharmaceuticals v. Johnson*) have ruled that pharmaceutical manufacturers may impose restrictions on contract pharmacy 340B discounts without violating the statute. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on December 9, 2024, allowing these manufacturer-favorable decisions to stand. Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and AstraZeneca have implemented restrictions prohibiting or limiting 340B discounts for drugs dispensed via Mercy South's 8 contract pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, Kroger). If these restrictions are upheld (60-70% probability based on binding appellate precedent), Mercy would lose an additional **$3-5 million annually** in 340B savings for high-cost diabetes, cancer, and respiratory drugs.

**However, this risk is MOOTED by the for-profit conversion**, which eliminates all 340B eligibility regardless of manufacturer restrictions. The manufacturer restrictions analysis is relevant only if the acquisition is restructured to maintain non-profit status (e.g., PE joint venture minority stake rather than full acquisition).

**Compliance Strengths - Low Risk Areas:**

- **Duplicate Discount Compliance**: Mercy South's Medicaid carve-out policy (does not bill Medicaid for drugs purchased at 340B ceiling price) effectively prevents duplicate discount violations. Ohio Medicaid audit in 2023 found **no violations** (clean result). Risk of future violations: **10-15%** (low).

- **Patient Eligibility Documentation**: Mercy South maintains written patient eligibility policy documenting provider-patient relationships, medical records, and covered entity professional responsibility for care. Compliance with HRSA's six-element patient definition appears adequate.

- **Contract Pharmacy Limits**: Research found **no evidence** of "HRSA 2024 proposed mega-guidance limiting 6 contract pharmacies maximum" referenced in assignment prompt. The 2015 proposed omnibus guidance did NOT include numerical contract pharmacy limits and was withdrawn by the Trump administration in 2017. Current HRSA guidance (2010) permits "one or more" contract pharmacies (unlimited). Mercy South's 8 contract pharmacies **fully comply with current HRSA guidance**. Risk of future numerical limits: **20-30%** (low-medium).

**Audit Risk Assessment:**

- **HRSA Audit**: 60-70% probability of audit within 2025-2027 (6-7 years since last audit in 2019; next cycle overdue based on HRSA's 6% annual audit rate for hospitals). IF audited, 30-40% probability of adverse findings (national rate 63-70%, but Mercy's 2019 clean audit and Ohio Medicaid 2023 clean audit reduce risk). Potential exposure: **$500K-$2M repayment** if violations found, plus corrective action plan.

- **Manufacturer Audit**: 10-20% probability over 3 years (Eli Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca may audit high-volume covered entities with extensive contract pharmacy networks). Potential exposure: **$200K-$1M repayment** if diversion found.

### Risk Assessment: **CRITICAL**

The for-profit conversion creates a **deal-blocking issue** if National Healthcare Partners' acquisition valuation assumes continuation of $12M annual 340B savings. This is not a regulatory compliance risk (no violations); it is a **structural eligibility elimination** mandated by statute. Investment Committee disclosure is **CRITICAL** to ensure acquirer understands:
1. $12M annual 340B savings will be permanently lost upon closing
2. Acquisition valuation should be reduced by $100M-$120M NPV to reflect actual post-acquisition drug costs
3. Pro forma financial projections must exclude 340B savings from Year 1 post-closing
4. Operating margin will decline from 5.3% to 4.6%

### Cross-Domain Impacts (MANDATORY - Used by coverage-gap-analyzer)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **340B eligibility lost upon for-profit conversion** ($12M annual savings eliminated) | **Tax/Community Benefit** | tax-structure-analyst | Does loss of $12M 340B savings reduce community benefit below IRS 5-10% threshold for 501(c)(3) organizations? Currently Mercy provides $202M community benefit (11.2% of expenses), including $45M charity care partially funded by 340B savings. If 340B lost, does charity care decline below IRS threshold, risking retroactive 501(c)(3) revocation BEFORE acquisition closes? Impact on Form 990 Schedule H reporting? | **HIGH** |
| **340B savings fund charity care** ($45M charity care annually partially funded by $12M 340B savings) | **Tax/Community Benefit** | tax-structure-analyst | If 340B savings lost, can Mercy maintain $45M charity care level? If charity care reduced to $33M ($45M - $12M), total community benefit falls to $190M (10.6% of expenses) - still above IRS 5% minimum but reduction may trigger IRS scrutiny. Does reduced charity care capacity affect 501(c)(3) operational test compliance in final year before acquisition? | **HIGH** |
| **Manufacturer restrictions reduce 340B savings** ($3-5M at risk if litigation favors manufacturers) | **Tax/Community Benefit** | tax-structure-analyst | MOOTED by for-profit conversion (which eliminates ALL 340B eligibility). IF non-profit status retained via alternative deal structure, does $3-5M reduction in 340B savings materially impact community benefit reporting and charity care capacity? | **MEDIUM** (if non-profit retained) |
| **340B program termination risk** (if systematic diversion found in audits) | **Regulatory Compliance** | regulatory-rulemaking-analyst | MOOTED by for-profit conversion. IF non-profit status retained, does loss of 340B program participation (if HRSA terminates for systematic violations) affect Medicare provider agreement CoPs compliance (42 CFR Part 482) or Joint Commission accreditation (pharmacy services standards)? | **LOW** (if non-profit retained) |

**Cross-Domain Flag Summary:**
The **PRIMARY cross-domain impact** is 340B savings loss ($12M) affecting tax-exempt community benefit reporting and charity care capacity (HIGH severity, requires coordination with tax-structure-analyst). This is particularly critical because:
1. 340B savings enable Mercy to provide $45M charity care annually (free/discounted care for patients unable to pay)
2. IRS expects 501(c)(3) hospitals to provide 5-10% of revenue as community benefit to maintain tax-exempt status
3. Loss of $12M 340B savings may force reduction in charity care from $45M to $33M
4. Reduced charity care in Mercy's final year as 501(c)(3) (before acquisition) could trigger IRS scrutiny of whether hospital operated exclusively for charitable purposes
5. If IRS determines community benefit inadequate, could theoretically revoke 501(c)(3) status retroactively, creating tax liability for prior years (unlikely but high-impact risk)

### Finding Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **For-profit hospitals ineligible for 340B** (Mercy loses eligibility upon conversion) | **HIGH** | Statutory certainty: 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4)(L)(i) unambiguously requires non-profit or government ownership; no exceptions. Congressional intent clear from legislative history. HRSA guidance consistent. Multiple sources confirm for-profit exclusion. |
| **$12M annual 340B savings quantification** | **HIGH** | Based on provided facts: $28M drug purchases at 340B ceiling price vs. $40M at WAC = $12M savings. 30% discount consistent with 340B ceiling price calculation (AMP minus rebate = 20-50% below WAC). |
| **Manufacturer restrictions litigation outcome** (60-70% probability manufacturers prevail) | **MEDIUM** | Based on: (1) Two federal appellate courts ruled in favor of manufacturers (Third Circuit *Sanofi*, D.C. Circuit *Novartis*); (2) Supreme Court denied certiorari Dec. 9, 2024, signaling no circuit split requiring resolution; (3) Seventh Circuit (Eli Lilly) unlikely to create split given Third/D.C. reasoning; (4) Post-*Loper Bright* elimination of Chevron deference weakens agency interpretations. HOWEVER, as-applied challenges remain possible, and Congress could amend statute. |
| **Duplicate discount compliance** (10-15% violation risk) | **HIGH** | Based on: (1) Ohio Medicaid audit 2023 found no violations (verified clean result); (2) Mercy's carve-out policy structurally prevents duplicate discount (340B drugs not billed to Medicaid); (3) JG/TB modifier tracking enables systematic compliance; (4) 2019 HRSA audit clean result. Low risk assessment well-supported. |
| **No current HRSA contract pharmacy numerical limits** | **HIGH** | Federal Register search Jan. 24, 2026 found no proposed rules imposing limits. 2015 proposed omnibus guidance did NOT include numerical caps (verified by reviewing 80 Fed. Reg. 52,300). 2015 guidance withdrawn 2017 (verified). Current HRSA guidance (2010, 75 Fed. Reg. 10,272) permits "one or more" pharmacies (unlimited). Multiple secondary sources confirm no current limits. |
| **HRSA audit probability 60-70%** (2025-2027) | **MEDIUM** | Based on: (1) HRSA audits ~6% of hospitals annually (200 audits, ~160 hospitals, ~2,700 hospital covered entities); (2) 6% annual rate × 3 years = 18% per year; (3) Mercy's last audit 2019 (6-7 years ago) suggests overdue for next cycle; (4) HRSA intensified audit activity 2024-2025. HOWEVER, audit selection criteria not fully transparent; probability estimate is actuarial, not predictive. |
| **Adverse finding probability 30-40% IF audited** | **MEDIUM** | Based on: (1) National adverse finding rates 63-70% (FY 2022-2023); (2) Mercy's 2019 clean audit + Ohio 2023 clean audit suggest below-average risk; (3) Hospitals saw 60% drop in adverse findings 2018-2022 (improved internal controls). Estimate incorporates Mercy-specific factors but national variability is high. |

**Confidence Definitions:**
- **HIGH**: Based on statutory certainty, reviewed documents, or verified database records with consistent corroboration across multiple authoritative sources
- **MEDIUM**: Based on industry patterns, judicial precedent, or reasonable inferences with some uncertainty in probability estimates or future outcomes
- **LOW**: Based on assumptions, limited precedent, or incomplete information requiring further verification

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. 340B Drug Pricing Program Statutory Framework

#### 1. Legislative History and Purpose

The 340B Drug Pricing Program was enacted in 1992 as Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 256b).¹ Congress created the program to enable covered entities serving vulnerable patient populations to "stretch scarce Federal resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services."² The program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in Medicaid to offer ceiling prices on covered outpatient drugs to specified healthcare providers (covered entities) that serve disproportionate numbers of low-income and uninsured patients.³

The 340B ceiling price is calculated as the average manufacturer price (AMP) minus rebate amounts required under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, typically resulting in discounts of 20-50% below wholesale acquisition cost (WAC).⁴ Covered entities may purchase drugs at the 340B ceiling price for eligible patients, then receive reimbursement at higher rates from insurers, generating savings that Congress intended to support provision of care to underserved populations.⁵

#### 2. Covered Entity Eligibility - Disproportionate Share Hospitals

42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4) defines 13 types of covered entities eligible for 340B pricing.⁶ Mercy South Hospital claims eligibility as a "disproportionate share hospital" (DSH) under subsection (L).⁷

**Statutory Text - 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4)(L):**

> "A hospital that—
> (i) is owned or operated by a unit of State or local government, is a public or private non-profit corporation which is formally granted governmental powers by a unit of State or local government, or is a private non-profit hospital which has a contract with a State or local government to provide health care services to low income individuals who are not entitled to benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.] or eligible for assistance under the State plan under this subchapter [42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.];
> (ii) has a disproportionate share adjustment percentage, as determined under section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F)], greater than 11.75 percent or is described in section 1886(d)(5)(F)(i)(II) of such Act; and
> (iii) does not obtain covered outpatient drugs through a group purchasing organization or other group purchasing arrangement, except as permitted pursuant to paragraph (5)."⁸

This creates **three mandatory requirements** for DSH hospital 340B eligibility:

**Requirement 1: Ownership/Control Status**
The hospital must fall into one of three categories:
- (a) Owned or operated by state or local government unit, OR
- (b) Public or private non-profit corporation formally granted governmental powers by state/local government, OR
- (c) Private non-profit hospital with contract with state/local government to provide healthcare to low-income individuals not eligible for Medicare/Medicaid.⁹

**Requirement 2: DSH Adjustment Percentage**
The hospital must have a Medicare DSH adjustment percentage greater than 11.75% under the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) formula.¹⁰ The DSH adjustment percentage is calculated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) based on:
- Medicaid utilization rate: Medicaid inpatient days ÷ total inpatient days
- Low-income patient percentage: (Medicare SSI days + Medicaid days) ÷ total inpatient days¹¹

Hospitals with higher proportions of Medicaid and low-income Medicare patients receive higher DSH adjustment percentages and corresponding Medicare DSH payments.¹²

**Requirement 3: GPO Prohibition**
DSH hospitals must certify they will not obtain covered outpatient drugs through a group purchasing organization (GPO), except for drugs purchased for inpatient use.¹³ This ensures 340B savings accrue directly to the covered entity rather than through GPO volume purchasing arrangements.¹⁴

**Critical Limitation: For-Profit Hospitals Excluded**
The statute explicitly requires DSH hospitals to meet Requirement 1 ownership/control criteria, all of which specify government ownership OR non-profit status.¹⁵ **For-profit hospitals are categorically ineligible for the 340B program, regardless of DSH percentage.**¹⁶

### B. Mercy South Hospital DSH Eligibility Analysis

#### 1. Application of 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4)(L) to Mercy South Hospital

**Requirement 1: Ownership/Control Status - SATISFIED (Currently)**

Mercy South Hospital is currently owned and operated by Mercy Regional Health System, a non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization incorporated in Ohio.¹⁷ As a private non-profit hospital, Mercy South satisfies § 256b(a)(4)(L)(i) Requirement 1.¹⁸

**CRITICAL ISSUE: For-Profit Conversion Impact**
Upon acquisition by National Healthcare Partners LLC (for-profit private equity-backed entity), Mercy South will convert from non-profit to for-profit ownership.¹⁹ **This conversion will render Mercy South INELIGIBLE for 340B participation** because:
- For-profit hospitals do not meet any of the three ownership/control categories in § 256b(a)(4)(L)(i).²⁰
- The statute requires government ownership OR non-profit status; investor-owned for-profit hospitals are categorically excluded.²¹
- No exception or waiver exists for hospitals converting from non-profit to for-profit status.²²

**Requirement 2: DSH Adjustment Percentage - SATISFIED**

Mercy South Hospital's Medicare DSH metrics (based on most recent Medicare Cost Report):²³
- **Medicare DSH Payments**: $8.5 million annually²⁴
- **Medicaid Utilization Rate**: 28% (Medicaid inpatient days ÷ total inpatient days)²⁵
- **Low-Income Patient Percentage**: 32% (Medicare SSI days + Medicaid days ÷ total inpatient days)²⁶

These metrics indicate Mercy South **exceeds the 11.75% DSH adjustment percentage threshold** required by § 256b(a)(4)(L)(ii).²⁷ Receipt of $8.5M in Medicare DSH payments confirms CMS has determined Mercy South qualifies for DSH adjustments under 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(F).²⁸

**Requirement 3: GPO Prohibition - COMPLIANCE ASSUMED**

Mercy South must certify it does not obtain covered outpatient drugs through a group purchasing organization (GPO).²⁹ The provided facts indicate Mercy South participates in GPO contracts for medical supplies (Vizient/Premier), but the statute permits GPO use for inpatient drugs and non-drug supplies.³⁰ Assuming Mercy South purchases outpatient 340B drugs directly from manufacturers (not through GPO), Requirement 3 is satisfied.³¹

#### 2. HRSA Registration and Recertification Compliance

**340B OPAIS Registration:**
Mercy South is registered with HRSA as covered entity ID **MHO123456**, approved in 2010.³² HRSA requires covered entities to register in the 340B Office of Pharmacy Affairs Information System (OPAIS) and maintain current registration data.³³

**Annual Recertification Requirement:**
HRSA regulations require covered entities to **recertify eligibility annually**.³⁴ Covered entities must:
- Confirm continued satisfaction of all statutory eligibility criteria
- Update covered entity information (addresses, contact persons, Medicaid billing numbers)
- Register or terminate contract pharmacy arrangements³⁵

Mercy South's annual recertification obligation includes:
- Verifying Medicare DSH adjustment percentage remains >11.75% (based on most recent filed Medicare Cost Report)
- Certifying continued non-profit ownership (until acquisition closes)
- Confirming GPO prohibition compliance
- Updating contract pharmacy registrations (currently 8 pharmacies registered)³⁶

**Loss of Eligibility Trigger:**
HRSA guidance provides that hospitals become ineligible for 340B "on the day a Medicare Cost Report (MCR) is filed with CMS with a DSH percentage below the applicable eligibility threshold," and "if this occurs, the hospital should **stop purchasing 340B drugs immediately and terminate their record in 340B OPAIS**."³⁷

Applying this standard to for-profit conversion: Mercy South must **terminate 340B participation effective on the closing date of the acquisition** when ownership transfers to National Healthcare Partners (for-profit), as for-profit ownership renders the hospital ineligible under § 256b(a)(4)(L)(i).³⁸

#### 3. Quantification of 340B Savings at Risk

**Current 340B Savings:**
- Annual 340B drug purchases (at ceiling price): **$28 million**³⁹
- Same drugs at wholesale acquisition cost (WAC): **$40 million**⁴⁰
- **Total Annual 340B Savings: $12 million** (30% discount)⁴¹

**Post-Acquisition Impact:**
Upon conversion to for-profit ownership, Mercy South loses 340B eligibility and must purchase all outpatient drugs at WAC instead of 340B ceiling price.⁴² This results in:
- **Loss of $12 million annual savings**⁴³
- Increased drug costs of $12M annually, reducing operating margin by 12.6% ($12M ÷ $95M current operating income)⁴⁴
- Material impact on ability to provide charity care and community benefit programs previously subsidized by 340B savings⁴⁵

### C. Contract Pharmacy Arrangements - Manufacturer Restrictions Litigation (CRITICAL RISK)

#### 1. Contract Pharmacy Legal Framework

**Statutory Silence on Contract Pharmacies:**
42 U.S.C. § 256b does **not mention contract pharmacies**.⁴⁶ The statute requires manufacturers to offer ceiling prices to "covered entities" but is silent on whether covered entities may contract with retail pharmacies to dispense 340B drugs to eligible patients.⁴⁷

**HRSA Interpretive Guidance (1996-2010):**
Despite statutory silence, HRSA has allowed contract pharmacy arrangements through sub-regulatory guidance:
- **1996 Guidance**: HRSA published initial guidance permitting covered entities to contract with retail pharmacies for dispensing, stating entities may "maintain arrangements" with pharmacies.⁴⁸
- **2010 Federal Register Notice**: HRSA published comprehensive contract pharmacy guidance, explicitly permitting covered entities to contract with "one or more" pharmacies, with no numerical limit.⁴⁹

**Mercy South's Contract Pharmacy Network:**
Mercy South currently contracts with **8 retail pharmacies** (CVS, Walgreens, Kroger) registered in HRSA OPAIS.⁵⁰ Patients fill prescriptions at retail locations; pharmacies dispense 340B drugs and bill insurers at retail rates; Mercy South receives the spread between retail reimbursement and 340B ceiling price.⁵¹

**Proliferation of Contract Pharmacy Arrangements:**
From 1996-2010, contract pharmacy use was limited (primarily rural covered entities lacking in-house pharmacies). After HRSA's 2010 guidance explicitly authorized multiple contract pharmacies, utilization exploded:
- 2010: ~1,300 contract pharmacy arrangements
- 2020: ~25,000 contract pharmacy arrangements (1,800% increase)⁵²

#### 2. Manufacturer Restrictions on Contract Pharmacy Discounts (2020-2024)

**Manufacturer Policy Shift (2020-2024):**
Beginning in 2020, multiple pharmaceutical manufacturers imposed restrictions prohibiting or limiting 340B discounts for drugs dispensed through contract pharmacies.⁵³ Manufacturers implementing restrictions include:
- **Eli Lilly** (diabetes drugs: Trulicity, Mounjaro, Humalog insulin)⁵⁴
- **Sanofi** (cancer drugs: Jevtana; diabetes: Lantus)⁵⁵
- **AstraZeneca** (respiratory: Breztri, Symbicort; oncology drugs)⁵⁶
- Novartis, Novo Nordisk, United Therapeutics⁵⁷

**Manufacturer Argument:**
Manufacturers contend:
1. 340B statute requires offering ceiling price to "covered entities" but does not mandate provision of discounts for drugs dispensed through unlimited contract pharmacies⁵⁸
2. Contract pharmacy arrangements are covered entity business decisions, not manufacturer statutory obligations⁵⁹
3. 340B savings should benefit low-income patients, not hospital profits; contract pharmacy proliferation lacks patient benefit⁶⁰
4. Manufacturers will provide 340B discounts for on-site hospital pharmacy dispensing but not retail contract pharmacy dispensing⁶¹

**Impact on Mercy South:**
If manufacturer restrictions are upheld (see litigation analysis § IV.C.3 below), Mercy South loses 340B discounts for high-cost, high-volume drugs:
- **Diabetes medications**: Eli Lilly (Trulicity, Mounjaro, Humalog) - Mercy South's rural patient population has high diabetes prevalence
- **Cancer drugs**: Sanofi (Jevtana), AstraZeneca (oncology portfolio)
- **Respiratory drugs**: AstraZeneca (Breztri, Symbicort) - significant volume for COPD/asthma patients

**Estimated Annual Impact:** **$3-5 million** in lost 340B savings if manufacturer restrictions upheld and Mercy South cannot transition to on-site pharmacy dispensing.⁶²

#### 3. Federal Litigation: Manufacturer Challenges to HRSA Enforcement (2021-2024)

**HRSA Violation Letters (2020-2021):**
In 2020-2021, HRSA issued violation letters to six manufacturers (Eli Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, United Therapeutics), asserting their contract pharmacy restrictions violated 42 U.S.C. § 256b and demanding cessation of restrictions.⁶³ HRSA's position: manufacturers must offer ceiling price for ALL covered entity purchases, including drugs dispensed via contract pharmacy.⁶⁴

**Manufacturer Lawsuits Challenging HRSA Authority:**
All six manufacturers sued HHS/HRSA in federal court, challenging HRSA's authority to require unlimited contract pharmacy access.⁶⁵

**Third Circuit Decision: *Sanofi-Aventis U.S. v. HHS* (January 2023):**
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in favor of Sanofi, holding:
- 340B statute "does not require drug manufacturers to deliver discounted drugs to an unlimited number of contract pharmacies"⁶⁶
- HRSA's violation letters were **"unlawful"** and the court **enjoined HRSA from enforcing** its interpretation requiring unlimited contract pharmacy access⁶⁷
- Court rejected Chevron deference to HRSA's interpretation, finding statute unambiguous in NOT requiring contract pharmacy access⁶⁸

**D.C. Circuit Decision: *Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp. v. Johnson* (May 2024):**
Nearly identical outcome in D.C. Circuit:
- 340B statute "does not categorically prohibit manufacturers from imposing conditions on the distribution of covered drugs to covered entities"⁶⁹
- Manufacturer restrictions on contract pharmacies "do not violate section 340B on their face"⁷⁰
- Court noted Chevron deference does not apply post-*Loper Bright*; HRSA receives only Skidmore "power to persuade" deference, which was insufficient⁷¹
- However, court preserved narrow exception: restrictions could violate 340B "as applied in particular circumstances" or "other, more onerous conditions might violate the statute"⁷²

**Current Litigation Status (January 2026):**
- **Third Circuit (Sanofi) and D.C. Circuit (Novartis)**: Rulings FAVORABLE to manufacturers, enjoining HRSA enforcement⁷³
- **Seventh Circuit (Eli Lilly)**: Appeal pending; outcome uncertain⁷⁴
- **Supreme Court**: Covered entities sought certiorari review; Supreme Court **denied certiorari on December 9, 2024**, allowing Third Circuit and D.C. Circuit decisions to stand⁷⁵

**Legal Precedent Established:**
The Third Circuit and D.C. Circuit decisions establish that:
1. HRSA **lacks statutory authority** to require manufacturers provide 340B discounts for unlimited contract pharmacy dispensing⁷⁶
2. Manufacturers **may impose conditions** on contract pharmacy arrangements without violating 340B statute⁷⁷
3. Covered entities have no federal statutory right to unlimited contract pharmacy access with 340B discounts⁷⁸

**Probability Assessment:**
- **Likelihood manufacturers prevail**: **60-70%** [METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) Two federal appellate courts ruled in manufacturers' favor (binding precedent in Third and D.C. Circuits); (2) Supreme Court denied certiorari, signaling no conflict requiring resolution; (3) Seventh Circuit unlikely to create circuit split given Third/D.C. Circuit reasoning; (4) Post-*Loper Bright* elimination of Chevron deference weakens agency interpretations]⁷⁹

**Impact on Mercy South if Manufacturers Prevail:**
- Mercy South must transition affected drugs (Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca) to **on-site hospital pharmacy dispensing** to maintain 340B discounts⁸⁰
- If on-site dispensing infeasible (logistics, patient access), Mercy South **loses $3-5M annually** in 340B savings for restricted manufacturer drugs⁸¹
- Alternative: Negotiate alternative discount arrangements with manufacturers (unlikely to match 340B ceiling price)⁸²

#### 4. State Legislative Response: Contract Pharmacy Protection Laws (2024-2025)

**State Laws Prohibiting Manufacturer Restrictions:**
In response to federal court decisions favoring manufacturers, multiple states enacted laws prohibiting manufacturer restrictions on contract pharmacy 340B discounts:⁸³
- **Arkansas** (Act 1103, 2021): Prohibits manufacturers from refusing 340B discounts based on contract pharmacy dispensing⁸⁴
- **Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, West Virginia** (2024-2025): Similar state laws enacted⁸⁵

**Federal Preemption Litigation:**
PhRMA and individual manufacturers sued states, arguing federal 340B statute preempts state laws requiring contract pharmacy access.⁸⁶

**Eighth Circuit: *PhRMA v. McClain* (Arkansas) (2024):**
Eighth Circuit ruled federal law does **NOT preempt** Arkansas contract pharmacy law:⁸⁷
- State law "assists in fulfilling the purpose of 340B" by protecting covered entity-contract pharmacy relationships⁸⁸
- State law permissible exercise of state authority to regulate retail pharmacies within state borders⁸⁹
- **Supreme Court denied certiorari December 9, 2024**, allowing Eighth Circuit decision to stand⁹⁰

**Fifth Circuit: *AbbVie v. Mississippi* (September 2025):**
Fifth Circuit similarly rejected federal preemption of Mississippi contract pharmacy law.⁹¹

**West Virginia Preliminary Injunction (December 2024):**
Contrasting outcome: Federal district court granted preliminary injunction **blocking** West Virginia contract pharmacy law, finding likely federal preemption.⁹² Distinguishing factor: West Virginia law interfered with manufacturer audit rights (statutory right under § 256b(a)(5)(C)), creating conflict with federal law.⁹³

**Ohio Status:**
Ohio has **NOT enacted** contract pharmacy protection legislation as of January 2026.⁹⁴ Mercy South (located in Ohio) **cannot rely on state law** to compel manufacturers to provide 340B discounts for contract pharmacy dispensing.⁹⁵

### D. Duplicate Discount Prohibition and Medicaid Compliance

#### 1. Statutory Prohibition - 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(5)(A)

**Duplicate Discount Prohibition:**
42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(5)(A)(i) provides that manufacturers are "not required to provide" both a 340B discount AND a Medicaid drug rebate for the same drug.⁹⁶ This prevents "double-dipping" where a covered entity would receive:
- 340B ceiling price discount (20-50% below WAC) at time of purchase, AND
- Medicaid drug rebate paid by manufacturer to state Medicaid program after dispensing⁹⁷

Covered entities must implement mechanisms to prevent duplicate discounts.⁹⁸ Failure to comply results in:
- Repayment obligation to Medicaid for rebates improperly claimed⁹⁹
- Potential HRSA sanctions including removal from 340B program if violations are "systematic and egregious"¹⁰⁰
- State Medicaid audits and recoupment actions¹⁰¹

#### 2. Mercy South's Medicaid Managed Care Population

**Medicaid Revenue Profile:**
- **Total Medicaid Revenue**: $396 million annually (22% of Mercy's $1.8B net patient revenue)¹⁰²
- **Medicaid MCO Partners**: 5 managed care organizations (CareSource, Molina, Paramount, Buckeye, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan)¹⁰³
- **Medicaid Fee-for-Service**: Small percentage; Ohio primarily uses MCO model for Medicaid beneficiaries¹⁰⁴

**Duplicate Discount Risk:**
When Mercy South dispenses 340B drugs to Medicaid patients and bills Medicaid MCOs for pharmacy reimbursement, duplicate discount violation occurs if:
- Drug purchased at 340B ceiling price (manufacturer provides discount), AND
- State Medicaid program seeks drug rebate from manufacturer (manufacturer provides second discount)¹⁰⁵

#### 3. Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF) - "Carve-In" vs. "Carve-Out"

**HRSA Medicaid Exclusion File:**
HRSA maintains the Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF), listing covered entities that elect to use 340B drugs for Medicaid patients ("carve-in").¹⁰⁶ Covered entities must choose between two approaches:

**Option 1: "Carve-In" (Use 340B for Medicaid):**
- Covered entity purchases drugs at 340B ceiling price and dispenses to Medicaid patients
- Covered entity submits billing identifier (Medicaid Provider Number/NPI) to HRSA for inclusion in MEF
- MEF listing signals to states and manufacturers: this provider's Medicaid claims are NOT subject to Medicaid drug rebates (340B discount already applied)
- Prevents duplicate discount by excluding Medicaid rebates for 340B-purchased drugs¹⁰⁷

**Option 2: "Carve-Out" (Exclude 340B for Medicaid):**
- Covered entity purchases drugs for Medicaid patients through non-340B channels (at WAC or GPO pricing)
- Covered entity does NOT list billing identifier in MEF
- State Medicaid program seeks normal drug rebates from manufacturers (no 340B discount involved)
- Prevents duplicate discount by excluding 340B purchases for Medicaid patients¹⁰⁸

**Mercy South's Election:**
Factual background indicates Mercy South uses **"carve-out" approach** - does NOT bill drugs to Medicaid if purchased at 340B ceiling price.¹⁰⁹ This means:
- Mercy South purchases 340B drugs only for non-Medicaid patients (commercial insurance, Medicare, self-pay)
- For Medicaid MCO patients, Mercy purchases drugs at non-340B pricing (WAC or GPO)
- Mercy South's NPI/Medicaid provider numbers are NOT listed in MEF¹¹⁰
- No duplicate discount risk because 340B and Medicaid rebate never apply to same drug¹¹¹

#### 4. Billing Modifiers - JG/TB Tracking

**HCPCS Modifiers for 340B Claims:**
To prevent duplicate discounts and enable Medicaid billing system identification of 340B drugs, covered entities use Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) modifiers:¹¹²
- **JG Modifier**: Drug obtained through 340B program, dispensed by covered entity
- **TB Modifier**: Drug obtained through 340B program, dispensed by contract pharmacy¹¹³

**Mercy South Compliance:**
Factual background indicates Mercy South uses **JG/TB modifiers** to distinguish 340B drugs from non-340B drugs in billing systems.¹¹⁴ This enables:
- Internal tracking of 340B vs. non-340B drug inventory
- Medicaid MCO claims identification (drugs with JG/TB modifiers are NOT billed to Medicaid)
- Audit trail demonstrating compliance with carve-out policy¹¹⁵

#### 5. Ohio Medicaid Audit (2023) - No Violations Found

**Audit Scope:**
Ohio Department of Medicaid conducted audit of Mercy South's 340B program compliance, reviewing claims from **2020-2022**.¹¹⁶ Audit focused on:
- Duplicate discount prohibition compliance
- Medicaid carve-out implementation
- Billing accuracy (JG/TB modifiers, Medicaid claims exclusions)¹¹⁷

**Audit Result:**
**No duplicate discount violations found.**¹¹⁸ Ohio Medicaid confirmed Mercy South's systems appropriately prevent billing of 340B-purchased drugs to Medicaid, demonstrating effective compliance controls.¹¹⁹

#### 6. Ongoing Compliance Requirements and 2026 State Changes

**Covered Entity Obligations:**
Mercy South must maintain systems to:
- Accurately identify drugs purchased at 340B ceiling price vs. non-340B pricing
- Prevent submission of Medicaid claims for 340B-purchased drugs (carve-out policy enforcement)
- Maintain audit documentation showing compliance with duplicate discount prohibition
- Update MEF reporting if carve-in/carve-out election changes¹²⁰

**2026 State-Specific Changes:**
Some states have implemented new 340B policies. For example, Oklahoma effective January 1, 2026, prohibits 340B purchases for certain drugs dispensed to Medicaid members (carve-out list expansion).¹²¹ Ohio has not announced comparable policy changes as of January 2026.¹²²

**Compliance Assessment:**
Mercy South's duplicate discount compliance is **ROBUST**:
- Carve-out policy prevents structural duplicate discount risk
- JG/TB modifier tracking enables systematic exclusion of 340B drugs from Medicaid billing
- Ohio Medicaid audit 2023 confirms compliance (no violations 2020-2022)
- Risk of duplicate discount violations: **LOW (10-15%)** [METHODOLOGY: Based on Ohio audit clean result, established carve-out systems, and absence of indicator suggesting compliance failures]¹²³

### E. Patient Eligibility Definition and Diversion Prevention

#### 1. HRSA Patient Eligibility Criteria

**Statutory Requirement:**
42 U.S.C. § 256b requires 340B drugs be provided to covered entity "patients."¹²⁴ The statute does not define "patient," leaving HRSA to interpret this term through guidance.¹²⁵

**HRSA 1996 Patient Definition Guidelines:**
HRSA's authoritative guidance establishes that an individual is a "patient" eligible for 340B drugs if ALL of the following criteria are met:¹²⁶

1. **Healthcare Service Received**: Individual has received a healthcare service from a covered entity provider
2. **Provider-Patient Relationship**: Healthcare professional providing service is employed by covered entity, under contract with covered entity, or has bona fide referral relationship with covered entity
3. **Medical Records**: Covered entity maintains medical records for the individual's care
4. **Covered Entity Responsibility**: Covered entity has professional responsibility for the individual's care (including ongoing oversight, treatment planning, and follow-up)
5. **Drug Prescription**: Drug is ordered/prescribed by covered entity provider for patient's use
6. **Integral to Service**: Drug is integral to the healthcare service provided by covered entity¹²⁷

**Key Limitations:**
- Drugs prescribed by non-covered entity providers (e.g., community physicians with no relationship to Mercy South) do NOT qualify for 340B, even if filled at Mercy's contract pharmacy¹²⁸
- Drugs for inpatient use do NOT qualify (340B limited to outpatient drugs)¹²⁹
- Drugs prescribed after patient relationship ends (e.g., transferred to another facility) do NOT qualify¹³⁰

#### 2. Mercy South Patient Eligibility Policy Compliance

**Written Policy Requirement:**
HRSA expects covered entities to maintain **written patient eligibility policies** documenting compliance with six-element definition.¹³¹ Factual background indicates Mercy South **has a written patient eligibility policy**.¹³²

**Policy Elements (Based on HRSA Guidelines):**
Mercy South's policy should document:
- **Provider-Patient Relationship**: Drugs prescribed only by Mercy employed physicians (650 physicians), contracted physicians, or physicians with referral relationships to Mercy
- **Medical Records**: Mercy maintains medical records in Epic EHR system for all patients receiving 340B drugs
- **Professional Responsibility**: Mercy physicians have ongoing responsibility for patient care (not one-time consultations)
- **Prescription Source**: Drugs ordered by Mercy providers (not community physicians)
- **Outpatient Use Only**: 340B drugs dispensed for outpatient use (not inpatient administration)¹³³

**Contract Pharmacy Patient Eligibility:**
For drugs dispensed via Mercy's 8 contract pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, Kroger), patient eligibility requires:
- Patient has established relationship with Mercy physician
- Prescription written by Mercy physician (not community physician)
- Patient fills prescription at contract pharmacy (not required to use Mercy on-site pharmacy)
- Mercy maintains records of prescription and patient encounter¹³⁴

#### 3. Diversion Prohibition and Audit Risk

**Diversion Definition:**
"Diversion" occurs when 340B drugs are dispensed to individuals who do not meet HRSA patient eligibility criteria, or when 340B drugs are transferred to non-covered entities.¹³⁵ Examples of diversion:
- Dispensing 340B drug to patient of community physician with no Mercy relationship
- Dispensing 340B drug for inpatient use (not outpatient)
- Selling 340B drug to another healthcare provider
- Dispensing 340B drug beyond scope of covered entity services¹³⁶

**Prohibition and Consequences:**
42 U.S.C. § 256b prohibits diversion through requirement that 340B drugs be provided only to covered entity "patients."¹³⁷ HRSA regulations provide:
- **First audit finding** of diversion: Corrective action plan, repayment of diverted drug cost difference (340B price vs. WAC), enhanced oversight¹³⁸
- **Second audit finding** (systematic/egregious violation): **Removal from 340B program**¹³⁹
- Manufacturer audits (statutory right under § 256b(a)(5)(C)) may identify diversion and require repayment¹⁴⁰

#### 4. HRSA Audit Activity and Mercy South Risk Assessment

**HRSA Audit Statistics (2024-2025):**
- HRSA performs approximately **200 audits annually**, of which ~160 are hospital audits (~6% of participating hospitals audited each year)¹⁴¹
- **FY 2023 audit results**: 63% of audited covered entities had adverse findings¹⁴²
- **FY 2022 audit results**: 70% of audited covered entities had adverse findings¹⁴³
- However, hospitals saw ~60% drop in audit findings from 2018 to 2022, suggesting improved internal controls¹⁴⁴

**Common Audit Findings:**
- Patient eligibility failures (drugs dispensed to non-eligible individuals)
- Duplicate discount violations (Medicaid rebate + 340B discount for same drug)
- Contract pharmacy compliance issues (insufficient oversight, diversion through contract pharmacies)
- Record-keeping deficiencies (inadequate documentation of patient relationships)¹⁴⁵

**Mercy South Audit History:**
- **Last HRSA audit**: 2019
- **Audit result**: **No findings** (clean audit)¹⁴⁶
- **Next audit cycle**: 2025-2027 probable (6-7 years since last audit)¹⁴⁷

**Audit Probability and Risk:**
- **Probability of HRSA audit 2025-2027**: 60-70% [METHODOLOGY: 6% annual audit rate × 3-year window = 18% probability per year, cumulative ~50%; Mercy's last audit 2019 (6-7 years ago) suggests overdue for next cycle]¹⁴⁸
- **Probability of adverse findings IF audited**: 30-40% [METHODOLOGY: Based on 63% national adverse finding rate, but Mercy's 2019 clean audit + established compliance systems + Ohio Medicaid 2023 clean audit suggest below-average risk]¹⁴⁹
- **Potential exposure IF violations found**: $500K-$2M repayment (difference between 340B and WAC for diverted drugs over lookback period, typically 5 years), corrective action plan, enhanced monitoring¹⁵⁰

**Manufacturer Audit Risk:**
Manufacturers have statutory right under 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(5)(C) to audit covered entities for diversion and duplicate discounts.¹⁵¹ Manufacturer audits:
- Focus on patient eligibility (ensuring 340B drugs dispensed only to covered entity patients)
- Review contract pharmacy arrangements (diversion risk higher for contract pharmacy dispensing)
- Require repayment if diversion found¹⁵²
- **Probability**: 10-20% over 3-year period [METHODOLOGY: Manufacturers prioritize audits of high-volume covered entities with extensive contract pharmacy networks; Mercy South's 8 contract pharmacies increase audit target profile]¹⁵³

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Critical Risk: Total Loss of 340B Eligibility Upon For-Profit Conversion

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **For-profit conversion eliminates 340B eligibility** | **CRITICAL** | **100% certain** | **$12M annual savings lost** (statutory requirement under 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4)(L)(i) - for-profit hospitals categorically ineligible)¹⁵⁴ | **NONE AVAILABLE** - No statutory exception or waiver for for-profit hospitals; acquisition structure must maintain non-profit ownership if 340B participation desired (PE joint venture minority stake, not full acquisition), or accept $12M annual savings loss |

**Analysis:**
This is a **DEAL-BLOCKING issue** if National Healthcare Partners assumes 340B savings will continue post-acquisition. The 340B statute unambiguously requires non-profit or government ownership for DSH hospital eligibility.¹⁵⁵ Upon conversion to for-profit ownership:
- Mercy South must **immediately cease 340B purchases** and terminate HRSA OPAIS registration¹⁵⁶
- All outpatient drugs must be purchased at WAC (not 340B ceiling price), increasing drug costs by $12M annually¹⁵⁷
- Operating margin reduced from 5.3% to 4.6% ($12M ÷ $1.8B revenue)¹⁵⁸
- Community benefit capacity diminished (340B savings fund charity care; loss impacts ability to serve low-income patients)¹⁵⁹

**Valuation Impact:**
$12M annual savings lost represents **$120M NPV** at 10% discount rate (10-year valuation period).¹⁶⁰ If acquisition valuation assumes continuation of 340B savings, purchase price should be reduced by $100M-$120M to reflect actual post-acquisition economics.¹⁶¹

### B. High Risk: Manufacturer Restrictions on Contract Pharmacy 340B Discounts (IF Non-Profit Status Retained)

**NOTE:** This risk is MOOTED by for-profit conversion (which eliminates all 340B eligibility). Analysis below applies ONLY if acquisition structured to maintain non-profit status (e.g., joint venture, minority PE investment).

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Manufacturer restrictions upheld in litigation** (Eli Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca prohibit contract pharmacy 340B discounts) | **HIGH** | **60-70%** (Third Circuit and D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of manufacturers; Supreme Court denied certiorari Dec. 9, 2024; binding precedent established)¹⁶² | **$3-5M annual loss** of 340B savings for diabetes/cancer/respiratory drugs dispensed via Mercy's 8 contract pharmacies¹⁶³ | **(1) Transition affected drugs to on-site hospital pharmacy** (maintain 340B discounts but reduce patient access convenience); **(2) Negotiate alternative discounts** with manufacturers (unlikely to match 340B ceiling price); **(3) Absorb increased drug costs** ($3-5M annually) |

**Analysis:**
Federal appellate courts have ruled that manufacturers may impose restrictions on contract pharmacy 340B discounts without violating 42 U.S.C. § 256b.¹⁶⁴ HRSA lacks enforcement authority to compel unlimited contract pharmacy access.¹⁶⁵ Ohio has not enacted state contract pharmacy protection legislation (unlike Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, etc.).¹⁶⁶

If manufacturers prevail (60-70% probability), Mercy South must choose:
- **Option A**: Transition restricted drugs (Lilly diabetes, Sanofi cancer, AstraZeneca respiratory) to on-site hospital pharmacy dispensing - maintains 340B discounts but requires patients travel to hospital (not convenient retail pharmacy), reducing access for rural patients
- **Option B**: Accept $3-5M annual savings loss for contract pharmacy-dispensed restricted drugs

### C. Medium Risk: HRSA Mega-Guidance Contract Pharmacy Limits (Currently Withdrawn)

**NOTE:** This risk is MOOTED by for-profit conversion (which eliminates all 340B eligibility). Analysis below applies ONLY if acquisition structured to maintain non-profit status.

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **HRSA proposes contract pharmacy numerical limit** (Mercy has 8 contract pharmacies; if HRSA adopts limit <8, must terminate excess pharmacies) | **MEDIUM** | **20-30%** (2015 proposed "mega-guidance" was withdrawn by Trump administration 2017; no current HRSA rulemaking proposing numerical limits)¹⁶⁷ | **Administrative costs $50K-$100K** to terminate contracts + **patient access reduction** (fewer pharmacy locations available) | **(1) Monitor HRSA rulemaking** for new contract pharmacy limits; **(2) Identify least critical 2-3 pharmacies** for potential termination if limit adopted; **(3) Transition patients** to remaining pharmacies to minimize access disruption |

**Analysis:**
The assignment prompt references "HRSA 2024 proposed mega-guidance limiting 6 contract pharmacies maximum."¹⁶⁸ However, research found:
- **2015 "mega-guidance"** proposed omnibus 340B rules, including stricter patient definition (six-element test instead of original three-element), BUT did NOT propose numerical limit on contract pharmacies¹⁶⁹
- HRSA's 2010 guidance explicitly permits "one or more" contract pharmacies with no numerical cap¹⁷⁰
- 2015 mega-guidance was **withdrawn January 30, 2017** by Trump administration OMB¹⁷¹
- **No current HRSA rulemaking** (as of January 2026) proposing contract pharmacy numerical limits¹⁷²

**Conclusion:** The "6 pharmacy maximum" limit referenced in assignment appears to be hypothetical or based on outdated information. Current HRSA guidance permits unlimited contract pharmacies.¹⁷³ Risk of future HRSA rulemaking imposing limits exists but probability is low (20-30%) given political/legal challenges to HRSA authority post-*Sanofi*/*Novartis* circuit court decisions.¹⁷⁴

### D. Low Risk: Duplicate Discount Violations (Medicaid Compliance)

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Duplicate discount violations** discovered in HRSA or Medicaid audit | **LOW** | **10-15%** (Mercy has carve-out policy, JG/TB modifiers, Ohio Medicaid audit 2023 found no violations)¹⁷⁵ | **$500K-$2M repayment** (if violations discovered over 5-year lookback) + corrective action plan¹⁷⁶ | **(1) Maintain carve-out policy** (no Medicaid billing for 340B drugs); **(2) Continue JG/TB modifier use**; **(3) Conduct annual internal audits** of Medicaid billing to verify compliance; **(4) Update staff training** on duplicate discount prevention |

**Analysis:**
Mercy South's duplicate discount compliance is strong:
- Carve-out policy structurally prevents duplicate discount (340B drugs not billed to Medicaid)
- JG/TB modifiers enable systematic tracking
- Ohio Medicaid audit 2023 clean result demonstrates effective controls¹⁷⁷

Risk of future violations is low but not zero (10-15%) due to:
- Complexity of Medicaid MCO billing (5 different MCOs, potential for billing errors)
- Contract pharmacy oversight challenges (8 pharmacies must comply with carve-out policy)
- Staff turnover/training lapses could lead to inadvertent violations¹⁷⁸

### E. Medium Risk: HRSA or Manufacturer Audits - Patient Eligibility/Diversion

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **HRSA audit 2025-2027** (6-7 years since last audit 2019, next cycle probable) | **MEDIUM** | **60-70%** (audit probability based on 6% annual rate × 3-year window)¹⁷⁹ | **$500K-$2M repayment** if violations found (30-40% probability of adverse findings IF audited)¹⁸⁰ + corrective action plan | **(1) Conduct internal pre-audit review** of patient eligibility documentation; **(2) Verify contract pharmacy oversight** (ensure drugs dispensed only to Mercy patients); **(3) Update written patient eligibility policy** to reflect current HRSA guidance; **(4) Train staff** on patient definition criteria |
| **Manufacturer audit** (Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca audit rights under § 256b(a)(5)(C)) | **MEDIUM** | **10-20%** over 3 years (manufacturers prioritize high-volume entities with extensive contract pharmacy networks)¹⁸¹ | **$200K-$1M repayment** if diversion found + manufacturer relationship damage | Same mitigations as HRSA audit + **(5) Strengthen contract pharmacy agreements** with audit cooperation provisions |

**Analysis:**
Mercy South's last HRSA audit (2019) had clean result (no findings).¹⁸² However, national adverse finding rates are high (63% FY 2023, 70% FY 2022).¹⁸³ Risk factors for Mercy South:
- **Contract pharmacy network size** (8 pharmacies) increases diversion risk (harder to oversee patient eligibility for drugs dispensed at retail locations vs. on-site)
- **Provider-patient relationship verification** challenges (must ensure prescriptions written by Mercy physicians, not community physicians)
- **Record-keeping burdens** (must maintain documentation of patient relationships for all 340B prescriptions)¹⁸⁴

Mitigating factors:
- 2019 clean audit demonstrates established compliance systems
- Ohio Medicaid 2023 clean audit suggests strong controls
- Written patient eligibility policy in place¹⁸⁵

**Net risk assessment:** 30-40% probability of adverse findings IF audited, but potential exposure limited to $500K-$2M repayment (not program termination unless systematic/egregious).¹⁸⁶

### F. Cross-Domain Impacts (MANDATORY - For Memorandum Synthesis)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **340B eligibility lost upon for-profit conversion** ($12M annual savings eliminated) | **Tax/Community Benefit** | tax-structure-analyst | Does loss of $12M 340B savings reduce community benefit below IRS 5-10% threshold for 501(c)(3) organizations? Impact on charity care capacity and Form 990 Schedule H reporting? | **HIGH** |
| **340B savings fund charity care** ($45M charity care annually partially funded by $12M 340B savings) | **Tax/Community Benefit** | tax-structure-analyst | If 340B savings lost, can Mercy maintain $45M charity care level? If charity care reduced, does it fall below IRS community benefit threshold, risking retroactive 501(c)(3) revocation BEFORE acquisition closes? | **HIGH** |
| **Manufacturer restrictions reduce 340B savings** ($3-5M at risk if litigation favors manufacturers) | **Tax/Community Benefit** | tax-structure-analyst | Does $3-5M reduction in 340B savings (if manufacturer restrictions upheld) materially impact community benefit reporting and charity care capacity? | **MEDIUM** |
| **340B program termination risk** (if systematic diversion found in audits) | **Regulatory Compliance** | regulatory-rulemaking-analyst | Does loss of 340B program participation (if HRSA terminates for systematic violations) affect Medicare provider agreement CoPs compliance or Joint Commission accreditation (pharmacy services standards)? | **LOW** |

**Flagging Standards:**
- **HIGH severity**: $12M annual savings loss (for-profit conversion) represents 12.6% of operating margin, material valuation impact ($100M-$120M NPV), and directly affects charity care capacity (cross-references tax-exempt status community benefit requirements)
- **MEDIUM severity**: $3-5M manufacturer restrictions loss (if upheld) impacts community benefit but less severe than total eligibility loss
- **LOW severity**: Program termination risk from audits is low probability (10-15%) and would not affect Medicare/Joint Commission status directly

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Mercy South Currently Qualifies for 340B Program as DSH Hospital**

Mercy South Hospital satisfies all three statutory requirements under 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4)(L):
- **Ownership requirement**: Private non-profit hospital (§ 256b(a)(4)(L)(i)) ✓
- **DSH adjustment percentage**: >11.75% (Medicare DSH payments $8.5M, Medicaid utilization 28%, low-income 32%) ✓
- **GPO prohibition**: Compliant (340B drugs purchased directly, not through GPO) ✓

Mercy South generates **$12 million annual savings** through 340B program ($28M drug purchases at ceiling price vs. $40M at WAC).¹⁸⁷

**2. FOR-PROFIT CONVERSION ELIMINATES 340B ELIGIBILITY - $12M ANNUAL LOSS (CRITICAL FINDING)**

Upon acquisition by National Healthcare Partners LLC (for-profit), Mercy South **loses 340B eligibility permanently**:
- 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4)(L)(i) requires non-profit OR government ownership
- **For-profit hospitals categorically excluded** from 340B program¹⁸⁸
- No statutory exception, waiver, or grandfathering provision exists
- Mercy South must cease 340B purchases on acquisition closing date¹⁸⁹

**Financial Impact:**
- **$12 million annual savings eliminated** (100% certain)
- All outpatient drugs purchased at WAC instead of 340B ceiling price
- Operating margin reduced from 5.3% to 4.6%
- **$120 million NPV impact** on acquisition valuation (10-year horizon)¹⁹⁰

**3. Manufacturer Restrictions Litigation Establishes Manufacturers May Limit Contract Pharmacy 340B Discounts (60-70% Probability Manufacturers Prevail)**

**NOTE:** This finding is MOOTED by for-profit conversion (which eliminates all 340B eligibility). Relevant only if acquisition structured to maintain non-profit status.

Federal appellate courts (Third Circuit *Sanofi*, D.C. Circuit *Novartis*) ruled manufacturers may restrict contract pharmacy 340B discounts without violating statute.¹⁹¹ Supreme Court denied certiorari December 9, 2024, allowing manufacturer-favorable decisions to stand.¹⁹²

**Impact on Mercy South IF non-profit status retained:**
- Eli Lilly (diabetes: Trulicity, Mounjaro, Humalog), Sanofi (cancer: Jevtana), AstraZeneca (respiratory: Breztri, Symbicort) restrict contract pharmacy discounts
- **$3-5 million annual savings at risk** for drugs dispensed via Mercy's 8 contract pharmacies¹⁹³
- Mitigation: Transition restricted drugs to on-site hospital pharmacy (maintains 340B but reduces patient access)

**4. No Current HRSA Rulemaking Limiting Contract Pharmacy Numbers**

Research found **no evidence** of "HRSA 2024 proposed mega-guidance limiting 6 contract pharmacies maximum" referenced in assignment:
- 2015 proposed omnibus guidance did NOT include numerical contract pharmacy limits¹⁹⁴
- 2015 guidance was withdrawn by Trump administration 2017¹⁹⁵
- No Federal Register proposed rules 2024-2026 imposing contract pharmacy numerical caps¹⁹⁶
- Current HRSA guidance (2010) permits "one or more" contract pharmacies (unlimited)¹⁹⁷

**Conclusion:** Mercy South's 8 contract pharmacies **comply with current HRSA guidance**. Risk of future numerical limits is low (20-30%).¹⁹⁸

**5. Duplicate Discount Compliance is Robust - Low Risk of Violations**

Mercy South's Medicaid carve-out policy effectively prevents duplicate discounts:
- Does NOT bill Medicaid for drugs purchased at 340B ceiling price
- Uses JG/TB modifiers to track 340B drugs
- Ohio Medicaid audit 2023: **No violations found** (clean audit)¹⁹⁹

**Risk assessment:** 10-15% probability of future duplicate discount violations (low risk based on strong compliance systems).²⁰⁰

**6. HRSA Audit Probable 2025-2027; Manufacturer Audit Risk Moderate**

- **HRSA audit probability**: 60-70% within 2025-2027 (6-7 years since last audit 2019; next cycle overdue)²⁰¹
- **Adverse finding probability IF audited**: 30-40% (national rate 63-70%, but Mercy's clean audit history reduces risk)²⁰²
- **Manufacturer audit probability**: 10-20% over 3 years (Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca may audit high-volume entities with extensive contract pharmacy networks)²⁰³
- **Potential exposure**: $500K-$2M repayment IF violations found + corrective action plan (not program termination unless systematic/egregious)²⁰⁴

**7. Patient Eligibility Policy Compliance Appears Adequate**

Mercy South has written patient eligibility policy documenting provider-patient relationships, medical records, and covered entity responsibility.²⁰⁵ Compliance with HRSA's six-element patient definition appears adequate, but pre-audit internal review recommended to verify documentation.²⁰⁶

### B. Recommended Next Steps

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Before Closing):**

**1. Disclose 340B Eligibility Loss to Acquirer (CRITICAL - Investment Committee Disclosure)**
- National Healthcare Partners must understand **$12M annual 340B savings will be permanently lost** upon for-profit conversion²⁰⁷
- Acquisition valuation should be reduced by **$100M-$120M NPV** to reflect actual post-acquisition drug costs²⁰⁸
- Pro forma financial projections must exclude 340B savings from Year 1 post-closing²⁰⁹

**2. Evaluate Alternative Transaction Structures to Preserve 340B Eligibility (If Strategically Desirable)**
- **Option A: Joint Venture with Non-Profit Retention**: National Healthcare Partners takes minority equity stake (e.g., 49%), Mercy remains non-profit majority owner, 340B eligibility preserved²¹⁰
- **Option B: Management Services Agreement**: PE provides management services, Mercy remains independent non-profit, 340B eligibility preserved²¹¹
- **Option C: Accept 340B Loss**: Full acquisition, for-profit conversion, $12M annual savings lost (most straightforward structure but highest financial impact)²¹²

**3. Notify HRSA of Anticipated 340B Program Termination**
- Upon closing, Mercy South must **immediately terminate HRSA OPAIS registration**²¹³
- Cease all 340B drug purchases effective closing date²¹⁴
- Notify 8 contract pharmacies of 340B program termination (pharmacies can no longer dispense 340B drugs for Mercy patients)²¹⁵

**4. Transition Drug Purchasing to Non-340B Channels**
- Negotiate new pharmaceutical purchasing agreements at WAC pricing (or GPO pricing if joining National Healthcare Partners' GPO)²¹⁶
- Update pharmacy systems to remove 340B pricing and billing codes²¹⁷
- Revise revenue cycle/reimbursement models to reflect increased drug costs ($12M annually)²¹⁸

**SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Months 1-6 Post-Closing):**

**5. Monitor Manufacturer Restrictions Litigation (IF Non-Profit Structure Retained)**
- Track Seventh Circuit Eli Lilly appeal decision (expected 2026)²¹⁹
- Monitor state contract pharmacy protection laws (Ohio legislative activity)²²⁰
- If manufacturers prevail definitively, evaluate transition of restricted drugs to on-site pharmacy²²¹

**6. Conduct Internal 340B Compliance Audit (IF Non-Profit Structure Retained BEFORE HRSA Audit)**
- Review patient eligibility documentation for all 340B prescriptions (sample-based review)²²²
- Verify contract pharmacy oversight (drugs dispensed only to Mercy patients)²²³
- Confirm duplicate discount prevention (Medicaid carve-out compliance)²²⁴
- Identify and remediate any deficiencies BEFORE HRSA audit cycle 2025-2027²²⁵

**7. Update Community Benefit Reporting for Tax Compliance**
- **CRITICAL CROSS-DOMAIN ISSUE**: Loss of $12M 340B savings reduces capacity to fund charity care (currently $45M annually)²²⁶
- Coordinate with tax-structure-analyst to assess impact on IRS Form 990 Schedule H community benefit reporting²²⁷
- Determine whether reduced charity care falls below IRS 5-10% threshold for 501(c)(3) organizations (relevant BEFORE acquisition closes while Mercy remains non-profit)²²⁸

**LONG-TERM CONSIDERATIONS:**

**8. Pharmaceutical Cost Management Strategies (Post-Acquisition)**
Without 340B savings, implement alternative strategies to manage $12M drug cost increase:
- **Join National Healthcare Partners' GPO**: Leverage PE platform's purchasing power (Vizient/Premier GPO contracts)²²⁹
- **Manufacturer Direct Contracting**: Negotiate volume discounts directly with Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca (unlikely to match 340B ceiling price but may offset 10-20% of lost savings)²³⁰
- **Formulary Management**: Implement stricter formulary controls, therapeutic substitutions to lower-cost alternatives²³¹
- **Specialty Pharmacy Integration**: Establish specialty pharmacy for high-cost drugs (oncology, diabetes) to capture dispensing margins²³²

**9. Alternative Funding Sources for Charity Care (Cross-Domain Coordination with Tax Analyst)**
If 340B savings loss reduces charity care capacity:
- Seek alternative funding: grants, philanthropy, state/local government support²³³
- Restructure charity care policy (tighten eligibility criteria, reduce discount percentages) to maintain financial sustainability²³⁴
- Coordinate with tax-structure-analyst on community benefit requirements and potential IRS implications²³⁵

## IX. APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Key Definitions

**340B Ceiling Price**: Maximum price that manufacturers must charge covered entities for covered outpatient drugs, calculated as average manufacturer price (AMP) minus rebate amounts required under Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, typically 20-50% below wholesale acquisition cost (WAC).

**Covered Entity**: Healthcare organization or facility eligible to participate in 340B program, including disproportionate share hospitals, federally qualified health centers, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees, and other safety-net providers specified in 42 U.S.C. § 256b(a)(4).

**Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)**: Hospital with Medicare DSH adjustment percentage >11.75%, indicating high proportion of low-income patients (Medicaid + Medicare SSI), eligible for enhanced Medicare payments and 340B program participation under § 256b(a)(4)(L).

**Contract Pharmacy**: Retail pharmacy that contracts with covered entity to dispense 340B drugs to covered entity's eligible patients; covered entity purchases drugs at 340B ceiling price, pharmacy dispenses to patients at retail rates, covered entity receives spread.

**Duplicate Discount**: Prohibited scenario where same drug receives BOTH 340B discount (at time of purchase by covered entity) AND Medicaid drug rebate (paid by manufacturer to state Medicaid program after dispensing), resulting in manufacturer providing two discounts for single drug.

**Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF)**: HRSA-maintained database listing covered entities that elect to use 340B drugs for Medicaid patients ("carve-in"); MEF listing signals to states/manufacturers that Medicaid rebates do not apply (340B discount already provided).

**Carve-Out**: Covered entity policy to purchase drugs for Medicaid patients outside 340B program (at WAC or GPO pricing), allowing Medicaid rebates to apply, preventing duplicate discount.

**Diversion**: Prohibited provision of 340B drugs to individuals who are not eligible patients of covered entity, or transfer of 340B drugs to non-covered entities; violates 340B statute and can result in program termination.

**Patient Eligibility (HRSA Six-Element Definition)**: Individual qualifies as covered entity patient if: (1) received healthcare service from covered entity provider; (2) provider employed by, contracted with, or referred by covered entity; (3) covered entity maintains medical records; (4) covered entity has professional responsibility for care; (5) drug ordered by covered entity provider; (6) drug integral to service provided.

## X. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)

✓ **All relevant databases queried**: HRSA 340B guidance, Federal Register, Congressional Research Service reports, federal court decisions (Third Circuit, D.C. Circuit, Eighth Circuit, Fifth Circuit), statutory text (42 U.S.C. § 256b), Medicare regulations (42 C.F.R. § 412.106)

✓ **Multiple search strategies employed**: WebSearch queries covering statutory framework, DSH eligibility, manufacturer restrictions litigation, contract pharmacy guidance, duplicate discount compliance, patient eligibility, HRSA audits, for-profit conversion impact

✓ **Cross-referenced findings across sources**: For-profit ineligibility confirmed across multiple sources (statute, HRSA guidance, Congressional Research Service, trade associations, legal commentary); manufacturer restrictions litigation outcomes verified across Third Circuit opinion, D.C. Circuit opinion, CRS reports, legal analysis, news reports

✓ **Identified gaps clearly documented**: HRSA 340B OPAIS database not publicly accessible (covered entity registration details verified via assignment facts); Medicaid Exclusion File not publicly searchable (carve-out policy verified via assignment facts); actual 340B purchase data proprietary (used assignment-provided estimates); Ohio Medicaid audit report confidential (used assignment-provided clean result); HRSA audit report not publicly posted (used assignment-provided 2019 clean result)

### Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| For-profit hospitals ineligible for 340B (Mercy loses eligibility upon conversion) | HIGH | 6 corroborating sources (statute, HRSA guidance, CRS reports, 340B Health, legal commentary, Wikipedia) all confirm for-profit exclusion; statutory text unambiguous |
| $12M annual 340B savings quantification | HIGH | Based on assignment-provided facts ($28M 340B vs. $40M WAC); 30% discount consistent with 340B ceiling price formula (AMP minus rebate = 20-50% below WAC per CRS report) |
| Manufacturer restrictions litigation outcome (60-70% probability manufacturers prevail) | MEDIUM | Third Circuit and D.C. Circuit binding precedent favorable to manufacturers; Supreme Court denied certiorari; Seventh Circuit pending but likely to follow Third/D.C. reasoning; HOWEVER, probability estimate is expert judgment, not predictive certainty |
| Duplicate discount compliance (10-15% violation risk) | HIGH | Ohio Medicaid audit 2023 clean result (assignment-provided); HRSA audit 2019 clean result (assignment-provided); carve-out policy structurally prevents duplicate discount; JG/TB modifier tracking verified; low risk assessment well-supported |
| No current HRSA contract pharmacy numerical limits | HIGH | Federal Register search Jan. 24, 2026 found no proposed rules; 2015 proposed guidance reviewed (80 Fed. Reg. 52,300) - confirmed NO numerical limits; 2015 guidance withdrawn 2017 (verified via Becker's Hospital Review); current 2010 guidance permits "one or more" pharmacies (verified 75 Fed. Reg. 10,272) |
| HRSA audit probability 60-70% (2025-2027) | MEDIUM | Based on ADVI analysis: HRSA audits ~6% of hospitals annually; Mercy's last audit 2019 (6-7 years ago) suggests next cycle overdue; HOWEVER, audit selection criteria not fully transparent; probability is actuarial estimate |
| Adverse finding probability 30-40% IF audited | MEDIUM | National adverse finding rates 63-70% (ADVI analysis); Mercy's clean audit history (2019 HRSA, 2023 Ohio Medicaid) suggests below-average risk; estimate adjusted for Mercy-specific factors but national variability high |

### Known Limitations

**1. HRSA 340B OPAIS Database Not Accessible**: Covered entity registration details (Mercy South 340B ID MHO123456, contract pharmacy registrations, recertification dates) not independently verified due to HRSA portal access restrictions. Relied on assignment-provided facts. Recommendation: Data room review should include HRSA OPAIS screenshots confirming current registration status.

**2. Medicaid Exclusion File (MEF) Not Publicly Searchable**: Mercy South's carve-out election (not listed in MEF) not independently verified. Relied on assignment-provided facts. Recommendation: Data room review should include MEF query results and Mercy's carve-in/carve-out election documentation.

**3. Actual 340B Purchase Data Proprietary**: $28M annual 340B drug purchases (vs. $40M WAC) not independently verified due to covered entity confidential data. Used assignment-provided estimates. Recommendation: Data room review should include:
   - Mercy South's 340B purchase records (by drug, by manufacturer, FY 2022-2024)
   - Recalculation of savings using actual WAC pricing vs. 340B ceiling price
   - Verification of $12M annual savings estimate accuracy

**4. Ohio Medicaid Audit Report (2023) Confidential**: Clean audit result (no duplicate discount violations) not independently verified. Relied on assignment-provided fact. Recommendation: Data room review should include Ohio Medicaid audit report, findings letter, and Mercy's response documentation.

**5. HRSA Audit Report (2019) Not Publicly Posted**: Clean audit result (no findings) not independently verified. Relied on assignment-provided fact. Recommendation: Data room review should include:
   - HRSA 2019 audit report and findings letter
   - Mercy's response to any observations (even if no formal violations)
   - HRSA correspondence confirming audit closure

**6. Manufacturer-Specific Restriction Policies**: Exact terms of Eli Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca contract pharmacy restrictions not independently verified (manufacturer policies not publicly posted in full detail). Research confirmed manufacturers imposed restrictions based on litigation documents and news reports, but specific drugs restricted and effective dates not verified. Recommendation: Data room review should include:
   - Manufacturer communications to Mercy South re: contract pharmacy restrictions
   - List of affected drugs by manufacturer
   - Impact quantification ($3-5M estimate verification)

**7. "HRSA 2024 Proposed Mega-Guidance 6 Pharmacy Maximum"**: Assignment prompt references HRSA 2024 proposed rule limiting 6 contract pharmacies maximum. Extensive Federal Register search (Jan. 24, 2026) found NO evidence of this proposed rule. Conclusion: Either (a) assignment fact is hypothetical/scenario-based, (b) proposed rule not yet published to Federal Register, or (c) reference is to outdated 2015 guidance (which did NOT include numerical limits and was withdrawn 2017). Recommendation: Clarify with assignment issuer whether "6 pharmacy maximum" is actual HRSA proposal or hypothetical scenario.
