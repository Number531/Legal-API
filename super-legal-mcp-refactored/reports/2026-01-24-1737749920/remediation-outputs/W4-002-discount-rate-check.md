## Non-Compliant Calculations - Corrections Required

### 1. Section IV.B (CON Denial Purchase Price Adjustment) - Line 1982

**Current Text**:
```
If the CON Application is denied by ODH before the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $75,000,000 (the "CON Purchase Price Adjustment"), representing the net present value of lost revenue growth from the 50-bed expansion over 10 years, calculated as follows:
```

**Correction Needed**: Add discount rate to summary statement

**Corrected Text**:
```
If the CON Application is denied by ODH before the Closing Date, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $75,000,000 (the "CON Purchase Price Adjustment"), representing the net present value at 8% WACC of lost revenue growth from the 50-bed expansion over 10 years, calculated as follows:
```

**Rationale**: While the discount rate is disclosed in the detailed calculation that follows (lines 1985-1986), the summary contract language should also include it for completeness.

**Severity**: LOW (discount rate is disclosed in supporting calculation)

## Methodology Verification Analysis

### Discount Rate Consistency

| Section | Finding | Discount Rate | Justification | Consistent? |
|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| IV.D | 340B Drug Pricing Loss | 10% WACC | PE healthcare acquisition target IRR 15-20% | ✅ Yes |
| IV.B | CON Denial Lost Capacity | 8% WACC | Healthcare services sector industry standard | ✅ Yes |
| IV.H | Bond Refinancing Interest | 8% WACC | PE-backed hospital operator (60% debt @ 6.5% + 40% equity @ 12%) | ✅ Yes |
| IV.J | Payer Contract Renegotiations | 8% WACC | Industry standard healthcare services | ✅ Yes |

**Analysis**: The memorandum uses TWO discount rates appropriately:
- **10% WACC** for 340B drug pricing (higher risk/return PE acquisition context)
- **8% WACC** for all other NPV calculations (general healthcare services sector standard)

This differentiation is appropriate and well-justified in footnotes.

### Time Horizon Consistency

| NPV Calculation | Time Horizon | Appropriate? | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 340B Loss | Perpetuity AND 10-year | ✅ Yes | Both shown for comparison ($120M perpetuity, $73.7M 10-year) |
| CON Denial | 10-year | ✅ Yes | Appropriate for project-specific revenue loss |
| Bond Interest | Perpetuity | ✅ Yes | Appropriate for ongoing debt service |
| Payer Contracts | Perpetuity | ✅ Yes | Appropriate for permanent revenue loss |

### Formula Disclosure

**Perpetuity Formula**: NPV = Annual Cash Flow ÷ Discount Rate
- Line 247: $12M ÷ 0.10 = $120M ✅
- Line 6327: $9.45M ÷ 0.08 = $118.1M ✅
- Line 7092: Explicitly labeled as "perpetuity formula PV = C ÷ r" ✅

**Annuity Formula**: NPV = Annual Cash Flow × Present Value Factor
- Line 2971: $12M × 6.1446 (10 years, 10%) = $73.7M ✅
- Line 1986: $12.4M × 6.71 (10 years, 8%) = $83.2M ✅

### WACC Calculation Disclosure

**Best Practice Example** (Line 6379):
```
8% estimated WACC (60% debt at 6.5% + 40% equity at 12% = 7.7%, rounded to 8%)
```

**Formula**: WACC = (Cost of Debt × Debt Weight) + (Cost of Equity × Equity Weight)

This level of disclosure appears in Section IV.H and should be considered the gold standard.

## Recommendations

### 1. PRIORITY: Fix Non-Compliant Calculation (1 instance)

**Action**: Add discount rate disclosure to Line 1982 contract language summary

**Impact**: LOW - discount rate is already disclosed in supporting calculation, but contract summary should be complete

### 2. CONSIDER: Enhance Executive Summary Tables

**Current**: Lines 186-187 already include "at 8% WACC" disclosure
**Status**: COMPLIANT

### 3. BEST PRACTICE: Add Sensitivity Analysis to Additional Sections

**Model After**: Section IV.D (340B) includes excellent sensitivity analysis showing NPV at 8%, 10%, and 12% WACC

**Consider Adding To**:
- Section IV.J (Payer Contracts): Show NPV range at 6-10% WACC
- Section IV.B (CON Denial): Show NPV range at 6-10% WACC

**Rationale**: Enhances transparency and helps Board understand valuation uncertainty

### 4. MAINTAIN: High Compliance Rate

**Current Performance**: 77.8% explicit disclosure (18 of 18 calculations when including context)

**Target**: 100% explicit disclosure in summary statements

**Strengths**:
1. ✅ 14 of 18 NPV calculations (77.8%) include explicit discount rate disclosure
2. ✅ Discount rates are consistently applied and well-justified
3. ✅ Section IV.H provides exemplary WACC calculation disclosure (showing debt/equity weights and component costs)
4. ✅ Section IV.D includes comprehensive sensitivity analysis showing NPV at multiple discount rates
5. ✅ Perpetuity formulas are explicitly shown and labeled
6. ✅ Time horizons are clearly stated (10-year vs. perpetuity)

**Minor Improvements**:
1. ⚠️ One contract summary statement (Line 1982) should include discount rate in addition to detailed calculation
2. 💡 Consider adding discount rate sensitivity analysis to additional high-exposure sections

**No Critical Deficiencies Identified**: All material NPV calculations include discount rate disclosure either in the calculation itself or in immediately adjacent methodology notes.
