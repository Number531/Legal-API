**Matter**: Project Hippocrates - Mercy Regional Health System Acquisition
**Prepared for**: National Healthcare Partners LLC
**Date**: January 24, 2026

## I. Healthcare Regulatory Compliance (STARK Law / Anti-Kickback)

**1. Probably Yes.** The Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC ownership arrangement **probably violates** the Stark Law prohibition on physician self-referrals under 42 U.S.C. Section 1395nn. Because the eight employed gastroenterologists hold 33% equity interests in an ASC to which they refer Medicare-eligible patients for designated health services, and neither the in-office ancillary services exception (services not provided in the same building) nor the whole hospital exception (ASC is not a hospital) applies, the arrangement lacks a qualifying exception. The employment exception under Section 1395nn(e)(2) protects only employment compensation, not the ownership returns distributed to physician-owners; CMS requires both relationships to independently satisfy STARK exceptions. Mercy faces mandatory refund liability of $17.6M (6-year lookback of Medicare/Medicaid payments) plus civil monetary penalties up to $27,017 per service and potential False Claims Act exposure of $10M-$50M. See **Section IV.A** for complete STARK/AKS CREAC analysis and remediation options (unwind ASC ownership for $2M-$3M or OIG voluntary self-disclosure for $3M-$5M settlement).

**2. Probably Yes.** The distribution of $35,000 in annual profits to each physician-owner of Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC **probably violates** the Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b(b). Because 85% of the facility's Medicare procedures originate from the eight referring physician-owners, and the investment interest safe harbor under 42 C.F.R. Section 1001.952(a) requires returns to be distributed based on capital contributions rather than the volume or value of referrals, the arrangement fails to qualify for safe harbor protection. Under the AKS "one purpose" test established in *United States v. Greber*, if even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce referrals, a violation exists. Mercy faces criminal penalties of up to $100,000 per violation plus 10 years imprisonment (20% prosecution probability), civil monetary penalties, and CMS exclusion that would terminate $864M annual Medicare revenue. See **Section IV.A** for AKS analysis and the critical requirement that the ASC arrangement be remediated before closing.

## II. Certificate of Need

**3. Probably Yes.** Mercy Regional Medical Center's pending CON application for a 50-bed capacity expansion **probably meets** the statutory criteria for Ohio DOH approval under Ohio Revised Code Section 3702.51 et seq. Because Mercy's current facility occupancy of 88% exceeds the 80% threshold demonstrating community need, and pro forma financial projections show $4M-$12M incremental EBITDA establishing financial viability, the application satisfies the two primary statutory criteria. However, OhioHealth's opposition citing 72% regional market occupancy and cost containment concerns creates a 30-40% denial probability, and ODH denied 2 of 5 hospital bed expansion CONs during 2022-2024 citing market saturation. If denied, Mercy faces $50M-$100M lost capacity NPV over 10 years. See **Section IV.B** for CON approval risk analysis and recommendation to make CON approval a closing condition precedent.

## III. Graduate Medical Education

**4. Probably No.** The surgery residency program **probably will not** face accreditation withdrawal despite its May 2024 probationary status under ACGME Common Program Requirements Section VI.F.1. Because Mercy implemented substantial corrective actions in June-August 2024--hiring two additional surgical faculty (increasing from 8 to 10 attendings), deploying automated Medscheduler duty-hour tracking software, hiring an associate program director, and adding three physician assistants--and has demonstrated 8 consecutive months of sustained compliance with the 80-hour weekly limit, the program has a 70-80% probability of restoration to Continued Accreditation status at the Q2 2025 follow-up. Withdrawal probability is only 5-10%, but if withdrawal occurs, Mercy loses $2.5M/year in direct GME payments plus $7.5M/year in IME payments due to reduced resident-to-bed ratio. See **Section IV.C** for GME accreditation status analysis and recommendation to escrow $2.5M-$5M for 18-24 months.

## IV. 340B Drug Pricing Program

**5. Yes.** Mercy South Hospital's 340B eligibility **will automatically terminate** upon acquisition by National Healthcare Partners LLC. Because 42 U.S.C. Section 256b(a)(4)(L)(i) categorically excludes for-profit hospitals from the 340B program regardless of DSH status, patient population served, or community benefit provided, and HRSA guidance explicitly confirms that "for-profit hospitals are not eligible to participate in the 340B Program," Mercy South loses 340B eligibility "on the day" of closing when ownership transfers to the for-profit acquirer. This is 100% certain with no available exceptions, waivers, or mitigation. Mercy South will lose approximately $12M in annual 340B drug pricing savings (the difference between WAC purchases of $40M and 340B ceiling price purchases of $28M), representing $120M NPV at 10% discount rate. See **Section IV.D** for 340B eligibility loss analysis and GPO consolidation offset strategies ($10M-$15M annual savings potential).

**6. Uncertain (Mooted).** The contract pharmacy limitation question **no longer presents material risk** following the December 2024 Supreme Court denials of certiorari in *Novartis v. HHS* and *Johnson & Johnson v. HHS*. Because the Supreme Court allowed the Third and D.C. Circuit decisions to stand--holding that manufacturers may impose restrictions on contract pharmacy 340B discounts without violating federal law--and because Mercy South's entire 340B eligibility terminates upon for-profit conversion under Question 5, the contract pharmacy issue is academically mooted for transaction purposes. Had 340B eligibility continued, manufacturer restrictions (Eli Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca) would have placed $3-5M annually at risk. See **Section IV.D** for contract pharmacy litigation history and the conclusion that this issue is superseded by the eligibility loss finding.

## V. HIPAA Privacy and Security

**7. Probably Yes.** Mercy Regional Health System **probably faces** findings of willful neglect and penalties of $500,000 to $1.5 million from the ongoing OCR investigation. Because (i) Mercy's last comprehensive Security Rule risk analysis under 45 C.F.R. Section 164.308(a)(1) was conducted in 2019--five years before the March 2024 ransomware attack, during which the threat environment dramatically changed; (ii) backup systems were network-accessible rather than air-gapped, allowing ransomware to encrypt both primary and backup systems in violation of the contingency plan requirement at Section 164.308(a)(7); and (iii) protected health information was stored unencrypted despite the addressable encryption specification at Section 164.312(a)(2)--OCR precedent in comparable ransomware breaches (*Premera*, *Anthem*, *BST & Co.*) consistently imposes penalties in this range. Additionally, class action exposure ranges from $5M-$15M (70% probability) based on *In re Anthem* and *In re Premera* settlements ($115-$74 per record). Total exposure: $8M-$21.5M. See **Section IV.E** for HIPAA Security Rule violation analysis and recommendation to escrow $16M pending OCR settlement.

## VI. Joint Commission Accreditation

**8. Probably No.** Mercy Regional Medical Center's Medicare deemed status **probably will not** be downgraded to provisional accreditation or denied following the March 2025 follow-up survey. Because the October 2024 survey resulted in "Accreditation with Requirements for Improvement" (not Conditional Accreditation or Denial), and Mercy has implemented substantive corrective actions for all eight deficiencies--including automated medication expiration tracking (99.7% compliance), hand hygiene improvement to 88% (approaching 90% target), fire door compliance verification, and completion of Dr. Wilson's primary source credentialing verification--the hospital has a 75-80% probability of restoration to full accreditation. However, the timing coincidence with Q2 2025 closing creates transaction risk: conditional accreditation (15-20% probability) would trigger CMS notification and potential state licensure complications costing $250K-$500K in remediation expenses; preliminary denial (<5% probability) would require CMS direct certification survey before Medicare billing could continue. See **Section IV.F** for Joint Commission deficiency analysis and recommendation to achieve sustained 90% hand hygiene compliance before March 2025 survey.

## VII. Tax-Exempt Conversion

**9. Yes.** National Healthcare Partners LLC's acquisition of Mercy Regional Health System **will automatically terminate** Mercy's tax-exempt status under IRC Section 501(c)(3). Because for-profit ownership by a private equity entity eliminates operation "exclusively for charitable purposes" as required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.501(c)(3)-1, and IRS Technical Advice Memoranda consistently hold that nonprofit hospitals lose 501(c)(3) status upon for-profit conversion regardless of continued charitable activities, the conversion is 100% certain with no exceptions available. The resulting conversion triggers approximately $36.43 million in new annual tax obligations: $15.12M federal income tax (21% of $72M net income), $4.66M Ohio commercial activity tax (0.26% of $1.794B taxable gross receipts), $10.80M property tax (1.8% effective rate on $600M assessed value), and $5.85M sales tax (6.5% on $90M previously exempt purchases). Tax minimization strategies (bonus depreciation, Ohio JCTC) can reduce Year 1 taxes to $16.31M. See **Section IV.G** for tax-exempt conversion analysis and tax minimization implementation roadmap.

## VIII. Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption

**10. Yes.** The for-profit conversion **will trigger mandatory redemption** of the $420 million tax-exempt revenue bonds at 102% of principal ($428.4M). Because IRC Section 141 private activity bond rules require that tax-exempt bond-financed property not be used by private business entities exceeding the 10% limit, and National Healthcare Partners' for-profit ownership causes 100% private business use effective immediately upon closing, the bonds lose tax-exempt status and the bond indenture's change-of-use provisions trigger acceleration. The 102% make-whole premium ($8.4M above principal) is required under the 2016 indenture terms. Subsequent refinancing at taxable rates of approximately 6.5% (versus the current 4.25% tax-exempt rate) results in $9.45M in additional annual interest expense perpetually (calculated as $420M x 2.25% rate differential). Combined with $43.2M property tax recapture (4 years retroactive at $10.8M/year), total one-time closing cash requirement is $471.6M. See **Section IV.H** for bond redemption mechanics, refinancing options, and covenant breach risk analysis (40% probability DSCR violation in Years 1-3).

## IX. Employment and Labor

**11. Probably Yes.** The anticipated post-acquisition workforce integration **probably constitutes** a "mass layoff" requiring 60-day WARN Act notice under 29 U.S.C. Section 2101. Because termination of 500-1,000 administrative and support positions across Mercy's 8,500-employee workforce exceeds both the 500-employee threshold and the one-third-of-workforce threshold for multi-site aggregation under 20 C.F.R. Section 639.3, and PE integration historically reduces hospital administrative headcount by 10-15% (8,500 x 12% = 1,020 potential terminations), the WARN Act thresholds are 75-85% likely to be triggered. Back-pay liability without proper notice is $5.1M-$5.4M, calculated as 500 employees x $10,275-$10,686 per employee (60 days average compensation plus benefits) plus $30,000 civil penalty. **This liability is entirely avoidable** with proper 60-day advance written notice to employees, Ohio DJFS, and Franklin County officials. See **Section IV.I** for WARN Act compliance protocol, notice template, and alternative approaches (staggered layoffs >30 days apart to avoid aggregation).

## X. Commercial Contracts and Payer Relationships

**12. Probably Yes.** Medicare Advantage payers **probably have** contractual termination rights exercisable upon 30-90 days' notice following for-profit conversion, and 1-2 plans exercising such rights would cause $22M-$45M annual revenue loss. Because change-of-control provisions in Mercy's eight MA network participation agreements (Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Anthem, and four others) provide payers contractual rights to terminate for convenience or renegotiate rates upon ownership change, and payers historically reassess nonprofit relationships when conversion eliminates community benefit rationale, the 20-30% probability that 1-2 plans terminate (representing 10-20% of $180M MA revenue) is material. Network adequacy requirements under 42 C.F.R. Section 422.116 provide defensive leverage--MAOs cannot terminate without adequate alternative network coverage--but this protection is strongest for Mercy's Lancaster facility (sole provider) and weakest in Columbus (multiple hospital alternatives). Medicaid MCO renegotiation risk is 30-40% probability of 5-10% rate cuts across $396M MCO revenue; commercial payer rate pressure is 50-60% probability of 5-10% cuts across $432M commercial revenue. Total payer-related exposure: $63.6M-$128.2M annual gross, $22.8M-$60.5M probability-weighted. See **Section IV.J** for payer contract analysis, network adequacy documentation strategy, and recommendation for pre-closing payer engagement to negotiate 12-24 month rate stability agreements.
