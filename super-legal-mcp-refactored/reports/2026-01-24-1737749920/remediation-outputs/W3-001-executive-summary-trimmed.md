# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Mercy Regional Health System Acquisition
**Prepared for**: National Healthcare Partners LLC Board of Directors
**Date**: January 24, 2026
**Transaction**: $2.4 billion acquisition of Mercy Regional Health System (4 hospitals, 8,500 employees, $1.8B revenue, $72M EBITDA)

---

## TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: **PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS**

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

National Healthcare Partners should proceed with the Mercy Regional Health System acquisition **only if the purchase price is reduced to $1.9B-$2.1B** (15-21% reduction) and critical conditions are satisfied. The nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion triggers $57.88M/year in structural cost increases (taxes $36.43M, 340B loss $12M, bond interest $9.45M) plus $22.8M-$60.5M/year in probability-weighted revenue pressure from payer contract renegotiations. Risk severity: **HIGH** across regulatory, financial, and operational domains.

**Immediate Board Decision Required**: Approve revised offer of $1.9B-$2.1B or walk away if seller rejects adjusted pricing.

### Rationale

Due diligence reveals a transaction fundamentally different from the underwritten pro forma. While Mercy operates quality facilities with strategic assets (Level II trauma center, teaching hospital, sole provider status in Lancaster), the nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion triggers cascading financial impacts totaling $147M-$186M in combined annual exposure:

**Structural Cost Increases (100% Certain)**: 340B eligibility loss ($12M/year), new operating taxes ($36.43M/year), additional bond interest ($9.45M/year) = **$57.88M/year**

**Revenue Pressure (High Probability)**: Medicare Advantage terminations ($4.4M-$13.5M/year), Medicaid MCO rate cuts ($6M-$16M/year), commercial payer pressure ($10.8M-$25.9M/year), HIPAA breach BAA terminations ($1.6M-$5.1M/year) = **$22.8M-$60.5M/year probability-weighted**

**Combined Impact**: $80.7M-$118.4M annual EBITDA reduction, converting Mercy's $95M operating income to **-$23.4M to $14.3M** post-conversion. Transaction viable **only with significant price adjustment** ($300M-$500M reduction) and aggressive post-closing mitigation.

---

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **Purchase Price Reduction to $1.9B-$2.1B**: Seller must accept 15-21% reduction reflecting structural EBITDA compression from tax conversion and 340B loss. Alternative: Seller finances $300M-$500M through subordinated seller note. **See Section II for detailed valuation analysis**.

2. **$68M-$90M Escrow Structure** (staged release over 36 months):
   - $16M HIPAA/OCR escrow (released upon OCR settlement and class action resolution)
   - $12M employment/labor escrow (released after 18-month WARN Act/physician retention window)
   - $10M commercial payer escrow (released after 24 months if no MA/MCO terminations)
   - $30M-$52M additional regulatory/operational escrow (CON approval, Joint Commission follow-up, bond covenant compliance buffer)

3. **Pre-Closing STARK/AKS Remediation**: Seller must unwind or restructure the ASC ownership arrangement (15% physician ownership creating private inurement risk) **before closing** to eliminate $150M-$170M IRS retroactive revocation exposure. Non-negotiable: acquisition will not proceed with unresolved federal healthcare fraud exposure. **See Section IV.A**.

4. **Certificate of Need (CON) Approval**: Ohio Department of Health approval for transfer of Mercy South Hospital's 180-bed license is **required before closing**. Denial probability 10-15%, but would eliminate Lancaster market access and reduce valuation by $400M-$600M. Structure CON approval as condition precedent. **See Section IV.B**.

5. **340B Loss Mitigation or Pricing Recognition**: Since 340B eligibility loss ($12M/year = $120M NPV) is 100% certain and unavoidable, either (a) reduce purchase price by $120M, or (b) commit to post-closing GPO consolidation generating equivalent $10M-$15M annual savings offset. **See Section IV.D**.

6. **Tax Minimization Strategy Implementation**: Engage tax advisors immediately to implement IRC Section 338(h)(10) election, bonus depreciation acceleration, Ohio JCTC preservation/expansion, and REIT sale-leaseback. These strategies can reduce Year 1 taxes from $36.43M to $16.31M and Years 2-10 to $28.28M. **See Section IV.G**.

7. **Payer Contract Stability**: National Healthcare Partners must engage with top 5 payers (Blue Cross/Anthem, Humana, UnitedHealthcare, CareSource, Molina) **before closing** to negotiate rate stability agreements or grandfather periods (12-24 months). Without payer commitments, commercial revenue risk ($21.6M-$43.2M annual) threatens DSCR covenant compliance. **See Section IV.J**.

|----------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Purchase Price Reduction** | **$300M-$500M** | Structural EBITDA decline ($92.7M-$130.4M annual) x 5-6x multiple = $463M-$782M value destruction | **CRITICAL** |

## SCENARIO ANALYSIS (Compressed)

### Base Case (P50)

**Adjusted EBITDA**: $11.05M (after structural costs of $35.95M and payer losses of $48M)

**Key Assumptions**: Tax minimization reduces taxes to $26.5M; GPO savings $12M; 1 MA termination + 6-7% commercial rate cuts; STARK remediated pre-closing for $2.5M; physician attrition 8-10%.

**Viability Assessment**: Transaction viable at $1.9B-$2.0B with aggressive operational improvements targeting $20M-$30M additional EBITDA within 24 months. One-time closing costs: $498.1M.

### Downside Case (P75)

**Adjusted EBITDA**: ($27.95M) negative (after structural costs of $43.95M and payer losses of $79M)

**Key Assumptions**: Taxes remain $31.5M; GPO savings only $9M; 2 MA terminations + 8-9% commercial cuts; STARK requires OIG voluntary disclosure ($5M settlement); WARN Act triggered ($5.4M); physician attrition 12-15%.

**Viability Assessment**: Transaction requires seller financing ($300M-$500M subordinated note) or earn-out structure. Negative EBITDA for 18-24 months requires $50M-$75M working capital infusion. One-time closing costs: $526.5M.

### Severe Downside Case (P90)

**Adjusted EBITDA**: ($114.88M) negative (after structural costs of $51.38M and payer/attrition losses of $158.5M)

**Key Assumptions**: Full $36.43M taxes; GPO only $6.5M; 3 MA terminations + 10-12% commercial cuts + Medicaid cuts; STARK FCA settlement $17.5M; CON denial possible; physician attrition 18-20%.

**Viability Assessment**: **WALK AWAY** - Transaction not viable at any purchase price. Negative EBITDA requires $200M-$300M equity injection with no path to positive cash flow. One-time closing costs: $603M.

---

## CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY

**A. STARK/Anti-Kickback ASC Violation (Section IV.A)**: ASC physician ownership arrangement creates $150M-$170M IRS retroactive revocation exposure. **Remediation required before closing** (unwind physician ownership $2M-$3M). Non-negotiable closing condition.

**B. 340B Drug Pricing Loss (Section IV.D)**: For-profit conversion eliminates $12M/year drug savings ($120M NPV). No mitigation exists; offset through GPO consolidation ($10M-$15M annual savings target).

**C. Bond Redemption + Property Tax (Section IV.H)**: $471.6M cash required at closing. Creates DSCR covenant risk (0.21x vs. 1.2x minimum). Requires purchase price reduction to enable manageable debt levels.

**D. Operating Taxes (Section IV.G)**: $36.43M annual new taxes. Tax strategies can reduce to $16M-$28M. Engage advisors immediately for IRC Section 338(h)(10) election.

**E. Payer Contract Risk (Section IV.J)**: $22.8M-$60.5M annual revenue at risk from MA terminations, MCO rate cuts, and commercial renegotiation. Pre-closing payer engagement essential.

**F. Employment/WARN Act (Section IV.I)**: $5.1M-$5.4M WARN Act exposure **avoidable** with 60-day notice. Physician retention bonuses ($3M-$7.5M) needed to limit 8-10% attrition.

**G. HIPAA Breach (Section IV.E)**: March 2024 ransomware breach creates $8M-$21.5M exposure; cyber insurance covers $7M-$18M. Escrow $16M for settlements.

## CROSS-DOMAIN INTEGRATION (Key Patterns)

See Cross-Reference Matrix Section V for 10 documented cross-domain patterns including:
- Tax Conversion -> Employment Layoffs -> WARN Act ($5.1M-$5.4M cascade)
- HIPAA Breach -> Payer BAA Terminations -> Revenue Loss ($8M-$17M)
- Bond Redemption Cash Strain -> Payer Negotiation Weakness
- 340B Loss + Tax Burden -> Bond Covenant Breach ($50M-$150M)
- Private Inurement -> IRS Retroactive Revocation ($150M-$170M)
- Payer Rate Cuts -> Physician Compensation Pressure -> Departures
- Multiple Adverse Scenarios -> Bond Acceleration -> Equity Injection or Bankruptcy
