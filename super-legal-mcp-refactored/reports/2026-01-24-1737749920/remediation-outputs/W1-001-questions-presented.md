# QUESTIONS PRESENTED

## I. Healthcare Regulatory Compliance (STARK Law / Anti-Kickback)

**Question 1.** Under 42 U.S.C. Section 1395nn (Stark Law), does Mercy Regional Health System's ownership arrangement in Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC, whereby eight employed gastroenterologists collectively hold 33% equity interests and refer Medicare-eligible patients for colonoscopies and upper endoscopies at the facility located 2 miles from the main hospital campus, constitute a prohibited physician self-referral when (i) the in-office ancillary services exception under Section 1395nn(b)(2) does not apply because the designated health services are not furnished in the same building where the referring physician provides services, and (ii) the whole hospital exception under Section 1395nn(d)(3) does not apply because the ambulatory surgery center is not a hospital?

**Question 2.** Under 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b(b) (Anti-Kickback Statute), does Mercy Regional Health System's distribution of $35,000 in annual profits to each of the eight physician-owners of Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC constitute illegal remuneration intended to induce referrals when 85% of the facility's Medicare procedures originate from referring physician-owners and the arrangement does not satisfy the investment interest safe harbor under 42 C.F.R. Section 1001.952(a) because returns are allocated based on the volume and value of referrals rather than pro rata capital contributions?

---

## II. Certificate of Need

**Question 3.** Under Ohio Revised Code Section 3702.51 et seq. (Certificate of Need Law), does Mercy Regional Medical Center's pending application for a 50-bed capacity expansion from 525 to 575 licensed beds meet the statutory criteria for approval when (i) current facility occupancy of 88% exceeds the 80% threshold demonstrating community need, (ii) pro forma financial projections show $4M-$12M incremental EBITDA, and (iii) OhioHealth has filed opposition arguing market duplication and excess capacity in the Columbus metropolitan area?

---

## III. Graduate Medical Education

**Question 4.** Under ACGME Common Program Requirements Section VI.F.1 (Resident Duty Hours), does Mercy Regional Medical Center's general surgery residency program, which was placed on probationary accreditation status in May 2024 after ACGME found residents averaged 85-90 work hours per week in violation of the 80-hour weekly limit, face reasonable probability of accreditation withdrawal and loss of $2.5 million in annual Medicare GME payments if the corrective actions implemented in June-August 2024 (hiring two additional surgical faculty, deploying electronic duty-hour tracking, and appointing an associate program director) are not sustained through the Q2 2025 follow-up evaluation?

---

## IV. 340B Drug Pricing Program

**Question 5.** Under 42 U.S.C. Section 256b(a)(4)(A) (340B Drug Pricing Program), does Mercy South Hospital's status as a disproportionate share hospital (DSH) with Medicare DSH payments of $8.5 million annually and Medicaid utilization of 28% terminate upon acquisition by National Healthcare Partners LLC, a for-profit entity, thereby causing Mercy South to lose approximately $12 million in annual 340B drug pricing savings because for-profit hospitals are categorically excluded from 340B eligibility regardless of patient population served?

**Question 6.** Under 42 U.S.C. Section 256b and pending HRSA mega-guidance limiting covered entities to six contract pharmacy arrangements, does Mercy South Hospital's current utilization of eight contract pharmacies (including CVS, Walgreens, and Kroger locations) require termination of two pharmacy relationships, and separately, do manufacturer restrictions imposed by Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and AstraZeneca on contract pharmacy dispensing place $3-5 million in annual 340B savings at risk pending resolution of PhRMA v. HHS litigation?

---

## V. HIPAA Privacy and Security

**Question 7.** Under 45 C.F.R. Section 164.308(a)(1) (Security Rule Risk Analysis), Section 164.308(a)(7) (Contingency Plan), and Section 164.312(a)(2) (Encryption), does Mercy Regional Health System face probable findings of willful neglect and penalties of $500,000 to $1.5 million from the ongoing HHS Office for Civil Rights investigation into the March 2024 ransomware attack that compromised 850,000 patient records, when (i) Mercy's last comprehensive risk analysis was conducted in 2019, (ii) backup systems were encrypted along with primary systems due to inadequate air-gapped disaster recovery infrastructure, and (iii) protected health information was stored unencrypted despite the addressable encryption specification?

---

## VI. Joint Commission Accreditation

**Question 8.** Under 42 C.F.R. Section 488.5 (Medicare Conditions of Participation Deemed Status) and Joint Commission accreditation standards, does Mercy Regional Medical Center's October 2024 survey resulting in eight deficiencies (including medication management violations with expired medications in operating room pharmacy, hand hygiene compliance at 78% versus the 90% standard, fire door propping in violation of life safety code, and incomplete physician credentialing files lacking primary source verification) place Medicare deemed status at risk of downgrade to provisional accreditation or denial if deficiencies are not sustained through the March 2025 follow-up survey?

---

## VII. Tax-Exempt Conversion

**Question 9.** Under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.501(c)(3)-1, does National Healthcare Partners LLC's acquisition of Mercy Regional Health System result in automatic loss of Mercy's tax-exempt status upon closing because (i) ownership by a for-profit parent eliminates operation exclusively for charitable purposes, and (ii) the resulting conversion triggers approximately $36.43 million in new annual tax obligations, including $15.12 million federal income tax (21% of $72 million net income), $4.66 million Ohio commercial activity tax, $10.80 million property tax on $600 million assessed real estate, and $5.85 million sales tax on previously exempt purchases?

---

## VIII. Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption

**Question 10.** Under Internal Revenue Code Section 141 (Private Activity Bond Test) and the bond indenture governing $420 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds issued through the Ohio Hospital Facilities Authority in 2016 for Mercy Northwest Hospital, does conversion to for-profit ownership constitute a change in use that violates the public use requirement and triggers mandatory redemption at 102% of principal ($428.4 million) at closing, with subsequent refinancing at taxable rates of approximately 6.5% (versus 4.25% tax-exempt) resulting in $9.45 million in additional annual interest expense?

---

## IX. Employment and Labor

**Question 11.** Under 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et seq. (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act), does National Healthcare Partners LLC's anticipated post-acquisition workforce integration, which may include elimination of 500-1,000 administrative and support positions across Mercy Regional Health System's 8,500-employee workforce to achieve operational synergies, constitute a "mass layoff" requiring 60-day advance written notice to affected employees and state/local governments, with potential back-pay liability of $5.1-$5.4 million (calculated as 500 employees multiplied by average daily compensation multiplied by 60 days) if proper notice is not provided?

---

## X. Commercial Contracts and Payer Relationships

**Question 12.** Under 42 C.F.R. Part 422 (Medicare Advantage Program) and the change-of-control provisions contained in Mercy Regional Health System's eight Medicare Advantage network participation agreements, do the payers (including Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Anthem) have contractual rights to terminate network participation upon 30-90 days' notice following for-profit conversion, and if 1-2 plans exercise such termination rights representing 10-20% of Medicare Advantage volume, would Mercy face annual revenue loss of $22-$45 million from the $180 million in current Medicare Advantage net patient revenue?
