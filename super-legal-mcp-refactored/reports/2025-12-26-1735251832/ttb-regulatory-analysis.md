## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This memorandum analyzes the federal and state alcoholic beverage regulatory framework governing American Beverage Partners LLC's proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company, LLC. The target operates 3 breweries (485,000 barrels/year), 1 distillery (100,000 proof gallons/year), 1 winery/meadery, and 18 taprooms across Oregon, Colorado, and North Carolina, holding 280 approved Certificates of Label Approval (COLAs) and 42 distilled spirits formulas.

The analysis identifies **TTB permit transfer timelines as the critical path risk** to transaction closing, with 120-180 day approval requirements and **mandatory operations cessation** if ownership changes before written TTB approval. Regulatory penalty exposure ($322K-$2.3M) is de minimis relative to transaction value, but operational disruption from delayed closing presents **$20M-$60M exposure** depending on timing.

Four material regulatory issues require transaction structuring and due diligence attention: (1) TTB permit transfers, (2) ongoing bourbon formula investigation, (3) Oregon tied house enforcement matter, and (4) COLA transfer strategy. Each issue is analyzed below with quantified exposure ranges, resolution strategies, and recommended purchase agreement provisions.

### Key Takeaways

1. **TTB Permit Transfers Are Deal-Critical:** Federal law requires new permits/registrations for all 5 facilities before ABP can commence operations post-closing. If acquisition closes before TTB grants written approval, **all production, distilling, winemaking, and distribution operations must immediately cease**. Processing timeline: 60-180 days depending on facility type. **Recommended mitigation:** Make TTB approvals a closing condition precedent; set 180-day outside date minimum.

2. **COLA Strategy Drives $280K-$420K Cost Differential:** If ASBC LLC's name changes post-acquisition, all 280 COLAs require reapplication (6-12 month timeline, $280K-$420K cost, sales disruption). **Recommended mitigation:** Retain ASBC LLC as wholly-owned subsidiary with unchanged name; avoid COLA reapplications entirely.

3. **Bourbon Investigation Exposes $310K-$1.4M:** TTB is investigating whether ASBC's Single Barrel Bourbon formula (toasted wood staves finishing) violates bourbon standards of identity prohibiting "added flavoring." Likely outcome: Reclassification to "Whiskey Specialty" requiring relabeling of 85,000 bottles ($4M inventory value). **Recommended mitigation:** $1.5M escrow released after 12 months; Seller indemnity for penalties and relabeling costs.

4. **Oregon Tied House Matter Settles for $12K-$18K:** OLCC investigating ASBC for providing $6,048 worth of free beer samples to 12 retailers (June 2024), exceeding "nominal value" exception. Exposure: $12K-$60K penalty plus potential license suspension. Settlement likely Q1 2026. **Recommended mitigation:** Resolve before closing or escrow $50K; Seller indemnity.

5. **Regulatory Penalty Exposure Is Immaterial; Delay Costs Are Not:** Total quantified regulatory penalties ($322K-$2.3M) represent 0.027%-0.19% of transaction value. However, transaction delays due to TTB approval timelines present **$20M-$60M revenue loss exposure** if closing extends 60-120 days beyond target date. **Critical finding:** The risk is operational disruption, not regulatory fines.

6. **Post-Closing Compliance Enhancements Required:** ASBC's COLA revocation (August 2024, health warning font size violation) and tied house investigation demonstrate gaps in regulatory compliance infrastructure. Post-closing, ABP must implement: (a) comprehensive COLA compliance audit, (b) enhanced tied house compliance program, (c) formula compliance review, and (d) taproom licensing verification.

### Risk Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Overall regulatory risk to transaction:** MEDIUM-HIGH

**Primary risks:**
- **CRITICAL:** TTB permit approval timeline (120-180 days) may delay closing beyond target date
- **CRITICAL:** Operations cessation if close before TTB approval (business-killing)
- **HIGH:** Bourbon investigation requires inventory relabeling ($310K-$1.4M)
- **MEDIUM:** OLCC tied house penalty and potential suspension ($12K-$60K)
- **MEDIUM:** COLA reapplication if name changes ($280K-$420K + 6-12 months)

**Mitigating factors:**
- Regulatory penalties are quantifiable and allocable via escrow/indemnity
- TTB permit timeline is predictable (though lengthy); can be built into transaction structure
- COLA issue avoidable via subsidiary structure preservation
- Bourbon and tied house matters non-business-threatening even in worst-case scenarios

**Aggravating factors:**
- TTB cannot expedite permit approvals; 120-180 day timeline is non-negotiable
- Operations cessation requirement is absolute; no interim operation permitted
- Seasonal production cycles may amplify delay costs
- Multiple overlapping regulatory investigations create execution risk

### Cross-Domain Impacts (For Memorandum Synthesis)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Legal Doctrine/Consideration | Recommended Memo Section |
|---------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **TTB permit approval timeline = 120-180 days** | Corporate/M&A | Closing conditions, outside date, reverse termination fee | Transaction Structure & Timeline |
| **Operations must cease if close before approval** | Corporate/M&A | Interim operating covenants, material adverse effect | Closing Mechanics |
| **$1.5M bourbon investigation escrow** | Tax | IRC § 1060 purchase price allocation timing | Tax Consequences |
| **Bourbon investigation exposure** | Securities (if ABP public) | Item 303 MD&A disclosure of pending proceedings | SEC Disclosure Obligations |
| **COLA strategy: Retain subsidiary vs. rebrand** | Corporate/M&A | Post-closing integration; brand preservation | Corporate Structure |
| **$450K bonding requirement** | Financing | Working capital; IRC § 5173 bonding obligations | Financing & Capitalization |
| **Tied house compliance program** | Corporate Governance | SOX § 404 internal controls over compliance | Post-Closing Integration |
| **$26,225/day health warning violations** | Litigation | Government enforcement risk; qui tam potential | Regulatory Litigation Risk |
| **18 taprooms tied-house compliance** | Real Estate/Licensing | Premises-specific licenses; three-tier system exceptions | Real Estate & Licensing |
| **Multi-state ABC compliance (OR, CO, NC)** | State Regulatory | State ABC license transfers; tied house variations | State Regulatory Compliance |

**Key Coordination Points:**

1. **Corporate M&A Counsel:** TTB approval timeline dictates outside date (minimum 180 days); operations cessation requirement necessitates TTB approval as closing condition precedent; subsidiary structure preservation avoids $280K-$420K COLA reapplication costs.

2. **Tax Counsel:** Bourbon investigation escrow ($1.5M) affects IRC § 1060 purchase price allocation and timing; bonding requirements ($450K) impact working capital structure; inventory write-offs if recall required.

3. **Securities Counsel (if ABP is public filer):** Bourbon investigation and OLCC matter likely do not meet Item 303 materiality threshold given amounts, but should be evaluated against ABP's disclosure thresholds and prior MD&A disclosures.

4. **Litigation Counsel:** OLCC administrative settlement must coordinate with transaction timeline; bourbon investigation may benefit from industry-wide TTB rulemaking petition re: wood finishing standards.

5. **Financing Counsel:** $450K bonding requirement must be incorporated into capitalization and working capital analysis; surety company pre-commitment required before signing.

6. **Real Estate Counsel:** Taproom licenses are premises-specific; any post-closing real estate changes trigger state ABC license amendments; verify tied-house self-distribution exceptions apply in all three states.

### Regulatory Compliance Exposure Summary

**Quantified Regulatory Exposure (Excluding Transaction Delay Costs):**

| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Most Likely | Probability |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Bourbon Investigation | $310,000 | $1,400,000 | $600,000 | 60% |
| OLCC Tied House Penalties | $12,000 | $60,000 | $15,000 | 85% |
| Federal Tied House (if distillery samples) | $0 | $50,000 | $15,000 | 30% |
| COLA Violations (if discovered) | $0 | $500,000 | $50,000 | 50% |
| Additional Bonding Costs | $0 | $300,000 | $100,000 | 20% |
| **TOTAL REGULATORY EXPOSURE** | **$322,000** | **$2,310,000** | **$780,000** | **Weighted** |

**Percentage of Transaction Value:** 0.027%-0.19% (de minimis)

**Transaction Delay Costs (Operational Disruption):**

| Delay Period | Lost EBITDA | Seasonal Multiplier | Total Exposure | Probability |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 60 days | $20M | 1.0× | $20M | 40% |
| 90 days | $30M | 1.2× | $36M | 25% |
| 120 days | $40M | 1.5× | $60M | 15% |

**Expected Value of Delay Cost:** $20M × 40% + $36M × 25% + $60M × 15% = **$26M**

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** Transaction delay costs ($20M-$60M) are 10-77× larger than regulatory penalty exposure ($780K most likely). The financial risk is NOT regulatory fines but operational disruption from delayed closing. TTB permit approval timeline is the dominant transaction risk factor.

### TTB Permit Transfer Framework (Section IV.A Key Findings)

**Regulatory Requirements:**

Federal law mandates that successor brewers, distillers, and winery operators must qualify in the same manner as new facilities before commencing operations. This requires:

- **3 Brewer's Notices** (Portland OR, Denver CO, Asheville NC): New notice, bond (if required), TTB written approval. Timeline: 60-120 days per facility.
- **1 DSP Registration** (Portland OR distillery): New registration, $50K-$250K bond, background investigation. Timeline: 120-180 days.
- **1 Winery Basic Permit** (Hood River OR): New permit, bond, formula adoption. Timeline: 60-90 days.

**Operations Cessation Requirement:**

27 CFR § 25.72 (breweries) explicitly states: "If a change in proprietorship occurs prior to the filing and approval of the new application, **all regulated operations must cease until approval is granted in writing by TTB**." While DSP and winery regulations focus on bonding requirements, the practical effect is identical—operations cannot continue without approved permits.

**Bond Requirements:**

New proprietors must file bonds in their own name. ASBC's existing bonds terminate upon change in proprietorship. Estimated bonding requirements:
- Breweries: $0-$450K (may be exempt if <500K bbl/year under 27 CFR § 25.91(e))
- Distillery: $50K-$250K (based on 100K proof gallons/year production)
- Winery: $25K-$50K
- **Total: $450K** (upper estimate if no exemptions apply)

**Processing Timeline Analysis:**

Current TTB processing times (2024-2025):
- DSP registrations: 120-180 days (longest timeline)
- Brewer's Notices: 60-120 days (may process in parallel)
- Winery permits: 60-90 days

**Risk factors affecting timeline:**
- Incomplete applications (missing diagrams, ownership info, forms)
- High TTB workload and specialist caseload
- Complex ownership structures requiring enhanced review
- Background investigations of ABP principals (30-60 days)
- Any adverse information discovered during background checks

**Estimated Timeline for Project Bacchus:**
- Best case (parallel processing, no issues): 120 days
- Realistic case (some serial processing, minor corrections): 150-180 days
- Worst case (background issues, multiple corrections): 210-270 days

**Transaction Structuring Implications:**

1. **Closing Condition:** Receipt of written TTB approval for all 5 permits must be precedent to Buyer's obligation to close. Cannot waive this condition without risking operations cessation.

2. **Outside Date:** Minimum 180 days from signing, with automatic 60-day extension if TTB applications pending but not denied. This accommodates realistic 150-180 day timeline with buffer.

3. **Reverse Termination Fee:** If ABP fails to obtain TTB approvals due to principals' background issues (not within ASBC's control), ABP should pay reverse termination fee ($24M = 2% of purchase price recommended).

4. **Interim Operating Covenants:** ASBC must cooperate fully with TTB permit process, maintain all existing permits in good standing, and avoid any actions that could jeopardize permits.

5. **Early Filing Strategy:** Applications should be drafted pre-signing and filed immediately upon Purchase Agreement execution to maximize parallel processing time.

**Financial Impact of Production Shutdown:**

Assuming $1.2B purchase price reflects ~10× EBITDA multiple, ASBC's annual EBITDA ≈ $120M, monthly EBITDA ≈ $10M.

- If TTB approval delays closing 60 days: **$20M revenue loss**
- If TTB approval delays closing 120 days: **$40M revenue loss**
- If acquisition closes before TTB approval and operations cease: **Incalculable damage** (lost distribution, retailer relationships, spoiled inventory, seasonal production disruption)

**Recommended Mitigation:**
- Make TTB approvals absolute closing condition (non-waivable)
- Set 180-day outside date minimum
- File applications immediately upon signing
- Weekly TTB status monitoring during permit period
- 24-hour response protocol for TTB information requests

### Bourbon Formula Investigation (Section IV.B Key Findings)

**Regulatory Framework:**

27 CFR § 5.143 defines bourbon whisky as whisky produced at ≤160° proof from ≥51% corn mash, stored at ≤125° proof in charred new oak containers, with **NO added coloring, flavoring, or blending materials** (except water).

**ASBC's Formula Under Investigation:**

TTB initiated investigation (September 2024) into ASBC's Single Barrel Bourbon formula:
- Production method: Bourbon aged 3 years in charred new oak, then toasted French oak staves inserted for additional 6-9 months
- TTB allegation: Toasted staves = "added flavoring" prohibited under bourbon standards
- ASBC defense: Staves are part of "charred new oak container" aging, not added flavoring
- Status: Investigation ongoing; no final determination

**Critical Distinction: Toasted vs. Seared/Charred:**

- **Toasting:** 300-400°F, caramelizes wood sugars, no char layer formed
- **Charring/Searing:** 500-600°F, creates carbonized "red layer," chemical transformation
- TTB appears to distinguish these methods for compliance purposes
- **Maker's Mark 46** uses "seared" staves and was approved as bourbon
- **ASBC's product** uses "toasted" staves, which TTB may deem non-compliant

**If TTB Requires Reclassification:**

- Current classification: Bourbon Whisky (Class Type 141) or Straight Bourbon (Class Type 101)
- Required reclassification: Whiskey Specialty (Class Type 641)
- Labeling requirements (27 CFR § 5.39(c)): Must include "Colored and Flavored with Toasted Oak Staves" or similar disclosure
- Example compliant label: "Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished with Toasted Oak Staves"

**Financial Exposure:**

- Current inventory: 85,000 bottles × $47 wholesale = **$4M inventory value**
- Recall/relabeling costs: $50K-$800K (depending on whether TTB allows grandfather provision)
- Civil penalties (26 U.S.C. § 5687): $10K-$100K (administrative penalties typical for labeling violations)
- Lost sales (6 months): $250K-$500K
- **Total exposure: $310K-$1.4M**

**Resolution Options:**

| Option | Action | Timeline | Success Probability | Cost |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------------|------|
| 1. Contest determination | Technical defense, sensory analysis | 6-12 months | 30-40% | $100K+ legal fees |
| 2. Accept reclassification | Relabel as Class Type 641 | 2-3 months | 90% | $50K-$800K |
| 3. Reformulate product | Remove toasted staves from future production | Immediate | 100% | $0 (prospective only) |
| 4. Seek TTB ruling | Industry-wide clarification on toasting vs. searing | 12-18 months | 50% | Delay + uncertainty |

**Recommended Strategy for Transaction:**

**Pre-Closing:**
1. ASBC counsel engages TTB to expedite investigation resolution
2. Offer to accept Class Type 641 reclassification for immediate determination
3. Prepare relabeling plan and new COLA applications for compliant labels
4. Conduct product hold-back: Stop shipping Single Barrel Bourbon pending resolution

**Closing Mechanics:**
1. **Escrow:** $1.5M from purchase price, released after 12 months if no penalties imposed
2. **Seller Indemnity:** Seller indemnifies for penalties, recall costs, relabeling costs (Cap: $1.5M)
3. **Purchase Price Adjustment:** If recall/relabeling >$500K, Buyer reduces purchase price dollar-for-dollar (Cap: $1M)

**Post-Closing:**
1. If reclassification required: Execute Option 2 (accept and relabel)
2. Discontinue toasted stave finishing for bourbon-labeled products
3. Develop new "whiskey specialty" brand positioning for finished products
4. Work with industry associations to seek TTB guidance on wood finishing

**Broader Industry Context:**

TTB's investigation reflects heightened scrutiny of wood finishing techniques across spirits industry. No Congressional action to amend bourbon definition. Kentucky distillers oppose relaxing standards. Regulatory uncertainty creates compliance risk for craft distillers using innovative finishing methods.

### COLA Transfer Strategy (Section IV.C Key Findings)

**The $280K-$420K Decision:**

ASBC holds 280 approved COLAs (120 beer, 150 spirits, 8 mead, 2 cider). Each COLA identifies the "responsible advertiser"—the entity legally responsible for the product. If the responsible advertiser changes post-acquisition, all 280 COLAs require reapplication.

**TTB Allowable Changes Policy:**

TTB permits changing responsible advertiser name to "a different name already approved for use" by that entity without reapplication. **Critical limitation:** This applies only to alternate names already on file with TTB for the same facility. It is NOT a general transfer provision for ownership changes.

**If ASBC LLC's Name Changes:**

- All 280 COLAs require new applications (TTB Form 5100.31)
- Timeline: 60-90 days per COLA (best case); 4-6 months realistic; 6-12 months if errors
- Cost: $1,000-$1,500 per COLA (legal fees + artwork) = **$280,000-$420,000**
- Sales disruption: Cannot sell products until new COLAs approved
- Inventory obsolescence: Must relabel or destroy existing labeled products

**Strategic Options:**

**Option 1: Retain ASBC LLC as Subsidiary (RECOMMENDED)**

ABP acquires 100% membership interests in ASBC LLC, which continues as wholly-owned subsidiary with unchanged name. No COLA reapplications required.

**Advantages:**
- $0 cost (vs. $280K-$420K)
- Zero timeline delay (vs. 6-12 months)
- Immediate sales continuity
- Preserves "Artisan" brand equity

**Disadvantages:**
- Maintains separate LLC ($200-500/year state fees—negligible)
- ABP's brand not immediately visible on labels

**Option 2: Rebrand and Reapply**

Change ASBC LLC name or transfer operations to ABP, reapply for all COLAs with new responsible advertiser.

**Advantages:**
- Unified branding under ABP
- Simplifies corporate structure

**Disadvantages:**
- **$280K-$420K cost**
- **6-12 month timeline**
- Sales disruption
- Inventory obsolescence

**Option 3: Phased Transition**

Retain ASBC name initially, gradually rebrand over 2-3 years as COLAs naturally expire.

**Advantages:**
- Spreads cost and timing
- Maintains continuity

**Disadvantages:**
- Extended dual-branding period
- Administrative complexity

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (retain subsidiary) is overwhelmingly superior from cost and timeline perspective. ABP can add sub-branding ("An ABP Company") to marketing materials without triggering COLA reapplications.

**COLA Revocation Case Study:**

August 2024: TTB revoked COLA for Artisan IPA 16 oz can due to health warning font size too small (6-point vs. required 2mm/8-point minimum). 120,000 cans ($840K value) required relabeling.

**Regulatory exposure if TTB had imposed maximum penalties:**
- 27 CFR § 16.33: $26,225 per violation × 60 days = **$1,573,500 theoretical maximum**
- TTB exercised discretion: $0 penalties due to voluntary detection, immediate corrective action, no consumer harm

**Lesson:** TTB actively enforces labeling standards. Post-acquisition, ABP must conduct comprehensive COLA compliance audit to identify and remediate any technical violations before statute of limitations expires.

**Purchase Agreement Provisions:**
- Seller represents all 280 COLAs compliant with 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 16
- Seller indemnifies for pre-closing COLA violations (Cap: $2M, Survival: 24 months)
- Post-closing: COLA compliance audit within 90 days

### Oregon Tied House Investigation (Section IV.D Key Findings)

**Factual Background:**

June 2024: ASBC provided free beer samples to 12 Oregon retailers ($6,048 total value, $504 average per retailer). OLCC determined this exceeded "nominal value" exception under ORS 471.398(4) and constituted prohibited financial assistance.

**Regulatory Framework:**

Oregon tied house law (ORS 471.392-471.400) prohibits manufacturers from providing "financial assistance" to retailers, with exceptions for "items of nominal value" including samples. Oregon administrative guidance suggests $50-100/month per retailer as "nominal value" threshold. ASBC provided $504 per retailer over 3 months (10× suggested limit).

**OLCC Enforcement Timeline:**
- June 2024: Investigation commenced
- September 2024: Notice of Violation issued
- October 2024: ASBC response submitted
- Anticipated resolution: Q1 2026 (settlement negotiations)

**Penalty Exposure:**

OLCC classifies tied house violations as Category III violations. Standard sanction: 10-day license suspension OR $1,650 civil penalty per violation.

**Exposure scenarios:**
- Minimal (single course of conduct): 1 violation × $1,650 = **$1,650**
- Moderate (per retailer): 12 violations × $1,650 = **$19,800**
- Severe (per transaction): 36 violations × $1,650 = **$59,400**

**Most likely:** OLCC counts violations per retailer = **$19,800 penalty** OR **120-day license suspension** (reduced via settlement)

**Settlement likelihood:** 85%

OLCC typically settles for 50-75% of maximum penalty ($10K-$15K) plus probation. **Estimated settlement: $12,000-$18,000 + 1-year probation.**

**Mitigating factors:**
- No health/safety issue
- Clean compliance history
- Voluntary corrective action
- Good faith misunderstanding of "nominal value"

**Aggravating factors:**
- Systematic conduct (12 retailers)
- Commercial value significant
- Competitive advantage gained

**Material Adverse Effect Analysis:**

$12K-$18K penalty = 0.0015% of $1.2B transaction value (immaterial). **However:** License suspension (even 7-15 days) disrupts Oregon brewery operations, which IS material to business continuity.

**Transaction Implications:**

**Closing Condition Options:**
1. OLCC investigation resolved (settled or dismissed) before closing; OR
2. Seller pays penalty and provides evidence no suspension will be imposed; OR
3. Escrow $50,000 pending resolution

**Indemnification:**
- Seller indemnifies for OLCC penalties and legal fees
- Cap: $100,000 (sufficient for severe scenario + legal costs)
- Basket: $5,000

**Post-Closing Compliance Program:**

ABP must implement enhanced tied house compliance:
1. Written policy prohibiting "things of value" beyond regulatory exceptions
2. Sample tracking system (log all samples with values)
3. Monthly tied house compliance audits
4. Quarterly training for sales/marketing/taproom personnel
5. Apply Oregon standard (most restrictive) company-wide to CO, NC facilities

**Federal Tied House Exposure:**

27 CFR Part 6 (federal tied house laws) apply directly to distillery operations (no state law qualifier). If ASBC's June 2024 samples included distilled spirits (not just beer), federal violations occurred independent of state OLCC matter.

**Federal penalty exposure:** $5,000-$50,000 administrative penalties typical for tied house violations.

**Due diligence action item:** Confirm whether samples included distilled spirits. If yes, federal investigation risk exists.

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Pre-Signing (Days 1-60)**

1. Engage TTB counsel for permit applications (Day 1-30)
2. TTB informal consultation on timeline (Day 15-30)
3. Bourbon investigation expedited resolution (Day 1-14)
4. OLCC settlement negotiations (Day 1-30)
5. Due diligence confirmations (distillery samples, multi-state violations, formula compliance, taproom licenses, ABP principals' backgrounds, bonding capacity)

**Phase 2: Purchase Agreement Execution (Day 60)**

Document provisions:
- Closing conditions: TTB approvals, OLCC resolution, no COLA revocations
- Outside date: 180 days + 60-day extension if pending
- Reverse termination fee: $24M (2%) if ABP background issues
- Indemnities: Bourbon ($1.5M cap), OLCC ($100K cap), COLA ($2M cap), other regulatory ($5M cap)
- Escrows: Bourbon $1.5M (12 months), OLCC $50K (pending resolution)

**Phase 3: Post-Signing/Pre-Closing (Days 61-240)**

1. File TTB permit applications (Day 61—same day as Purchase Agreement)
2. Weekly TTB monitoring (Days 61-240)
3. Bourbon investigation resolution (Days 61-120)
4. OLCC settlement execution (Days 61-90)
5. Target: All TTB approvals by Day 150 (30-day buffer before outside date)

**Phase 4: Post-Closing (Days 1-365)**

1. Preserve ASBC LLC subsidiary structure (Day 1)
2. COLA compliance audit (Days 1-90)
3. Enhanced tied house compliance program (Days 1-180)
4. Taproom licensing audit (Days 1-90)
5. Formula compliance review (Days 1-180)
6. Remediate any violations (Days 91-180)

### Conclusion

The $1.2B acquisition of ASBC presents manageable regulatory risks if properly structured. Total quantified regulatory exposure ($322K-$2.3M) is de minimis relative to transaction value. The primary risk is not regulatory fines but **transaction delay from TTB permit approval timelines** (120-180 days) and **operations cessation requirements** if closing precedes approval.

**Critical success factors:**
1. Make TTB approvals absolute closing condition
2. Set 180-day minimum outside date
3. File permit applications immediately upon signing
4. Retain ASBC LLC as subsidiary to avoid $280K-$420K COLA reapplications
5. Escrow $1.5M for bourbon investigation pending 12-month resolution
6. Resolve OLCC matter before closing or escrow $50K

With proper transaction structuring and diligent permit processing, ABP can consummate this acquisition within 150-180 days of signing while effectively allocating regulatory risks through purchase agreement mechanics.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. TTB Permit Transfers: Breweries, Distillery, and Winery

#### 1. Legal Framework for Change in Proprietorship

A change in proprietorship occurs when there is a change in the entity that owns and operates the business.¹ Federal law requires successor operators to qualify in the same manner as proprietors of new facilities before commencing or continuing operations.² This requirement applies uniformly across breweries (27 CFR § 25.72), distilleries (27 CFR § 19.112), and wineries (27 CFR § 24.71).

**Critical Distinction:** TTB distinguishes between "change in proprietorship" (ownership transfer triggering full re-qualification) and "change in control" (stock ownership or LLC membership changes that may require only amendments).³ The acquisition of ASBC by ABP constitutes a change in proprietorship requiring new permits.

#### 2. Brewery Permit Transfers (27 CFR Part 25)

**Three Brewer's Notices Required:**
- Portland, OR brewery (485,000 bbl/year capacity)
- Denver, CO brewery
- Asheville, NC brewery

**Transfer Requirements:**

The outgoing brewer (ASBC) must comply with termination requirements under 27 CFR § 25.85.⁴ The successor brewer (ABP) must:

1. **File new Brewer's Notice** (TTB Form 5130.10) for each facility⁵
2. **Submit new bond** if required (exemptions apply under 27 CFR § 25.91(e) for small brewers producing <500,000 bbls/year in prior calendar year)⁶
3. **Obtain written TTB approval** before commencing operations⁷

**Mandatory Timeline:** The regulations require filing "well in advance of the proposed effective date of the change."⁸ TTB guidance emphasizes: "If a change in proprietorship occurs prior to the filing and approval of the new application, all regulated operations must cease until approval is granted in writing by TTB."⁹

**Amendment Deadline:** 27 CFR § 25.71 currently requires brewers to submit amended notices within 30 days of changes to information in the Brewer's Notice.¹⁰ TTB proposed extending this to 60 days in a 2022 Federal Register notice,¹¹ though implementation status requires verification.

**Production Continuity:** Operations MUST CEASE if the ownership change occurs before TTB grants written approval.¹² Beer on hand may transfer tax-free to the successor brewer and will be accounted for by that brewer.¹³

#### 3. Distillery Permit Transfer (27 CFR Part 19)

**DSP Registration:** Portland, OR distillery (DSP-OR-20145, 100,000 proof gallons/year)

**Transfer Requirements:**

27 CFR § 19.112 governs amendments to DSP registrations and historically required reporting changes within 30 days.¹⁴ The December 2021 Federal Register proposed extending this deadline to 60 days.¹⁵

The successor DSP proprietor must:

1. **File new DSP registration** through Permits Online¹⁶
2. **Submit distilled spirits bond** (TTB Form 5110.56)¹⁷
3. **Complete Owner Officer Information Application** for all principals¹⁸
4. **Transfer approved formulas** (42 formulas transfer with DSP registration)¹⁹

**Bonding Requirements:** Bond amount depends on production volume and tax liability. For facilities processing 100,000 proof gallons/year with significant tax-paid inventory, bond amounts typically range from $50,000-$250,000.²⁰ Bonds up to $250,000 cost $12 per $1,000 of coverage (minimum $100); amounts exceeding $250,000 require underwriting (starting at $300).²¹

**Critical Enforcement Update (2024):** TTB increased enforcement of 27 CFR §§ 19.126 and 19.127, which mandate reporting ownership changes within 30 days.²² If permits are terminated for non-compliance, operations must immediately cease, and DSPs must re-apply for new permits before resuming any production, sales, or operations.²³

**Production Continuity:** Federal law requires successor DSPs to obtain bond approval and complete all qualifying documents before commencing or continuing business.²⁴ Unlike breweries where the regulation explicitly states operations must cease, DSP regulations focus on the bond requirement but the practical effect is identical—operations cannot continue without approved permits.²⁵

#### 4. Winery Permit Transfer (27 CFR Part 24)

**Winery Permit:** Hood River, OR winery/meadery facility

**Transfer Requirements:**

27 CFR § 24.71 governs changes in proprietorship for wine premises.²⁶ The outgoing proprietor (ASBC) must comply with termination requirements, and the successor (ABP) must:

1. **Apply for and obtain any required permits** under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 CFR Part 1)²⁷
2. **File required bonds**²⁸
3. **File application and receive permission to operate** in the same manner as a new wine premises²⁹

**Formula Adoption:** The successor may adopt the approved formulas of the outgoing proprietor.³⁰ Wine, spirits, and winemaking materials may transfer from outgoing to successor proprietor per 27 CFR § 24.140.³¹

**Special Consideration:** Oregon's winery/meadery operation may qualify as a bonded wine premises under 27 CFR Part 24. Bond requirements depend on annual tax liability and production volume.

#### 5. Processing Timeline Analysis

**Official TTB Processing Times:**

Recent industry data indicates:
- **Distilled Spirits Plants:** Over 6 months for approval³²
- **Breweries:** "Months and almost universally requires back and forth to meet TTB's current requirements"³³
- **Wineries:** Several months depending on complexity³⁴

**Factors Affecting Timeline:**³⁵
- Incomplete or inaccurate applications (missing diagrams, unclear ownership, incorrect forms)
- High TTB workload and specialist caseload
- Complex business structures (alternating proprietorships, multi-location operations)
- Background investigations of new owners (ABP principals)

**Estimated Timeline for Project Bacchus:**

| Facility Type | Quantity | Estimated Timeline | Risk Factor |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Breweries | 3 | 60-120 days per facility | HIGH - staggered approvals likely |
| Distillery | 1 | 120-180 days | CRITICAL - longest timeline |
| Winery | 1 | 60-90 days | MEDIUM |

**Cumulative Risk:** If TTB processes permits serially rather than in parallel, total timeline could extend to 7-10 months. If any application requires corrections or additional information, add 30-60 days per iteration.

#### 6. Bonding Requirements Summary

**Total Bond Requirements (Estimated):**

| Facility | Bond Type | Estimated Amount | Basis |
|----------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Portland Brewery | Brewer's Bond | $0-$150,000 | May be exempt if <500K bbl/year³⁶ |
| Denver Brewery | Brewer's Bond | $0-$150,000 | May be exempt if <500K bbl/year |
| Asheville Brewery | Brewer's Bond | $0-$150,000 | May be exempt if <500K bbl/year |
| Portland Distillery | DSP Bond | $50,000-$250,000 | Based on 100K proof gallons/year³⁷ |
| Hood River Winery | Wine Bond | $25,000-$50,000 | Based on production volume |
| **TOTAL** | | **$450,000** | **Upper estimate if no exemptions** |

**Bond Transfer vs. Replacement:**

New proprietors must file bonds in their own name before commencing operations.³⁸ ASBC's existing bonds terminate upon proprietorship change. ABP cannot "assume" existing bonds—new bonds must be obtained with ABP as principal and an approved surety company.³⁹

**Superseding Bonds:** If the surety company changes or bond amounts increase, ABP must file superseding bonds.⁴⁰ If ABP qualifies for bond exemptions (e.g., small brewer exemption), it must document the exemption basis in permit applications.

#### 7. Background Investigation Requirements

TTB conducts background investigations of all principals, owners, and officers listed in permit applications. For DSPs and basic permit holders, this includes:
- Criminal background checks
- Financial solvency verification
- Prior regulatory compliance history
- Source of funds inquiry (particularly for large acquisitions)

For a $1.2 billion acquisition, TTB will scrutinize ABP's principals, financing sources, and ownership structure. This investigation adds 30-60 days to processing time and may require additional documentation if TTB identifies issues.⁴¹

#### 8. Critical Compliance Exposure: Operations Cessation Requirement

**THE DEAL-BLOCKING ISSUE:**

The most critical regulatory risk is the operations cessation requirement. If the acquisition closes before TTB grants written approval of all permit transfers, ASBC/ABP must immediately shut down:
- All brewing operations (3 breweries producing 485K bbl/year)
- All distilling operations (100K proof gallons/year)
- All winemaking operations
- All sales and distribution from bonded premises

**Financial Impact of Production Shutdown:**

Assuming $1.2B acquisition price reflects ~10x EBITDA multiple, ASBC's annual EBITDA is approximately $120M. Monthly EBITDA: $10M.

If TTB approval delays closing by 60 days: **$20M revenue loss**
If TTB approval delays closing by 120 days: **$40M revenue loss**
If acquisition closes before TTB approval and operations cease: **Incalculable damage** (lost distribution, retailer relationships, seasonal production)

**Mitigation Strategy:** The transaction must structure closing as conditional upon receipt of all TTB permit approvals. The Purchase Agreement should include:
- Outside date set at 180 days post-signing (minimum)
- TTB approval as closing condition precedent
- Reverse termination fee if ABP fails to obtain TTB approvals
- Interim operating covenants prohibiting ASBC from jeopardizing permits

### B. Bourbon Formula Investigation: Single Barrel Bourbon with Toasted Wood Staves

#### 1. Regulatory Framework: Bourbon Standards of Identity

**27 CFR § 5.143 - Definition of Bourbon Whisky:**

Bourbon whisky is defined as "whisky produced at not exceeding 160° proof from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent corn... and stored at not more than 125° proof in charred new oak containers."⁴²

**Key Requirements:**⁴³
1. ≥51% corn mash bill
2. Distilled at ≤160° proof (80% ABV)
3. Stored at ≤125° proof (62.5% ABV)
4. Aged in charred new oak containers
5. **NO added coloring, flavoring, or blending materials** (except water to reduce proof)

**Critical Language:** The standard requires "charred new oak containers," not "charred new oak barrels," which historically provided flexibility in container configuration but not in materials added during aging.⁴⁴

#### 2. The TTB Investigation: ASBC's Single Barrel Bourbon Formula

**Investigation Timeline:**
- **September 2024:** TTB initiated investigation into ASBC's Single Barrel Bourbon formula (Formula No. [redacted], approved 20XX)
- **Allegation:** Use of toasted French oak staves during aging constitutes "added flavoring" prohibited under bourbon standards of identity⁴⁵
- **Status:** Investigation ongoing; TTB has not issued final determination

**ASBC's Production Method (Based on Formula):**
1. Bourbon mash (53% corn, 35% rye, 12% malted barley) distilled to 155° proof
2. Barreled at 120° proof in charred new American oak barrels (char level 4)
3. After 3 years aging, **toasted French oak staves inserted into barrels** for additional 6-9 months
4. Bottled at 94 proof (no coloring or flavoring added)

**ASBC's Defense:**
- Toasted staves are part of the "charred new oak container" aging requirement, not "added flavoring"
- Staves are inserted into original barrels, which remain the aging container
- Process parallels Maker's Mark 46, which TTB approved as bourbon

**TTB's Position (Preliminary):**
- Toasted staves ≠ charred barrels
- Secondary wood finishing = HCFBM (Harmless Coloring, Flavoring, Blending Materials) under 27 CFR § 5.39(c)⁴⁶
- Product must be reclassified as "Whiskey Specialty" (Class Type 641), not bourbon (Class Type 141/101)⁴⁷

#### 3. Comparison to Maker's Mark 46: Critical Distinction

**Maker's Mark 46 Process:**⁴⁸
- Fully matured Maker's Mark bourbon transferred to emptied barrels
- Ten heavily **seared** French oak staves placed in barrels
- Additional 2-3 months finishing
- **Labeled as bourbon** - TTB approved

**Key Distinction:** Maker's Mark uses "seared" staves, which Maker's Mark argued (and TTB apparently accepted) qualifies as "charring" under bourbon standards.⁴⁹ ASBC uses "toasted" staves, which involve lower heat and do not achieve the same charring effect.

**"Toasted" vs. "Seared/Charred":**⁵⁰
- **Toasting:** 300-400°F, caramelizes wood sugars, no char layer
- **Charring/Searing:** 500-600°F, creates carbonized "red layer," chemical transformation
- TTB appears to distinguish these methods for standards of identity compliance

**Regulatory Uncertainty:** TTB has not published clear guidance on the toasting/searing distinction, creating substantial uncertainty for craft distillers using wood finishing techniques.⁵¹

#### 4. Class and Type Reclassification

If TTB denies ASBC's defense and reclassifies the product:

**Current Classification:** Bourbon Whisky (Class Type 141 or Straight Bourbon Class Type 101)

**Required Reclassification:** Whiskey Specialty (Class Type 641)⁵²

**Labeling Requirements (27 CFR § 5.39(c)):**⁵³
- Cannot use "bourbon" as class/type designation
- May state "bourbon" if followed by disclosure statement
- Must include: "Colored and Flavored with Toasted Oak Staves" or similar language
- Disclosure must appear on front label as part of class/type statement

**Example Compliant Label:**
> "Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished with Toasted Oak Staves"
> or
> "Whiskey Specialty - Bourbon Finished with Toasted Oak"

#### 5. Financial Exposure Analysis

**Inventory at Risk:**
- **Current inventory:** 85,000 bottles (750ml) of Single Barrel Bourbon
- **Wholesale value:** $47.00 per bottle
- **Total inventory value:** $3,995,000 (~$4 million)

**Recall and Relabeling Costs:**

| Scenario | Action Required | Cost Estimate |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **TTB Denial + Voluntary Recall** | Pull inventory, relabel, redistribute | $500K-$800K |
| **TTB Denial + Grandfather Existing Inventory** | Relabel future production only | $50K-$100K |
| **TTB Approval** | No action | $0 |

**Civil Penalties (26 U.S.C. § 5687):**⁵⁴
- General penalty for Chapter 51 violations: Up to $1,000 per violation or 1 year imprisonment
- However, TTB typically imposes administrative penalties rather than criminal penalties for labeling violations
- **Estimated administrative penalty range:** $10,000-$100,000 (depending on number of bottles in commerce, duration of violation, good faith)

**Reputational Risk:**
- Brand damage if "bourbon" label revoked
- Consumer confusion about product identity
- Competitive disadvantage vs. properly labeled bourbon

**Total Estimated Exposure:**

| Component | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Recall/Relabeling | $50,000 | $800,000 |
| Civil Penalties | $10,000 | $100,000 |
| Lost Sales (6 months) | $250,000 | $500,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$310,000** | **$1,400,000** |

**Note:** These estimates assume TTB does not require full destruction of inventory. If TTB determines product is "adulterated" under FAA Act, destruction costs could add $1-2M.⁵⁵

#### 6. Resolution Options and Strategy

**Option 1: Contest TTB Determination**
- Submit technical defense distinguishing toasted staves from prohibited flavorings
- Argue staves are part of "container" under 27 CFR § 5.143
- Provide sensory analysis showing minimal flavor impact vs. barrel aging alone
- **Timeline:** 6-12 months
- **Success probability:** 30-40% (TTB rarely reverses preliminary determinations)

**Option 2: Accept Reclassification and Relabel**
- Agree to Class Type 641 designation
- Relabel as "Bourbon Finished with Toasted Oak Staves"
- Request grandfather provision for existing inventory
- **Timeline:** 2-3 months
- **Success probability:** 90% (TTB typically accommodates cooperative compliance)

**Option 3: Reformulate Product**
- Remove toasted staves from production process
- Maintain "bourbon" designation
- Release existing inventory as Class Type 641, new production as bourbon
- **Timeline:** Immediate (prospective only)
- **Success probability:** 100%

**Option 4: Seek TTB Ruling**
- Request formal TTB Industry Circular or Ruling on toasting vs. searing distinction
- Industry-wide precedential value
- Delay resolution 12-18 months
- **Success probability:** 50% (would establish clear standard)

**Recommended Strategy for Transaction:**

**Pre-Closing (ABP/ASBC):**
1. Immediately engage TTB to expedite investigation resolution
2. Prepare relabeling plan for Class Type 641 compliance
3. Conduct product hold-back: Stop shipping Single Barrel Bourbon pending TTB decision
4. Request informal TTB guidance on Maker's Mark 46 distinction

**Closing Mechanics:**
1. **Purchase Agreement Provision:** Seller indemnifies Buyer for TTB penalties and recall costs related to pre-closing production
2. **Escrow:** Hold back $1.5M from purchase price pending TTB resolution (release after 12 months if no penalties)
3. **Inventory Representation:** Seller represents that all labeled bourbon complies with 27 CFR § 5.143 as of Seller's knowledge; Buyer assumes risk of TTB determination

**Post-Closing (ABP):**
1. If TTB requires reclassification: Implement Option 2 (accept and relabel)
2. Discontinue toasted stave finishing for bourbon products
3. Develop new "whiskey specialty" brand for finished products
4. Work with industry associations to seek TTB clarity on wood finishing standards

#### 7. Broader Industry Context

The TTB's investigation of ASBC reflects heightened scrutiny of wood finishing techniques across the spirits industry. Recent trends:
- **Increased use of alternative woods** (French oak, cherry, maple) for flavor development⁵⁶
- **Secondary barrel finishing** (port, sherry, wine casks) now common practice⁵⁷
- **TTB enforcement actions** targeting non-compliant bourbon labels (2022-2024)⁵⁸

**Legislative Context:** No current Congressional action to amend bourbon definition to accommodate wood finishing. Bourbon purists and Kentucky distillers oppose any relaxation of standards.⁵⁹

### C. Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) Transfers

#### 1. COLA Inventory and Transfer Requirements

**ASBC's Approved COLAs:**
- 120 beer COLAs
- 150 spirits COLAs
- 8 mead COLAs
- 2 cider COLAs
- **Total: 280 approved COLAs**

**Regulatory Framework:**⁶⁰

COLAs are issued per 27 CFR Parts 4 (wine), 5 (distilled spirits), and 7 (malt beverages). Each COLA identifies the "responsible advertiser" - the entity responsible for the product entering commerce.

#### 2. Allowable Changes to COLAs Without Reapplication

**TTB Allowable Revisions Policy:**⁶¹

Industry members may make certain changes to approved labels without submitting new COLA applications. The complete list of allowable revisions appears on pages 3-4 of TTB Form 5100.31.

**Responsible Advertiser Name Changes:**⁶²

TTB permits changing the name or trade name to reflect "a different name already approved for use by the responsible bonded wine cellar, taxpaid wine bottling house, distilled spirits plant, brewery, or importer," or changing the address where it is within the same state.

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** The name change provision applies only to names **already approved** for that specific responsible entity. This is not a general transfer provision - it allows using alternate names already on file with TTB for the same facility.⁶³

#### 3. Change of Ownership: Full COLA Reapplication Required

**When Responsible Advertiser Changes:**

If ASBC LLC's name changes post-acquisition (e.g., to "Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company, an ABP Company" or "ABP Artisan Division"), or if the responsible advertiser becomes a different legal entity (e.g., American Beverage Partners LLC), TTB considers this a change requiring new COLA applications.⁶⁴

**Reapplication Requirements:**
- New COLA application (TTB Form 5100.31) for each of 280 labels
- Submission of revised label artwork showing new responsible advertiser
- TTB review and approval before products can be sold
- **Timeline:** 60-90 days per COLA under current TTB processing times⁶⁵

**Processing Bottleneck:**

TTB processes COLAs sequentially based on submission date. For 280 COLAs submitted simultaneously:
- Best case (parallel processing with sufficient TTB staff): 60-90 days
- Realistic case (sequential processing in batches): 4-6 months
- Worst case (errors requiring resubmission): 6-12 months

#### 4. Strategic Options for COLA Management

**Option 1: Retain ASBC LLC as Operating Entity (RECOMMENDED)**

**Structure:**
- ABP acquires 100% membership interests in Artisan Spirits & Brewing Company, LLC
- ASBC LLC continues as operating subsidiary (wholly-owned by ABP)
- ASBC LLC name remains unchanged on all permits and COLAs
- No COLA reapplication required

**Advantages:**
- Zero COLA reapplication timeline or cost
- Immediate continuity of sales and distribution
- No consumer confusion from label changes
- Preserves brand equity in "Artisan" name

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires maintaining separate LLC (minimal cost: $200-500/year state fees)
- ABP's brand identity not immediately visible on labels

**Option 2: Rebrand and Reapply for 280 COLAs**

**Structure:**
- Change ASBC LLC name to ABP-affiliated name
- Or dissolve ASBC LLC and transfer operations to ABP
- Reapply for all 280 COLAs with new responsible advertiser
- Obtain TTB approval before resuming sales

**Advantages:**
- Unified branding under ABP corporate identity
- Simplifies corporate structure (single entity vs. subsidiary)

**Disadvantages:**
- **6-12 month timeline** before all COLAs approved
- **$280,000-$420,000 cost** (280 COLAs × $1,000-1,500 avg. legal/filing cost per COLA)⁶⁶
- Sales disruption: Cannot sell products until new COLAs approved
- Inventory obsolescence: Must relabel or destroy all existing labeled products
- Retailer/distributor confusion during transition

**Option 3: Phased Transition**

**Structure:**
- Retain ASBC LLC name for first 12-18 months post-closing
- Gradually rebrand products as COLAs expire and require renewal
- Submit new COLAs for rebranded products alongside natural renewals
- Complete transition over 2-3 years

**Advantages:**
- Avoids immediate reapplication bottleneck
- Spreads cost and administrative burden
- Maintains sales continuity

**Disadvantages:**
- Extended dual-branding period (market confusion)
- Requires tracking which COLAs are under which entity
- Ongoing administrative complexity

#### 5. COLA Revocation Case Study: Artisan IPA Labeling Violation

**Timeline:**
- **August 2024:** TTB revoked COLA for Artisan IPA 16 oz can
- **Violation:** Health warning statement font size too small (6-point vs. required 2mm/~8-point minimum)⁶⁷
- **Inventory impacted:** 120,000 cans × $7.00 wholesale = $840,000 value
- **October 2024:** New COLA approved with compliant font size; 120,000 cans relabeled

**Financial Impact:**
- Relabeling cost: $18,000 (120,000 cans × $0.15 per label replacement)
- Sales disruption (2 months): $140,000 lost revenue
- **Total cost: $158,000**

**Regulatory Analysis:**

27 CFR § 16.21 mandates health warning statements in specific font sizes:⁶⁸
- Containers >237ml and ≤3L: Minimum 2mm font height
- Letters/words shall not be compressed such that statement is not readily legible
- Statement must appear on contrasting background

**Penalty Exposure:**

27 CFR § 16.33: Violations of health warning requirements subject to civil penalty of **$26,225 per violation** (effective January 16, 2025, adjusted for inflation).⁶⁹ Each day of violation constitutes a separate offense.

ASBC's exposure if TTB had imposed maximum penalties:
- 120,000 non-compliant cans in commerce for 60 days
- Theoretical maximum: $26,225 × 60 days = **$1,573,500**
- TTB discretion to reduce penalties for good faith, prompt corrective action

**TTB's Enforcement Posture:** TTB did not impose civil penalties in this case, likely due to:
- ASBC's voluntary detection and notification to TTB
- Immediate product hold and relabeling commitment
- No consumer complaints or health/safety issue
- First-time violation of 27 CFR Part 16

**Lesson for Transaction:** The COLA revocation demonstrates TTB's active enforcement of labeling standards. Post-acquisition, ABP must audit all 280 COLAs for technical compliance to avoid similar issues.

#### 6. Recommendations for Purchase Agreement

**Representations and Warranties:**
- Seller represents all 280 COLAs are in good standing and compliant with 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, 7, 16
- Seller represents no pending TTB investigations or COLA revocation proceedings (except disclosed bourbon investigation)
- Seller warrants all labeled inventory complies with approved COLAs

**Indemnification:**
- Seller indemnifies Buyer for pre-closing COLA violations discovered post-closing
- **Survival period:** 24 months (sufficient to cover TTB enforcement statute of limitations)
- **Cap:** $2 million (sufficient to cover COLA reapplication costs + penalties for all products)

**Closing Conditions:**
- No COLA revocations or pending revocation proceedings as of closing
- All products sold in 12 months pre-closing comply with approved COLAs

**Post-Closing Covenants:**
- Buyer conducts comprehensive COLA compliance audit within 90 days of closing
- Buyer rectifies any non-compliances before statute of limitations expires

### D. Federal and State Tied House Compliance

#### 1. Federal Tied House Framework (27 CFR Part 6)

**Statutory Basis:**

27 U.S.C. § 205 (Federal Alcohol Administration Act § 105(b)) prohibits producers and wholesalers from inducing retailers to purchase their products to the exclusion of competitors' products through furnishing things of value.⁷⁰

**27 CFR Part 6 Implementation:**⁷¹

Subpart C identifies unlawful inducements; Subpart D provides exceptions. Industry members may furnish retailers equipment, signs, supplies, services, or other things of value only under prescribed conditions and limitations.

**Critical Distinction for Breweries:**⁷²

"In the case of malt beverages, this part applies to transactions between a retailer in any State and a brewer... only to the extent that the law of such State imposes requirements similar to section 105(b) of the [FAA Act]."

**Practical Effect:** Federal tied house laws apply to ASBC's breweries (malt beverage production) **only if** Oregon, Colorado, and North Carolina have substantially similar state tied house laws. All three states have such laws, making federal and state prohibitions cumulatively applicable.

**Distillery Operations:** Federal tied house laws under 27 CFR Part 6 apply **directly and unconditionally** to ASBC's distillery operations (distilled spirits production), regardless of state law.⁷³

#### 2. Oregon Tied House Investigation: Free Beer to Retailers

**Factual Background:**
- **June 2024:** ASBC provided free beer samples to 12 Oregon retailers
- **Total value:** $6,048 ($504 average per retailer)
- **Violation:** Exceeded Oregon's sample limits under ORS 471.398/471.400

**Oregon Tied House Law (ORS 471.392-471.400):**⁷⁴

ORS 471.392 defines "manufacturer or wholesaler" to include brewery license holders. ORS 471.398 prohibits manufacturers/wholesalers from providing financial assistance to retailers, subject to exceptions in ORS 471.400.

**Exception for Samples (ORS 471.398(4)):**⁷⁵

Manufacturers may provide "items of nominal value" including:
- Distilled spirits samples ≤50ml per retailer for products the retailer does not carry
- Wine and malt beverage tastings/samples (no specified limit for products not carried)

**Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR 845-013-0020, 845-013-0060):**⁷⁶

Implementing ORS 471.398(4), OLCC rules limit the value and frequency of samples to prevent circumventing tied house prohibitions. Industry guidance suggests monthly sample value limits of approximately $50-100 per retailer.⁷⁷

**ASBC's Violation:**

ASBC provided $504 worth of beer per retailer (10× suggested monthly limit), distributed over 3 months (April-June 2024). OLCC determined this exceeded "nominal value" exception and constituted prohibited financial assistance.

**OLCC Enforcement Timeline:**
- **June 2024:** OLCC field investigation commenced
- **September 2024:** OLCC issued Notice of Violation to ASBC
- **October 2024:** ASBC submitted written response contesting violation severity
- **Anticipated Resolution:** Q1 2026 (OLCC administrative hearings and settlement negotiations)

#### 3. OLCC Penalty Structure and Exposure Analysis

**Category III Violation Classification:**⁷⁸

Tied house/financial assistance violations are Category III violations under OLCC sanction schedule. Category III encompasses "Violations that create a potential threat to public health or safety OR violations of the tied house or financial assistance prohibitions."

**Standard Sanction for Category III:**⁷⁹
- First offense: 10-day license suspension OR $1,650 civil penalty per violation
- Calculation: $165 per day × 10 days = $1,650

**ASBC's Exposure (12 Retailers):**

| Scenario | Violations Counted | Total Penalty | License Suspension |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Minimal (single violation)** | 1 (single course of conduct) | $1,650 | 10 days |
| **Moderate (per retailer)** | 12 (one per retailer) | $19,800 | 120 days (likely reduced via settlement) |
| **Severe (per transaction)** | 36 (3 deliveries × 12 retailers) | $59,400 | 360 days (business-killing) |

**Most Likely Outcome:**

OLCC typically counts tied house violations on a per-retailer basis. For 12 retailers receiving improper assistance, ASBC faces:
- **12 violations × $1,650 = $19,800 civil penalty**
- OR **120-day license suspension** (reduced to 30-60 days via settlement)

**Mitigating Factors:**
- No health/safety issue (consumer protection not implicated)
- ASBC's clean compliance history (no prior OLCC violations)
- Voluntary corrective action (ASBC immediately ceased free sample program)
- Good faith misunderstanding of "nominal value" limit

**Aggravating Factors:**
- Systematic conduct across multiple retailers (not isolated incident)
- Commercial value significant ($6,048 total)
- Competitive advantage gained over compliant breweries

**Settlement Likelihood:** 85%

OLCC typically settles Category III violations for:
- 50-75% of maximum penalty ($10,000-$15,000 civil penalty)
- Short suspension (7-15 days) converted to civil penalty
- Probationary period requiring enhanced compliance monitoring

**Estimated Settlement Range: $12,000-$18,000 + 1-year probation**

#### 4. Impact on Transaction

**Pre-Closing Considerations:**

**Material Adverse Effect Analysis:**
- $12,000-$18,000 penalty = 0.0015% of $1.2B transaction value
- Not material to transaction economics
- **However:** License suspension (even 7-15 days) could disrupt Oregon brewery operations, which IS material

**Closing Condition Proposal:**
- OLCC investigation must be resolved (settled or dismissed) before closing
- OR Seller pays penalty and provides evidence no suspension will be imposed
- OR Escrow $50,000 pending resolution (released to party bearing penalty per settlement terms)

**Representations and Warranties:**
- Seller represents no other tied house violations in past 5 years
- Seller represents OLCC investigation is only pending enforcement matter
- Seller warrants compliance with ORS 471 and all state ABC laws in all operating jurisdictions

**Indemnification:**
- Seller indemnifies Buyer for OLCC penalties and legal fees related to pre-closing conduct
- **Cap:** $100,000 (sufficient to cover severe scenario + legal defense costs)
- **Basket:** $5,000 (excludes de minimis penalties)

**Post-Closing Compliance Program:**

ABP should implement enhanced tied house compliance for all facilities:
1. **Written Policy:** Prohibit "things of value" to retailers beyond explicit regulatory exceptions
2. **Sample Tracking:** Log all samples provided to retailers with value calculations
3. **Monthly Audit:** Review all retailer interactions for tied house compliance
4. **Training:** Annual tied house training for sales, marketing, and brewery personnel
5. **State Law Compliance:** Audit compliance with tied house laws in CO, NC, OR (breweries) and OR (distillery)

#### 5. Multi-State Tied House Compliance Matrix

**Colorado (Denver Brewery):**
- Colo. Rev. Stat. § 44-3-301 et seq. (Colorado Liquor Code)
- Prohibits manufacturers from having financial interest in retailers
- Similar exceptions for samples and promotional materials
- Colorado Department of Revenue, Liquor Enforcement Division enforcement

**North Carolina (Asheville Brewery):**
- N.C. Gen. Stat. § 18B-1114 (Tied House prohibitions)
- Prohibits manufacturers from providing "things of value" to retailers beyond exceptions
- North Carolina ABC Commission enforcement
- Violations subject to civil penalties and license suspension

**Oregon (Portland Brewery, Portland Distillery, Hood River Winery):**
- ORS 471.392-471.400 (Financial assistance prohibitions)
- Most restrictive tied house regime of the three states
- OLCC aggressive enforcement posture

**Compliance Recommendation:** Adopt Oregon's most restrictive standards as company-wide policy to ensure compliance in all jurisdictions. This "highest common denominator" approach prevents multi-state violations.

#### 6. Federal Tied House Exposure (Distillery Operations)

**27 CFR Part 6 Applicability:**⁸⁰

Federal tied house laws apply directly to ASBC's distilled spirits operations without regard to state law. If ASBC provided free spirits samples to Oregon retailers in same manner as beer samples, **federal FAA Act violations** occurred.

**Federal Penalty Exposure:**

27 U.S.C. § 205(e): Violations subject to suspension/revocation of basic permit and/or criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (false statements) if misrepresented on TTB filings.⁸¹

TTB administrative penalties for tied house violations typically range $5,000-$50,000 depending on severity and prior compliance history.⁸²

**Due Diligence Action Item:** Confirm whether ASBC's June 2024 retailer samples included distilled spirits. If yes, federal tied house investigation risk exists independent of OLCC matter.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy | Estimated Exposure |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **TTB permit transfer delays closing** | CRITICAL | High (70%) | Make TTB approvals closing condition; 180-day outside date | $20M-$40M revenue loss |
| **Operations cessation if close before TTB approval** | CRITICAL | Medium (40%) | Prohibit closing before written TTB approvals received | Incalculable |
| **Bourbon investigation requires reclassification** | HIGH | Medium-High (60%) | Escrow $1.5M; Seller indemnity; Pre-close relabeling plan | $310K-$1.4M |
| **OLCC tied house penalty + suspension** | MEDIUM | High (85%) | Resolve before closing or escrow $50K | $12K-$18K + operations disruption |
| **COLA reapplication if name changes** | MEDIUM | Low (20%) | Retain ASBC LLC as subsidiary; avoid name change | $280K-$420K + 6-12 month delay |
| **Federal tied house violation (distillery samples)** | MEDIUM | Low-Medium (30%) | Due diligence confirmation; Seller indemnity | $5K-$50K |
| **Additional COLA violations discovered** | LOW | Medium (50%) | Post-closing COLA compliance audit within 90 days | $10K-$500K |
| **TTB bond insufficient for new owners** | LOW | Low (20%) | Pre-closing bond adequacy analysis | $100K-$300K additional bonding costs |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Distillery Samples to Retailers:** Confirm whether June 2024 retailer samples included distilled spirits (federal tied house violation independent of state OLCC matter)

2. **Other State Tied House Violations:** Audit Colorado and North Carolina operations for similar retailer assistance violations

3. **Formula Compliance Beyond Bourbon:** Review all 42 approved formulas for standards of identity compliance (not just bourbon formula under investigation)

4. **Taproom Licensing:** Verify all 18 taprooms hold proper retail licenses and comply with tied house self-distribution exceptions

5. **Background Investigation Issues:** Assess whether ABP principals have any regulatory compliance history that could delay TTB approvals

6. **Bond Capacity:** Confirm surety company will issue bonds for ABP within required timelines and amounts

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Quantified Regulatory Exposure (Excluding Transaction Delay Costs):**

| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Most Likely |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Bourbon Investigation | $310,000 | $1,400,000 | $600,000 |
| OLCC Tied House Penalties | $12,000 | $60,000 | $15,000 |
| Federal Tied House (if distillery samples) | $0 | $50,000 | $15,000 |
| COLA Violations (if discovered) | $0 | $500,000 | $50,000 |
| Additional Bonding Costs | $0 | $300,000 | $100,000 |
| **TOTAL REGULATORY EXPOSURE** | **$322,000** | **$2,310,000** | **$780,000** |

**Percentage of Transaction Value:** 0.027%-0.19% (de minimis relative to $1.2B purchase price)

**Transaction Delay Costs (If TTB Approval Delays Closing):**

| Delay Period | Lost EBITDA | Seasonal Impact Multiplier | Total Exposure |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| 60 days | $20M | 1.0× (normal) | $20M |
| 90 days | $30M | 1.2× (if crosses holiday season) | $36M |
| 120 days | $40M | 1.5× (if crosses spring production) | $60M |

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Transaction delay costs due to TTB permit approval timelines **dwarf** regulatory penalty exposure. The primary risk is not fines but operational disruption.

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **TTB Permit Transfers Are the Critical Path:** The 120-180 day timeline for distillery permit approval and 60-120 day timeline for brewery permits present the greatest risk to transaction closing. Operations MUST cease if ownership changes before TTB grants written approval.

2. **Bourbon Investigation Is Manageable:** The $310K-$1.4M exposure from the bourbon formula investigation, while non-trivial, can be effectively allocated through escrow and indemnification. The reclassification to "Whiskey Specialty" is likely but not business-threatening.

3. **OLCC Tied House Matter Will Settle:** The Oregon tied house investigation will likely settle for $12K-$18K plus probation. This is immaterial to transaction economics but requires resolution to avoid license suspension risk.

4. **COLA Strategy Is Outcome-Determinative:** Retaining ASBC LLC as a subsidiary avoids $280K-$420K in costs and 6-12 months of sales disruption from COLA reapplications. This is the single most important post-closing structural decision.

5. **Cumulative Regulatory Risk Is De Minimis:** Total quantified regulatory exposure ($322K-$2.3M) represents 0.027%-0.19% of transaction value. These are manageable closing adjustment items, not deal blockers.

6. **Operational Disruption Risk Is Material:** Transaction delay costs ($20M-$60M) and operations cessation requirements present material risks requiring careful transaction structuring.

3. **Multi-State Tied House Violations:** Any similar violations in Colorado or North Carolina? (Requires audit of sales practices in all states)

4. **Taproom Three-Tier Compliance:** Do all 18 taprooms comply with state self-distribution exceptions? (Requires license verification and state law analysis)

5. **Formula Compliance:** Do all 42 formulas comply with current standards of identity? (Requires TTB counsel technical review)

6. **Bond Capacity:** Will surety company issue bonds for ABP within timelines required? (Requires surety consultation and pre-commitment)

7. **Seasonal Production Impact:** Does TTB approval timeline cross critical production seasons? (Requires production schedule analysis)

8. **State License Approvals:** Do state ABC agencies (Oregon OLCC, Colorado DOR, North Carolina ABC) require separate ownership change approvals? (Requires state law analysis for all three states)

### D. Cross-Domain Impacts for Memorandum Synthesis

| TTB Finding | Impacts Legal Domain | Relevant Doctrine/Statute | Memo Section Reference |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| TTB permit transfer = closing condition | Corporate/M&A | Closing conditions, MAC, outside date | Transaction Structure |

**Key Cross-References for Memo Generator:**
- **Corporate M&A Counsel:** Structure transaction with ASBC LLC as surviving subsidiary to avoid COLA reapplications ($280K-$420K savings + 6-12 month timeline)
- **Tax Counsel:** Bourbon inventory escrow ($1.5M) creates timing issue for purchase price allocation and IRC § 1060 reporting
- **Securities Counsel (if applicable):** Bourbon investigation and OLCC matter require Item 303 disclosure if material to ABP (likely not material given amounts)
- **Litigation Counsel:** OLCC administrative settlement negotiations require coordination with transaction timeline
- **Financing Counsel:** $450K bonding requirement must be factored into working capital and capitalization structure
- **Real Estate Counsel:** Taproom licenses tied to premises; any real estate changes trigger license amendments
