## CRITICAL ISSUES CHECKLIST

Identify HIGH-priority issues that MUST be addressed:

| # | Critical Issue | Domain | Why Critical | Expected Exposure |
|---|----------------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | TTB permit transfer timeline | Regulatory | 5 permits (3 brewery, 1 DSP, 1 winery) require 60-120 days approval; production shutdown if delayed | Deal-blocking |
| 2 | Bourbon formula investigation | Regulatory | TTB investigating toasted wood staves as "added flavoring"; denial = $4M recall + fine | $4M-$4.2M |
| 3 | Controlled group FET increase | Tax | If ABP has other breweries/distilleries, ASBC loses reduced rates → $500K-$1.3M annual FET increase | $500K-$1.3M/year |
| 4 | Texas Lone Star litigation | Litigation | Distributor termination under franchise law; brand value compensation + lost profits | $2.8M-$4M |
| 5 | Distributor consolidation costs | Franchise Law | If ABP consolidates 30-50 underperforming distributors, franchise law compensation in 25 states | $10M-$25M |
| 6 | 50-state ABC approvals | Regulatory | 118 licenses require change of control approval; CA/NY/TX/FL/IL = 90-180 days | Deal timing risk |

| 9 | FTC health claims investigation | Regulatory | Social media posts claimed health benefits; cease & desist + corrective advertising | $60K-$120K |
| 10 | COLA transfers (280 labels) | Regulatory | If ASBC name changes, must re-apply for all COLAs (60-90 days each) | Deal timing risk |

**Tracking Rule:** Each critical issue MUST appear in at least one specialist report with:
- Detailed legal analysis
- Quantified exposure range
- Risk mitigation recommendations

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Document key assumptions for specialist context:

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| ASBC has valid TTB permits | User-provided (3 brewery, 1 DSP, 1 winery) | If permits invalid/suspended, deal-blocking |
| ABP has other beverage holdings | User instruction to "assume ABP owns 2 other craft breweries" for FET analysis | If ABP has no other holdings, no controlled group FET increase |
| 305 distributor agreements are standard form | User-provided (180 beer, 125 spirits, standard terms) | If agreements highly non-standard, consolidation analysis more complex |
| Bourbon investigation is only pending TTB matter | User disclosure | If other undisclosed TTB investigations, additional exposure |
| No pending environmental violations | User statement "no pending violations" but compliance verification needed | If violations exist, EPA enforcement exposure |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual TTB investigation file not provided (bourbon toasted wood staves) - using user summary
- Distributor agreement templates not provided - analyzing based on user description of standard terms
- ABP's actual beverage holdings not disclosed - modeling hypothetical controlled group scenarios
- ASBC's insurance policy terms not provided - using $5M/$100K limits from user description

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:**
1. Phase 1 (T1-T6) must complete before Phase 3 (T10 financial aggregation)
2. Bourbon investigation resolution (#2) is deal-blocking - must be addressed pre-closing
3. TTB permit timeline (#1) is deal-blocking - 60-120 days requires immediate filing
4. Controlled group FET (#3) affects EBITDA by $500K-$1.3M annually - material valuation impact

**Potential Issues:**
- If bourbon formula denied, $4M inventory recall affects working capital and may trigger MAE
- If TTB/ABC approvals delayed beyond 120 days, deal timeline at risk (18-day Investment Committee urgency suggests aggressive closing timeline)
- If ABP has 3+ other breweries/distilleries, controlled group FET increase could exceed $1.5M annually

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If any specialist finds >$10M single exposure, flag immediately
- If bourbon investigation appears likely to result in denial (>50% probability), recommend deal restructure or withdrawal
- If TTB permit timeline >120 days likely, recommend extended outside date in purchase agreement

### Gaps Identified

**CRITICAL GAPS (require remediation):**
- ❌ **None identified**

**MAJOR GAPS (recommend additional research):**
- ❌ **None identified**

**MINOR GAPS (note only):**
- ✅ Stylistic variations (Executive Summary heading levels) - ACCEPTABLE, memo-generator will normalize
- ✅ D&O/EPLI policy existence unknown - Properly flagged as due diligence action item (not research gap)
- ✅ Phase I ESA not completed - Properly flagged as timeline constraint (not research gap)
- ✅ ABP beverage holdings unknown - Properly addressed via sensitivity analysis in T2

**RESULT:** No remediation required. All "gaps" are factual information limitations or due diligence constraints, not research deficiencies.
