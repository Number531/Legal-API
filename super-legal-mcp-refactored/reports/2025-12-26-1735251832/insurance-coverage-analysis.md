## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This insurance coverage analysis assesses ASBC's insurance portfolio in connection with ABP's proposed $1.2 billion acquisition, with primary focus on the **Oregon Smith dram shop case** ($1.85M-$3.85M claimed damages). The analysis evaluates coverage for the Smith case and four other known liabilities (Lone Star litigation, TTB bourbon investigation, FTC advertising investigation, EEOC Gonzalez claim), assesses policy adequacy for ASBC's 18-location craft beverage operations, and identifies critical transaction-related insurance issues requiring immediate attention.

**Bottom Line:** The Oregon Smith dram shop case is **highly likely to be insured** under ASBC's $5 million general liability policy with dram shop coverage, limiting ASBC's direct exposure to the $100,000 self-insured retention. However, **critical coverage gaps exist or remain unconfirmed** for other known liabilities, resulting in $5.5M-$8.5M aggregate uninsured exposure depending on whether ASBC maintains D&O and EPLI coverage. ABP must immediately verify the existence of D&O and EPLI policies, confirm timely notice for the Smith case, and address change of control provisions to prevent policy termination at closing.

### Key Findings

#### A. Oregon Smith Dram Shop Case Coverage - **LOW RISK, INSURED**

**Coverage Opinion:** **COVERED** ✓ (Confidence: 85-90%)

The $2.5M-$3.5M Oregon Smith dram shop case is highly likely to be covered under ASBC's confirmed $5 million general liability policy with dram shop coverage:

**Affirmative Coverage Factors:**
- **Liquor liability coverage confirmed:** Litigation report (T4) states ASBC maintains "$5 million general liability policy including dram shop coverage"
- **Claims falls within policy:** Serving alcohol to allegedly visibly intoxicated patron causing third-party injuries is precisely the risk liquor liability coverage addresses
- **No exclusions apply:** Intentional acts, criminal conduct, pollution, professional services, and employer's liability exclusions do not bar coverage
- **Oregon duty to defend:** Oregon's broad duty to defend standard (eight corners rule) requires insurer to defend based on complaint allegations alone
- **Settlement range manageable:** $500K-$1.5M settlement range well within $5M policy limits

**Financial Impact:**
- **ASBC maximum exposure:** $100,000 (SIR only)
- **Insurer exposure:** $400K-$1.4M (settlement/judgment exceeding SIR)
- **Probability-weighted ASBC cost:** $100,000 (capped at SIR)

**Conditions Requiring Verification:**
- **Timely notice:** Confirm ASBC notified insurer within 30-60 days of September 2023 incident (late notice could trigger prejudice analysis under Oregon law)
- **Policy type:** Confirm occurrence-based (most likely) vs. claims-made trigger
- **No reservation of rights disputes:** Verify insurer accepted defense without coverage defenses
- **Actual policy language:** Analysis based on standard ISO forms; actual policy may vary

**Risk Assessment:** **LOW RISK** - Coverage is highly probable, and ASBC's financial exposure is capped at $100K SIR regardless of settlement or verdict amount (up to $5M policy limit).

#### B. Coverage for Other Known Liabilities - **HIGH RISK, LARGELY UNINSURED**

| Liability | Exposure | Coverage Status | ASBC Net Exposure |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Texas Lone Star Litigation** | $800K-$2.0M | **NO COVERAGE** (CGL excludes economic loss) | $800K-$2.0M |
| **TTB Bourbon Investigation** | $4.0M-$4.2M | **NO COVERAGE** (no product recall insurance) | $4.0M-$4.2M |
| **FTC Advertising Investigation** | $64K-$120K | **PARTIAL** (defense costs if D&O exists) | $64K-$120K |
| **EEOC Gonzalez Claim** | $750K-$1.1M | **YES** (if EPLI exists and reported) | $10K-$50K (deductible) |
| **EEOC Gonzalez (no EPLI)** | $750K-$1.1M | **NO COVERAGE** | $750K-$1.1M |

**Aggregate Uninsured Exposure:**
- **Best case** (EPLI exists): $5.474M-$7.42M
- **Worst case** (no EPLI): $6.214M-$8.52M

**Critical Insight:** ASBC faces $5.5M-$8.5M in known uninsured liabilities, representing **4.6%-7.1% of the $1.2B purchase price**. This exposure must be addressed through escrow/holdback ($7M-$10M recommended), purchase price adjustment, and/or pre-closing settlement of key liabilities.

#### C. Critical Coverage Gaps (Due Diligence Priority Items)

**1. EPLI Status Unknown - CRITICAL GAP**

**Issue:** Unknown whether ASBC maintains Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) covering the $850K EEOC Gonzalez discrimination/retaliation claim.

**Impact if No EPLI:**
- Gonzalez exposure increases from **$10K-$50K (deductible)** to **$750K-$1.1M (full exposure)**
- Future employment claims (likely 2-3 annually for 1,850-employee workforce) become uninsured
- Hospitality sector faces elevated harassment/discrimination risk (950 taproom employees)

**Recommendation:** **Immediate verification required** (within 7 business days). If no EPLI exists, this is a **material uninsured exposure** requiring increased escrow by $750K-$1.1M.

**2. D&O Status Unknown - CRITICAL GAP**

**Issue:** Unknown whether ASBC maintains Directors & Officers (D&O) liability insurance covering regulatory investigations (TTB, FTC, OLCC).

**Impact if No D&O:**
- Regulatory defense costs ($220K-$370K for TTB + FTC + OLCC) become uninsured
- Investigation-related entity coverage unavailable
- Private equity sponsors typically require D&O for portfolio companies, suggesting likely exists

**Recommendation:** **Immediate verification required**. If no D&O exists, add $220K-$370K to uninsured exposure and consider requiring ASBC to procure D&O pre-closing.

**3. Change of Control Policy Termination - TRANSACTION-BLOCKING RISK**

**Issue:** Most insurance policies contain "change of control" provisions that **terminate or modify coverage** upon acquisition without proper notice and insurer consent.

**Impact if Not Addressed:**
- **All policies may terminate at closing**, leaving ASBC/ABP with:
  - Uninsured Smith case: $500K-$1.5M (settlement range)
  - Uninsured Gonzalez claim: $750K-$1.1M (if EPLI terminates)
  - Uninsured future claims arising from pre-closing conduct

**Critical Action Required:**
1. **Notice to all insurers** (30-60 days pre-closing)
2. **Obtain assignment consent** for policy transfer to ABP
3. **Add ABP as additional insured** on all policies
4. **Verify no automatic termination** at closing

**Risk Level:** **CRITICAL** - Failure to address change of control is a **deal-blocking issue** that could leave ABP with $6M-$9M in uninsured pre-closing liabilities.

**4. Tail Coverage for Claims-Made Policies - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Issue:** D&O and EPLI policies (if they exist) are likely written on claims-made basis, requiring "tail coverage" (extended reporting period) to cover claims arising from pre-closing conduct reported after closing.

**Tail Coverage Cost:**
- **6-year tail recommended:** $500K-$750K (2.5×-3× annual premium)
- **Allocation:** Typically seller's responsibility; may negotiate 50/50 split

**Recommendation:** Require ASBC to purchase 6-year tail for all claims-made policies as closing condition. Cost to be factored into purchase price negotiation.

#### D. Policy Adequacy Assessment

**Adequate Coverage:**
- ✅ **Liquor Liability ($5M):** Industry-leading limits for 18-location operations (industry standard: $1M-$5M)
- ✅ **SIR Structure ($100K):** Reasonable retention; protects ASBC from catastrophic loss
- ✅ **Oregon statutory compliance:** $5M far exceeds $300K Oregon minimum requirement

**Critical Unknown/Unconfirmed Coverage:**
- ❓ **D&O Insurance ($10M-$25M recommended):** Essential for $4.4M regulatory exposure
- ❓ **EPLI ($2M-$5M recommended):** Essential for 1,850-employee workforce
- ❓ **Umbrella/Excess ($5M-$25M recommended):** Protects against catastrophic multi-claim scenarios

**Acceptable Coverage Gaps:**
- ⚠️ **Product Recall Insurance:** $4M bourbon recall uninsured (not typical for craft breweries)
- ⚠️ **E&O/Commercial Contracts:** Lone Star $800K-$2M uninsured (economic loss excluded from CGL)

**Overall Assessment:** **CONDITIONALLY ADEQUATE** - Liquor liability coverage is strong, but D&O/EPLI existence must be confirmed. If both exist with adequate limits, ASBC's insurance program is sufficient for its risk profile.

### Executive Recommendations for ABP (Buyer)

#### Immediate Actions (Within 7 Business Days)

**1. Obtain Complete Insurance Policies**
- Request all policies from ASBC (CGL/liquor, D&O, EPLI, umbrella, E&O, cyber, product recall)
- Identify insurers, policy numbers, periods, limits, deductibles/SIRs
- Review actual policy language (analysis based on standard forms; actual language controls)

**2. Confirm Coverage for Key Claims**
- **Smith case:** Verify insurer notified in September-October 2023 (timely notice); obtain coverage position letter
- **Gonzalez EEOC:** If EPLI exists, confirm EEOC charge reported to insurer
- **TTB/FTC:** If D&O exists, confirm investigations reported to insurer

**3. Quantify Uninsured Exposure**
- If no EPLI: add $750K-$1.1M to uninsured exposure
- If no D&O: add $220K-$370K defense costs
- **Total uninsured:** $5.5M-$8.5M (depending on EPLI/D&O status)

#### Pre-Closing Actions (30-60 Days Before Closing)

**4. Address Change of Control**
- ASBC must notify all insurers of acquisition (30-60 days pre-closing)
- Obtain insurer consent to assign policies to ABP
- Add ABP as additional insured/successor in interest on all policies
- Verify policies continue post-closing without termination

**5. Require Tail Coverage Purchase**
- ASBC must purchase 6-year tail for all claims-made policies (D&O, EPLI, E&O if applicable)
- Estimated cost: $500K-$750K
- Allocate cost in purchase agreement (typically seller pays; may split 50/50)

**6. Due Diligence Completion**
- Interview ASBC's insurance broker (understand complete program, claims history, premium costs)
- Obtain 5-year loss runs (review all claims under each policy)
- Identify red flags (prior coverage denials, bad faith disputes, late notice issues)

#### Purchase Agreement Provisions

**7. Escrow/Holdback Structure**
- **Amount:** $7M-$10M to cover uninsured known liabilities
  - Lone Star settlement: $800K-$2.0M
  - TTB bourbon investigation: $4.0M-$4.2M
  - FTC/EEOC (if uninsured): $750K-$1.2M
  - Contingency: $500K-$1.0M
- **Release schedule:**
  - $2.0M released upon Lone Star settlement
  - $4.2M released upon TTB investigation resolution (if no recall required)
  - $500K released 18 months post-closing
  - Balance released 24 months post-closing

**8. Representations, Covenants, and Conditions**
- **Insurance rep:** All policies in full force, no coverage disputes, all premiums current
- **Maintain coverage:** ASBC maintains all policies through closing without reduction
- **Tail coverage:** ASBC purchases 6-year tail as closing condition
- **Assignment consent:** Receipt of insurer consent (or legal opinion consent not required)

### Transaction Risk Assessment

**Overall Insurance Coverage Risk Level:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Risk Factors:**
- ✅ **Smith case well-insured:** $5M liquor liability coverage adequate, ASBC exposure capped at $100K SIR
- ⚠️ **$5.5M-$8.5M uninsured exposure:** Lone Star + TTB + FTC + potentially EEOC/Gonzalez
- 🛑 **Change of control risk:** Policies may terminate at closing without proper notice/consent (CRITICAL)
- ⚠️ **Unknown D&O/EPLI status:** Cannot assess full coverage adequacy without policy verification

**Go/No-Go Decision Factors:**

**✅ PROCEED** if:
- D&O and EPLI exist with adequate limits ($10M+ D&O, $2M+ EPLI)
- Smith case coverage confirmed with timely notice
- Change of control properly addressed (notice, consent, assignment)
- Tail coverage procured for all claims-made policies
- $7M-$10M escrow/holdback negotiated for uninsured liabilities

**⚠️ PROCEED WITH CAUTION** if:
- D&O or EPLI absent (requiring increased escrow $8M-$12M)
- Smith case late notice issue (requiring litigation with insurer or increased escrow)
- Partial change of control resolution (some policies assigned, others disputed)

**🛑 RECONSIDER TRANSACTION** if:
- All policies absent (D&O, EPLI, umbrella) + Smith coverage dispute + late notice issues
- Insurer denies Smith coverage (exposing ASBC/ABP to $500K-$1.5M uninsured settlement)
- Change of control triggers automatic termination of all policies
- **Total uninsured exposure exceeds $10M** (representing fundamentally uninsurable target)

**Current Recommendation:** **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - Pending immediate verification (within 7 business days) of:
1. D&O and EPLI policy existence and limits
2. Smith case notice date and insurer coverage position
3. Change of control provisions and insurer consent requirements

If verification confirms D&O/EPLI exist and Smith coverage is solid, transaction can proceed with **standard risk allocation** ($7M-$10M escrow for known uninsured liabilities). If verification reveals material gaps, transaction requires **enhanced risk mitigation** (increased escrow $8M-$12M, purchase price adjustment $5M-$7M, or pre-closing settlement of key liabilities).

### Research Quality Attestation

**Completeness:** ✅ Comprehensive analysis of Oregon Smith dram shop coverage, other known liabilities, policy adequacy, and transaction implications based on T1-T6 specialist reports and 15+ web searches on Oregon insurance law, policy structures, and industry standards.

**Confidence Levels:**

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Smith coverage likely** | **HIGH (85-90%)** | Confirmed dram shop coverage + straightforward claim + Oregon broad duty to defend standard |
| **Lone Star uninsured** | **HIGH (90%)** | Economic loss claims systematically excluded from CGL as industry standard |
| **TTB uninsured** | **HIGH (85%)** | Product recall insurance rare for craft breweries; fines/penalties excluded from all policies |
| **EPLI critical if absent** | **HIGH (90%)** | 1,850 employees + hospitality sector + $850K Gonzalez = material uninsured risk |
| **D&O critical if absent** | **MEDIUM (70%)** | Regulatory exposure significant but defense costs potentially manageable uninsured |

**Known Limitations:**
- **No actual policy review:** Analysis based on standard ISO CGL/liquor liability forms and industry practices; actual policy language may differ materially and controls coverage
- **Unknown policies:** D&O, EPLI, umbrella, E&O existence and terms unconfirmed
- **Insurer identity:** Carrier financial strength ratings not assessed (affects collectability risk)
- **Premium costs:** Policy renewal terms and premium history not addressed
- **International operations:** 8-market international distribution not analyzed (outside scope)

**Escalation Trigger:** If Items 1-4 (policy discovery, Smith notice, EPLI/D&O verification) are not resolved within **7 business days**, ABP should escalate to Investment Committee with recommendation to:
- Increase escrow/holdback by $5M-$8M (total $12M-$18M)
- Require ASBC to obtain EPLI and D&O insurance pre-closing (if absent)
- Adjust purchase price by $5M-$7M to account for uninsured risk
- Consider deal withdrawal if total uninsured exposure exceeds $10M without adequate mitigation

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Oregon Dram Shop Insurance Coverage Framework

#### 1. General Liability Policy Structure and Liquor Liability Exclusion

**ISO CGL Policy Standard Provisions:**

The standard ISO Commercial General Liability (CGL) policy contains a **liquor liability exclusion** that eliminates coverage for dram shop claims. According to industry sources, the liquor liability exclusion applies only to insureds who are "in the business" of manufacturing, distributing, selling, serving, or furnishing alcoholic beverages.¹

The ISO liquor liability exclusion states that coverage does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising from:
- Causing or contributing to a person becoming intoxicated
- Furnishing alcoholic beverages to a person who is under the legal drinking age
- Furnishing alcoholic beverages to a person who is already under the influence of alcohol
- Any violation of law relating to the sale, gift, distribution, or use of alcoholic beverages²

**Critical Issue for ASBC:** As a craft brewery/distillery operating 18 taprooms where alcohol is served directly to consumers, ASBC is unquestionably "in the business" of serving alcoholic beverages. This means the standard CGL liquor liability exclusion would apply, **eliminating coverage** for the Oregon Smith dram shop case under a standard ISO CGL form.

**Coverage Restoration Through Endorsements:**

Coverage for liquor liability must be restored through one of the following mechanisms:

1. **ISO CG 24 08 Endorsement (Liquor Liability Coverage Grant):** This endorsement completely removes the liquor liability exclusion from the CGL policy, providing full dram shop coverage within the policy limits.³

2. **Separate Liquor Liability/Dram Shop Policy:** A standalone policy specifically designed to cover alcohol-related liability claims.

**ASBC Policy Analysis:**

The litigation report (T4) confirms that ASBC maintains **$5 million general liability policy including dram shop coverage** with a **$100,000 self-insured retention (SIR)**.⁴ This language indicates one of the following scenarios:

- **Scenario A:** ASBC has a CGL policy with the ISO CG 24 08 endorsement (or equivalent) that removes the liquor liability exclusion
- **Scenario B:** ASBC has a separate liquor liability policy with $5M limits that is referenced collectively with the GL policy
- **Scenario C:** ASBC has an occurrence-based CGL policy with manuscript liquor liability coverage inclusion

**Conclusion:** Based on the confirmed "$5 million general liability policy including dram shop coverage," coverage should be available for the Smith case, subject to analysis of policy exclusions and conditions.

#### 2. Oregon Statutory Requirements for Liquor Liability Coverage

**ORS 471.168 - Mandatory Insurance:**

Oregon law requires businesses that sell alcohol to maintain minimum liquor liability insurance. Under ORS 471.168, certain licensees are required to maintain liquor liability insurance or bond as prescribed by Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC) rules.⁵

**Minimum Coverage Amount:**

Oregon requires businesses that sell alcohol to maintain a **minimum of $300,000 in liquor liability coverage**.⁶ Failure to maintain this coverage can result in:
- OLCC fines
- License suspension or revocation
- Personal liability exposure for business owners

**ASBC Compliance:**

With $5 million in dram shop coverage, ASBC significantly exceeds Oregon's $300,000 minimum requirement. This provides:
- Regulatory compliance assurance
- Substantial protection for the Oregon Smith case ($1.85M-$3.85M claimed)
- Buffer for potential future claims across 18 taproom locations

#### 3. Coverage Trigger Analysis: Occurrence vs. Claims-Made

**Coverage Trigger Definitions:**

The type of coverage trigger determines when a policy responds to a claim:

**Occurrence-Based Policies:**
- Coverage triggered when bodily injury or property damage **takes place**
- Policy responds to events that occur during the policy term **regardless of when the claim is made**
- Claims can be made months or years after the injury, as long as the injury occurred during the policy period⁷

**Claims-Made Policies:**
- Coverage triggered when a **claim is first made** against the insured
- Bodily injury or property damage must have occurred after the policy's "retroactive date"
- Three critical dates: (1) injury date, (2) retroactive date, (3) claim date⁸
- Typical for professional liability, D&O, and some liquor liability policies

**Oregon Smith Case Application:**

**Injury Date:** September 2023 (Jones' accident)
**Claim Date:** July 2024 (Smith filed lawsuit)

**If ASBC has occurrence-based coverage:**
- The policy in effect during **September 2023** (injury date) responds
- This is the most common structure for CGL/liquor liability policies
- Coverage is confirmed if ASBC maintained the $5M policy during September 2023

**If ASBC has claims-made coverage:**
- The policy in effect during **July 2024** (claim date) responds
- Must verify retroactive date is before September 2023
- Late notice issues are more critical in claims-made policies

**Conclusion:** Based on industry standards for GL/liquor liability policies serving the craft beverage industry, ASBC likely has occurrence-based coverage. The litigation report's reference to "general liability policy including dram shop coverage" suggests traditional occurrence-based CGL coverage with liquor liability endorsement.

#### 4. Policy Exclusions Analysis

Even with confirmed liquor liability coverage, several standard policy exclusions could potentially bar coverage for the Smith case:

**A. Intentional Acts Exclusion**

**Standard Policy Language:**
CGL policies exclude coverage for bodily injury "expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured." This exclusion prevents coverage when the insured deliberately harms someone or intends the consequences of their actions.

**Smith Case Application:**
- ASBC did not intend to harm Smith
- Server's conduct (serving beer to Jones) was not intended to cause injury
- This is classic negligence (failure to recognize visible intoxication), not intentional conduct
- **Exclusion does NOT apply** ✓

**B. Liquor Liability Exclusion (If Not Removed)**

As discussed above, this exclusion would bar coverage unless removed by endorsement. The litigation report confirms coverage exists, indicating the exclusion has been removed or a separate liquor liability policy is in place.

**C. Criminal Acts Exclusion**

**Potential Issue:**
Some policies exclude coverage for injuries arising from criminal acts. Serving a visibly intoxicated person violates ORS 471.565 and could constitute a criminal violation under Oregon liquor laws.

**Counter-Argument:**
- ORS 471.565 creates civil liability, not criminal
- Oregon's civil dram shop statute is the basis for the claim
- Criminal acts exclusions typically apply to felonies or intentional crimes (assault, fraud)
- Regulatory violations related to alcohol service are generally covered
- **Exclusion likely does NOT apply** ✓

**D. Employer's Liability / Employee Exclusion**

**Not Applicable:**
Smith was not an ASBC employee but a third-party victim. This exclusion does not apply.

**E. Pollution Exclusion**

**Not Applicable:**
Alcohol service does not constitute "pollution" under standard policy definitions.

**F. Professional Services Exclusion**

**Not Applicable:**
Serving alcohol at a taproom is not a "professional service" (which typically covers doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers).

**Conclusion on Exclusions:** No standard policy exclusions should bar coverage for the Oregon Smith dram shop case. The claim arises from negligent service of alcohol to a visibly intoxicated patron—precisely the risk that liquor liability coverage is designed to address.

### B. Notice Requirements and Compliance

#### 1. Oregon Statutory Notice Requirements - ORS 471.565

Oregon imposes strict statutory notice requirements for dram shop claims separate from insurance policy notice provisions:

**180-Day Notice Rule (Non-Death Cases):**

Under ORS 471.565, for dram shop claims involving injuries **other than wrongful death**, written notice must be given within **180 days** after:
- The injury occurs, OR
- The person asserting the claim discovers (or reasonably should have discovered) the existence of the claim
- **Whichever is later**⁹

**One-Year Notice Rule (Wrongful Death):**

For claims arising from wrongful death, notice must be given within **one year** after the date of death or discovery of the claim (whichever is later).¹⁰

**What Constitutes Sufficient Notice:**

A licensee, permittee, or social host is considered to have received notice if:
1. They receive **formal written notice** (mailed or personally served)
2. They receive **actual notice** (any communication giving actual knowledge of the time, place, and circumstances)
3. An action is commenced within the required time period
4. Any payment on the claim is made¹¹

**Formal Notice Requirements:**
- Must be in **writing**
- Must be **mailed or personally served** on the licensee/permittee
- Must contain a **statement that a claim for damages is made**¹²

**Oregon Smith Case Compliance Analysis:**

**Incident Date:** September 2023
**Claim Filed:** July 2024
**Elapsed Time:** Approximately 10 months

**Statutory Notice Assessment:**
- Oregon's 180-day notice requirement is a **condition precedent** to bringing a dram shop action
- Smith filed the lawsuit in July 2024 (within ~10 months of the September 2023 incident)
- Under ORS 471.565, commencement of an action within the required time period **satisfies the notice requirement**
- **Conclusion:** Statutory notice requirements appear satisfied ✓

**Critical Distinction:** Oregon's statutory notice requirement under ORS 471.565 is separate from (and in addition to) insurance policy notice requirements. Even if statutory notice is timely, the insured must also comply with the policy's notice provisions to trigger coverage.

#### 2. Insurance Policy Notice Requirements

Standard CGL and liquor liability policies contain notice provisions requiring the insured to notify the insurer "as soon as practicable" or within a specified timeframe after an "occurrence" or "claim."

**Typical Policy Language:**

*"You must see to it that we are notified as soon as practicable of an 'occurrence' or an offense which may result in a claim. To the extent possible, notice should include:*
- *How, when and where the 'occurrence' took place;*
- *The names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses; and*
- *The nature and location of any injury or damage arising out of the 'occurrence' or offense."*

**Critical Timeline Questions for ASBC:**

**September 2023:** Jones accident occurs (ASBC becomes aware of potential claim)
**July 2024:** Smith files lawsuit (formal claim made)
**Unknown:** When did ASBC notify its insurer?

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Scenario A - Prompt Notice (September-October 2023):**
- ASBC notified insurer shortly after accident
- Insurer likely accepted defense under reservation of rights
- No late notice issues
- **Coverage confirmed** ✓

**Scenario B - Late Notice (After lawsuit filed in July 2024):**
- ASBC waited until served with lawsuit to notify insurer
- 10-month delay between occurrence and notice
- Potential late notice defense by insurer
- Coverage depends on Oregon's prejudice standard

#### 3. Oregon Late Notice Defense and Prejudice Standard

**General Rule:**

Under Oregon law (consistent with most jurisdictions), an insurer may deny coverage based on late notice only if the insurer can demonstrate **actual prejudice** resulting from the delay.¹³

**Prejudice Requirement:**

The insurer bears the burden of proving:
1. Notice was untimely under the policy terms
2. The insurer suffered **actual, demonstrable prejudice** as a result of the delay

**Examples of Prejudice:**
- Witnesses became unavailable or memories faded
- Physical evidence was lost or destroyed
- Investigation was materially impaired
- Settlement opportunities were lost
- Defense strategy was compromised

**Oregon Smith Case - Late Notice Analysis:**

**Factors Favoring ASBC (No Prejudice):**
- Incident involved well-documented drunk driving accident (police report, BAC test, witnesses)
- Jones' BAC (0.12%) and accident circumstances are objectively established
- Video surveillance from ASBC taproom likely preserved (T4 litigation report notes "Portland taproom surveillance video preservation")
- Medical records documenting Smith's injuries are complete
- 10-month delay is relatively short for dram shop claims
- Smith's lawsuit provides full notice of claim details

**Factors Favoring Insurer (Potential Prejudice):**
- Server's memory of Jones' appearance/behavior may have faded
- Other patrons who interacted with Jones may be harder to locate
- Early settlement discussions were precluded

**Likely Outcome:** If notice was delayed until July 2024, the insurer would have difficulty establishing material prejudice given the well-documented nature of the accident, preservation of video evidence, and relatively short delay. Oregon courts apply a strict actual prejudice standard that favors insureds.

**Recommendation:** ABP should confirm in due diligence that ASBC provided timely notice to its insurer (ideally within 30-60 days of the September 2023 incident) to eliminate any late notice coverage defense.

### C. Duty to Defend vs. Duty to Indemnify

#### 1. Oregon's Broad Duty to Defend Standard

Oregon follows an extremely policyholder-friendly approach to the duty to defend, establishing one of the broadest duty to defend standards in the United States.

**Eight Corners Rule (Four Corners Rule):**

Oregon applies the "eight corners rule" (also called the "four corners rule") to determine whether an insurer owes a duty to defend. The court examines:
1. The **four corners of the insurance policy**
2. The **four corners of the complaint** filed against the insured

**No extrinsic evidence** is considered when determining the duty to defend (with limited exceptions for fundamental coverage issues).¹⁴

**West Hills Development Co. v. Chartis Claims, Inc., 360 Or 650 (2016):**

The Oregon Supreme Court held that an insurer owes a duty to defend if the court can **reasonably interpret the complaint's allegations** to include an incident or injury that falls within policy coverage.¹⁵ The key inquiry is whether the complaint permits the presentation of evidence that would establish covered facts.

**State of Oregon v. Pacific Indemnity Company, 328 Or App 64 (2023):**

The Oregon Court of Appeals reaffirmed that an insurer has a duty to defend so long as **the complaint's allegations would permit the presentation of evidence** that would later establish the necessary facts for coverage. The court also confirmed the "complete defense" rule applies to general liability policies.¹⁶

**Key Principles:**

1. **Potential for coverage triggers defense duty:** If there is any possibility that the claim could result in covered liability, the insurer must defend.

2. **Doubt resolved in favor of insured:** Where a complaint fails to allege determinative facts, doubt must be resolved in favor of the insured.¹⁷

3. **Mixed claims require full defense:** If a complaint alleges both covered and uncovered claims, the insurer must defend the **entire action** (complete defense rule).

4. **Defense duty broader than indemnity duty:** An insurer may owe a duty to defend even if it ultimately owes no duty to indemnify.¹⁸

**Oregon Smith Case - Duty to Defend Analysis:**

**Smith's Complaint Allegations:**
- ASBC served alcohol to Jones while he was visibly intoxicated
- Service occurred at ASBC's Portland taproom
- Jones drove from taproom and caused accident injuring Smith
- ASBC violated ORS 471.565 dram shop liability statute
- Damages: $850K medical expenses + $1M-$3M pain/suffering

**Coverage Analysis Under Eight Corners Rule:**

**Policy (Corner 1-4):** $5M GL policy with dram shop coverage included
**Complaint (Corner 5-8):** Alleges negligent service of alcohol to visibly intoxicated patron causing third-party injuries

**Conclusion:** The complaint unquestionably alleges conduct within the policy's coverage grant. ASBC served alcohol to a patron (within the business of serving alcoholic beverages) who allegedly caused injuries to a third party (Smith). This is precisely the risk covered by dram shop/liquor liability insurance.

**Duty to Defend:** The insurer **absolutely owes a duty to defend** under Oregon's broad standard. No policy exclusion eliminates the potential for coverage based on the complaint's allegations.

#### 2. Independent Nature of Defense and Indemnity Duties

**Ledford v. Gutoski, 319 Or 397, 877 P.2d 80 (1994):**

The Oregon Supreme Court held that "[t]he duty to indemnify is **independent of the duty to defend**."¹⁹ Even when the allegations of the complaint do not reveal an insured claim, the duty to indemnify may arise if the evidence at trial demonstrates that the judgment was entered on a covered injury.

**Practical Implications:**

1. **Defense duty determined at outset:** The duty to defend is assessed based on the complaint's allegations at the time the claim is tendered.

2. **Indemnity duty determined at conclusion:** The duty to indemnify is determined based on the actual facts established at trial or through settlement.

3. **Insurer may defend and not indemnify:** An insurer may owe a defense duty but ultimately owe no indemnity if the actual facts establish the injury is not covered.

4. **Insurer may indemnify without defending:** Conversely, if the complaint alleges only uncovered conduct but trial evidence reveals covered conduct, the insurer may owe indemnity even if it had no duty to defend.

**Oregon Smith Case Application:**

- **Duty to Defend:** Triggered immediately upon tender of the complaint (liquor liability claim within policy coverage)
- **Duty to Indemnify:** Will be determined based on whether ASBC is found liable for serving Jones while visibly intoxicated and whether that service proximately caused Smith's injuries
- **Likely Outcome:** Both defense and indemnity duties will apply, as the claim falls squarely within dram shop coverage

### D. Self-Insured Retention (SIR) - $100,000 Exhaustion Analysis

#### 1. SIR Structure and Operation

ASBC's policy includes a **$100,000 self-insured retention (SIR)**, which differs materially from a standard deductible.

**Key Characteristics of SIR:**

1. **Insured pays first dollar:** ASBC is responsible for the first $100,000 of covered losses (defense costs and/or indemnity).²⁰

2. **Insurer responsibility post-exhaustion:** Once the SIR is exhausted, the insurer assumes responsibility for additional defense and indemnity costs up to the $5M policy limit.

3. **Insured manages claims within SIR:** ASBC is typically responsible for managing and defending claims until the SIR is exhausted (unless policy provides otherwise).²¹

**SIR vs. Deductible:**

- **Deductible:** Insurer pays the full claim, then seeks reimbursement from insured for the deductible amount
- **SIR:** Insured pays claims directly until SIR is exhausted; insurer has no obligation until exhaustion²²

#### 2. Defense Costs and Indemnity Allocation

**Critical Question:** Does the $100,000 SIR apply to **defense costs only**, **indemnity only**, or **both combined**?

**Standard SIR Structures:**

**Option A - Combined SIR (Most Common):**
- Defense costs + indemnity are **aggregated** to exhaust the $100,000 SIR
- Example: If ASBC incurs $60K in defense costs and settles for $150K, the SIR is exhausted ($60K defense + $40K of settlement = $100K SIR), and the insurer pays the remaining $110K

**Option B - Indemnity-Only SIR:**
- SIR applies only to indemnity (settlement/judgment)
- Insurer pays defense costs outside the SIR from the first dollar
- Less common for commercial liability policies

**Option C - Defense-Inclusive SIR with Reimbursement:**
- Insured pays all defense costs until SIR is exhausted
- If settlement/judgment exceeds SIR, insurer reimburses insured for a pro-rata portion of defense costs²³

**ASBC Policy - Likely Structure:**

Without reviewing the actual policy language, **Option A (combined SIR)** is most likely based on industry standards for $5M GL policies with $100K SIR. This means:
- ASBC pays the first $100K of combined defense and indemnity costs
- Insurer pays all costs exceeding $100K up to $5M policy limit

#### 3. Oregon Smith Case - SIR Exhaustion Scenarios

**Current Litigation Status (from T4 Report):**
- Case filed July 2024, currently in discovery phase
- Expert depositions scheduled Q1 2026
- Trial anticipated Q2 2026
- Settlement range: $500K-$1.5M
- Defense costs to date: [Unknown, but likely $50K-$150K for 6 months of litigation]

**Scenario A - Early Settlement ($750K at Mediation Q1 2026):**

| Cost Component | Amount | Who Pays |
|---|---|---|
| Defense costs (through settlement) | $150K | ASBC: $100K (SIR) / Insurer: $50K |
| Settlement payment | $750K | Insurer: $750K (post-SIR exhaustion) |
| **Total** | **$900K** | **ASBC: $100K / Insurer: $850K** |

In this scenario, defense costs alone nearly exhaust the SIR, and the insurer bears the vast majority of the settlement.

**Scenario B - Trial Verdict ($2.5M After Trial Q2 2026):**

| Cost Component | Amount | Who Pays |
|---|---|---|
| Defense costs (through trial) | $350K | ASBC: $100K (SIR) / Insurer: $250K |
| Judgment | $2,500K | Insurer: $2,500K (SIR already exhausted) |
| **Total** | **$2,850K** | **ASBC: $100K / Insurer: $2,750K** |

In this scenario, defense costs exceed the SIR before judgment, and ASBC's exposure is capped at $100K.

**Scenario C - High Verdict ($4M) with Fault Allocation Issue:**

| Cost Component | Amount | Who Pays |
|---|---|---|
| Defense costs | $400K | ASBC: $100K (SIR) / Insurer: $300K |
| Judgment (ASBC 30% at fault) | $4,000K | Insurer: $4,000K (within $5M limit) |
| **Total** | **$4,400K** | **ASBC: $100K / Insurer: $4,300K** |

Even with a large verdict, ASBC's exposure remains capped at $100K SIR (assuming policy limits are not exceeded).

**Key Insight:** The $100,000 SIR provides ASBC with substantial financial protection. ASBC's maximum exposure is limited to the SIR amount, and the insurer bears the overwhelming majority of defense and indemnity costs for the Oregon Smith case.

#### 4. SIR Exhaustion - Defense Duty Clarification

**Important Principle:**

Some jurisdictions hold that an SIR **does not eliminate the insurer's duty to defend** absent express policy language to the contrary. In these jurisdictions, the insurer must provide a defense from the first dollar (even before SIR exhaustion) and then seek reimbursement from the insured for costs within the SIR.²⁴

**Competing View:**

Other jurisdictions (and many policy forms) provide that the insurer has **no duty to defend or indemnify** until the SIR is exhausted, placing the burden entirely on the insured for losses within the retention.²⁵

**ASBC Policy Analysis:**

The policy language will control. ABP should confirm in due diligence:
1. Whether ASBC's insurer is providing defense counsel (suggesting insurer-managed defense with SIR reimbursement)
2. Whether ASBC is self-managing the defense (suggesting no insurer defense duty until SIR exhaustion)

**Current Status:** The T4 litigation report indicates ASBC has engaged litigation counsel and is actively defending the case. This suggests either:
- ASBC is self-managing defense within the SIR, or
- Insurer is providing defense counsel subject to later SIR reimbursement

---

### E. Reservation of Rights and Conflict of Interest Issues

#### 1. Reservation of Rights Letters - Purpose and Effect

When an insurer has concerns about coverage but chooses to provide a defense, it typically issues a **reservation of rights letter** to preserve its ability to later deny indemnity coverage.

**Purpose of Reservation of Rights:**

A reservation of rights letter informs the policyholder that:
1. The insurer will **defend the matter** (fulfilling the duty to defend)
2. The insurer is **reserving its rights** to later deny coverage based on policy exclusions or other coverage defenses
3. The insurer's provision of defense does **not waive** its right to contest coverage²⁶

**Legal Effect:**

- Insurer fulfills its duty to defend while preserving coverage defenses
- Insured receives defense counsel and financial protection during litigation
- Coverage determination is deferred until facts are fully developed

**Oregon Smith Case - Reservation of Rights Likelihood:**

Given the straightforward nature of the dram shop claim and the confirmed existence of liquor liability coverage, a reservation of rights letter is **unlikely unless:**
- Policy has restrictive definitions (e.g., "visible intoxication" defined narrowly)
- Insurer questions whether Jones was actually "visibly intoxicated" based on server testimony
- Insurer believes ASBC violated policy conditions (late notice, lack of cooperation)
- Policy has criminal acts or intentional misconduct exclusions the insurer seeks to preserve

**Typical Scenario:** Insurer likely accepted the defense without reservation, as dram shop claims are precisely what liquor liability coverage is designed to address. However, ABP should confirm whether a reservation of rights letter was issued.

#### 2. Conflict of Interest and Cumis Counsel Rights

**Conflict of Interest Defined:**

A conflict of interest arises when the insurance company's interests diverge from the insured's interests such that defense counsel faces competing loyalties. This typically occurs when:
- Covered and uncovered claims are alleged in the same lawsuit
- The outcome of factual issues affects both liability and coverage
- Insurer has issued a reservation of rights based on exclusions tied to specific facts²⁷

**Cumis Counsel (California Standard):**

Under California Civil Code § 2860, when a conflict of interest arises, the insurer must pay for **independent counsel** (commonly called "Cumis counsel") selected by the insured.²⁸ The landmark case *San Diego Navy Federal Credit Union v. Cumis Insurance Society, Inc.* established this principle.

**Key Requirements for Cumis Counsel:**
- **Actual conflict required:** A mere possibility of conflict is insufficient; the conflict must be "significant, not merely theoretical, actual, not merely potential"²⁹
- **Coverage-based conflict:** The reservation of rights must specifically identify policy provisions or exclusions that create a defense conflict³⁰
- **Insurer pays:** The insurer is responsible for reasonable attorney's fees for independent counsel³¹

**Oregon's Position on Cumis Counsel:**

Oregon courts have **not definitively addressed** whether insureds have a right to independent counsel when an insurer defends under a reservation of rights.³² Idaho and Oregon "apparently either do not require Cumis counsel, or its courts have not squarely addressed the issue."³³

**Likely Oregon Approach:**

While Oregon lacks a Cumis statute, Oregon's policyholder-friendly insurance jurisprudence suggests courts would recognize independent counsel rights in appropriate circumstances, particularly where:
- Insurer's coverage position creates incentive to develop facts favorable to coverage denial
- Defense strategies that benefit the insurer's coverage position harm the insured's liability defense
- Insurer's reservation of rights is based on exclusions tied to specific factual findings

**Oregon Smith Case Application:**

**Unlikely Conflict Scenario:** The dram shop claim presents minimal conflict potential because:
- Coverage and liability determinations largely overlap (whether Jones was visibly intoxicated)
- No apparent policy exclusions tied to specific facts (intentional acts, criminal conduct)
- Insurer and insured share common interest in minimizing damages and securing favorable settlement

**Recommendation:** If a reservation of rights letter was issued, ASBC should evaluate whether the reserved coverage defenses create actual conflicts warranting independent counsel. Given Oregon's lack of clear Cumis precedent, this may require negotiation with the insurer or court intervention.

### F. Bad Faith Exposure and Extra-Contractual Liability

#### 1. Oregon's Moody Decision - Paradigm Shift in Bad Faith Law

On December 29, 2023, the Oregon Supreme Court issued a **landmark decision** in *Moody v. Oregon Community Credit Union*, 371 Or 772 (2023), fundamentally transforming Oregon insurance bad faith law.

**Pre-Moody Landscape:**

Before *Moody*, Oregon was one of the few jurisdictions that **declined to recognize first-party negligence claims** against insurers for bad faith claims handling. Insureds were limited to breach of contract remedies.³⁴

**Moody Holding:**

The Oregon Supreme Court held that the relationship between an insurer and its insured is sufficiently **"special"** to permit a negligence claim for violations of Oregon's Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (ORS 746.230).³⁵

**Key Principles Established:**

1. **Negligence Per Se Claims:** Violations of Oregon's unfair claims practices statute can give rise to negligence per se claims against insurers.

2. **Extra-Contractual Damages Available:**
   - **Emotional distress damages** (without physical impact requirement)
   - **Economic damages** (including consequential damages, lost profits)
   - **Punitive damages** (in appropriate cases)³⁶

3. **Negligence Standard:** Oregon effectively created bad faith liability based on a **negligence standard** rather than the higher "unreasonable, frivolous, or unfounded" burden of proof used in most jurisdictions.³⁷

**2024 Expansion Beyond First-Party Claims:**

Post-*Moody* cases have extended the decision beyond its original first-party insurance context:
- *LiquidAgents Healthcare LLC v. Evanston Insurance Company* - Applied *Moody* to allow recovery of lost profits in third-party liability insurance dispute³⁸
- Multiple 2024 cases have invoked *Moody* in uninsured/underinsured motorist claims, PIP benefits, and other insurance disputes³⁹

#### 2. Bad Faith Risk in Oregon Smith Case

**Potential Bad Faith Scenarios:**

**Scenario A - Unreasonable Coverage Denial:**
If ASBC's insurer denies coverage for the Smith dram shop claim without reasonable basis:
- Breach of duty to defend
- Breach of duty to indemnify
- Negligent claims handling under *Moody*
- **Exposure:** Extra-contractual damages including emotional distress, economic losses, punitive damages

**Scenario B - Failure to Settle Within Limits:**
If the insurer refuses a reasonable settlement within the $5M policy limits and ASBC faces an excess judgment:
- Breach of duty to settle in good faith
- ASBC exposed to personal liability for judgment exceeding policy limits
- **Exposure:** Insurer liable for entire judgment (including amounts exceeding policy limits) plus bad faith damages

**Scenario C - Inadequate Defense:**
If insurer provides inadequate defense counsel or fails to properly investigate/prepare the case:
- Negligent defense provision
- Inadequate settlement preparation
- **Exposure:** Damages resulting from inadequate defense, including excess judgment

**Likelihood Assessment for ASBC:**

**Low Bad Faith Risk** - The Oregon Smith case presents minimal bad faith exposure because:
- Clear liquor liability coverage with no apparent exclusions
- Well-documented claim with objective evidence
- Settlement range ($500K-$1.5M) well within $5M policy limits
- No facts suggesting unreasonable insurer conduct

**Critical Monitoring Points:**

ABP should verify in due diligence:
1. No unreasonable coverage denials or reservation of rights positions
2. Timely and adequate defense provided
3. Good faith settlement efforts at mediation (scheduled Q1 2026)
4. No excess judgment risk (settlement range comfortably within policy limits)

#### 3. Settlement Authority and Hammer Clause Provisions

**Hammer Clause Definition:**

Many liability policies contain "hammer clauses" (also called "consent to settle" clauses) that give the insurer unilateral authority to settle claims or penalize insureds who refuse recommended settlements.

**Common Hammer Clause Structures:**

**Type A - Soft Hammer (Coinsurance):**
If the insured refuses a settlement recommendation within policy limits, the insurer's liability is capped at the settlement amount plus defense costs to that point. The insured becomes responsible for any excess.

**Type B - Hard Hammer (No Further Payment):**
If the insured refuses a settlement recommendation, the insurer's obligation ceases entirely, and the insured assumes all further defense and indemnity costs.

**Oregon Smith Case - Settlement Dynamics:**

**Settlement Range (T4 Report):** $500,000 - $1,500,000
**Policy Limits:** $5,000,000
**Settlement Timeline:** Mediation scheduled Q1 2026

**Analysis:**
- Settlement range is comfortably within policy limits (10-30% of policy)
- No excess judgment risk
- Minimal financial incentive for insurer to refuse reasonable settlement
- ASBC and insurer have aligned interests in securing favorable settlement

**Recommendation:** ABP should confirm that:
1. ASBC has authority to participate in settlement negotiations
2. Policy does not contain overly restrictive hammer clause
3. Settlement strategy is coordinated with insurer in advance of Q1 2026 mediation

### G. Coverage for Other Known Liabilities

Beyond the Oregon Smith dram shop case, ASBC faces several other known liabilities that may trigger insurance coverage.

#### 1. Texas Lone Star Distributor Litigation

**Claim Details (from T4 Litigation Report):**
- **Case:** Lone Star Beverages v. ASBC
- **Forum:** Texas District Court, Travis County
- **Claims:** Wrongful termination under Texas franchise law, breach of contract
- **Exposure:** $2.8M - $4.0M (brand value compensation + lost profits)
- **Settlement Range:** $800K - $2.0M
- **Status:** Discovery phase, mediation anticipated Q1 2026⁴⁰

**Insurance Coverage Analysis:**

**Commercial General Liability Policy:**

**Coverage Unlikely** - Standard CGL policies provide coverage for "bodily injury" or "property damage." The Lone Star claims seek:
- Brand value compensation (economic loss, not property damage)
- Lost profits (pure economic loss)
- Breach of contract damages (typically excluded)

CGL policies generally **exclude pure economic loss** claims that do not arise from bodily injury or property damage.

**Commercial Umbrella Policy:**

**Coverage Unlikely** - Umbrella policies typically "follow form" to the underlying CGL, meaning economic loss exclusions apply.

**Errors & Omissions (E&O) / Professional Liability:**

**Coverage Possible (If Policy Exists)** - E&O policies cover economic losses arising from professional services or business operations, including:
- Breach of contract claims
- Negligent misrepresentation
- Economic damages

If ASBC maintains E&O coverage for its distribution/sales operations, the Lone Star claims **may be covered**. However, E&O policies typically exclude intentional breaches or contractual liability assumed by contract.

**Directors & Officers (D&O) Liability:**

**Coverage Unlikely** - D&O policies cover individual directors and officers for wrongful acts, not the company's contractual liabilities.

**Conclusion:** The Lone Star litigation is **unlikely to be insured** under standard CGL/liquor liability policies. ASBC likely bears full exposure ($800K-$2M settlement range). ABP should confirm whether ASBC maintains E&O or specialized commercial contracts insurance that might provide coverage.

#### 2. FTC Advertising Investigation

**Investigation Details (from T6 FTC Report):**
- **Agency:** Federal Trade Commission
- **Allegations:** Health claims in social media posts (March-April 2024)
- **Statutory Basis:** FTC Act Section 5 (deceptive practices)
- **Exposure:** $64K - $120K (civil penalties + corrective advertising costs)
- **Status:** Investigation ongoing, likely informal resolution⁴¹

**Insurance Coverage Analysis:**

**Commercial General Liability:**

**Coverage Unlikely** - CGL policies cover "bodily injury" or "property damage," not regulatory fines or advertising liability.

**Directors & Officers (D&O) Liability:**

**Coverage Possible (If Policy Exists)** - D&O policies increasingly provide coverage for:
- **Regulatory investigations** and proceedings
- **Defense costs** for FTC investigations naming directors or officers
- **Entity coverage** for investigations (in Management Liability policies)⁴²

Modern D&O policies often include or sublimit coverage for regulatory investigations, though narrow policies may exclude investigations unless formal charges are filed.⁴³

**Critical Coverage Issue - Fines and Penalties:**

Most insurance policies **exclude coverage for fines and penalties** as against public policy. However, D&O policies may cover:
- **Defense costs** for the investigation (typically covered)
- **Corrective advertising costs** (potentially covered as "damages" rather than fines)
- **Settlement amounts** negotiated with the FTC (coverage depends on characterization)

**Likely Coverage Outcome:**

- **Defense costs:** $50K-$80K (likely covered if D&O policy exists)
- **Civil penalties:** $10K-$40K (likely excluded as fines/penalties)
- **Corrective advertising:** $50K-$80K (potentially covered if characterized as remedial measures rather than penalties)

**Net ASBC Exposure:** $60K-$120K (likely uninsured unless D&O or specialized advertising liability policy exists)

**Recommendation:** ABP should verify whether ASBC maintains D&O insurance with regulatory investigation coverage. If so, confirm the investigation has been tendered to the insurer.

#### 3. TTB Bourbon Formula Investigation

**Investigation Details (from T1 TTB Report):**
- **Agency:** Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)
- **Allegations:** Use of toasted wood staves as "added flavoring" in bourbon production
- **Statutory Basis:** 27 CFR § 5.22 (standards of identity)
- **Exposure:** $4.0M - $4.2M ($4M inventory recall + $10K-$100K TTB fine)
- **Status:** Investigation ongoing, formula approval decision pending⁴⁴

**Insurance Coverage Analysis:**

**Product Liability / Product Recall Insurance:**

**Coverage Possible (If Policy Exists)** - Specialized product recall insurance covers:
- Cost of recalling non-compliant products
- Loss of inventory value
- Customer notification costs
- Brand rehabilitation expenses

If ASBC maintains product recall insurance, the $4M bourbon inventory recall **may be covered**. However, typical exclusions include:
- Recalls ordered due to **intentional non-compliance** with regulations
- **Known defects** or regulatory violations at policy inception
- **Regulatory fines and penalties**

**Directors & Officers (D&O) Liability:**

**Coverage Possible (If Policy Exists)** - D&O policies may cover:
- **Defense costs** for TTB investigation
- **Regulatory proceeding costs** (depositions, document production, legal fees)
- **Entity coverage** for formal enforcement actions

**Exclusions Likely to Apply:**
- TTB **fines and penalties** ($10K-$100K) - excluded as against public policy
- **Product recall costs** ($4M) - typically excluded from D&O policies as insurable under product recall insurance

**Commercial General Liability:**

**Coverage Unlikely** - The bourbon investigation involves regulatory compliance and product standards, not "bodily injury" or "property damage" covered by CGL.

**Likely Coverage Outcome:**

- **Defense costs:** $150K-$250K (potentially covered if D&O policy exists)
- **TTB fines:** $10K-$100K (excluded as penalties)
- **Product recall:** $4M (excluded unless product recall insurance exists)

**Net ASBC Exposure:** $4.01M - $4.35M (likely largely uninsured)

**Critical Transaction Issue:** The bourbon investigation represents the largest uninsured liability exposure in the acquisition. ABP should:
1. Verify TTB investigation status and likely outcome
2. Confirm no product recall insurance exists (or investigate coverage if it does)
3. Structure escrow/holdback to account for $4M-$4.2M potential exposure

#### 4. EEOC Maria Gonzalez Claim

**Claim Details (from T8 Employment Report):**
- **Claimant:** Maria Gonzalez (former ASBC employee)
- **Claims:** National origin discrimination, retaliation (Title VII)
- **Agency:** Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
- **Exposure:** $850K (back pay, compensatory damages, reinstatement)
- **Status:** EEOC investigation ongoing⁴⁵

**Insurance Coverage Analysis:**

**Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI):**

**Coverage Likely (If Policy Exists)** - EPLI policies specifically cover:
- **Discrimination claims** (age, race, gender, national origin, disability)
- **Sexual harassment** and workplace harassment
- **Retaliation claims**
- **Wrongful termination**
- **EEOC charges** and investigations⁴⁶

EPLI coverage typically includes:
- **Defense costs:** Attorney's fees, court costs, investigation expenses
- **Settlements and judgments:** Damages awarded or agreed to in settlement
- **EEOC proceedings:** Coverage for charges filed with federal or state agencies⁴⁷

**Coverage Trigger:**

EPLI policies are typically written on a **Claims Made and Reported** basis, meaning:
- Claims must be reported during the policy period in which allegations were made
- **Immediate reporting required** upon receiving EEOC charge or employee demand letter⁴⁸

**Typical EPLI Structures:**
- **Policy Limits:** $1M-$5M per claim / $1M-$5M aggregate
- **Deductible/Retention:** $10K-$50K per claim
- **Defense Costs:** Covered in addition to policy limits (or included within limits, depending on policy)

**Likely Coverage Outcome (Assuming EPLI Exists):**

| Cost Component | Amount | Who Pays |
|---|---|---|
| Defense costs | $150K-$250K | EPLI insurer (subject to deductible) |
| Settlement/Judgment | $600K-$850K | EPLI insurer (subject to deductible) |
| **Total** | **$750K-$1.1M** | **EPLI pays majority, ASBC pays deductible ($10K-$50K)** |

**Net ASBC Exposure (With EPLI):** $10K-$50K (deductible only)
**Net ASBC Exposure (Without EPLI):** $750K-$1.1M (full exposure)

**Critical Due Diligence Item:** ABP should immediately verify:
1. Does ASBC maintain EPLI coverage? (If yes, policy limits and deductible?)
2. Has the Gonzalez EEOC charge been reported to the EPLI insurer?
3. Is the insurer providing defense counsel or has coverage been denied?

**2024 EPLI Trends:** EEOC updates now cover harassment and discrimination in online and remote workplaces, and settlements and defense costs are rising in some sectors.⁴⁹ ASBC's 1,850-employee workforce and hospitality-heavy operations (950 taproom/hospitality employees) create elevated EPLI exposure.

### H. Policy Adequacy Assessment

#### 1. Industry Benchmarks for Craft Beverage Operations

**Liquor Liability / Dram Shop Coverage Standards:**

According to 2024 industry sources, typical liquor liability coverage for craft breweries with taprooms includes:

- **Standard Coverage:** $1 million per occurrence / $2 million aggregate⁵⁰
- **Enhanced Coverage:** $2 million - $5 million per occurrence for multi-location operations⁵¹
- **State Minimums:** Oregon requires $300,000 minimum, though South Carolina recently mandated $1 million for establishments operating after 5pm⁵²

**ASBC's Coverage Position:**

With **$5 million per occurrence** dram shop coverage, ASBC's limits are at the **high end of industry standards** for craft beverage operators. This reflects appropriate risk management given:
- **18 taproom locations** (8 in Oregon, 4 in Colorado, 3 in North Carolina, 2 in Washington, 1 in California)
- **Multi-state exposure** to dram shop liability across 5 jurisdictions
- **High-volume operations** (485,000 barrels annual brewery capacity + 100,000 proof gallons distillery production)
- **1,800+ employees** with 950 taproom/hospitality staff serving alcohol directly to consumers

**Adequacy Assessment:** ASBC's $5M limit is **adequate** for the Oregon Smith case ($1.85M-$3.85M claimed) and provides substantial cushion for potential future claims across 18 locations.

#### 2. Umbrella/Excess Coverage Analysis

**Standard Structure:**

Comprehensive insurance programs typically include:
- **Primary CGL/Liquor Liability:** $1M-$5M per occurrence
- **Commercial Umbrella:** $5M-$25M excess of primary⁵³
- **Total Coverage:** $6M-$30M layered protection

**ASBC's Coverage:**

The record does not indicate whether ASBC maintains **umbrella or excess liability coverage** above the $5M primary policy. This represents a potential coverage gap.

**Excess Judgment Risk:**

For the Oregon Smith case:
- **Claimed damages:** $1.85M-$3.85M
- **Settlement range:** $500K-$1.5M
- **Worst-case verdict (per T4 report):** $3M (if ASBC fault >25% and Jones is insolvent)
- **$5M limit:** Adequate to cover worst-case scenario

However, **multiple claims across 18 taproom locations** could exceed $5M policy limits if:
- Smith case settles near high end ($1.5M)
- Additional dram shop claims arise at other taprooms
- Severity of claims increases (Oregon abolished $500K non-economic damages cap in 2023⁵⁴)

**Recommendation:** ABP should verify whether ASBC maintains:
1. **Commercial umbrella coverage** ($5M-$10M excess recommended)
2. **Aggregate policy limits** (annual cap on all claims)
3. **Per-location sublimits** (coverage caps per taproom location)

If no umbrella coverage exists, ABP should evaluate acquiring umbrella coverage post-acquisition to protect against catastrophic multi-claim scenarios.

#### 3. Directors & Officers (D&O) Liability Coverage

**D&O Coverage Importance for ASBC:**

Given ASBC's regulatory exposure, D&O insurance is **critical** to cover:
- **TTB bourbon formula investigation** (defense costs: $150K-$250K)
- **FTC advertising investigation** (defense costs: $50K-$80K)
- **Oregon OLCC tied house investigation** (defense costs: $20K-$40K)
- **Securities law compliance** (if applicable to PE-backed entity)
- **Employment claims** against individual directors/officers

**2024 D&O Coverage Trends:**

D&O policies increasingly provide:
- **Regulatory investigation coverage** (FTC, TTB, state ABC agencies)⁵⁵
- **Entity coverage** for investigations (in Management Liability policies)
- **Defense cost coverage** outside policy limits (in some structures)⁵⁶

**Typical D&O Limits:**

- **Private companies ($100M-$1B revenue):** $10M-$25M per claim
- **PE-backed entities:** $15M-$50M (higher limits due to investor protection)

**Due Diligence Critical Item:**

ABP should immediately verify:
1. **Does ASBC maintain D&O coverage?** (If no, this is a material gap)
2. **Policy limits:** Are they adequate for regulatory exposure ($4.2M TTB + $120K FTC + $60K OLCC)?
3. **Regulatory investigation sublimits:** Are TTB and FTC investigations covered?
4. **Notice to insurer:** Have investigations been reported to D&O insurer?

**Likely Scenario:** Private equity sponsors typically require portfolio companies to maintain adequate D&O insurance. ASBC likely has D&O coverage, but limits and terms must be confirmed.

#### 4. Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI)

**EPLI Necessity:**

With **1,850 employees** (including 950 taproom/hospitality staff in high-turnover, customer-facing roles), ASBC faces elevated employment practices exposure:
- **EEOC Gonzalez claim:** $850K exposure (national origin discrimination, retaliation)
- **Hospitality industry trends:** Sexual harassment claims common in bar/restaurant environments
- **2024 EEOC updates:** Now cover harassment in online/remote workplaces⁵⁷

**Industry Standard EPLI Limits:**

- **Companies with 1,000-2,000 employees:** $2M-$5M per claim / $2M-$5M aggregate
- **Hospitality sector:** Higher limits recommended due to elevated harassment/discrimination risk

**EPLI Cost-Benefit:**

Without EPLI:
- **Gonzalez claim exposure:** $750K-$1.1M (defense + settlement)
- **Additional unknown claims:** Potentially 2-3 claims annually for 1,850-employee company

With EPLI ($2M limits, $25K deductible):
- **Gonzalez claim exposure:** $25K (deductible only)
- **Additional claims:** $25K per claim (deductible only)
- **Annual premium:** Approximately $50K-$100K for 1,850 employees

**Critical Due Diligence Item:** ABP should verify EPLI coverage exists and Gonzalez claim has been reported. If no EPLI coverage, this represents material uninsured exposure ($750K-$1.1M for Gonzalez alone, plus unknown additional claims).

#### 5. Other Coverage Gaps

**Product Recall Insurance:**

Given the **TTB bourbon investigation** with $4M inventory recall exposure, product recall insurance could provide critical protection. However, most craft breweries do not maintain specialized product recall coverage due to cost.

**Cyber Liability Insurance:**

ASBC's operations (e-commerce, customer databases, payment processing) create cyber exposure. Not addressed in this analysis, but ABP should verify cyber coverage exists.

**Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL):**

Brewery operations generate 5.7M gallons annual wastewater. Environmental compliance policies may provide coverage for pollution events or regulatory enforcement. Verify EIL coverage with environmental specialist (T9 report).

### I. Transaction Implications and M&A Coverage Issues

#### 1. Change of Control - Impact on Insurance Policies

**Change of Control Provisions:**

Most insurance policies contain "change of control" provisions that may **terminate or modify coverage** upon acquisition:

**D&O Policies:**
- Typically contain provisions that **convert coverage to "runoff"** upon change in control
- **No coverage** for claims arising from conduct after the acquisition closing
- **Limited coverage** for pre-closing conduct (claims must be made during current policy period)⁵⁸

**Liability Policies (CGL/Liquor Liability):**
- Often contain **anti-assignment** or **change of control** clauses requiring insurer consent
- **Policy may terminate** automatically upon change of control unless consent obtained
- **Successor in interest endorsements** needed to ensure buyer receives coverage benefits⁵⁹

**EPLI and Other Claims-Made Policies:**
- Coverage typically terminates at change of control
- **Immediate notice required** to preserve coverage for pending/unreported claims

**ASBC Transaction - Critical Action Items:**

ABP must confirm **before closing**:

1. **Notice to all insurers:** ASBC must notify all insurers of the impending acquisition (typically 30-60 days pre-closing)

2. **Consent to assignment:** Obtain insurer consent for assignment of liability policies to ABP (or confirm consent not required under policy terms)

3. **Verify continuation:** Confirm policies will continue post-closing without modification or termination

4. **Successor in interest endorsements:** Add ABP as additional insured/successor in interest on all policies

**Failure to Address Change of Control:** If change of control provisions are triggered without proper notice/consent, ASBC's insurance coverage may **terminate at closing**, exposing ABP to:
- **Uninsured Smith case:** $500K-$1.5M (settlement range)
- **Uninsured Gonzalez claim:** $750K-$1.1M (if EPLI exists but terminates)
- **Uninsured future claims:** Arising from pre-closing conduct

**Risk Level:** **CRITICAL** - This must be addressed in pre-closing diligence.

#### 2. Tail Coverage / Extended Reporting Period

**Tail Coverage Purpose:**

"Tail coverage" (extended reporting period) allows insureds to **report claims arising from pre-closing conduct for an extended period after policy termination** (typically 1-6 years post-closing).⁶⁰

**Policies Requiring Tail Coverage:**

**Claims-Made Policies:**
- **D&O insurance** (if exists)
- **EPLI** (if exists)
- **E&O/Professional Liability** (if exists)
- Any policy where coverage is triggered by **claim date** rather than **occurrence date**

**Tail Coverage Cost:**

- **1-year tail:** 100%-125% of annual premium
- **3-year tail:** 175%-200% of annual premium
- **6-year tail:** 250%-300% of annual premium⁶¹

**Example for ASBC:**
- Assume $150K annual D&O premium + $75K EPLI premium = $225K total
- **6-year tail cost:** $562K-$675K (2.5×-3× annual premium)

**Transaction Negotiation:**

**Who Pays for Tail Coverage?**
- **Seller (ASBC):** Typically responsible for purchasing tail coverage for pre-closing conduct
- **Buyer (ABP):** May negotiate for seller to purchase tail as closing condition
- **Split cost:** Sometimes negotiated 50/50 between buyer and seller

**ASBC Tail Coverage Needs:**

Given known pre-closing liabilities, tail coverage is **essential**:
- **Oregon Smith case:** Filed July 2024 (pre-closing), ongoing through Q2 2026 trial
- **Lone Star litigation:** Filed April 2024 (pre-closing), ongoing
- **EEOC Gonzalez claim:** EEOC investigation ongoing
- **TTB bourbon investigation:** Ongoing, potential post-closing claim
- **FTC advertising investigation:** Ongoing, potential post-closing claim

**Recommendation:** ABP should require ASBC to purchase **6-year tail coverage** for all claims-made policies (D&O, EPLI, E&O if applicable) as a condition to closing. Estimated cost: $500K-$750K (to be allocated in purchase price negotiation).

#### 3. Runoff Coverage for Occurrence-Based Policies

**Occurrence-Based Policies:**

The $5M GL/liquor liability policy (if occurrence-based) does **not require tail coverage** because coverage follows the occurrence date, not claim date.

**Post-Closing Coverage:**

For incidents occurring **before closing**:
- ASBC's policy in effect at the time of the occurrence responds
- Claims can be made months or years after closing
- **No gap in coverage** for pre-closing occurrences

**Assignment Issues:**

ABP must ensure:
1. **Policy assignment** to ABP as successor entity (or confirmation ABP is automatically covered)
2. **Claims cooperation** clause does not require seller's ongoing involvement
3. **Premium payment** responsibility post-closing (typically buyer's responsibility for tail period of occurrence policies)

#### 4. Representations & Warranties Insurance (RWI) Considerations

**RWI Overview:**

Representations & Warranties Insurance provides coverage to buyers (or sellers) for losses arising from **breaches of representations and warranties** in the acquisition agreement.⁶²

**2024 RWI Trends:**
- Used in **75% of private equity transactions** and 64% of strategic acquisitions
- **Premium rates:** 2%-2.5% of policy limits (at historic lows)
- **Typical limits:** 10%-20% of enterprise value⁶³

**For $1.2B ASBC Acquisition:**
- **RWI limit:** $120M-$240M (10%-20% of purchase price)
- **Premium cost:** $2.4M-$6.0M (2%-2.5% of limits)
- **Retention/deductible:** $6M-$12M (0.5%-1% of purchase price)

**RWI Exclusions - Known Litigation:**

RWI policies **systematically exclude coverage for matters known to the parties before closing**, including:
- **Disclosed litigation** (Smith, Lone Star) - Excluded from RWI⁶⁴
- **Disclosed investigations** (TTB, FTC, EEOC) - Excluded from RWI
- **Due diligence discoveries** - Excluded from RWI
- **Matters in disclosure schedules** - Excluded from RWI⁶⁵

**ASBC Known Liabilities - RWI Coverage:**

| Liability | Exposure | RWI Coverage? |
|---|---|---|
| Oregon Smith case | $500K-$1.5M | **NO** (disclosed litigation) |
| Lone Star litigation | $800K-$2.0M | **NO** (disclosed litigation) |
| TTB bourbon investigation | $4.0M-$4.2M | **NO** (disclosed investigation) |
| FTC investigation | $64K-$120K | **NO** (disclosed investigation) |
| EEOC Gonzalez claim | $750K-$1.1M | **NO** (disclosed EEOC charge) |

**Conclusion:** While ABP may obtain RWI for the ASBC acquisition, it will **not provide coverage** for any of the known liabilities addressed in this insurance analysis. RWI is relevant only for **unknown breaches** discovered post-closing.

**Recommended Approach:** ABP should:
1. Negotiate **escrow/holdback** to cover known liabilities ($7M-$10M recommended)
2. Obtain **RWI** for unknown breaches ($120M-$240M limits)
3. Require ASBC to maintain **existing liability insurance** and purchase tail coverage for all claims-made policies

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks - Oregon Smith Dram Shop Case

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Coverage denial** (late notice, policy exclusion) | **MEDIUM** | **Low (10%)** | Confirm timely notice; review policy language; Oregon prejudice standard favors insured |
| **Excess judgment beyond $5M limits** | **LOW** | **Very Low (5%)** | Settlement range $500K-$1.5M; worst-case verdict ~$3M; well within limits |
| **Insurer bad faith** (failure to settle) | **LOW** | **Very Low (5%)** | Settlement within limits; no apparent conflict; *Moody* provides strong insured protections |
| **SIR exhaustion uncertainty** | **LOW** | **N/A** | Confirm SIR structure (combined vs. indemnity-only); likely $100K cap on ASBC exposure |

**Aggregate ASBC Exposure (Smith Case):** $100,000 (SIR only, assuming coverage confirmed)

### B. Identified Risks - Other Known Liabilities

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Coverage | Net ASBC Exposure |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Lone Star litigation** | **HIGH** | **60-70%** | **NO** (CGL excludes economic loss) | **$800K-$2.0M** |
| **TTB bourbon investigation** | **CRITICAL** | **30-40%** | **UNLIKELY** (no product recall insurance) | **$4.0M-$4.2M** |
| **FTC investigation** | **MEDIUM** | **70%** | **PARTIAL** (defense costs if D&O exists) | **$64K-$120K** |
| **EEOC Gonzalez claim** | **HIGH** | **50%** | **YES** (if EPLI exists and reported) | **$10K-$50K (deductible)** or **$750K-$1.1M (if no EPLI)** |

**Critical Coverage Gaps:**

1. **EPLI Status Unknown:** If ASBC lacks EPLI coverage, Gonzalez exposure increases from $10K-$50K (deductible) to **$750K-$1.1M (full exposure)** → **Due diligence priority #1**

2. **D&O Status Unknown:** If ASBC lacks D&O coverage, regulatory defense costs ($220K-$370K for TTB + FTC + OLCC) are uninsured → **Due diligence priority #2**

3. **No Product Recall Insurance:** $4M bourbon inventory recall is likely **uninsured** → **Due diligence priority #3** (coordinate with T1 TTB specialist on investigation resolution strategy)

### C. Policy Adequacy Concerns

| Coverage Type | Current Status | Industry Standard | Adequacy Assessment |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Liquor Liability** | $5M per occurrence | $1M-$5M | **ADEQUATE** ✓ |
| **Umbrella/Excess** | **Unknown** | $5M-$25M excess | **UNCONFIRMED** - Verify existence |
| **D&O Insurance** | **Unknown** | $10M-$25M | **CRITICAL GAP** if absent |
| **EPLI** | **Unknown** | $2M-$5M | **CRITICAL GAP** if absent ($850K Gonzalez exposure) |
| **Product Recall** | **Likely absent** | Not typical for craft breweries | Gap acceptable given industry norms |

### D. Transaction-Specific Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Change of control policy termination** | **CRITICAL** | Policies terminate at closing; all liabilities become uninsured | **Immediate action:** Notice to all insurers; obtain assignment consent; add ABP as additional insured |
| **No tail coverage for claims-made policies** | **HIGH** | D&O/EPLI claims arising from pre-closing conduct become uninsured post-closing | Require ASBC to purchase 6-year tail ($500K-$750K cost) |
| **Assignment restrictions** | **HIGH** | Liability policies may not transfer to ABP without insurer consent | Verify anti-assignment clauses; obtain consent 60 days pre-closing |
| **Straddle claims** (pre/post-closing conduct) | **MEDIUM** | Claims spanning closing date may have coverage disputes | Negotiate specific allocation in purchase agreement |

### E. Red Flags Requiring Immediate Follow-Up

**Critical Items for Pre-Closing Due Diligence:**

1. ✅ **Confirm EPLI exists** - If no EPLI, ABP faces **$750K-$1.1M uninsured exposure** for Gonzalez claim alone

2. ✅ **Confirm D&O exists** - If no D&O, regulatory defense costs ($220K-$370K) and investigation exposure uninsured

3. ✅ **Verify notice to insurer (Smith case)** - Late notice could jeopardize $5M coverage for $500K-$1.5M settlement

4. ✅ **Obtain insurance policies** - Cannot assess coverage without reviewing actual policy language

5. ✅ **Notice of acquisition to insurers** - Must occur 30-60 days pre-closing to preserve coverage post-closing

6. ✅ **Tail coverage purchase** - ASBC must purchase tail for all claims-made policies (D&O, EPLI) as closing condition

7. ✅ **Assignment consent** - Obtain insurer consent for policy assignment to ABP

**Escalation Trigger:** If Items 1-4 are not resolved within **7 business days**, ABP should consider:
- Increasing escrow/holdback by $5M-$8M to cover potential uninsured liabilities
- Requiring ASBC to obtain EPLI and D&O insurance pre-closing
- Adjusting purchase price to account for uninsured risk

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

#### 1. Oregon Smith Dram Shop Case - Coverage Opinion

**Coverage Determination:** **COVERED** ✓

The Oregon Smith dram shop case is **highly likely to be covered** under ASBC's $5 million general liability policy with dram shop coverage, subject to the following conditions:

**Affirmative Findings:**
- Liquor liability coverage confirmed (litigation report states "including dram shop coverage")
- Claim falls squarely within policy coverage grant (serving alcohol to allegedly visibly intoxicated patron causing third-party injuries)
- No policy exclusions apply (intentional acts, criminal conduct, pollution, professional services, employer's liability)
- Oregon's broad duty to defend standard requires insurer to defend based on complaint allegations
- Eight corners rule analysis confirms potential for coverage triggers defense duty

**Conditions Requiring Confirmation:**
- **Timely notice** to insurer (September 2023 incident → insurer notified when?)
- **Policy type** (occurrence vs. claims-made) - Likely occurrence-based, but must confirm
- **No reservation of rights disputes** - Verify insurer accepted defense without coverage disputes
- **Actual policy language** - Analysis based on standard ISO CGL/liquor liability forms; actual policy may vary

**Financial Impact:**
- **ASBC's maximum exposure:** $100,000 (SIR only)
- **Insurer's exposure:** $400K-$1.4M (settlement/judgment exceeding SIR, up to $5M limit)
- **Settlement range (T4 report):** $500K-$1.5M (comfortably within $5M policy limits)

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH (85-90%)** - Coverage is highly probable based on confirmed dram shop coverage and straightforward claim facts, but actual policy review required for definitive opinion.

#### 2. Coverage for Other Known Liabilities

| Liability | Coverage Status | ASBC Exposure | Insurer Exposure |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Lone Star litigation ($800K-$2.0M)** | **NO COVERAGE** (economic loss) | $800K-$2.0M | $0 |
| **TTB bourbon ($4.0M-$4.2M)** | **NO COVERAGE** (likely no product recall ins.) | $4.0M-$4.2M | $0 |
| **FTC investigation ($64K-$120K)** | **PARTIAL** (defense costs if D&O exists) | $64K-$120K | $0-$80K |
| **EEOC Gonzalez ($750K-$1.1M)** | **YES** (if EPLI exists) | $10K-$50K (deductible) | $700K-$1.05M |
| **EEOC Gonzalez (no EPLI)** | **NO COVERAGE** | $750K-$1.1M | $0 |

**Aggregate Uninsured Exposure:** $5.474M - $7.42M (excluding Smith case, assuming EPLI exists)
**Worst-Case Uninsured Exposure:** $6.214M - $8.52M (if no EPLI coverage)

#### 3. Policy Adequacy Assessment

**Adequate Coverage:**
- ✅ **Liquor Liability ($5M):** Industry-leading limits for 18-location craft beverage operator
- ✅ **SIR Structure ($100K):** Reasonable retention level; protects ASBC from catastrophic loss

**Unknown/Unconfirmed Coverage (Critical Gaps):**
- ❓ **D&O Insurance:** Essential for regulatory exposure ($220K-$370K defense costs + $4.2M investigation exposure)
- ❓ **EPLI:** Essential for 1,850-employee workforce ($850K Gonzalez claim + future claims)
- ❓ **Umbrella/Excess:** Recommended for catastrophic multi-claim scenarios

**Likely Absent Coverage (Acceptable Gaps):**
- ⚠️ **Product Recall Insurance:** $4M bourbon recall uninsured (not typical for craft breweries)
- ⚠️ **E&O/Commercial Contracts:** Lone Star $800K-$2M uninsured (economic loss not covered by CGL)

**Overall Adequacy:** **CONDITIONALLY ADEQUATE** - Liquor liability coverage is strong, but critical gaps (D&O, EPLI) must be confirmed. If D&O and EPLI exist with adequate limits, overall insurance program is sufficient for ASBC's risk profile.

### B. Recommended Next Steps for ABP (Buyer)

#### Immediate Actions (Within 7 Business Days)

**Priority 1 - Policy Discovery:**
1. **Obtain complete insurance policies:** Request all policies from ASBC (CGL/liquor liability, D&O, EPLI, umbrella, E&O, cyber, product recall)
2. **Identify insurers:** Confirm carrier names, policy numbers, policy periods, limits, deductibles/SIRs
3. **Review policy language:** Analyze actual coverage grants, exclusions, conditions, change of control provisions

**Priority 2 - Coverage Confirmation:**
4. **Verify Smith case notice:** Confirm date ASBC notified insurer of September 2023 incident; obtain insurer's coverage position letter
5. **Verify EPLI exists:** If yes, confirm Gonzalez EEOC charge reported; obtain coverage confirmation
6. **Verify D&O exists:** If yes, confirm TTB and FTC investigations reported; obtain coverage confirmation

**Priority 3 - Coverage Gap Assessment:**
7. **Quantify uninsured exposure:** If no EPLI: add $750K-$1.1M to uninsured exposure
8. **Quantify uninsured exposure:** If no D&O: add $220K-$370K defense costs + limited regulatory investigation coverage
9. **Calculate total uninsured exposure:** Aggregate Lone Star ($800K-$2.0M) + TTB ($4.0M-$4.2M) + FTC ($64K-$120K) + EPLI gap (if applicable) + D&O gap (if applicable)

#### Pre-Closing Actions (30-60 Days Before Closing)

**Change of Control Management:**
10. **Notice to all insurers:** ASBC must notify all insurers of impending change of control (30-60 days pre-closing recommended)
11. **Request assignment consent:** Obtain insurer consent to assign policies to ABP or confirm consent not required
12. **Add ABP as additional insured:** Endorse all policies to add ABP as named insured or successor in interest
13. **Verify no automatic termination:** Confirm change of control provisions do not terminate coverage at closing

**Tail Coverage Procurement:**
14. **Require ASBC to purchase tail coverage:** 6-year extended reporting period for all claims-made policies (D&O, EPLI, E&O if applicable)
15. **Allocate tail coverage cost:** Negotiate whether ASBC (seller) pays tail premium as closing condition or cost is split
16. **Estimated cost:** $500K-$750K for 6-year tail (to be factored into purchase price negotiation)

**Due Diligence Completion:**
17. **Interview ASBC's insurance broker:** Understand complete insurance program, claims history, premium costs, upcoming renewals
18. **Obtain 5-year loss runs:** Review all claims paid or reserved under each policy (CGL, EPLI, D&O, workers' comp, property)
19. **Identify red flags:** Prior coverage denials, bad faith disputes, late notice issues, reservation of rights letters

#### Purchase Agreement Provisions

**Representations and Warranties:**
20. **Insurance representation:** ASBC represents all policies listed on Schedule X are in full force and effect, no coverage disputes exist, all premiums current
21. **No undisclosed claims:** ASBC represents no known or threatened claims beyond those disclosed in litigation/regulatory schedules
22. **Cooperation with insurers:** ASBC represents it has timely reported all claims and complied with all policy conditions

**Covenants:**
23. **Maintain coverage through closing:** ASBC must maintain all policies through closing date without reduction in limits or material changes in terms
24. **Notice and cooperation:** ASBC must promptly notify ABP of any coverage disputes, reservation of rights letters, or insurer communications
25. **Purchase tail coverage:** ASBC must purchase 6-year tail for all claims-made policies as closing condition

**Indemnification:**
26. **Indemnity for uninsured liabilities:** ASBC indemnifies ABP for all pre-closing liabilities, subject to escrow fund
27. **Cap:** Indemnification capped at $10M-$15M (or 10%-12% of purchase price)
28. **Basket:** De minimis claims below $250K-$500K excluded
29. **Survival period:** Insurance reps survive 24-36 months post-closing

**Escrow/Holdback:**
30. **Escrow amount:** $7M-$10M to cover uninsured known liabilities:
   - Lone Star settlement: $800K-$2.0M
   - TTB bourbon investigation: $4.0M-$4.2M
   - FTC/EEOC (if uninsured): $750K-$1.2M
   - Contingency: $500K-$1.0M
31. **Release schedule:**
   - $2.0M released upon Lone Star settlement (reimbursing ASBC for settlement within $800K-$2.0M range)
   - $4.2M released upon TTB investigation resolution (reimbursing ASBC for costs if recall avoided)
   - $500K released 18 months post-closing (if no additional claims)
   - Balance released 24 months post-closing

**Closing Conditions:**
32. **Insurance certificates:** Receipt of certificates of insurance confirming all policies in force through closing
33. **Tail coverage evidence:** Receipt of evidence ASBC purchased 6-year tail for all claims-made policies
34. **Assignment consent:** Receipt of insurer consent to assignment (or legal opinion that consent not required)

### C. Recommended Actions for ASBC (Seller)

**To Facilitate Transaction:**
1. **Provide complete insurance files:** Deliver all policies, endorsements, loss runs, broker correspondence to ABP within 7 days
2. **Confirm coverage status:** Obtain and deliver coverage position letters from insurers for Smith, Gonzalez, TTB, and FTC matters
3. **Notify insurers:** Provide formal notice of acquisition to all insurers 60 days pre-closing
4. **Procure tail coverage quotes:** Obtain quotes for 6-year tail coverage for all claims-made policies
5. **Coordinate with broker:** Engage insurance broker to assist with change of control management and tail procurement

**To Minimize Escrow/Holdback:**
6. **Settle Smith case pre-closing:** Target Q1 2026 mediation; settle within $500K-$1.0M range to demonstrate insurance coverage works
7. **Resolve TTB investigation:** Negotiate formula approval or inventory reformulation to eliminate $4M recall exposure
8. **Resolve FTC investigation:** Negotiate informal consent order to cap exposure at $64K-$120K
9. **Settle Gonzalez EEOC claim:** Engage in EEOC mediation to resolve for $300K-$500K before charge escalates to lawsuit

### D. Transaction Structuring Recommendations

**Insurance-Driven Deal Terms:**

1. **Purchase Price Adjustment:** Consider $5M-$7M purchase price reduction to account for uninsured liabilities (Lone Star + TTB + FTC + contingency)

2. **Split-Tail Approach:** ABP and ASBC split cost of 6-year tail coverage ($250K-$375K each), reflecting shared benefit

3. **Contingent Earnout:** Structure $4M earnout tied to TTB investigation resolution (if formula approved and no recall required, seller receives $4M earnout)

4. **Insurance Proceeds Assignment:** ASBC assigns all rights to insurance proceeds for pre-closing claims to ABP (particularly Smith case settlement proceeds exceeding SIR)

5. **Post-Closing Insurance Program:** ABP procures new GL/liquor liability policy effective at closing with $10M limits (increasing from $5M) to account for ASBC's 18-location exposure within ABP's broader portfolio

**Risk Allocation Matrix:**

| Liability | Pre-Closing Cost | Responsibility | Insurance Coverage | Escrow/Holdback |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Oregon Smith** | $500K-$1.5M | **Insurer pays** (ASBC pays $100K SIR) | Yes ($5M GL/liquor) | $200K (SIR + contingency) |
| **Lone Star** | $800K-$2.0M | **ASBC pays** (uninsured) | No | $2.0M (released upon settlement) |
| **TTB Bourbon** | $4.0M-$4.2M | **ASBC pays** (uninsured) | No | $4.2M (released if no recall) |
| **FTC** | $64K-$120K | **Shared** (defense costs vs. penalties) | Partial (if D&O exists) | $150K (contingency) |
| **EEOC Gonzalez** | $750K-$1.1M | **Insurer pays** (if EPLI exists) | Yes (if EPLI) | $100K (deductible + contingency) |
| **Unknown Claims** | TBD | **ABP/Insurer** (post-closing policy responds) | Yes (tail coverage) | $500K (contingency) |

**Total Escrow/Holdback:** $7.15M (adequate to cover uninsured known liabilities + contingency)

### E. Insurance Due Diligence Quality Attestation

**Completeness:** This analysis addresses all known liabilities and insurance coverage issues based on available information from T1-T6 specialist reports.

**Limitations:**
- **No actual policy review:** Analysis based on standard ISO CGL/liquor liability forms and industry practices; actual policy language may differ materially
- **Unknown policies:** D&O, EPLI, umbrella, E&O existence and terms unconfirmed
- **Insurer identity:** Carrier financial strength ratings not assessed

**Confidence Levels:**

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Smith coverage likely** | **HIGH (85-90%)** | Confirmed dram shop coverage + straightforward claim + Oregon broad duty to defend |
| **Lone Star uninsured** | **HIGH (90%)** | Economic loss claims excluded from CGL as industry standard |
| **TTB uninsured** | **HIGH (85%)** | Product recall insurance rare for craft breweries; fines excluded from all policies |
| **EPLI critical gap if absent** | **HIGH (90%)** | 1,850 employees + hospitality sector + $850K Gonzalez exposure = material uninsured risk |
| **D&O critical gap if absent** | **MEDIUM (70%)** | Regulatory exposure significant but defense costs (not fines) may be manageable uninsured |

**Known Gaps in Analysis:**
- FTC/TTB/EEOC investigations not fully addressed in Phase 1 reports; exposure estimates used from research plan
- Workers' compensation, property, auto, cyber coverage not analyzed (outside scope)
- Premium costs and renewal terms not addressed
- Insurer financial strength ratings not assessed
- International operations coverage (8 markets) not addressed

### F. Final Opinion - Transaction Risk Assessment

**Overall Insurance Coverage Risk Level:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Summary:**
- **Oregon Smith case ($500K-$1.5M):** **INSURED** - Well-covered under $5M liquor liability policy, ASBC exposure capped at $100K SIR
- **Other known liabilities ($5.5M-$7.4M):** **LARGELY UNINSURED** - Lone Star, TTB bourbon, FTC, and potentially EEOC/Gonzalez if no EPLI
- **Total uninsured exposure:** $5.474M-$7.42M (with EPLI) or $6.214M-$8.52M (without EPLI)

**Critical Action Required:** ABP must immediately verify existence of D&O and EPLI coverage. If neither exists, total uninsured exposure exceeds **$8.5M**, representing **material transaction risk** that must be addressed through:
1. **Increased escrow/holdback** ($8M-$10M recommended)
2. **Purchase price adjustment** ($5M-$7M reduction)
3. **Pre-closing settlement** of key liabilities (Lone Star, EEOC, FTC)
4. **Require ASBC to procure D&O and EPLI** pre-closing

**Go/No-Go Factors:**
- ✅ **PROCEED** if: D&O and EPLI exist with adequate limits ($10M+ D&O, $2M+ EPLI), Smith case coverage confirmed, tail coverage procured
- ⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** if: D&O or EPLI absent, requiring increased escrow and risk allocation negotiations
- 🛑 **RECONSIDER** if: All policies absent (D&O, EPLI, umbrella) + Smith coverage dispute + late notice issues = fundamentally uninsurable target

**Current Status:** **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - Pending immediate verification of D&O/EPLI existence and confirmation of Smith case notice/coverage status.

## IX. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment

✓ All known liabilities analyzed (Oregon Smith, Lone Star, TTB, FTC, EEOC)
✓ Oregon insurance law comprehensively researched (15+ searches)
✓ Policy structures analyzed (CGL, liquor liability, D&O, EPLI, umbrella)
✓ Industry benchmarks confirmed (craft brewery coverage standards)
✓ Transaction implications addressed (change of control, tail coverage, RWI)
✓ Cross-references to Phase 1 reports incorporated

### Confidence Levels

| Analysis Area | Confidence | Basis |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| **Smith coverage analysis** | **HIGH (85-90%)** | Confirmed coverage + straightforward claim + Oregon broad standard |
| **Policy exclusions analysis** | **HIGH (85%)** | Standard ISO forms + industry practice |
| **Late notice prejudice** | **HIGH (90%)** | Oregon case law + statute |
| **Duty to defend standard** | **HIGH (90%)** | Oregon Supreme Court precedent |
| **SIR operation** | **MEDIUM-HIGH (75%)** | Standard structures, but actual policy controls |
| **Bad faith exposure** | **MEDIUM-HIGH (80%)** | Moody decision + 2024 developments |
| **Coverage for other liabilities** | **HIGH (85-90%)** | Standard exclusions well-established |
| **Policy adequacy assessment** | **MEDIUM (70%)** | Industry benchmarks, but gaps unconfirmed |
| **Transaction implications** | **HIGH (85%)** | M&A insurance practice + 2024 trends |

### Known Limitations

1. **No actual policy review:** Analysis based on standard ISO CGL/liquor liability forms; actual policy language may differ materially
2. **Unknown policies:** D&O, EPLI, umbrella, E&O existence and terms unconfirmed
3. **Insurer identity unknown:** Cannot assess carrier financial strength or claims-paying ability
4. **Notice date unknown:** Critical for late notice analysis (assumes September-October 2023 notice)
5. **Reservation of rights unknown:** Cannot assess actual insurer coverage position
6. **Phase 1 report gaps:** FTC, TTB, EEOC investigations not fully detailed in specialist reports

### Recommended Follow-Up Research

If ABP proceeds with acquisition:
1. **Obtain and review actual insurance policies** (CGL, D&O, EPLI, umbrella, E&O)
2. **Confirm notice dates** to all insurers for all known claims
3. **Interview insurance broker** (program structure, claims history, renewal terms)
4. **Obtain loss runs** (5-year history of all claims and reserves)
5. **Engage coverage counsel** for formal coverage opinion on Smith case
6. **Consult M&A insurance specialist** for transaction-specific coverage issues
