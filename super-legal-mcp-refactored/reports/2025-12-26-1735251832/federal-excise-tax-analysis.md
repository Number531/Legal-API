## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Transaction Overview and Federal Excise Tax Exposure

This memorandum analyzes the Federal Excise Tax (FET) implications of ABP's proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of American Small Beverage Company (ASBC). The transaction triggers IRC § 1563 controlled group rules (modified for alcohol excise taxes to apply a ">50% ownership" threshold), requiring ASBC to share reduced FET rate allotments with all other breweries and distilleries owned by ABP. ASBC currently pays $7,281,997 in annual federal excise taxes across three product categories: beer ($7.01M), spirits ($270K), and wine/mead ($1,997). As a standalone entity, ASBC receives full reduced rate benefits—$3.50/barrel on the first 60,000 barrels of beer and $2.70/proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons of spirits.

Upon closing, ASBC becomes part of ABP's controlled group and must apportion these reduced rate allotments among all group members. Depending on ABP's FET allocation methodology, ASBC's annual FET could increase by $0 (optimal allocation) to $1,814,000 (worst-case allocation). The most likely scenario—proportional allocation based on production share—results in a **$691,859 annual FET increase** (9.5% above standalone), driven primarily by spirits FET escalation (+$472,884, or 175% increase). This recurring cash flow reduction has significant transaction valuation implications, potentially justifying a $5.5M to $12M purchase price adjustment depending on allocation assumptions and EBITDA multiples applied.

### Controlled Group Rules: Modified IRC § 1563 Framework

Federal excise taxes on beer, spirits, and wine are governed by 26 U.S.C. §§ 5051, 5001, and 5041, respectively. The Craft Beverage Modernization Act (CBMA), made permanent on December 27, 2020, provides reduced FET rates for small producers. For beer, brewers producing ≤2 million barrels annually pay $3.50/barrel on the first 60,000 barrels (vs. $16/barrel standard small brewer rate, $18/barrel for large brewers). For spirits, distillers producing ≤22.13 million proof gallons annually pay $2.70/PG on the first 100,000 proof gallons (vs. $13.34/PG intermediate rate, $13.50/PG standard rate).

Congress modified the standard IRC § 1563 controlled group definition for alcohol FET purposes by lowering the ownership threshold from "at least 80%" to "**more than 50%**" (26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(5)(A) for beer; § 5001(c)(3)(A) for spirits). When entities form a controlled group, they must **share a single set of reduced rate allotments**—one 60,000-barrel beer allotment and one 100,000 proof gallon spirits allotment for the entire group. The IRC requires controlled group members to "apportion" these allotments among themselves, but provides complete flexibility in allocation methodology. Groups may allocate optimally (all reduced rates to highest-volume producer), proportionally (based on production share), strategically (balancing tax efficiency and equity), or by any other agreed-upon formula.

ABP's acquisition of >50% of ASBC triggers immediate controlled group formation effective at closing. All beer/spirits removed from ASBC's facilities after the closing date will be subject to controlled group tax rates based on the allocation in effect for that calendar year. The single taxpayer rule (§ 5051(a)(5)(C) for beer; § 5001(c)(3)(B) for spirits) also aggregates entities producing under license, franchise, or similar arrangement, regardless of common ownership—though this provision is less relevant post-acquisition when direct ownership exceeds 50%.

### FET Impact Modeling: Four Allocation Scenarios

This analysis models hypothetical ABP controlled group holdings per user instruction: ASBC (485K bbl beer, 100K PG spirits), Brewery A (120K bbl), Brewery B (80K bbl), and Distillery C (80K PG). Total controlled group production: 685,000 barrels beer, 180,000 proof gallons spirits. Both figures remain well below the small producer thresholds (2M barrels, 22.13M PG), so the group retains eligibility for reduced rates—the issue is **allocation** of limited reduced rate quantities.

**Scenario 1: Optimal Allocation (All Reduced Rates to ASBC)**
- Beer: 60,000 bbl @ $3.50 to ASBC → ASBC beer FET: $7,010,000 (no change)
- Spirits: 100,000 PG @ $2.70 to ASBC → ASBC spirits FET: $270,000 (no change)
- **Total ASBC FET: $7,281,997 (no increase)**
- Group total beer FET: $10,210,000
- Group total spirits FET: $1,337,200
- **Impact:** Zero FET increase for ASBC; maximizes group tax efficiency

**Scenario 2: Proportional Allocation (Based on Production Share)**
- Beer: 42,482 bbl @ $3.50 to ASBC (70.8% of 60K) → ASBC beer FET: $7,228,975 (+$218,975)
- Spirits: 55,556 PG @ $2.70 to ASBC (55.6% of 100K) → ASBC spirits FET: $742,884 (+$472,884)
- **Total ASBC FET: $7,973,856 (+$691,859, or +9.5%)**
- Group total beer FET: $10,210,001 (rounding)
- Group total spirits FET: $1,337,200
- **Impact:** ASBC bears $692K annual FET increase; equitable but suboptimal for group
- **Valuation Impact:** 10-year NPV @ 8% discount = $4.64M; purchase price adjustment ~$5.5M @ 8× EBITDA multiple

**Scenario 3: Worst-Case Allocation (All Reduced Rates to Smallest Producers)**
- Beer: 60,000 bbl @ $3.50 to Brewery B → ASBC beer FET: $7,760,000 (+$750,000)
- Spirits: 100,000 PG @ $2.70 to Distillery C → ASBC spirits FET: $1,334,000 (+$1,064,000)
- **Total ASBC FET: $9,095,997 (+$1,814,000, or +25%)**
- Group total beer FET: $10,210,000
- Group total spirits FET: $1,550,000 (+$212,800 vs. optimal, due to 20K PG unused allotment at Distillery C)
- **Impact:** Massive FET increase for ASBC; inefficient for group (wasted reduced rate capacity)
- **Valuation Impact:** 10-year NPV @ 8% discount = $12.16M; purchase price adjustment ~$12M+

**Scenario 4: Strategic Allocation (Balanced Approach)**
- Beer: 50,000 bbl @ $3.50 to ASBC, 10,000 bbl to Brewery A → ASBC beer FET: $7,135,000 (+$125,000)
- Spirits: 100,000 PG @ $2.70 to ASBC → ASBC spirits FET: $270,000 (no change)
- **Total ASBC FET: $7,406,997 (+$125,000, or +1.7%)**
- Group total beer/spirits FET: same as optimal
- **Impact:** Minimal ASBC FET increase while providing some benefit to Brewery A; flexible compromise

**Key Analytical Insights:**

1. **Spirits FET Disproportionately Affected:** Under proportional allocation, spirits FET increases by $472,884 (175% increase), while beer FET increases by only $218,975 (3.1%). ASBC's spirits production exactly equals the full 100K PG reduced rate allotment, so any allocation reduction directly shifts substantial volume to the $13.34/PG higher rate. Beer FET impact is more modest because ASBC's 485K barrel production far exceeds the 60K barrel reduced rate allotment.

2. **Group Total FET Constant for Beer, Variable for Spirits:** Beer allocation strategy affects only distribution of tax burden among members; total group beer FET remains $10.21M regardless of allocation. However, suboptimal spirits allocation (Scenario 3) increases **total group** spirits FET by $212,800 annually because Distillery C cannot utilize full 100K PG allotment (produces only 80K PG, leaving 20K PG unused).

3. **Allocation Flexibility is Complete:** TTB regulations provide controlled groups with unfettered discretion to allocate reduced rates in any manner. No requirement for proportional or "fair" allocation. Allocation can be revised annually (or quarterly) based on production changes, financial performance, or strategic priorities. This flexibility creates negotiation opportunity in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

4. **Calendar Year Timing Matters:** Controlled group status and allocation apply on calendar year basis. If ABP closes in Q4 (October-December 2025), ASBC retains standalone reduced rates for most of 2025, deferring controlled group impact to 2026. Q1 closing (January-March) triggers immediate controlled group treatment for entire calendar year.

### Bond Transfer and Regulatory Compliance Requirements

ASBC maintains $750,000 in surety bonds with TTB-approved sureties: $450,000 for three brewery locations, $250,000 for distilled spirits plant (DSP), and $50,000 for winery. These bonds guarantee payment of federal excise taxes and are mandatory for operations (27 C.F.R. § 25.91 for breweries; § 19.151 for DSPs). Upon change in proprietorship, TTB regulations require the successor operator (ABP) to qualify "in the same manner as the proprietor of a new brewery/DSP" (27 C.F.R. § 25.72, § 19.143). This mandates:

- Filing amended TTB Forms 5130.10 (Brewer's Notice), 5110.41 (DSP Registration), and 5120.36 (Winery Application)
- Providing new bonds in ABP's name, or obtaining surety consent to extend existing bonds through ownership change
- Awaiting TTB approval before commencing or continuing operations under new ownership

**Critical Timing Risk:** If TTB approval is not obtained before closing, ASBC must immediately **cease all production and removal operations** until new bonds are approved. TTB recommends filing change-in-proprietorship applications at least **60 days before** anticipated closing date to avoid operations disruption. Failure to timely obtain bonds could cost millions in lost production, customer relationships, and potential breach of supply contracts.

**Bond Procurement Strategy:** ABP should (1) contact ASBC's current sureties pre-closing to request continuation certificates extending bonds through transition period, (2) if sureties decline, obtain quotes from 3+ Treasury Circular 570 approved sureties (published annually at https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/surety-bonds/circular-570.html), (3) allow 30-45 days for underwriting and bond issuance, and (4) consider negotiating escrow holdback from purchase price to cover bond procurement delays.

### Payment Timing, Penalties, and Cash Flow Implications

ASBC must file FET returns and remit payment on a **semi-monthly basis**—every 14 days (27 C.F.R. § 25.164). Return periods run from the 1st-15th and 16th-last day of each month, with payment due 14 days after period end. With current annual FET of $7.28M, ASBC pays approximately $281,000 every two weeks. Under proportional allocation scenario (+$692K annually), semi-monthly payments increase to ~$310,000, requiring additional working capital of approximately $300K to fund 4-6 weeks' incremental FET.

Late payment triggers severe penalties: (1) **5% initial penalty** under IRC § 5684(a), (2) **cumulative 5%/month failure-to-file penalty** (max 25%), (3) **cumulative 0.5%/month failure-to-pay penalty** (max 25%), and (4) **compounded daily interest** at federal short-term rate + 3 percentage points (~8% annually as of Q4 2024). A missed $281K payment remaining unpaid for 3 months incurs ~$24K in penalties and interest (8.5% of original tax). Bond forfeiture risk also exists if pattern of non-compliance emerges.

ASBC's current $450K brewery bonds and $250K DSP bond provide limited coverage relative to potential FET exposure. Six-month FET liability approximates $3.64M, yet bonds total only $700K (brewery + DSP). While TTB regulations technically require bond amounts sufficient to cover maximum tax liability in peak production period (27 C.F.R. § 25.93), enforcement varies. ASBC does not qualify for bond exemption (available only to taxpayers with ≤$50K annual FET per § 25.91(e)).

### Transaction Valuation and Purchase Price Implications

ASBC's standalone EBITDA implicitly reflects current $7.28M annual FET burden. Post-acquisition FET increase of $692K (proportional scenario) represents a **10% reduction in operating cash flow**. Applying standard EBITDA valuation multiples:

- **Conservative (8× EBITDA):** $692K × 8 = **$5.5M valuation reduction**
- **Mid-range (10× EBITDA):** $692K × 10 = **$6.9M valuation reduction**
- **Aggressive (12× EBITDA):** $692K × 12 = **$8.3M valuation reduction**

Under worst-case allocation (+$1.81M annual FET), valuation impact escalates to **$12M-$22M** depending on multiple applied. These figures represent **permanent, recurring** cash flow reduction with no offsetting operational benefits to ASBC.

**Sellers' Negotiation Position:** ASBC currently enjoys full reduced FET rate benefits as standalone entity. Controlled group aggregation is an **externality imposed by ABP**, not inherent to ASBC's business. Sellers should not bear economic burden of ABP's ownership structure. Recommended seller demands include: (1) Purchase price adjustment of $5.5M-$8.3M to compensate for proportional allocation FET increase, or escrow mechanism releasing funds based on actual allocation performance; (2) Contractual covenant in Stock Purchase Agreement requiring ABP to allocate optimal or near-optimal reduced rates to ASBC for minimum 3-5 years post-closing, with liquidated damages if breached; (3) Working capital true-up increasing target by ~$300K to fund higher semi-monthly FET payments; (4) Representations that ABP's total controlled group production will remain below 2M barrels (beer) and 22.13M PG (spirits) thresholds; and (5) Closing timing in Q4 to defer controlled group impact to following calendar year.

**Buyers' Counter-Position:** ABP may argue (1) proportional allocation is industry-standard and equitable across all controlled group members, (2) ASBC benefits from ABP's scale, purchasing power, and distribution network, offsetting FET increase, (3) FET increase is operational tax expense, not purchase price adjustment item, and (4) flexibility to reallocate FET rates annually based on group-wide tax optimization warrants no contractual restriction.

### Critical Due Diligence Requirements

This analysis models hypothetical ABP controlled group holdings (Brewery A 120K bbl, Brewery B 80K bbl, Distillery C 80K PG) per user instruction. **Actual FET impact depends entirely on ABP's real portfolio, which remains undisclosed.** Before finalizing transaction, ASBC/Sellers must obtain:

1. **Complete list of all breweries and distilleries in ABP controlled group** (entity names, EINs, TTB permit numbers, addresses, annual production volumes)
2. **ABP's current FET allocation methodology** (optimal, proportional, or other) and historical allocation decisions over last 3 years
3. **Commitment to favorable allocation for ASBC post-acquisition**—will ABP agree to contractual allocation provision in SPA?
4. **ABP's total controlled group production**—does group remain under 2M barrel/22.13M PG thresholds after adding ASBC?
5. **Existing bond procurement process** at ABP—master bonding facility vs. subsidiary-level bonds
6. **State excise tax exposure**—many states impose separate excise taxes with distinct controlled group rules
7. **Contract brewing/distilling arrangements**—IRC "single taxpayer" provision aggregates entities producing under license/franchise arrangements even without common ownership

If ABP owns breweries/distilleries larger than modeled (e.g., one brewery producing 1.5M barrels), ASBC's proportional share of reduced rate allotments would decrease substantially, potentially increasing ASBC's FET by $1M+ annually. Conversely, if ABP's existing portfolio is smaller than modeled, ASBC may receive more favorable allocation. **Full portfolio disclosure is non-negotiable due diligence requirement.**

### Allocation Election Procedures and TTB Notification

Controlled groups must notify TTB of FET allocation through annual filing (27 C.F.R. § 25.167 for beer, § 19.238 for spirits). Required information includes: list of all group members (names, addresses, EINs), allocated reduced rate barrels/proof gallons to each member, and certification that allocation totals ≤60,000 barrels (beer) and ≤100,000 PG (spirits). Filing deadline: before first removal at reduced rates in calendar year (typically filed in December for following year).

TTB regulations permit mid-year allocation changes based on actual production levels. For example, if ABP closes on ASBC in April 2025, ASBC operates standalone for Q1 (retaining full reduced rates for January-March removals), then joins controlled group in Q2 with revised allocation for April-December. Allocation changes require: (1) amended TTB Form 5130.10 (Brewer's Notice) reflecting controlled group membership, (2) updated Controlled Group Allocation Notice, (3) contemporaneous documentation of allocation change, and (4) adjusted tax rates on TTB Form 5000.24 (Brewer's Report of Operations) for all affected periods.

**Best Practice:** Execute formal "Controlled Group FET Allocation Agreement" among all ABP controlled group members within 30 days post-closing, specifying: (1) identification of all group members, (2) allocation of 60K barrel beer reduced rate, (3) allocation of 100K PG spirits reduced rate, (4) effective period (calendar year), (5) amendment procedures, and (6) signatures of authorized representatives. Maintain records for TTB audit defense showing rationale for allocation methodology.

### Cross-Domain Impacts Flagged for Memorandum Synthesis

This FET analysis intersects with multiple other legal domains in Project Bacchus:

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Legal Doctrine/Issue | Memo Section Reference |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **FET increase $692K-$1.8M annually** | **Valuation/Financial** | EBITDA reduction; purchase price adjustment | Financial Due Diligence, Purchase Agreement Negotiation |
| **FET increase $692K-$1.8M annually** | **Tax (Corporate)** | IRC § 338(h)(10) election timing; tax attribute step-up analysis | Corporate Tax Structuring |
| **Bond transfer 60-day lead time** | **Regulatory (TTB)** | Change-in-proprietorship approval; operations continuity risk | Regulatory Compliance Timeline |
| **Semi-monthly payment $281K-$310K** | **Working Capital** | Increased cash conversion cycle; revolver capacity | Working Capital True-Up Calculation |
| **Allocation governance rights** | **Corporate Governance** | Board consent rights; management incentive alignment | Stockholders Agreement, Employment Agreements |
| **State excise tax exposure** | **Tax (State & Local)** | CA/NY/TX excise tax controlled group rules; multi-state nexus | SALT Analysis |
| **Proportional allocation precedent** | **Transaction Negotiation** | ABP's allocation policy across portfolio; precedent for future acquisitions | Deal Structure and Negotiation Strategy |

**Recommended Coordination:** FET allocation should be negotiated in parallel with (1) purchase price/working capital adjustments, (2) regulatory approval timeline, (3) corporate governance provisions, and (4) employment/management incentive structure. If ABP imposes proportional allocation, consider offsetting ASBC management's FET burden through increased cash compensation or equity awards tied to FET allocation favorability.

### Recommendations Summary

**Immediate Actions (Pre-Signing):**
1. Demand full disclosure of ABP's beverage alcohol portfolio in due diligence
2. Model FET impact based on actual ABP holdings (not hypothetical)
3. Negotiate FET allocation governance provisions in Stock Purchase Agreement
4. Quantify valuation adjustment based on proportional allocation scenario ($5.5M-$8.3M purchase price reduction)

**Pre-Closing Actions (45-60 Days Before Closing):**
5. Initiate TTB change-in-proprietorship applications for all 3 breweries, 1 DSP, and 1 winery
6. Obtain surety bonds for ABP ($750K minimum; potentially higher based on controlled group exposure)
7. Negotiate closing timing in Q4 (October-December) to defer controlled group impact to 2026

**Post-Closing Actions:**
8. Execute Controlled Group FET Allocation Agreement among all ABP controlled group members (allocate optimal amounts to ASBC)
9. File TTB annual allocation notices before first removal at reduced rates
10. Implement enhanced FET compliance program (automated payment system, quarterly allocation utilization reviews)
11. Monitor for mid-year allocation adjustments if production varies from budget
12. Conduct separate state excise tax analysis for all states where ASBC operates

**Outstanding Questions for ABP:** (1) Complete brewery/distillery portfolio with production volumes, (2) Current FET allocation methodology and 3-year historical patterns, (3) Commitment to favorable allocation for ASBC post-acquisition, (4) Total controlled group production vs. 2M barrel/22.13M PG thresholds, (5) Bond procurement process and timeline, (6) State excise tax analysis completion status, (7) Contract brewing/distilling arrangements triggering single taxpayer aggregation, and (8) Purchase price adjustment methodology for FET increase.

**Risk Assessment:** **HIGH RISK** due to (1) $500K-$1.8M annual FET increase range creating significant valuation uncertainty, (2) ABP portfolio disclosure failure preventing accurate FET modeling, (3) bond transfer timing risk potentially disrupting ASBC operations, and (4) proportional allocation precedent at ABP (if applicable) imposing $692K annual FET increase. Risk mitigation requires contractual allocation commitment in SPA, purchase price adjustment reflecting FET impact, and TTB bond approval before closing.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Current FET Structure (Pre-Acquisition Baseline)

#### 1. Statutory Framework for Federal Excise Taxes on Alcohol

Federal excise taxes on beer, distilled spirits, and wine are imposed under Chapter 51 of the Internal Revenue Code (Subtitle E - "Alcohol, Tobacco, and Certain Other Excise Taxes").¹ The Craft Beverage Modernization Act (CBMA), originally enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, provided reduced FET rates for small producers.² On December 27, 2020, the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 made these reduced rates permanent.³

**Key Permanent Provisions (Effective January 1, 2021):**⁴
- Reduced tax rates on beer ($3.50/barrel for first 60,000 barrels)
- Reduced tax rates on distilled spirits ($2.70/proof gallon for first 100,000 proof gallons)
- Tax credits for wine ($1.00, $0.90, and $0.535 per gallon on tiered production)
- Adjusted alcohol content classification for still wines (14% to 16% ABV threshold)
- Lower rates for mead and low-alcohol wines
- Reduced rates for certain distilled spirits processing activities

#### 2. ASBC Beer Production and FET Calculation

**Statutory Authority:** 26 U.S.C. § 5051 (Imposition and rate of tax)⁵

**Annual Production:** 485,000 barrels

**Tax Rate Structure:**⁶
| Production Tier | Volume (barrels) | Rate per Barrel | Tax Liability |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| First 60,000 bbl (reduced rate) | 60,000 | $3.50 | $210,000 |
| Next 425,000 bbl (standard small brewer rate) | 425,000 | $16.00 | $6,800,000 |
| **Total Beer FET** | **485,000** | **Average: $14.45** | **$7,010,000** |

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Small brewer status: Production ≤ 2,000,000 barrels per calendar year⁷
- Reduced rate applies to first 60,000 barrels removed for consumption or sale
- Standard rate of $18.00/barrel applies to brewers producing > 6,000,000 barrels

**Current Status:** ASBC qualifies as a small brewer producing well below the 2M barrel threshold. As a standalone entity, ASBC receives the full benefit of both the $3.50 reduced rate (60,000 barrels) and the $16.00 rate (remaining production up to 6M barrels).

#### 3. ASBC Spirits Production and FET Calculation

**Statutory Authority:** 26 U.S.C. § 5001 (Imposition, rate, and attachment of tax)⁸

**Annual Production:** 100,000 proof gallons

**Tax Rate Structure:**⁹
| Production Tier | Volume (proof gallons) | Rate per PG | Tax Liability |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| First 100,000 PG (reduced rate) | 100,000 | $2.70 | $270,000 |
| **Total Spirits FET** | **100,000** | **$2.70** | **$270,000** |

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Small distiller status: Production ≤ 22,130,000 proof gallons per calendar year¹⁰
- Reduced rate of $2.70/PG applies to first 100,000 proof gallons
- Intermediate rate of $13.34/PG applies to proof gallons 100,001 through 22,130,000
- Standard rate of $13.50/PG applies to production > 22,130,000 proof gallons

**Current Status:** ASBC's spirits production of 100,000 proof gallons falls entirely within the reduced rate tier. As a standalone small distiller, ASBC realizes a tax savings of $1,064,000 annually compared to the standard rate [($13.34 - $2.70) × 100,000 = $1,064,000].

#### 4. ASBC Wine Production and FET Calculation

**Statutory Authority:** 26 U.S.C. § 5041 (Imposition and rate of tax - Wine)¹¹

**Annual Production:** 28,530 gallons (mead)

**Mead Classification:** Mead is taxed as wine under § 5041. The specific rate depends on alcohol content:
- Still wines ≤ 16% ABV: $1.07/gallon (base rate)¹²
- Tax credits apply to reduce effective rate for small producers

**Tax Calculation (assuming ≤ 16% ABV mead):**¹³
| Production Tier | Volume (gallons) | Gross Rate | Tax Credit | Net Rate | Tax Liability |
|----------------|------------------|------------|------------|----------|---------------|
| First 28,530 gal | 28,530 | $1.07/gal | $1.00/gal¹⁴ | $0.07/gal | $1,997 |
| **Total Wine FET** | **28,530** | | | **Effective: $0.07** | **$1,997** |

**Note:** Wine tax credits are structured as follows:
- $1.00 per gallon on first 30,000 gallons
- $0.90 per gallon on next 100,000 gallons (gallons 30,001-130,000)
- $0.535 per gallon on next 620,000 gallons (gallons 130,001-750,000)

Since ASBC produces only 28,530 gallons of mead, the entire production receives the $1.00/gallon credit, reducing the effective rate from $1.07 to $0.07 per gallon.

**Controlled Group Issue for Wine:** Unlike beer and spirits, wine tax credits are subject to controlled group limitations, but the impact is less severe given ASBC's small wine production volume.¹⁵

#### 5. ASBC Total Annual FET Obligation (Pre-Acquisition)

| Product Category | Annual Tax Liability |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Beer (485,000 bbl) | $7,010,000 |
| Spirits (100,000 PG) | $270,000 |
| Wine/Mead (28,530 gal) | $1,997 |
| **Total Annual FET** | **$7,281,997** |

**Rounded for Planning Purposes:** $7,310,527 (per user context, which may reflect higher wine calculation methodology)

**Payment Frequency:** Semi-monthly (every 14 days) per 27 CFR § 25.164¹⁶

### B. Controlled Group Rules and Definition

#### 1. IRC § 1563 Controlled Group Framework (Modified for Alcohol FET)

**General Rule:** IRC § 1563 defines "controlled group of corporations" for purposes of various tax provisions.¹⁷ For alcohol Federal Excise Tax purposes, Congress modified the standard § 1563 definition by lowering the ownership threshold from "at least 80%" to "more than 50%."¹⁸

**Beer Controlled Group Definition (26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(5)):**¹⁹
> "The term 'controlled group' has the meaning assigned to it by subsection (a) of section 1563, except that **'more than 50 percent'** shall be substituted for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears in such subsection."

**Spirits Controlled Group Definition (26 U.S.C. § 5001(c)(3)):**²⁰
> "The term 'controlled group' shall have the meaning given such term by subsection (a) of section 1563, except that **'more than 50 percent'** shall be substituted for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears in such subsection."

**Critical Distinction:** The 50% threshold is significantly lower than the 80% standard used for most corporate tax purposes (e.g., consolidated returns, accumulated earnings tax, etc.). This makes controlled group status much easier to trigger in the alcohol industry.

#### 2. Types of Controlled Groups Under Modified § 1563(a)

**Parent-Subsidiary Controlled Group:**²¹
- One or more chains of corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation
- Common parent must own > 50% (voting power or value) of at least one other corporation
- Each corporation (except common parent) must have > 50% of its stock owned by other members

**Brother-Sister Controlled Group:**²²
- Two or more corporations where five or fewer persons (individuals, estates, or trusts) own:
  - > 50% of voting power or value of each corporation (modified from 80%), AND
  - More than 50% identical ownership (considering each person's ownership only to extent identical across all corporations)

**Combined Group:**²³
- Three or more corporations each of which is member of parent-subsidiary or brother-sister group
- At least one corporation is common parent and also member of brother-sister group

**Application to Non-Corporations:**²⁴
- Controlled group principles apply to partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietorships
- If one entity maintains > 50% control over group including non-corporate entities, all members treated as single taxpayer for FET purposes

#### 3. Attribution Rules (26 CFR § 1.1563-3)

**Stock Ownership Attribution:**²⁵
- **From family members:** Stock owned by spouse, children, grandchildren, and parents attributed to individual
- **From partnerships:** Stock owned by partnership attributed proportionately to partners
- **From estates/trusts:** Stock owned by estate/trust attributed to beneficiaries
- **From corporations:** Stock owned by corporation attributed to shareholders owning ≥ 5% of corporation

**Impact on Control Determination:** Attribution rules can create controlled group status even when direct ownership is below 50%. For example, if ABP CEO owns 30% of ASBC directly and spouse owns 25%, attributed ownership = 55%, potentially triggering controlled group status.

#### 4. Controlled Group Impact on FET Reduced Rates

**Beer (26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(2) and (5)):**²⁶
> "In the case of a controlled group, the 6,000,000 barrel quantity [eligible for $16 rate vs. $18 rate] and the 2,000,000 barrel quantity [small brewer eligibility threshold] shall be applied to the controlled group, and the **60,000 barrel quantity [eligible for $3.50 rate] shall be apportioned among the brewers who are members of such group**."

**Translation:** All breweries in the controlled group must **share a single 60,000-barrel allotment** eligible for the $3.50/barrel rate. Any barrels beyond this shared allotment are taxed at $16.00/barrel (assuming group produces < 6M barrels total).

**Spirits (26 U.S.C. § 5001(c)(2) and (3)):**²⁷
> "In the case of a controlled group, the proof gallon quantities [100,000 PG at $2.70 and 22,130,000 PG at $13.34] shall be applied to the controlled group and apportioned among the distilled spirits operations who are members of such group."

**Translation:** All distilleries in the controlled group must **share a single 100,000 proof gallon allotment** eligible for the $2.70/PG rate. Production beyond this shared allotment is taxed at $13.34/PG (or $13.50/PG if group exceeds 22.13M PG).

#### 5. Franchise/License Aggregation Rule ("Single Taxpayer" Provision)

**Beer Provision (26 U.S.C. § 5051(a)(5)(C)):**²⁸
> "Two or more entities (whether or not under common control) that produce beer **under a license, franchise, or other arrangement** shall be treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of the application of this subsection."

**Spirits Provision (26 U.S.C. § 5001(c)(3)(B)):**²⁹
> "Two or more entities (whether or not under common control) that produce or process distilled spirits **under a license, franchise, or other arrangement** shall be treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of [reduced rate provisions]."

**Policy Rationale:** Congress enacted these provisions to prevent circumvention of controlled group rules through contract brewing/distilling arrangements. A large producer cannot evade aggregation by licensing production to nominally independent entities.

**Application to Project Bacchus:** If ASBC produces beer or spirits under any licensing or franchise arrangement with ABP (or ABP subsidiaries), the entities would be aggregated even without meeting the >50% ownership test. Post-acquisition, this provision is redundant because ABP will own ASBC directly.

### C. Post-Acquisition Controlled Group Analysis

#### 1. Controlled Group Formation Upon ABP's Acquisition of ASBC

**Triggering Event:** When ABP acquires ASBC (assuming > 50% ownership), ASBC immediately becomes part of ABP's controlled group for FET purposes, effective on the date of closing.³⁰

**Aggregation Consequences:**
- All breweries owned > 50% by ABP = single controlled group for beer FET
- All distilleries owned > 50% by ABP = single controlled group for spirits FET
- Group must share single 60,000-barrel reduced rate allotment (beer)
- Group must share single 100,000 proof gallon reduced rate allotment (spirits)

**Timing of Impact:** FET is imposed when beer/spirits are "removed" from the brewery/distillery for consumption or sale.³¹ Controlled group status is determined based on ownership at time of removal. Therefore:
- Removals before closing → ASBC treated as standalone (full reduced rates)
- Removals after closing → ASBC treated as controlled group member (shared reduced rates)

#### 2. Hypothetical ABP Holdings (Modeling Scenario)

**User Instruction:** Model impact assuming ABP owns the following beverage alcohol operations:

| Entity | Product | Annual Production |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **ASBC (Target)** | Beer | 485,000 barrels |
| | Spirits | 100,000 proof gallons |
| | Wine (mead) | 28,530 gallons |
| **Brewery A** | Beer | 120,000 barrels |
| **Brewery B** | Beer | 80,000 barrels |
| **Distillery C** | Spirits | 80,000 proof gallons |

**Controlled Group Aggregated Production:**
- **Total Beer:** 685,000 barrels (ASBC 485K + Brewery A 120K + Brewery B 80K)
- **Total Spirits:** 180,000 proof gallons (ASBC 100K + Distillery C 80K)

**Small Producer Eligibility:**
- Beer: 685,000 barrels < 2,000,000 threshold → **Group qualifies as small brewer**³²
- Spirits: 180,000 PG < 22,130,000 threshold → **Group qualifies as small distiller**³³
- Result: Controlled group remains eligible for reduced rates, but must apportion limited quantities among members

### D. Beer FET Assignment Scenarios (60,000 Barrel Reduced Rate Allocation)

#### Scenario 1: Optimal Assignment (All 60,000 Barrels to ASBC)

**Allocation Strategy:** Assign entire 60,000-barrel reduced rate allotment to ASBC (highest-volume producer).

**ASBC Beer FET Calculation:**
- First 60,000 bbl @ $3.50/bbl = $210,000
- Next 425,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = $6,800,000
- **ASBC Total Beer FET: $7,010,000** (no change from standalone)

**Brewery A Beer FET Calculation:**
- All 120,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = **$1,920,000**

**Brewery B Beer FET Calculation:**
- All 80,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = **$1,280,000**

**Controlled Group Total Beer FET:**
- ASBC: $7,010,000
- Brewery A: $1,920,000
- Brewery B: $1,280,000
- **Group Total: $10,210,000**

**ASBC FET Impact:** $0 increase (maintains standalone rate)

**Rationale:** Assigning reduced rate to highest-volume producer maximizes total tax savings for the controlled group by avoiding the $12.50/barrel rate differential ($16.00 - $3.50) on as many barrels as possible.

#### Scenario 2: Proportional Assignment (Based on Production Share)

**Allocation Formula:** Each brewery receives reduced rate barrels proportional to its share of group production.

**Production Shares:**
- ASBC: 485,000 / 685,000 = 70.80%
- Brewery A: 120,000 / 685,000 = 17.52%
- Brewery B: 80,000 / 685,000 = 11.68%

**Reduced Rate Allocation:**
- ASBC: 60,000 × 70.80% = **42,482 barrels @ $3.50**
- Brewery A: 60,000 × 17.52% = **10,511 barrels @ $3.50**
- Brewery B: 60,000 × 11.68% = **7,007 barrels @ $3.50**

**ASBC Beer FET Calculation:**
- First 42,482 bbl @ $3.50/bbl = $148,687
- Next 442,518 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = $7,080,288
- **ASBC Total Beer FET: $7,228,975**
- **Increase from Standalone: $218,975** (3.1% increase)

**Brewery A Beer FET Calculation:**
- First 10,511 bbl @ $3.50/bbl = $36,789
- Next 109,489 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = $1,751,824
- **Brewery A Total: $1,788,613**

**Brewery B Beer FET Calculation:**
- First 7,007 bbl @ $3.50/bbl = $24,525
- Next 72,993 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = $1,167,888
- **Brewery B Total: $1,192,413**

**Controlled Group Total Beer FET:**
- ASBC: $7,228,975
- Brewery A: $1,788,613
- Brewery B: $1,192,413
- **Group Total: $10,210,001** (rounding difference)

**ASBC FET Impact:** **+$218,975 annually** (compared to standalone)

**Equity Consideration:** Proportional allocation treats all group members "fairly" based on production volume, but results in suboptimal tax efficiency for the group. Many controlled groups nevertheless adopt this approach to avoid internal disputes about allocation methodology.

#### Scenario 3: Worst-Case Assignment (All 60,000 Barrels to Smallest Producer)

**Allocation Strategy:** Assign entire 60,000-barrel reduced rate allotment to Brewery B (smallest producer - 80,000 barrels).

**ASBC Beer FET Calculation:**
- All 485,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = **$7,760,000**
- **Increase from Standalone: $750,000** (10.7% increase)

**Brewery A Beer FET Calculation:**
- All 120,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = **$1,920,000**

**Brewery B Beer FET Calculation:**
- First 60,000 bbl @ $3.50/bbl = $210,000
- Next 20,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = $320,000
- **Brewery B Total: $530,000**

**Controlled Group Total Beer FET:**
- ASBC: $7,760,000
- Brewery A: $1,920,000
- Brewery B: $530,000
- **Group Total: $10,210,000**

**ASBC FET Impact:** **+$750,000 annually** (compared to standalone)

**Analysis:** This allocation wastes tax savings potential. Brewery B only produces 80,000 barrels, so 20,000 barrels of the reduced rate allotment are "unused" (Brewery B cannot use reduced rate on barrels it doesn't produce). The group pays the same total FET as Scenario 1, but ASBC bears disproportionate burden.

**Likelihood:** This allocation would only occur if there were non-tax business reasons to favor Brewery B (e.g., financial distress at Brewery B requiring cash flow support, or contractual obligations to certain allocation methodology).

#### Scenario 4: Strategic Split (Balance Tax Efficiency and Equity)

**Allocation Strategy:** Assign reduced rate to optimize group tax position while providing some benefit to all members.

**Example Allocation:**
- ASBC: 50,000 barrels @ $3.50
- Brewery A: 10,000 barrels @ $3.50
- Brewery B: 0 barrels @ $3.50 (all production at $16 rate)

**ASBC Beer FET Calculation:**
- First 50,000 bbl @ $3.50/bbl = $175,000
- Next 435,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = $6,960,000
- **ASBC Total: $7,135,000**
- **Increase from Standalone: $125,000** (1.8% increase)

**Brewery A Beer FET Calculation:**
- First 10,000 bbl @ $3.50/bbl = $35,000
- Next 110,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = $1,760,000
- **Brewery A Total: $1,795,000**

**Brewery B Beer FET Calculation:**
- All 80,000 bbl @ $16.00/bbl = **$1,280,000**

**Controlled Group Total Beer FET:**
- ASBC: $7,135,000
- Brewery A: $1,795,000
- Brewery B: $1,280,000
- **Group Total: $10,210,000**

**ASBC FET Impact:** **+$125,000 annually**

**Strategic Rationale:** ABP might adopt this allocation to:
1. Minimize ASBC's FET increase (preserves EBITDA for transaction valuation)
2. Provide some reduced rate benefit to Brewery A (operational efficiency incentive)
3. Maintain flexibility to adjust allocation annually based on production changes

#### Summary Table: Beer FET Assignment Scenarios

| Scenario | ASBC Reduced Rate Barrels | ASBC Annual Beer FET | FET Increase vs. Standalone | Group Total Beer FET |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Current (Standalone)** | 60,000 | $7,010,000 | Baseline | $7,010,000 |
| **Scenario 1 (Optimal)** | 60,000 | $7,010,000 | $0 | $10,210,000 |
| **Scenario 2 (Proportional)** | 42,482 | $7,228,975 | **+$218,975** | $10,210,001 |
| **Scenario 3 (Worst Case)** | 0 | $7,760,000 | **+$750,000** | $10,210,000 |
| **Scenario 4 (Strategic)** | 50,000 | $7,135,000 | **+$125,000** | $10,210,000 |

**Key Insight:** The controlled group's **total beer FET remains constant at $10,210,000** regardless of allocation strategy (assuming same production volumes). The allocation decision affects only the **distribution of tax burden among group members**, not the total group tax liability.

### E. Spirits FET Assignment Scenarios (100,000 Proof Gallon Reduced Rate Allocation)

#### Scenario 1: Optimal Assignment (All 100,000 PG to ASBC)

**Allocation Strategy:** Assign entire 100,000 proof gallon reduced rate allotment to ASBC (highest-volume distiller).

**ASBC Spirits FET Calculation:**
- First 100,000 PG @ $2.70/PG = **$270,000** (no change from standalone)

**Distillery C Spirits FET Calculation:**
- All 80,000 PG @ $13.34/PG = **$1,067,200**

**Controlled Group Total Spirits FET:**
- ASBC: $270,000
- Distillery C: $1,067,200
- **Group Total: $1,337,200**

**ASBC Spirits FET Impact:** $0 increase (maintains standalone rate)

**Rationale:** Since ASBC produces exactly 100,000 proof gallons (equal to the full reduced rate allotment), assigning the entire allotment to ASBC maximizes tax efficiency. Distillery C's 80,000 PG production is taxed at $13.34/PG, still well below the $13.50/PG standard rate for large distillers.

#### Scenario 2: Proportional Assignment (Based on Production Share)

**Allocation Formula:** Each distillery receives reduced rate proof gallons proportional to its share of group production.

**Production Shares:**
- ASBC: 100,000 / 180,000 = 55.56%
- Distillery C: 80,000 / 180,000 = 44.44%

**Reduced Rate Allocation:**
- ASBC: 100,000 × 55.56% = **55,556 PG @ $2.70**
- Distillery C: 100,000 × 44.44% = **44,444 PG @ $2.70**

**ASBC Spirits FET Calculation:**
- First 55,556 PG @ $2.70/PG = $150,001
- Next 44,444 PG @ $13.34/PG = $592,883
- **ASBC Total Spirits FET: $742,884**
- **Increase from Standalone: $472,884** (175% increase)

**Distillery C Spirits FET Calculation:**
- First 44,444 PG @ $2.70/PG = $119,999
- Next 35,556 PG @ $13.34/PG = $474,317
- **Distillery C Total: $594,316**

**Controlled Group Total Spirits FET:**
- ASBC: $742,884
- Distillery C: $594,316
- **Group Total: $1,337,200**

**ASBC Spirits FET Impact:** **+$472,884 annually** (compared to standalone)

**Analysis:** Proportional allocation creates substantial FET increase for ASBC. The $10.64/PG rate differential ($13.34 - $2.70) on 44,444 proof gallons costs ASBC nearly $473,000 annually. This represents a **70% increase** in spirits FET for ASBC.

#### Scenario 3: Full Assignment to Distillery C (Worst Case for ASBC)

**Allocation Strategy:** Assign entire 100,000 proof gallon reduced rate allotment to Distillery C.

**ASBC Spirits FET Calculation:**
- All 100,000 PG @ $13.34/PG = **$1,334,000**
- **Increase from Standalone: $1,064,000** (394% increase)

**Distillery C Spirits FET Calculation:**
- First 80,000 PG @ $2.70/PG = $216,000
- **Distillery C Total: $216,000**
- (Note: 20,000 PG of reduced rate allotment unused because Distillery C only produces 80,000 PG)

**Controlled Group Total Spirits FET:**
- ASBC: $1,334,000
- Distillery C: $216,000
- **Group Total: $1,550,000**

**ASBC Spirits FET Impact:** **+$1,064,000 annually** (compared to standalone)

**Group Inefficiency:** This allocation is tax-inefficient for the controlled group. Total group spirits FET increases to $1,550,000 (vs. $1,337,200 under optimal/proportional allocation). The group loses $212,800 annually due to wasted reduced rate allocation [20,000 unused PG × $10.64 differential = $212,800].

**Likelihood:** This allocation would be irrational from a group tax optimization perspective. It would only occur due to contractual mandate, regulatory misunderstanding, or intentional benefit shifting to Distillery C.

#### Summary Table: Spirits FET Assignment Scenarios

| Scenario | ASBC Reduced Rate PG | ASBC Annual Spirits FET | FET Increase vs. Standalone | Group Total Spirits FET |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Current (Standalone)** | 100,000 | $270,000 | Baseline | $270,000 |
| **Scenario 1 (Optimal)** | 100,000 | $270,000 | $0 | $1,337,200 |
| **Scenario 2 (Proportional)** | 55,556 | $742,884 | **+$472,884** | $1,337,200 |
| **Scenario 3 (Worst Case)** | 0 | $1,334,000 | **+$1,064,000** | $1,550,000 |

**Key Insight:** Unlike beer (where total group FET is constant), spirits FET allocation strategy can affect **both** ASBC's individual tax liability **and** the group's total tax liability. Scenario 3 costs the group an additional $212,800 annually compared to optimal allocation.

### F. Combined FET Impact: All Products

#### Consolidated FET Impact Analysis (ASBC Only)

Combining beer and spirits FET scenarios to assess total ASBC FET increase under various allocation strategies:

| Allocation Strategy | Beer FET | Spirits FET | Wine FET | **Total ASBC FET** | **Increase vs. Standalone** |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Standalone (Pre-Acquisition)** | $7,010,000 | $270,000 | $1,997 | **$7,281,997** | **Baseline** |
| **Optimal (All to ASBC)** | $7,010,000 | $270,000 | $1,997 | **$7,281,997** | **$0** |
| **Proportional** | $7,228,975 | $742,884 | $1,997 | **$7,973,856** | **+$691,859** |
| **Worst Case** | $7,760,000 | $1,334,000 | $1,997 | **$9,095,997** | **+$1,814,000** |
| **Strategic (Beer 50K/Spirits 100K)** | $7,135,000 | $270,000 | $1,997 | **$7,406,997** | **+$125,000** |

**Note:** Wine FET assumed constant at $1,997 across scenarios due to ASBC's small production volume (28,530 gallons) and likely continued eligibility for full tax credit even in controlled group context.

#### Critical Findings

**1. Allocation Flexibility Creates Wide Outcome Range**
- Best case: $0 FET increase for ASBC
- Worst case: $1,814,000 annual FET increase (25% above standalone FET)
- Most likely (proportional): $691,859 annual FET increase (9.5% above standalone)

**2. Spirits FET Drives Greatest Risk**
- Spirits FET increase under proportional allocation ($472,884) represents 68% of total FET increase
- ASBC's spirits business is most vulnerable to controlled group impact
- Losing 44,444 PG of reduced rate eligibility costs ASBC $10.64/PG differential

**3. Transaction Valuation Implications**
- ASBC's pre-acquisition EBITDA implicitly reflects $7.28M FET burden
- Post-acquisition FET increase of $692K (proportional scenario) reduces ASBC's cash flow by 10%
- If ABP valued ASBC at 12× EBITDA, a $692K annual cash flow reduction implies ~$8.3M valuation decrease
- Purchase price adjustment negotiations should address FET allocation methodology

**4. Working Capital Impact**
- Semi-monthly FET payment obligation (27 CFR § 25.164)³⁴
- Proportional allocation scenario increases ASBC's semi-monthly FET payments by ~$28,800 per period
- Requires increased bonded warehouse working capital or accelerated cash conversion cycle

### G. FET Payment Timing, Penalties, and Compliance Requirements

#### 1. Semi-Monthly Payment Regime

**Regulatory Authority:** 27 CFR § 25.164 (beer), 27 CFR § 19.235 (spirits), 27 CFR § 24.271 (wine)³⁵

**Standard Payment Period (Semimonthly):**³⁶
- **Period 1:** 1st day through 15th day of month
- **Period 2:** 16th day through last day of month
- **Payment Due:** 14th day after last day of return period

**Example:**
- Production removed January 1-15 → Tax return and payment due January 29
- Production removed January 16-31 → Tax return and payment due February 14

**Deferred Payment Requirement:** Brewers/distillers paying tax on deferred basis must use semimonthly return periods unless they qualify for quarterly or annual filing.³⁷

**Alternative Filing Frequencies:**³⁸
- **Quarterly:** Taxpayers with ≤ $50,000 annual FET liability
- **Annual:** Taxpayers with ≤ $1,000 annual FET liability

**ASBC Status:** With $7.28M annual FET, ASBC must file semimonthly (26 returns per year). Post-acquisition controlled group status does not change filing frequency for ASBC operations.

#### 2. Late Payment Penalties

**Statutory Authority:** 26 U.S.C. § 5684 (penalties relating to payment and collection of liquor taxes)³⁹

**Initial Penalty (IRC § 5684(a)):**
- **5% of unpaid tax** for failure to pay at prescribed time
- Assessed in addition to any other penalties under Title 26

**Cumulative Failure-to-File Penalty:**⁴⁰
- 5% of unpaid tax for each month or part of month return is late
- Maximum: 25% of unpaid tax

**Cumulative Failure-to-Pay Penalty:**⁴¹
- 0.5% (½ of 1%) of unpaid tax for each month or part of month tax remains unpaid
- Maximum: 25% of unpaid tax

**Interest on Underpayments (26 U.S.C. § 6601):**⁴²
- Accrues from due date until payment date
- Rate: Federal short-term rate + 3 percentage points (compounded daily)
- Currently approximately 8% annually (as of Q4 2024)

**Example Penalty Calculation (ASBC Semimonthly Payment):**
Assume ASBC misses February 14 payment deadline for January 16-31 production:
- FET due: ~$281,000 (1/26th of annual $7.28M FET)
- Initial penalty (5%): $14,050
- If unpaid for 3 months:
  - Failure-to-pay penalty: $281,000 × 0.5% × 3 = $4,215
  - Interest (8% annual): $281,000 × 8% × (90/365) = $5,536
  - **Total penalty + interest: $23,801** (8.5% of original tax)

#### 3. Bond Forfeiture Risk

**Bonding Requirement:** Brewers and distillers must post surety bonds to cover potential FET liabilities unless exempt.⁴³

**Current ASBC Bonds (Per User Context):**
- Brewery operations: $150,000 × 3 locations = $450,000
- Distilled spirits plant (DSP): $250,000
- Winery: $50,000
- **Total bonds: $750,000**

**Bond Coverage Calculation (27 CFR § 25.93 for breweries):**⁴⁴
- Bond amount based on maximum tax liability in peak production period
- Minimum bond: $1,000
- Maximum bond required: Generally tied to 6 months' peak FET liability

**Adequacy Analysis:**
- ASBC semimonthly FET: ~$281,000
- 6-month FET: ~$3,640,000
- Current brewery bonds: $450,000 (12.4% of 6-month exposure)

**Bond Exemption (27 CFR § 25.91(e)):**⁴⁵
- Brewers paying tax on deferred basis are **not required to provide bond** if:
  - Eligible for annual or quarterly return period (i.e., ≤ $50,000 annual FET)
  - Or participating in TTB's bond exemption program for low-risk taxpayers

**ASBC Status:** ASBC does not qualify for bond exemption due to $7.28M annual FET (far exceeds $50,000 threshold). ASBC must maintain bonds or risk immediate suspension of operations.

#### 4. Bond Transfer Issues in Acquisition

**Regulatory Framework:** 27 CFR § 25.72 (brewery change in proprietorship), 27 CFR § 19.143 (DSP change in proprietorship)⁴⁶

**Change in Proprietorship Rule:**⁴⁷
> "The successor brewer shall, before beginning operations, qualify in the same manner as the proprietor of a new brewery. The successor brewer shall file a new notice and bond in his or her own name, except that the successor brewer is not required to file a bond if the brewer is exempt from bond requirements."

**Implications for Project Bacchus:**
1. **New Bonds Required:** ABP (as successor proprietor) must file new TTB Form 5130.22 (brewer's bond) and TTB Form 5110.56 (DSP bond) in ABP's name
2. **Surety Consent:** ASBC's current surety must either:
   - Consent to extend bond coverage to ABP (via continuation certificate), OR
   - Terminate existing bonds (requiring ABP to obtain new bonds from different surety)
3. **Operations Suspension Risk:** If new bonds not in place before closing, ASBC must cease all beer/spirits production and removal until TTB approves new bonds
4. **Timing:** TTB recommends filing new qualification documents (including bonds) at least **60 days before** anticipated closing date⁴⁸

**Treasury Circular 570 Compliance:**⁴⁹
- All bonds must be issued by corporate surety approved by U.S. Department of Treasury
- List published annually in Treasury Circular 570 (also available at https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/surety-bonds/)
- Major approved sureties include: Travelers, Liberty Mutual, CNA, Hartford, Zurich

**Bond Procurement Strategy for ABP:**
- **Option 1 (Preferred):** Negotiate consent of surety on existing ASBC bonds to extend coverage through closing and transition period (30-90 days), then obtain new ABP bonds
- **Option 2:** Procure new ABP bonds pre-closing, submit to TTB with change-in-proprietorship applications, obtain TTB approval before closing
- **Option 3:** Negotiate escrow holdback from purchase price to cover bond procurement and potential interim shutdown period if TTB approval delayed

### H. Allocation Election Procedures and TTB Notification

#### 1. Controlled Group Member Agreement on Allocation

**Statutory Requirement:** IRC § 5051(a)(5)(B) (beer) and § 5001(c)(2)(B) (spirits) require controlled group members to "apportion" reduced rate quantities among themselves.⁵⁰

**TTB Regulatory Guidance:**⁵¹
- Controlled groups have flexibility to allocate reduced rates in any manner members agree upon
- No requirement for proportional or "fair" allocation
- Allocation can change annually (or more frequently)
- Each member must maintain records showing allocation methodology

**Documentation Requirements (27 CFR § 25.152(e)):**⁵²
> "Each brewery should keep records indicating how the quantities will be apportioned among the breweries and make those records available to TTB officers upon request."

**Best Practice:** Execute written "Controlled Group FET Allocation Agreement" among all controlled group members specifying:
- Identification of all group members
- Allocation of 60,000-barrel reduced beer rate
- Allocation of 100,000 proof gallon reduced spirits rate
- Effective period (calendar year)
- Amendment procedures
- Signatures of authorized representatives

#### 2. TTB Notification (Annual Notice)

**Beer Notification Requirement (27 CFR § 25.167):**⁵³
> "Breweries who produce no more than 2,000,000 barrels and apportion the $3.50 reduced rate of tax must also notify TTB about the apportionment, either by providing the annual notice described in 27 CFR 25.167 or by incorporating the information into the Brewer's Notice."

**Required Information in Annual Notice:**
- List of all breweries in controlled group
- Address and employer identification number (EIN) for each
- Allocated amount of reduced rate barrels to each brewery
- Certification that allocation totals 60,000 barrels or less

**Filing Deadline:** Before first removal of beer at reduced rate in calendar year (typically filed in December for following year)

**Spirits Notification:** Similar requirements apply under 27 CFR § 19.238 for distilled spirits operations.⁵⁴

**Penalty for Failure to Notify:** TTB may disallow reduced rates and assess tax at standard rate ($18/barrel for beer, $13.50/PG for spirits) plus penalties and interest.

#### 3. Mid-Year Allocation Changes

**Permissibility:** TTB regulations allow controlled groups to change allocation during calendar year based on actual production levels.⁵⁵

**Example Application to Project Bacchus:**
- Q1 2025 (pre-acquisition): ASBC operates standalone, uses full 15,000 barrels reduced rate (60K ÷ 4 quarters)
- Q2 2025 (post-acquisition in April): ABP closes on ASBC in April
- For May-December removals: ASBC joins ABP controlled group, allocation revised

**Procedure for Mid-Year Change:**
1. File amended TTB Form 5130.10 (Brewer's Notice) reflecting controlled group membership
2. Submit updated Controlled Group Allocation Notice
3. Maintain contemporaneous documentation of allocation change
4. Adjust tax rates on TTB Form 5000.24 (Brewer's Report of Operations) for all affected periods

**Quarterly Removal Tracking:** TTB Industry Circular 2022-3 clarifies that controlled group allocation applies to total removals during calendar year, not quarterly.⁵⁶ Groups can "front-load" reduced rate allocations in early quarters if desired.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **FET Increase $500K-$1.8M** | HIGH | Certain | Negotiate optimal allocation in SPA; secure ABP commitment to favorable allocation |
| **Bonding Transfer Delays** | HIGH | Probable | File TTB change-in-proprietorship applications 60+ days pre-closing; obtain surety consent letters |
| **Operations Suspension** | CRITICAL | Possible | Obtain TTB approval before closing; consider escrow holdback for bond procurement |
| **Proportional Allocation Imposed** | MEDIUM | Probable | Document tax-optimized allocation strategy; negotiate allocation governance rights |
| **ABP Portfolio Unknown** | HIGH | Certain | Demand full disclosure of ABP's existing breweries/distilleries in due diligence |
| **Semi-Monthly Cash Flow Strain** | MEDIUM | Certain (if proportional) | Adjust working capital targets in SPA; increase revolver availability |
| **Late Payment Penalties** | MEDIUM | Possible | Implement automated FET payment system; assign dedicated tax compliance officer |
| **Wine Credit Aggregation** | LOW | Certain | Minimal impact given ASBC's 28,530-gallon production (well within 30K tier) |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

**1. ABP's Existing Beverage Alcohol Portfolio**
- **Unknown Variable:** User instruction models "hypothetical" ABP holdings (Brewery A, Brewery B, Distillery C)
- **Action Required:** Demand complete list of all breweries/distilleries owned >50% by ABP in due diligence request list
- **Information Needed:**
  - Entity names and EINs
  - Annual production volumes (barrels beer, proof gallons spirits)
  - Current FET allocation methodology
  - TTB permit numbers and facility addresses
- **Impact:** Without actual ABP portfolio data, FET modeling scenarios remain illustrative only

**2. Current Allocation Governance at ABP**
- **Question:** How does ABP currently allocate reduced FET rates among existing controlled group members?
- **Precedent Risk:** If ABP uses proportional allocation as standard practice across all subsidiaries, ASBC will face proportional treatment (+$692K FET)
- **Negotiation Leverage:** SPA should explicitly address FET allocation methodology; consider representation that ASBC will receive "no less favorable" allocation than any other group member on per-barrel/per-PG basis

**3. Timing of Closing Relative to Calendar Year**
- **Q1 Closing (Jan-Mar):** ASBC loses most of calendar year 2025 reduced rate eligibility
- **Q4 Closing (Oct-Dec):** ASBC retains most of 2025 standalone reduced rates; controlled group impact deferred to 2026
- **Modeling Assumption:** User context does not specify closing quarter
- **Recommendation:** If closing date flexible, negotiate Q4 timing to defer FET increase by 9-12 months

**4. Existing ASBC Bond Surety Relationships**
- **Unknown:** Identity of sureties on current $750K bonds
- **Risk:** Some sureties categorically refuse to extend bonds through ownership changes (requires new bonds from different surety)
- **Action Required:**
  - Identify all current sureties (likely listed on TTB permits)
  - Contact sureties to confirm consent-to-transfer availability
  - Obtain preliminary bond quotes from 3+ Treasury Circular 570 approved sureties
  - Budget $50K-$100K for bond procurement costs (premiums typically 1-3% of bond amount annually)

**5. State Excise Tax Controlled Group Rules**
- **Scope Limitation:** This analysis addresses **federal** excise taxes only
- **State Variation:** Many states impose separate excise taxes on beer/spirits with their own controlled group rules:
  - California: Beer $0.20/gallon; spirits $3.30/gallon
  - New York: Beer $0.14/gallon; spirits $6.44/gallon
  - Texas: Beer $0.20/gallon; spirits $2.40/gallon
- **Risk:** State controlled group rules may differ from federal (e.g., different ownership thresholds, allocation rules)
- **Action Required:** Separate state tax analysis for all states where ASBC maintains inventory, production, or distribution operations

**6. Contract Brewing/Distilling Arrangements**
- **Single Taxpayer Rule:** IRC § 5051(a)(5)(C) and § 5001(c)(3)(B) aggregate entities producing under "license, franchise, or other arrangement"
- **Question:** Does ASBC engage in contract brewing/distilling for third parties, or does ASBC contract with third parties to produce ASBC-branded products?
- **Risk:** Existing contract arrangements may already create controlled group-like FET aggregation
- **Due Diligence:** Review all production agreements, licensing agreements, and co-packing arrangements

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

#### Quantified FET Exposure Range

**Scenario Analysis Summary:**
| Scenario | Annual FET Increase | 5-Year NPV (8% discount) | 10-Year NPV (8% discount) |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Optimal Allocation** | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Strategic Allocation** | $125,000 | $498,530 | $838,438 |
| **Proportional Allocation** | $691,859 | $2,760,425 | $4,640,832 |
| **Worst Case Allocation** | $1,814,000 | $7,237,208 | $12,164,872 |

**Base Case Assumption (Proportional):** $692K annual FET increase × 8.0 EBITDA multiple = **$5.5M valuation reduction**

**Purchase Price Adjustment Modeling:**
- If SPA includes working capital adjustment provisions, increased FET represents normalized ongoing cash outflow
- Buyer may argue for $5.5M-$12M purchase price reduction depending on allocation assumptions
- Seller should resist proportional allocation assumption; argue for optimal allocation commitment

#### Transaction Structuring to Avoid Controlled Group Status

**Threshold Question:** Can transaction be structured to keep ASBC below 50% ABP ownership, thus avoiding controlled group?

**Option 1: 49% Acquisition (Minority Investment)**
- ABP acquires 49% of ASBC equity
- ASBC remains controlled by existing shareholders (51%)
- **Result:** No controlled group (requires >50% ownership)⁵⁷
- **Drawback:** ABP lacks majority control; not true "acquisition"

**Option 2: Preferred Stock Structure**
- ABP acquires 100% of non-voting preferred stock (economic interest)
- Existing shareholders retain 100% voting common stock (control)
- **Analysis:** Controlled group status determined by "voting power or value"⁵⁸
- **Result:** ABP likely has >50% of "value" → controlled group still triggered
- **Drawback:** Ineffective for FET avoidance

**Option 3: Joint Venture Structure**
- ABP and sellers form 50-50 JV to own ASBC
- Each JV partner owns exactly 50% (voting and value)
- **Analysis:** Controlled group requires ">50%" not "≥50%"⁵⁹
- **Result:** Potentially avoids controlled group if structured precisely at 50%
- **Risk:** IRC § 1563 attribution rules may attribute JV partner ownership, creating >50% indirect ownership
- **Drawback:** Complex; uncertain tax treatment; sellers must remain invested

**Recommendation:** Structuring around controlled group status is **not advisable** for $1.2B acquisition. The FET exposure ($125K-$692K annually) is de minimis relative to transaction size (0.01%-0.06% of purchase price). Operational control and clean ownership structure outweigh minor FET savings.

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Controlled Group Formation is Certain Upon Closing**

When ABP acquires >50% of ASBC, ASBC immediately becomes part of ABP's controlled group for federal excise tax purposes. This triggers mandatory sharing of reduced FET rate allotments with all ABP-owned breweries and distilleries.

**2. FET Impact Range: $0 to $1.8M Annually (Depending on Allocation)**

ASBC's annual FET may increase by:
- **$0** if ABP assigns entire reduced rate allotments to ASBC (optimal allocation)
- **$125,000** under strategic allocation (50K beer barrels + 100K spirits PG to ASBC)
- **$691,859** under proportional allocation based on production share (most likely scenario)
- **$1,814,000** under worst-case allocation (all reduced rates assigned elsewhere)

**3. Spirits FET Presents Greater Risk Than Beer FET**

Under proportional allocation, ASBC's spirits FET increases by $472,884 (175% increase), while beer FET increases by only $218,975 (3.1% increase). The spirits business is disproportionately impacted due to ASBC's 100,000 proof gallon production exactly matching the full reduced rate allotment—meaning any loss of allocation directly converts production to the $13.34/PG higher rate.

**4. Total Controlled Group FET is Constant for Beer, Variable for Spirits**

Allocation strategy for beer affects only distribution of tax burden among group members (total remains $10.21M). However, for spirits, suboptimal allocation can increase **total group** FET by up to $212,800 annually if reduced rates are assigned to entities that cannot fully utilize them.

**5. ABP's Existing Portfolio is Critical Unknown Variable**

This analysis models hypothetical ABP holdings (Brewery A, Brewery B, Distillery C) per user instruction. Actual FET impact depends entirely on ABP's real portfolio, which must be disclosed in due diligence. If ABP owns larger breweries/distilleries than modeled, ASBC's FET exposure could be significantly different.

**6. Bond Transfer Requires 60+ Day Lead Time**

TTB change-in-proprietorship applications must include new bonds in ABP's name. Failure to obtain TTB approval before closing will force ASBC to suspend all production and removal operations until bonds are approved—potentially costing millions in lost production and customer relationships.

**7. FET Allocation is Flexible and Annually Revisable**

Controlled groups have complete discretion to allocate reduced FET rates in any manner members agree upon. Allocation can be revised annually (or even quarterly) based on production changes, financial performance, or strategic priorities. SPA should address governance of allocation decisions.

**8. Valuation Impact: $5.5M to $12M Purchase Price Reduction**

If ASBC faces proportional allocation (+$692K annual FET), the present value of this cash flow reduction over 10 years is $4.6M. Applying an 8× EBITDA multiple, the valuation impact is approximately **$5.5M**. Under worst-case allocation, valuation impact reaches **$12M+**.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### Immediate Actions (Pre-Signing)

**1. Demand Full Disclosure of ABP's Beverage Alcohol Portfolio**

Include in due diligence request list:
- Complete list of all breweries and distilleries owned >50% by ABP
- Annual production volumes (barrels beer, proof gallons spirits) for each facility
- Current controlled group FET allocation methodology and historical allocations (last 3 years)
- Copy of most recent Controlled Group Allocation Agreement and TTB annual notices
- Identification of any contract brewing/distilling arrangements that may trigger "single taxpayer" aggregation

**2. Model FET Impact Based on Actual ABP Portfolio**

Once ABP portfolio disclosed:
- Recalculate controlled group aggregated production
- Confirm continued eligibility for reduced rates (group must produce <2M barrels beer, <22.13M PG spirits)
- Assess proportional allocation impact based on ASBC's actual production share
- Quantify valuation adjustment for purchase price negotiations

**3. Negotiate FET Allocation Governance in Stock Purchase Agreement**

Proposed SPA provisions:
- **Representation:** ABP represents it currently uses [optimal/proportional/other] allocation methodology across controlled group
- **Covenant:** ABP covenants that for [3/5/indefinite] years post-closing, ASBC will receive allocation of reduced FET rates "no less favorable than any other controlled group member on a per-barrel and per-proof-gallon basis"
- **Working Capital Adjustment:** If allocation methodology results in FET increase >$X annually, working capital target will be increased by [amount] to fund higher semi-monthly payments
- **Consent Right:** Allocation changes affecting ASBC require [ASBC management/seller/board committee] consent

**4. Quantify Valuation Adjustment**

Work with financial advisors to model:
- Base case: Proportional allocation (+$692K annual FET)
- Downside case: Less favorable allocation (+$1M-$1.8M annual FET)
- Impact on ASBC EBITDA and cash flow
- Appropriate purchase price adjustment (recommend 8-10× multiplier on annual FET increase)

#### Pre-Closing Actions (45-60 Days Before Closing)

**5. Initiate TTB Change-in-Proprietorship Applications**

File with TTB:
- **TTB Form 5130.10** (Brewer's Notice) amendments for all 3 ASBC brewery locations
- **TTB Form 5110.41** (Registration of Distilled Spirits Plant) amendment for ASBC DSP
- **TTB Form 5120.36** (Winery Application) amendment for ASBC winery
- New bonds in ABP's name (or surety consent of continuation certificates)

**6. Obtain Surety Bonds for ABP**

- Contact ASBC's current sureties to request consent to extend bonds through ownership change
- If current sureties decline, obtain quotes from 3+ Treasury Circular 570 approved sureties
- Procure bonds totaling at least $750,000 (may need higher amounts based on ABP's total controlled group FET liability)
- Allow 30-45 days for underwriting and bond issuance

**7. Negotiate Closing Timing for FET Optimization**

If closing date is flexible:
- **Optimal:** Close in Q4 (October-December) to defer controlled group impact to following calendar year
- **Suboptimal:** Q1 closing (January-March) triggers controlled group for entire calendar year
- **Rationale:** FET allocation applies on calendar year basis; ASBC retains standalone reduced rates for all removals before closing date

#### Post-Closing Actions

**8. Execute Controlled Group FET Allocation Agreement**

Within 30 days post-closing:
- Draft formal allocation agreement among all ABP controlled group members
- Specify allocation of 60,000-barrel beer reduced rate and 100,000 proof gallon spirits reduced rate
- Allocate optimal amounts to ASBC (ideally full allotments)
- Obtain signatures from authorized representatives of all group members

**9. File TTB Annual Allocation Notices**

Before first removal at reduced rates (or before end of calendar year):
- File controlled group allocation notice with TTB per 27 CFR § 25.167 (beer) and § 19.238 (spirits)
- Include list of all group members, EINs, addresses, and allocated amounts
- Maintain copies for TTB audit defense

**10. Implement Enhanced FET Compliance Program**

- Designate responsible officer for FET compliance (likely ASBC CFO or tax director)
- Implement automated semi-monthly FET calculation and payment system
- Establish internal controls for production tracking and tax rate application
- Schedule quarterly reviews of allocation utilization (actual vs. budgeted production)

**11. Monitor for Mid-Year Allocation Adjustments**

- If actual production varies from budget, consider mid-year allocation revision
- TTB permits allocation changes during calendar year with proper documentation
- Reallocation may be advantageous if any controlled group member over/under-produces vs. plan

**12. Conduct State Excise Tax Analysis**

Separately analyze state excise tax implications in all states where ASBC operates:
- Identify states with controlled group rules for state excise taxes
- Calculate state tax impact of ABP acquisition
- File required notifications with state tax authorities (typically within 30 days of ownership change)

### C. Outstanding Questions for ABP

Before finalizing transaction, obtain answers to:

1. **Complete list of all breweries and distilleries in ABP controlled group** (names, locations, production volumes)?
2. **Current FET allocation methodology** used by ABP (proportional, optimal, or other)?
3. **Historical allocation patterns** over last 3 years—has ABP changed allocation methodology?
4. **Commitment to favorable allocation for ASBC** post-acquisition? Will ABP agree to contractual allocation commitment in SPA?
5. **ABP's total controlled group production**—does group remain under 2M barrels (beer) and 22.13M proof gallons (spirits) thresholds after adding ASBC?
6. **Existing bond procurement process** at ABP—does ABP have master bonding facilities with major sureties, or does each subsidiary obtain separate bonds?
7. **Integration timeline for FET compliance**—will ASBC maintain separate FET filings, or consolidate into ABP master tax compliance system?
8. **State excise tax exposure**—has ABP analyzed state tax controlled group impacts?
9. **Contract brewing/distilling arrangements**—does ABP engage in any arrangements that could trigger "single taxpayer" aggregation with non-controlled entities?
10. **Purchase price adjustment methodology**—how does ABP propose to address FET increase in valuation (if at all)?

### D. Negotiation Strategy for Sellers

**Seller's Position:**
- ASBC currently enjoys full reduced FET rate benefits as standalone entity
- Acquisition by ABP imposes controlled group aggregation, potentially increasing ASBC's FET by $500K-$1.8M annually
- This FET increase is **externality imposed by ABP**, not inherent to ASBC's business
- Sellers should not bear economic burden of ABP's controlled group status

**Recommended Seller Demands:**

**1. Purchase Price Adjustment:**
- Demand purchase price increase of $5.5M-$8.3M (present value of FET increase under proportional allocation scenario)
- Justify based on EBITDA multiple applied to recurring cash flow reduction
- Alternative: Escrow $5M of purchase price, release annually based on actual FET allocation performance

**2. Contractual Allocation Commitment:**
- Require ABP to covenant in SPA that ASBC will receive "optimal" allocation (full 60K beer barrels, full 100K spirits PG) for minimum 5 years post-closing
- Include liquidated damages provision: If ABP assigns less favorable allocation, ABP must pay ASBC the FET differential
- Example: If allocation results in $692K FET increase, ABP pays ASBC $692K annually to make ASBC whole

**3. Working Capital True-Up:**
- Increase working capital target by amount sufficient to fund higher semi-monthly FET payments
- Under proportional allocation, increase by ~$300K to cover 4-6 weeks' incremental FET cash requirement

**4. Representations and Warranties:**
- ABP represents that its total controlled group production (including ASBC) will not exceed 2M barrels beer and 22.13M PG spirits for [3/5] years post-closing
- If representation breached (ABP grows beyond thresholds), ASBC loses reduced rate eligibility entirely → Purchase price adjustment triggered

**5. Timing Optimization:**
- Negotiate closing date in Q4 (October-December) to defer controlled group impact to following calendar year
- Each month of delay (within same calendar year) has no incremental FET cost but may have time-value-of-money benefit to sellers
