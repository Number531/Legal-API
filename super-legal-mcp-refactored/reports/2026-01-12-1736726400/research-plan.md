- Focus areas: 46 U.S.C. § 31301 (preferred ship mortgages), 46 U.S.C. § 31341 (maritime liens priority crew wages/salvage/necessaries/tort), ship mortgage change of control provisions, debt covenants
- Key authorities to research: Maritime lien priority (The J.E. Rumbell, 148 U.S. 1 (1893)), preferred mortgage requirements, loan agreement change of control provisions
- Critical issues to address: #10 (ship mortgage change of control consents, $2.8B debt, refinancing risk $56M-$84M increased annual debt service if lenders refuse consent)
- Cross-reference with: T1 (FMC license transfer impacts lender consent analysis), T7 (maritime liens for 905(b) tort claims rank above mortgages), T9 (terminal leases as collateral)
- **Output quantification**: Debt $2.8B (4 lenders), refinancing risk $56M-$84M annual (if rates increase 6-8% vs. 4-5%), debt covenant breach risk (acquisition adds $3.2B debt may exceed 4.5× debt/EBITDA)

**T9 (commercial-contracts-analyst - Port Terminal Leases):**
- Focus areas: Oakland lease renewal (Port demands $42M vs. $28M current, walk-away analysis), LA/Long Beach/Seattle lease terms, lease termination provisions, force majeure (ILWU strike, regulatory changes)
- Key authorities to research: California commercial lease law, port authority concession agreements, lease termination for economic infeasibility
- Critical issues to address: #4 (Oakland Port demands $42M rent, if accepted terminal EBITDA $3M uneconomic, walk-away improves EBITDA $63M-$83M vs. accepting uneconomic rent)
- Cross-reference with: T5 (ILWU strike shuts down all terminals, force majeure provision analysis), T10 (LA air quality lawsuit, lease termination option if regulatory changes uneconomic)
- **Output quantification**: Oakland walk-away net EBITDA improvement $63M-$83M vs. accepting $42M rent (terminal becomes uneconomic, $3M EBITDA insufficient ROI)

**T10 (environmental-compliance-analyst - Environmental Litigation):**
- Focus areas: Clean Air Act preemption of state/local vessel regulation (42 U.S.C. § 7543(e)), California air quality standards, CAAP (Clean Air Action Plan LA/Long Beach voluntary), NOAA natural resource damages (CERCLA § 107, OPA 90), Coast Guard oil spill regulations (33 CFR Part 155 Subpart B bunker hose maintenance)
- Key authorities to research: City of Los Angeles v. PMSC (March 2024), Clean Air Act vessel preemption (Engine Manufacturers Ass'n v. South Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246 (2004)), NOAA NRD assessment procedures
- Critical issues to address: #6 (LA air quality lawsuit $315M capital demand, if City wins ZEV trucks/electric CHE/shore power required, PMSC lease termination option vs. capital investment), bunker spill (NOAA NRD $2M-$5M pending)
- Cross-reference with: T6 (IMO NOx/sulfur compliance overlaps with air quality), T9 (LA lease termination option if regulatory changes uneconomic)
- **Output quantification**: LA lawsuit capital demand $315M (ZEV trucks, electric CHE $270M, shore power $45M) + annual operating costs $25M-$40M, NOAA NRD $2M-$5M (bunker spill March 2023)

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Document key assumptions for specialist context:

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| PMSC's FMC license and service contracts are current and compliant | User-provided fact pattern | If license suspended or contracts in default, would materially impact OCC operations |
| 2 vessels currently 73% U.S. crew (below 75% Jones Act threshold) | User-provided crew manifests | If Coast Guard audits before correction, penalty $39.6M per voyage + vessel forfeiture risk |
| Seattle TWIC reader extension will be granted by Coast Guard | User states 60-70% probability based on good faith/supply chain delays | If denied, $25K/day penalty from 1/1/2025 = $2.25M-$4.5M |
| ILWU strike probability 30-40% based on 2027 negotiations | Historical precedent (2002, 2014-2015, 2022) | If strike occurs, $2.5M/day revenue loss, 90-day shutdown $225M |
| Ship mortgage lenders will require change of control consent | Standard ship mortgage provision | If lenders refuse, refinancing required at 6-8% rates vs. 4-5% existing = $56M-$84M annual |
| Oakland Port will negotiate vs. insist on $42M rent | Commercial negotiation dynamics | If Port insists $42M, PMSC walk-away decision (terminal uneconomic at $3M EBITDA) |
| LA air quality lawsuit is currently in motion to dismiss phase | User-provided status (hearing Q1 2025) | If City wins and orders $315M capital investment, PMSC may terminate lease |
| Martinez 905(b) case will go to trial Q3 2025 | User-provided trial schedule | Settlement could occur pre-trial for $1.5M-$3M (avoid jury risk) |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual FMC OCC license documentation not provided (assume valid based on License No. 024587)
- 850 service contracts terms not disclosed (assume standard confidential service contracts compliant with 46 U.S.C. § 40501)
- Ship mortgage loan agreements not provided (assume standard preferred mortgage terms with change of control provisions)
- Terminal lease agreements not provided (assume standard port authority concession agreements with force majeure provisions)
- Insurance policy terms (hull & machinery, P&I, loss of hire) not provided (assume standard maritime insurance with $2M deductible, 14-day waiting period loss of hire)
- Actual crew citizenship percentages verified via Coast Guard NVDC not confirmed (rely on user-provided 73% figure for 2 vessels)

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:** T7 (case-law-analyst) depends on T5 (employment-labor-analyst) completion for LHWCA exclusive remedy analysis in Martinez 905(b) case. All other specialists (T1-T6, T8-T10) can execute in parallel.

**Potential Issues:**
- If Jones Act crew non-compliance persists (2 vessels 73% vs. 75% required), Coast Guard audit could result in $39.6M penalty per voyage + vessel forfeiture → escalate immediately
- If Seattle TWIC reader extension denied, penalty accrues $25K/day from 1/1/2025 → expedite installation via air freight ($100K) to minimize exposure
- If ILWU strike occurs (30-40% probability 2027 negotiations), all 4 terminals shut down $2.5M/day revenue loss → no mitigation strategy available, risk inherent to West Coast maritime operations
- If Oakland Port insists on $42M rent (vs. $28M current), walk-away decision required → redeploy 620K TEU to LA/Long Beach (600K TEU excess capacity available)
- If LA air quality lawsuit succeeds and orders $315M capital investment, PMSC may exercise lease termination option (economic infeasibility) → lose $420M annual revenue but avoid $315M capital cost

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If any specialist finds exposure >$100M single issue (e.g., Jones Act fleet-wide violations, ILWU strike during closing period, ship mortgage refinancing at distressed rates), flag immediately for Investment Committee
- If deal-blocking issues identified (e.g., FMC license suspended, Jones Act fleet ineligible due to systemic crew violations, lenders refuse change of control consent and refinancing unavailable), recommend DO NOT PROCEED
- If cumulative exposure across all domains >$500M (sum of probabilistic losses), recommend enhanced indemnification and escrow protections

**RESEARCH PLAN STATUS:** READY FOR EXECUTION

**NEXT STEP:** Spawn T1-T6, T8-T10 specialists in parallel (Phase 1), then T7 sequential after T5 completes (Phase 2)
