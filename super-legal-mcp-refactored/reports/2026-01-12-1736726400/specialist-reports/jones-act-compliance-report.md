## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Jones Act Compliance Risk Assessment: **HIGH** (Material Non-Compliance – Deal-Blocking if Not Remediated)

Pacific Maritime Services Corporation's Jones Act fleet operations present **two critical compliance failures** requiring immediate corrective action before acquisition closing:

1. **Crew Citizenship Violations (46 U.S.C. § 8103):** M/V Island Express and M/V Pacific Voyager operate at 73.3% U.S. citizen crew (22/30), below the statutory 75% requirement (23/30). **Exposure: $812K-$170M.**

2. **Offshore Wind Vessels Jones Act Ineligible (46 U.S.C. § 55102):** Two COSCO-built vessels ($56M value) are foreign-built and statutorily barred from U.S. coastwise trade, yet currently operate in U.S. offshore wind installation (OCS). **Exposure: $56M-$600M.**

**Total Exposure Range:** $11 million (with immediate remediation) to $842 million (if Coast Guard/CBP enforcement before correction).

**Deal-Blocking Assessment:** Crew non-compliance is **MATERIAL and requires 90-day corrective action as condition precedent to closing**. Offshore wind vessels require **immediate cessation of U.S. operations and international redeployment**. With proper remediation, exposure reduces 98.7% ($842M → $11M), rendering risk acceptable for transaction completion.

### Key Findings Summary

#### 1. Crew Citizenship Non-Compliance (Critical Issue #1 – DEAL-BLOCKING)

**FINDING:** Two Jones Act vessels violate the 75/25 Rule (46 U.S.C. § 8103(b)) requiring 75% U.S. citizen crew.

| Vessel | Current Crew | U.S. Citizens | Compliance % | Required | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------------|----------|--------|
| **M/V Island Express** | 30 | 22 | 73.3% | 75% (23) | **NON-COMPLIANT** |
| **M/V Pacific Voyager** | 30 | 22 | 73.3% | 75% (23) | **NON-COMPLIANT** |

**Legal Analysis:**
- **Statutory violation:** 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b) mandates 75% U.S. citizens for vessels engaged in coastwise trade
- **Every voyage** operated at current crew composition violates federal law
- **Enforcement authority:** U.S. Coast Guard (crew verification via National Vessel Documentation Center)
- **Penalty statute:** 46 U.S.C. § 8103(f) – $1,562 per individual per voyage (inflation-adjusted 2025)
- **Look-back period:** 5 years (28 U.S.C. § 2462 statute of limitations for civil penalties)

**Quantified Exposure:**

| Exposure Type | Annual | 5-Year Look-Back | Vessel Forfeiture |
|---------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Civil penalties** | $162,448 | $812,240 | N/A |
| **Criminal forfeiture (46 U.S.C. § 55102(c))** | N/A | N/A | **$170,000,000** (2 vessels × $85M) |

**Probability Assessment:**
- Civil penalties: **95% likely** if violation discovered by Coast Guard audit
- Vessel forfeiture: **5-10%** (extreme scenario – depends on enforcement timing, whistleblower complaint, or accident investigation trigger)

**CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUIRED:** Hire **two (2) U.S. citizen crew members** (one per vessel) within **90 days** via Seafarers International Union (SIU) hiring hall.

**Timeline:**
- SIU dispatch: Week 1
- Background checks: Weeks 2-4
- TWIC credential: Weeks 2-6 (TSA security threat assessment – 60-day standard processing)
- USCG Merchant Mariner Credential: Weeks 3-6
- Vessel training (46 CFR § 15.1105): Weeks 7-8
- **Compliance achieved:** Day 70-90 (target March 15, 2026 if commenced January 15, 2026)

**Cost of Compliance:**
- Additional crew compensation (U.S. vs. foreign): $120K-$180K annually (2 crew × $60K-$90K differential)
- Recruiting/training: $10K-$15K per hire
- **Total first-year cost:** $140K-$210K

**Cost-Benefit:**
- **Avoided civil penalties:** $162K annually ($812K over 5 years)
- **Avoided forfeiture risk:** $170M vessel value
- **Net benefit:** Compliance economically justified (99.4% risk reduction)

---

#### 2. Offshore Wind Vessels – Foreign-Built Ineligibility (Critical Issue #8)

**FINDING:** PMSC acquired two COSCO-built crew transfer vessels (CTVs) for U.S. offshore wind projects, but foreign-built vessels are **statutorily barred** from U.S. coastwise trade under 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A).

| Vessel Attribute | Status |
|------------------|--------|
| **Builder** | COSCO (China Ocean Shipping Company), Shanghai |
| **Built** | 2022 (foreign-built) |
| **U.S. Flag** | Yes (documented with Coast Guard NVDC) |
| **Coastwise Endorsement** | **NO** (ineligible – not U.S.-built) |
| **Acquisition Cost** | $28M per vessel ($56M total) |
| **Current Operations** | Turbine component transport: U.S. ports → U.S. OCS installation sites |

**Legal Analysis:**

**(a) OCSLA 2021 Amendment Brings Offshore Wind Within Jones Act:**
- National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Pub. L. No. 116-283, § 9503) amended 43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(1) to extend OCSLA to **"non-mineral energy resources"** (offshore wind)
- Effect: U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore wind installations are now **"points in the United States"** for Jones Act purposes

**(b) CBP September 2023 Ruling (Confirmed August 2024):**
- **July 17, 2023 initial ruling:** Foreign vessels could install monopiles at pristine OCS sites without Jones Act violation
- **September 14, 2023 reversal (CRITICAL):** CBP determined **"a second coastwise point is established once the jack-up vessel attaches itself to the seabed"** for installation purposes
- **August 21, 2024 confirmation:** CBP affirmed September 2023 interpretation – offshore wind installation **creates coastwise points** subject to Jones Act restrictions

**(c) Coastwise Trade Three-Part Test (PMSC Operations):**

| Element | Finding | Analysis |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **(1) Transportation of merchandise** | **YES** | Turbine components (blades, nacelles, towers, monopiles) are "merchandise" |
| **(2) Between U.S. points** | **YES** | U.S. port → U.S. OCS installation site (both U.S. points under OCSLA 2021) |
| **(3) By water** | **YES** | Ocean transport via vessel |

**Conclusion:** PMSC offshore wind operations **constitute coastwise trade** under 46 U.S.C. § 55102.

**(d) Foreign-Built Statutory Bar (Absolute – No Cure):**
- 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A): **"A coastwise endorsement may be issued for a vessel that was built in the United States."**
- COSCO vessels built in China → **permanently ineligible** for coastwise endorsements
- **No retrofit, re-documentation, or waiver** can cure foreign construction (statutory requirement, not regulatory discretion)

**Quantified Exposure:**

| Exposure Type | Per Voyage | Annual (10 Voyages/Vessel) | Historical (2023-2024) | Vessel Forfeiture |
|---------------|------------|----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Civil penalty (merchandise value)** | $5M-$15M | $100M-$300M | $200M-$600M | $56M (2 vessels) |

**Penalty Calculation Basis (46 U.S.C. § 55102(c)):**
> "An amount equal to the **value of the merchandise** (as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security) or the actual cost of the transportation, whichever is greater, may be recovered."

- Turbine component value per voyage: $5M-$15M (estimated)
- Transport cost per voyage: $500K-$1M (estimated)
- **Penalty = merchandise value** (higher of the two)

**Probability Assessment:**
- CBP enforcement if operations continue: **50-60%** (offshore wind high-visibility industry, CBP Jones Act Division of Enforcement active since 2021)
- Precedent: CBP assessed $350M in Jones Act penalties for Alaska fish transport violations (2021); $15M penalty in *Furie Operating Alaska, LLC* (2012)

**REMEDIATION OPTIONS:**

| Option | Description | Financial Impact | Probability |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Option 1: Cease U.S. Operations** | Stop using COSCO vessels for U.S. OCS projects | Revenue loss: $5M-$8M/year | 70% |
| **Option 2: Forfeit Vessels** | Surrender to CBP | Vessel value loss: $56M | 5% (last resort) |
| **Option 3: International Redeployment** | Europe/Asia offshore wind markets | Revenue: $10M-$20M/year (preserves 100-125% of U.S. revenue) | **85% RECOMMENDED** |
| **Option 4: Challenge CBP Ruling** | Litigation/private ruling | Legal costs: $500K-$1.5M; Success: 15-20% | 10% (not recommended) |
| **Option 5: MARAD Waiver (voyage-by-voyage)** | 46 U.S.C. § 501(b) | Administrative burden; Success: 30-40% | 20% (backup) |

**RECOMMENDED STRATEGY:** **Option 3 (International Redeployment) + Option 5 (MARAD Waiver Backup)**

**Immediate Actions (30 Days):**
1. **Cease U.S. OCS operations** (no voyages until compliance resolved)
2. **Notify offshore wind clients** (force majeure: regulatory impossibility)
3. **Engage European/Asian developers** (North Sea, Taiwan Strait – no Jones Act restrictions)
4. **Request MARAD private ruling** (as backup if international deployment delayed)

**Revenue Recovery:**
- International offshore wind charter rates: $8K-$15K/day (comparable to U.S. market)
- **Annual revenue potential:** $10M-$20M (Europe/Asia markets) vs. $5M-$8M (U.S. lost revenue)
- **Net benefit:** Revenue preserved or increased, eliminates $100M-$600M penalty exposure

**SPA Purchase Price Adjustment:**
- Negotiate **$28M-$56M reduction** (reflecting offshore wind vessel stranded asset risk in U.S. market)
- Alternative: Seller indemnification for Jones Act penalties (capped at $56M vessel value)

### Regulatory Timeline Implications

| Milestone | Date | Impact |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Transaction closing (Q1 2026)** | March 2026 (estimated) | Crew citizenship compliance MUST be achieved before closing (90-day window: Jan 15 – Mar 15, 2026) |
| **TWIC credential expiration (existing crew)** | Varies (5-year validity) | Verify all current U.S. citizen crew have valid TWIC credentials; renewals require 60-day lead time |
| **Coast Guard COI annual inspection** | Vessel-specific (varies) | If M/V Island Express or M/V Pacific Voyager due for annual COI inspection during Q1 2026, Coast Guard will verify crew citizenship → enforcement trigger |
| **Offshore wind contract deadlines** | User to provide | If COSCO vessels committed to U.S. OCS projects Q1-Q2 2026, contract terminations must occur immediately to avoid additional penalty accrual |
| **MARAD waiver processing (if pursued)** | 30-90 days per application | If seeking Jones Act waiver for COSCO vessels, request must be submitted January 2026 for Q2 2026 decision |

**CRITICAL TIMING CONCERN:** If Coast Guard audit occurs **before** 90-day crew citizenship correction completes, $170M vessel forfeiture exposure materializes. **Immediate SIU hiring hall engagement essential** (target: Day 1 post-signing).

---

### Total Quantified Exposure Summary

#### Best Case (Immediate Remediation – 70% Probability)
- **Crew citizenship compliance cost:** $140K-$210K (hire 2 U.S. crew, first-year)
- **Minimal civil penalties:** $812K (historical look-back if discovered)
- **Offshore wind revenue loss + redeployment:** $8M-$10M (contract termination + mobilization – revenue recovered via international markets)
- **TOTAL:** **$8.95M - $10.67M**

#### Worst Case (Enforcement Before Remediation – 10% Probability)
- **Crew citizenship forfeiture:** $170M (vessel seizure if Coast Guard audit before correction)
- **Offshore wind penalties:** $56M-$600M (forfeiture + historical/ongoing civil penalties)
- **TOTAL:** **$226M - $770M** (midpoint: $842M)

#### Probability-Weighted Expected Exposure
- Best case (70%): $9.5M × 0.70 = **$6.65M**
- Likely case (20%): $10.7M × 0.20 = **$2.14M**
- Worst case (10%): $842M × 0.10 = **$84.2M**
- **TOTAL EXPECTED VALUE: $92.99M** (before remediation)

**With immediate remediation:** Expected exposure reduces to **$9.5M - $10.7M** (70% probability scenario) → **90% risk reduction.**

---

### Risk Mitigation Summary

**RECOMMENDATION:** Condition closing on (1) 90-day crew citizenship correction (SPA condition precedent) and (2) immediate offshore wind operations cessation. With proper remediation, exposure reduces from **$842M (worst case) to $11M (likely case)** — **98.7% risk reduction** — rendering Jones Act risk **acceptable for $4.8B acquisition**.

**SPA Provisions Required:**
1. **Condition precedent:** Crew citizenship compliance (75%) verified by NVDC before closing
2. **Condition precedent:** COSCO vessel U.S. OCS operations cease immediately
3. **Purchase price adjustment:** $28M-$56M reduction (offshore wind vessel impairment)
4. **Seller indemnification:** Jones Act penalties/forfeitures for pre-closing violations (capped at $56M)

**Post-Closing Compliance Program Cost:** $75K-$155K annually (NVDC audits, Jones Act training, Coast Guard inspection readiness) — economically justified to avoid $162K annual penalty + $170M forfeiture risk.

- No access to CBP private rulings specific to PMSC vessels

---

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. PMSC Fleet Overview

Pacific Maritime Services Corporation operates a 22-vessel owned fleet comprising:
- **18 container vessels** (including 4 ultra-large container vessels with 18,000-20,000 TEU capacity)
- **4 bulk carriers**
- **8 additional chartered vessels**

**Jones Act Compliant Fleet (6 vessels):**
PMSC operates 6 U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-documented vessels engaged in coastwise trade serving:
- **Hawaii routes** (trans-Pacific domestic service from U.S. West Coast)
- **Alaska routes** (domestic container service)
- **Puerto Rico routes** (U.S. mainland to Puerto Rico container service)

These six vessels are documented with coastwise endorsements by the U.S. Coast Guard National Vessel Documentation Center (NVDC) and qualify for domestic maritime commerce under 46 U.S.C. § 55102.¹

### B. Crew Citizenship Non-Compliance (2 Vessels)

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Two vessels currently operate below the statutory 75% U.S. citizen crew requirement mandated by 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b):

| Vessel Name | Total Crew | U.S. Citizens | Foreign Crew | Percentage U.S. | Statutory Requirement | Compliance Status |
|-------------|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| M/V Island Express | 30 | 22 | 8 | 73.3% | 75% (22.5/30) | **NON-COMPLIANT** (need 23) |
| M/V Pacific Voyager | 30 | 22 | 8 | 73.3% | 75% (22.5/30) | **NON-COMPLIANT** (need 23) |

**Gap:** Each vessel requires hiring **one (1) additional U.S. citizen crew member** to achieve 75% compliance (23 of 30 = 76.7%).

**Voyage Frequency:** Each vessel conducts approximately **52 voyages annually** (weekly service Hawaii/Alaska routes).²

### C. Offshore Wind Vessels (COSCO-Built)

**CRITICAL FINDING:** PMSC acquired two specialized crew transfer vessels (CTVs) in 2023 for offshore wind farm installation services:

| Vessel Specifications | Details |
|----------------------|---------|
| **Builder** | China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO), Shanghai |
| **Built** | 2022 (delivered 2023) |
| **U.S. Flag** | Yes (documented with U.S. Coast Guard) |
| **U.S.-Built** | **NO** (foreign-built in China) |
| **Coastwise Endorsement** | **NO** (ineligible due to foreign construction) |
| **Acquisition Cost** | $28 million per vessel ($56 million total) |
| **Intended Use** | Offshore wind turbine installation in U.S. federal waters (OCS 3-200 nautical miles) |
| **Current Operations** | Turbine component transportation from U.S. ports to offshore installation sites |

**Jones Act Eligibility Issue:** Foreign-built vessels cannot obtain coastwise endorsements under 46 U.S.C. § 55102(a)(2), disqualifying them from coastwise trade.³

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Jones Act Legal Framework – Coastwise Trade Restrictions

#### 1. Statutory Requirements: 46 U.S.C. § 55102

The Jones Act, codified at **46 U.S.C. § 55102**, provides:

> "A vessel may not provide any part of the transportation of merchandise by water, or by land and water, between points in the United States to which the coastwise laws apply, either directly or via a foreign port, unless the vessel— (1) is wholly owned by citizens of the United States for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade; and (2) has been issued a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement under chapter 121 or is exempt from documentation but would otherwise be eligible for such a certificate and endorsement."⁴

**Four Requirements for Jones Act Compliance:**
1. **U.S.-built** (vessel constructed in the United States)
2. **U.S.-flagged** (documented under U.S. law)
3. **U.S.-owned** (wholly owned by U.S. citizens)
4. **U.S.-crewed** (officers and at least 75% of crew are U.S. citizens)⁵

#### 2. Coastwise Endorsement: 46 U.S.C. § 12112

A coastwise endorsement is required for vessels engaging in domestic maritime commerce. **46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)** mandates that a coastwise endorsement may be issued only for a vessel that was:
- **(A) built in the United States; and**
- **(B) meets the ownership requirements in section 12103.**⁶

**CONSEQUENCE:** Foreign-built vessels are **statutorily ineligible** for coastwise endorsements, regardless of current U.S. flag or U.S. ownership.⁷

#### 3. Crew Citizenship Requirements: 46 U.S.C. § 8103

**46 U.S.C. § 8103(b)** (the "75/25 Rule") requires:

> "Seventy-five percent of the crew of a vessel documented under section 12103 or 12112(c) of this title and engaged in the coastwise trade shall be citizens of the United States."⁸

More precisely, **no more than 25% of unlicensed seamen may be aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.**⁹

**Additional Officer Requirements (46 U.S.C. § 8103(a)):**
- Master (captain)
- Chief engineer
- Officer in charge of a deck or engineering watch

All must be **U.S. citizens** without exception.¹⁰

#### 4. Enforcement Authority

The Jones Act is enforced by:
- **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** – cargo/vessel violations, civil penalties
- **U.S. Coast Guard** – crew citizenship verification via NVDC, vessel documentation
- **Maritime Administration (MARAD)** – waiver determinations, policy guidance¹¹

---

### B. Crew Citizenship Violation Analysis (Critical Issue #1)

#### 1. Statutory Violation: 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b)

**Factual Findings:**
- **M/V Island Express:** 22 U.S. citizens / 30 total crew = **73.3%** (below 75% threshold)
- **M/V Pacific Voyager:** 22 U.S. citizens / 30 total crew = **73.3%** (below 75% threshold)
- **Statutory requirement:** 75% = 23 U.S. citizens (22.5 rounded up)
- **Shortfall:** Each vessel is **1 crew member short** of compliance

**Legal Conclusion:** Both vessels are in **violation of 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b)** on every voyage operated at current crew composition.¹²

#### 2. Civil Penalty Exposure

**Statutory Penalty (46 U.S.C. § 8103(f)):**
> "A person employing an individual in violation of this section or a regulation prescribed under this section is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of **$500 for each individual so employed**."¹³

**Inflation-Adjusted Penalty (2025):** $1,562 per individual per violation.¹⁴

**PENALTY CALCULATION (Per Vessel, Per Voyage):**
- Foreign crew in excess of 25% limit: **1 crew member per vessel**
- Penalty: $1,562 per voyage per vessel
- Annual voyages: 52 per vessel
- **Annual penalty exposure per vessel:** $1,562 × 52 = **$81,224**
- **Two vessels annual exposure:** $81,224 × 2 = **$162,448**

**Look-Back Period (Statute of Limitations):**
General maritime statute of limitations for civil penalties: **5 years** (28 U.S.C. § 2462).¹⁵

**Five-Year Total Exposure:**
- $162,448 × 5 years = **$812,240 civil penalty exposure**

**NOTE:** This calculation assumes Coast Guard discovers the violation and assesses penalties retroactively. Current exposure accrues daily until corrected.

#### 3. Criminal Forfeiture Risk: 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c)

While 46 U.S.C. § 8103 addresses crew citizenship with civil penalties, **46 U.S.C. § 55102** governs **coastwise trade violations generally** and provides for vessel forfeiture:

> "Merchandise transported in violation of subsection (b) is liable to seizure by and forfeiture to the Government."¹⁶

**Alternative Penalty (in lieu of forfeiture):**
"An amount equal to the value of the merchandise (as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security) or the actual cost of the transportation, whichever is greater, may be recovered from any person transporting the merchandise or causing the merchandise to be transported."¹⁷

**Analysis of Forfeiture Risk:**

CBP has historically interpreted Jones Act violations broadly to include **vessel ineligibility due to crew non-compliance**. In *Furie Operating Alaska, LLC* (2011-2012), CBP assessed a **$15 million penalty** for using a foreign-flag vessel to transport a drilling rig between U.S. points via a foreign port.¹⁸

**Vessel Forfeiture Precedent:**
46 U.S.C. § 55102 provides that **"in the event of forfeiture, the vessel is deemed to have become the property of the United States at the instant of violation and allows immediate seizure."**¹⁹

**Exposure for PMSC:**
- **M/V Island Express value:** $85 million (estimated)
- **M/V Pacific Voyager value:** $85 million (estimated)
- **Total vessel forfeiture exposure:** **$170 million**

**Probability Assessment:**
- **Low probability (5-10%)** if corrected within 90 days
- **Medium probability (30-40%)** if violation persists >1 year and Coast Guard audit occurs
- **High probability (70-85%)** if whistleblower complaint or accident triggers investigation

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Crew citizenship non-compliance creates **dual exposure**:
1. **Civil penalties** under 46 U.S.C. § 8103(f): $162,448 annually ($812,240 over 5 years)
2. **Criminal forfeiture** under 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c): $170 million vessel value (extreme scenario)

**Total Exposure Range: $812,240 - $170,812,240** (depending on enforcement action)

### C. Corrective Action Plan for Crew Citizenship Compliance

#### 1. Immediate Hiring Requirement

**CORRECTIVE ACTION REQUIRED:** Hire **two (2) U.S. citizen crew members** (one for each non-compliant vessel) within **90 days** to achieve 75% compliance before closing.

**Target Crew Composition (Post-Correction):**
- M/V Island Express: 23 U.S. citizens / 30 total = **76.7%** ✓ COMPLIANT
- M/V Pacific Voyager: 23 U.S. citizens / 30 total = **76.7%** ✓ COMPLIANT

#### 2. Recruitment Strategy

**Maritime Union Hiring Halls:**

**Seafarers International Union (SIU):**
- Represents unlicensed U.S. merchant mariners (deck, engine, steward departments)
- 35,498 members nationwide (largest U.S. maritime labor union)
- **Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and Education** (Piney Point, MD) – trained 100,000+ mariners since 1967
- **Apprenticeship program:** Free training, meals, lodging; guaranteed first job on contracted vessel²⁰

**Masters, Mates & Pilots (MM&P):**
- Represents licensed deck officers on U.S.-flag commercial vessels
- Best-qualified professional mariners for officer positions²¹

**Alternative Sources:**
- U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (Kings Point, NY) – federal academy graduates
- State maritime academies (California Maritime, SUNY Maritime, Maine Maritime, Mass Maritime, Texas A&M Maritime, Great Lakes Maritime)
- Veterans transitioning from U.S. Navy/Coast Guard with maritime ratings

#### 3. Hiring Timeline and Requirements

| Step | Timeline | Requirements |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Job posting via union hiring halls** | Week 1 | SIU/MM&P dispatch, QMED/AB ratings |
| **Background checks (USCG)** | Weeks 2-4 | Criminal history, drug testing |
| **TWIC credential application** | Weeks 2-6 | TSA security threat assessment, fingerprints, photos |
| **USCG Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC)** | Weeks 3-6 | Medical exam, STCW training certification |
| **Vessel-specific training** | Weeks 7-8 | Safety familiarization, emergency procedures (46 CFR § 15.1105) |
| **Assignment to vessel** | Week 9-10 | Ready for first voyage |

**CRITICAL: TWIC Processing Time:** TSA recommends minimum **60 days** for TWIC applications (including renewals).²² Expedited processing available for additional fee ($60 rush processing).

**Total Timeline:** **8-10 weeks** from job posting to vessel assignment (within 90-day corrective action window).

#### 4. Cost Analysis

**Annual Compensation (U.S. Citizen Crew vs. Foreign Crew):**

| Position | U.S. Citizen Annual Cost | Foreign Crew Annual Cost | Differential |
|----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Able Seaman (AB) / QMED | $120,000 - $180,000 | $60,000 - $90,000 | +$60,000 - $90,000 |

**Two New Hires (One Per Vessel):**
- Additional annual cost: **$120,000 - $180,000** (2 crew × $60,000-$90,000 differential)
- Initial recruiting/training costs: $10,000 - $15,000 per hire
- Total first-year cost: **$140,000 - $210,000**

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- **Compliance cost:** $140,000 - $210,000 annually
- **Avoided civil penalties:** $162,448 annually (or $812,240 over 5 years)
- **Avoided forfeiture risk:** $170 million vessel value (extreme scenario)
- **Net benefit:** Compliance cost is **economically justified** to eliminate penalty exposure

#### 5. Alternative: Vessel Lay-Up (Not Recommended)

**Option:** Temporarily remove non-compliant vessels from service until U.S. crew hired.

**Revenue Impact:**
- M/V Island Express revenue: $9 million annually (estimated)
- M/V Pacific Voyager revenue: $9 million annually (estimated)
- **Total revenue loss during lay-up:** $18 million per year

**Conclusion:** Lay-up is **economically inferior** to immediate hiring ($18M revenue loss vs. $140K-$210K hiring cost).

**RECOMMENDED ACTION:** Immediate recruitment via SIU hiring hall, target 60-day placement.

### D. Offshore Wind Vessels – Jones Act Ineligibility (Critical Issue #8)

#### 1. Legal Framework: OCSLA 2021 Amendment

**Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) – 2021 Amendment:**

Section 9503 of the **National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021** (Pub. L. No. 116-283) amended **43 U.S.C. § 1333(a)(1)** to extend OCSLA to **"non-mineral energy resources"**:

> "OCSLA will now apply to installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed, which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring for, developing, or producing resources, **including non-mineral energy resources**."²³

**Effect:** Congress ended ambiguity over whether OCSLA applied to offshore wind installations. **CBP construed the 2021 amendment as extending OCSLA to wind activities on the OCS**, bringing offshore wind projects within Jones Act coastwise trade restrictions.²⁴

#### 2. CBP Offshore Wind Rulings (2023-2024)

**July 17, 2023 Ruling:**
CBP initially ruled that a foreign vessel could load monopile foundations in a U.S. port, transport them to an offshore work site where nothing had been previously attached to the seabed, and install such foundations **without violating the Jones Act** (no second coastwise point created).²⁵

**September 14, 2023 Modification (Critical):**
CBP **reversed** its July ruling, determining:

> "The use of a foreign-flagged jack-up vessel to transport monopiles between a U.S. port and an installation site on the OCS would **violate the Jones Act**, because **a second coastwise point is established once the jack-up vessel attaches itself to the seabed** for the purposes of monopile installation."²⁶

**August 21, 2024 Confirmation:**
CBP confirmed its September 2023 interpretation, solidifying that **offshore wind installation creates coastwise points** subject to Jones Act restrictions.²⁷

#### 3. Coastwise Trade Analysis: Three-Part Test

CBP applies a **functional test** to determine whether activity constitutes "coastwise trade":
1. **Transportation of merchandise or passengers**
2. **Between two points in the United States**
3. **By water**²⁸

**Application to PMSC Offshore Wind Vessels:**

| Element | Finding | Analysis |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **(1) Transportation of merchandise** | **YES** | Turbine components (blades, nacelles, towers, monopiles) are "merchandise" |
| **(2) Between U.S. points** | **YES** | U.S. port (loading) → U.S. OCS installation site (3-200 nm offshore) = both U.S. points |
| **(3) By water** | **YES** | Vessels transport components via ocean to offshore site |

**Conclusion:** PMSC offshore wind vessel operations **constitute coastwise trade** under 46 U.S.C. § 55102.

#### 4. COSCO-Built Vessels: Ineligibility for Coastwise Endorsement

**Factual Findings:**
- **Builder:** COSCO (China Ocean Shipping Company), Shanghai
- **Built:** 2022 (foreign-built)
- **U.S. Flag:** Yes (documented with Coast Guard NVDC)
- **Coastwise endorsement:** **NO** (ineligible under 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A) – not U.S.-built)

**Statutory Barrier (46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A)):**
> "A coastwise endorsement may be issued for a vessel that was **built in the United States**."²⁹

**LEGAL CONCLUSION:** COSCO-built vessels are **statutorily ineligible** for coastwise endorsements. No waiver, retrofit, or re-documentation can cure foreign construction.³⁰

#### 5. Penalty Exposure for Offshore Wind Operations

**Current Operations (User-Provided Facts):**
- PMSC uses COSCO vessels to transport turbine components from U.S. ports to OCS installation sites
- Operations ongoing since 2023 acquisition

**Jones Act Violation:**
Using foreign-built vessels without coastwise endorsements for coastwise trade violates **46 U.S.C. § 55102(b)**.

**Civil Penalty Calculation:**
> "An amount equal to the value of the merchandise (as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security) or the actual cost of the transportation, whichever is greater, may be recovered."³¹

**Penalty Estimation (Per Voyage):**
- Turbine component value transported per voyage: $5 million - $15 million (estimated)
- Transportation cost per voyage: $500,000 - $1 million (estimated)
- **Penalty per voyage:** $5 million - $15 million (based on merchandise value)

**Annual Exposure (Assuming 10 Voyages/Year Per Vessel):**
- 2 vessels × 10 voyages × $5M-$15M = **$100 million - $300 million annually**

**Look-Back Period (5 Years):**
- Operations commenced 2023 = 2 years of potential violations
- **Historical exposure:** $200 million - $600 million (2023-2024)

**Vessel Forfeiture Risk:**
- COSCO vessel value: $28 million each ($56 million total)
- **Forfeiture exposure:** $56 million (vessels deemed property of U.S. government upon violation)³²

**Total Offshore Wind Violation Exposure: $56M - $600M** (depending on CBP enforcement action and merchandise value calculations)

### E. Offshore Wind Vessel Remediation Options

#### Option 1: Cease U.S. Offshore Wind Operations

**Description:** Immediately cease using COSCO vessels for U.S. OCS offshore wind projects.

**Financial Impact:**
- Current annual revenue from U.S. offshore wind contracts: $5 million - $8 million (estimated)
- **Revenue loss:** $5 million - $8 million annually
- Avoided penalty exposure: $100 million - $300 million annually

**Contractual Obligations:**
- Review offshore wind service contracts for force majeure provisions (regulatory compliance impossibility)
- Potential breach of contract claims if contracts do not contain Jones Act compliance assumptions
- Estimate early termination penalties: $2 million - $5 million (liquidated damages)

**Recommendation Probability:** **70% – Recommended if international redeployment viable**

#### Option 2: Forfeit Vessels to U.S. Government

**Description:** Surrender COSCO vessels to CBP pursuant to 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c) forfeiture provisions.

**Financial Impact:**
- Vessel value loss: $28 million × 2 = **$56 million**
- Avoided civil penalties: $200 million - $600 million (historical) + $100M-$300M (ongoing)
- **Net benefit:** Forfeiture may be preferable to civil penalties if CBP enforcement action imminent

**Voluntary Forfeiture:**
- CBP may accept voluntary forfeiture in exchange for civil penalty waiver
- Precedent: Limited (CBP prefers civil penalties for revenue generation)

**Recommendation Probability:** **5% – Only if CBP enforcement action imminent and no alternative**

#### Option 3: Redeploy to International Offshore Wind (Europe/Asia)

**Description:** Redeploy COSCO vessels to offshore wind projects outside U.S. jurisdiction (Europe, Asia).

**Market Analysis:**
- **Europe:** Offshore wind capacity expanding (North Sea, Baltic Sea) – high demand for crew transfer vessels
- **Asia:** China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea offshore wind growth – COSCO vessels well-suited for Asian markets
- **International rates:** $8,000 - $15,000 per day charter rates (comparable to U.S. market)

**Financial Impact:**
- Estimated annual revenue (international): $5 million - $10 million per vessel ($10M-$20M total)
- **Revenue preservation:** 100% - 125% of current U.S. operations
- Mobilization costs: $500,000 - $1 million per vessel (transport to Europe/Asia)

**Legal Advantages:**
- **No Jones Act restrictions** outside U.S. jurisdiction
- Foreign-built vessels preferred in international markets (lower acquisition cost, broader supply chain)

**Recommendation Probability:** **85% – STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**

#### Option 4: Challenge CBP Interpretation (Low Success Probability)

**Description:** Seek CBP private ruling or challenge September 2023 ruling interpretation.

**Legal Arguments:**
- Offshore wind installation is "construction activity," not "transportation of merchandise"
- OCS installations are "fixed platforms," not "coastwise points" under traditional interpretation
- OCSLA 2021 amendment legislative history ambiguous on Jones Act application

**Success Probability:**
- **15-20%** based on CBP's consistent offshore wind rulings (July 2023, Sept 2023, Aug 2024)
- August 2024 confirmation signals CBP's firm position

**Costs:**
- Legal fees for private ruling request: $50,000 - $150,000
- Litigation costs if challenge proceeds to Court of International Trade: $500,000 - $1.5 million
- Timeline: 12-24 months for private ruling; 3-5 years for litigation

**Risk:**
- Adverse ruling solidifies Jones Act applicability, eliminates any ambiguity defense
- Ongoing violations accrue penalties during challenge period

**Recommendation Probability:** **10% – Not recommended (low success probability, high cost)**

#### Option 5: Seek MARAD Waiver (Voyage-by-Voyage)

**Description:** Apply to MARAD for Jones Act waiver pursuant to 46 U.S.C. § 501(b).

**Waiver Standard:**
MARAD may waive Jones Act requirements if:
1. No qualified U.S.-flag vessel available
2. Waiver serves national defense or national interest

**Analysis:**
- **U.S.-built offshore wind vessels available:** Limited (Dominion Energy's *Charybdis*, Esvagt *Liberty* class under construction)
- **National interest argument:** Offshore wind supports Biden Administration renewable energy goals
- **Precedent:** MARAD waivers rare, **reviewed vessel-by-vessel, voyage-by-voyage** (no blanket waivers)³³

**Practical Challenges:**
- Each voyage requires separate waiver application (administrative burden)
- Uncertainty: MARAD approval timeline 30-90 days per application
- Industry opposition: American Maritime Partnership (Jones Act advocacy group) challenges waivers

**Success Probability:** **30-40%** (depends on U.S.-flag vessel availability demonstration)

**Recommendation Probability:** **20% – Consider as backup if international redeployment infeasible**

---

### F. Recommended Remediation Strategy (Offshore Wind Vessels)

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH:** **Option 3 (International Redeployment) + Option 5 (MARAD Waiver Backup)**

**Immediate Actions (Within 30 Days):**
1. **Cease U.S. OCS operations** until Jones Act compliance resolved
2. **Notify offshore wind clients** of Jones Act compliance issue, cite force majeure (regulatory impossibility)
3. **Engage European/Asian offshore wind developers** for international contracts (North Sea, Taiwan Strait)
4. **Request MARAD private ruling** on Jones Act waiver eligibility (as backup if international redeployment delayed)

**Short-Term (30-90 Days):**
1. **Mobilize COSCO vessels to Europe/Asia** (target: Q2 2026)
2. **Execute international charter agreements** ($8K-$15K/day rates, 3-5 year terms)
3. **Negotiate U.S. contract terminations** (minimize liquidated damages via force majeure)

**Long-Term (6-12 Months):**
1. **Establish European/Asian operations base** (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or Taipei)
2. **Monitor U.S. Jones Act-compliant vessel construction** (potential acquisition if market develops)
3. **Revenue preservation:** Maintain $10M-$20M annual revenue from international operations

**SPA Purchase Price Adjustment:**
- Negotiate **$28 million - $56 million purchase price reduction** (reflecting offshore wind vessel stranded asset risk)
- Alternative: Seller indemnification for Jones Act penalties (capped at $56 million vessel value)

---

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Quantified Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Crew citizenship violation (2 vessels)** | HIGH | 95% (ongoing violation) | $162K annually + $170M forfeiture risk | Hire 2 U.S. crew within 90 days (SIU hiring hall) |
| **Offshore wind COSCO vessels Jones Act ineligible** | HIGH | 85% (CBP enforcement if operations continue) | $56M-$600M (forfeit + penalties) | Redeploy to international markets (Europe/Asia) |
| **Coast Guard crew audit triggers forfeiture** | MEDIUM | 30-40% (if violation persists >1 year) | $170M vessel forfeiture | Immediate compliance (90 days) |
| **CBP offshore wind enforcement action** | MEDIUM | 40-50% (2023-2024 operations) | $200M-$600M historical penalties | Cease U.S. operations, seek MARAD waiver |
| **Whistleblower complaint (crew non-compliance)** | LOW | 10-15% | $812K civil + $170M forfeiture | Pre-emptive compliance, crew retraining |
| **Jones Act waiver denial (offshore wind)** | MEDIUM | 60-70% (MARAD rarely grants waivers) | $5M-$8M annual revenue loss | International redeployment primary strategy |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Crew citizenship documentation verification via USCG NVDC:**
   - Confirm actual crew manifests for M/V Island Express and M/V Pacific Voyager
   - Verify U.S. citizenship status (birth certificates, passports, naturalization certificates)
   - Determine date of first non-compliant voyage (statute of limitations calculation)

2. **Offshore wind contract force majeure provisions:**
   - Review all offshore wind service contracts for Jones Act compliance assumptions
   - Identify liquidated damages provisions for early termination
   - Assess client notification requirements and cure periods

3. **Historical Jones Act violations (crew citizenship):**
   - Determine how long crew non-compliance has persisted (look-back exposure calculation)
   - Review past Coast Guard inspections for crew citizenship verification
   - Assess whether PMSC filed false certifications with NVDC (criminal exposure under 18 U.S.C. § 1001)

4. **COSCO vessel operations log:**
   - Obtain voyage logs for offshore wind operations (2023-2024)
   - Calculate number of U.S. port → OCS voyages (penalty calculation)
   - Determine merchandise value transported (civil penalty exposure per 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c))

5. **Jones Act-compliant vessel availability:**
   - Research U.S.-built offshore wind vessel construction pipeline
   - Assess acquisition feasibility if U.S. market develops (2026-2028)
   - Evaluate sale of COSCO vessels to international operators (asset recovery)

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

#### Crew Citizenship Violations (Critical Issue #1)

| Exposure Type | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Basis |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Civil penalties (annual)** | $162,448 | $162,448 | 46 U.S.C. § 8103(f): $1,562 × 2 vessels × 52 voyages |
| **Civil penalties (5-year look-back)** | $812,240 | $812,240 | 5 years × $162,448 annual |
| **Vessel forfeiture** | $0 (if corrected within 90 days) | $170,000,000 | 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c): $85M per vessel × 2 |
| **Compliance cost (corrective action)** | $140,000 | $210,000 | Hire 2 U.S. crew, first-year cost |
| **TOTAL CREW EXPOSURE** | **$952,240** | **$171,022,240** | Depends on enforcement timing |

**Probability-Weighted Exposure:**
- Low scenario (immediate correction): $952,240 × 70% = **$666,568**
- High scenario (forfeiture if audit): $171M × 10% = **$17,100,000**
- **Expected exposure: $17.8M** (blended probability)

#### Offshore Wind Vessel Violations (Critical Issue #8)

| Exposure Type | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Basis |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Vessel forfeiture** | $56,000,000 | $56,000,000 | 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c): $28M per vessel × 2 |
| **Civil penalties (historical 2023-2024)** | $100,000,000 | $300,000,000 | Merchandise value: $5M-$15M per voyage × 20 voyages |
| **Civil penalties (ongoing if not corrected)** | $100,000,000 | $300,000,000 | Annual exposure: 10 voyages/vessel × 2 vessels × $5M-$15M |
| **Revenue loss (cease operations)** | $5,000,000 | $8,000,000 | Annual U.S. offshore wind revenue |
| **Contract termination penalties** | $2,000,000 | $5,000,000 | Liquidated damages (early termination) |
| **International redeployment cost** | $1,000,000 | $2,000,000 | Mobilization to Europe/Asia |
| **TOTAL OFFSHORE WIND EXPOSURE** | **$264,000,000** | **$671,000,000** | Depends on CBP enforcement |

**Probability-Weighted Exposure:**
- International redeployment (70% probability): $8M revenue recovery, $1M-$2M mobilization cost = **Net $6M-$7M benefit**
- CBP enforcement if operations continue (50% probability): $156M-$356M penalties × 50% = **$78M-$178M exposure**
- **Expected exposure (if immediate remediation): $8M-$10M** (revenue loss + mobilization + contract termination)

#### Combined Total Exposure

| Scenario | Crew Citizenship | Offshore Wind | Total Exposure |
|----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Best Case (Immediate Remediation)** | $952,240 | $8,000,000 | **$8,952,240** |
| **Likely Case (90-Day Correction + International Redeployment)** | $666,568 | $10,000,000 | **$10,666,568** |
| **Worst Case (Enforcement Before Correction)** | $171,022,240 | $671,000,000 | **$842,022,240** |

**RECOMMENDATION:** Immediate remediation (90-day crew compliance + offshore wind international redeployment) reduces exposure from **$842M (worst case)** to **$11M (likely case)** — **98.7% risk reduction**.

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Jones Act Compliance Status: NON-COMPLIANT (Critical Deficiencies)**

PMSC's Jones Act fleet presents **two material compliance failures** requiring immediate corrective action:

**(a) Crew Citizenship Violation (46 U.S.C. § 8103(b)):**
- **M/V Island Express** and **M/V Pacific Voyager** operate at **73.3% U.S. crew** (22/30), below the statutory **75% requirement** (23/30 required)
- Each vessel is **1 crew member short** of compliance
- **Violation occurs on every voyage** operated at current crew composition
- **Civil penalty exposure:** $162,448 annually ($812,240 over 5-year look-back)
- **Criminal forfeiture exposure:** $170 million vessel value (extreme scenario if Coast Guard audit before correction)

**(b) Offshore Wind Vessels Jones Act Ineligible (46 U.S.C. § 55102):**
- **2 COSCO-built vessels** ($56 million total value) are **foreign-built**, rendering them **statutorily ineligible** for coastwise endorsements under 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A)
- **CBP September 2023 ruling** confirmed offshore wind installation on U.S. OCS creates **coastwise points** subject to Jones Act restrictions
- Current operations (turbine component transport from U.S. ports to OCS sites) **violate 46 U.S.C. § 55102**
- **Civil penalty exposure:** $100M-$300M annually (merchandise value-based)
- **Vessel forfeiture exposure:** $56 million
- **Historical exposure (2023-2024):** $200M-$600M

**2. Legal Certainty: HIGH (Statutory Requirements Unambiguous)**

- 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b) 75% crew citizenship requirement is **clear and non-discretionary**
- 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A) U.S.-built requirement for coastwise endorsements is **absolute** (no waiver for foreign construction)
- CBP August 2024 confirmation of offshore wind Jones Act applicability provides **high regulatory certainty**

**3. Total Exposure Range: $11M - $842M** (Depending on Enforcement Timing and Remediation)

| Scenario | Probability | Crew Citizenship | Offshore Wind | Total |
|----------|-------------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| **Best Case (Immediate Remediation)** | 70% | $952,240 | $8,000,000 | **$8.95M** |
| **Likely Case (90-Day Correction)** | 20% | $666,568 | $10,000,000 | **$10.67M** |
| **Worst Case (Enforcement First)** | 10% | $171,022,240 | $671,000,000 | **$842.02M** |

**Expected Value (Probability-Weighted): $27.8M**

| **Evaluate COSCO vessel sale to international operators** | 2026 | Asset recovery $20M-$28M per vessel |

---

### C. Outstanding Questions Requiring Data Room Access

**1. Crew Citizenship Historical Verification:**
- **Question:** When did M/V Island Express and M/V Pacific Voyager first drop below 75% U.S. crew?
- **Data Required:** Historical crew manifests (2020-2025), NVDC submissions, Coast Guard inspection reports
- **Relevance:** Determines look-back penalty exposure (statute of limitations 5 years under 28 U.S.C. § 2462)

**2. Offshore Wind Contract Force Majeure Provisions:**
- **Question:** Do offshore wind service contracts contain Jones Act compliance assumptions or force majeure clauses for regulatory impossibility?
- **Data Required:** Complete offshore wind service contracts (2023-2025)
- **Relevance:** Determines liquidated damages exposure for early termination ($2M-$5M estimate)

**3. COSCO Vessel Voyage Logs (2023-2024):**
- **Question:** How many U.S. port → OCS voyages have COSCO vessels completed?
- **Data Required:** Voyage logs, cargo manifests, port call records
- **Relevance:** Calculates precise civil penalty exposure ($5M-$15M per voyage × actual voyage count)

**4. PMSC NVDC Filings (False Certification Risk):**
- **Question:** Did PMSC certify crew citizenship compliance in NVDC filings despite 73% crew composition?
- **Data Required:** NVDC annual vessel documentation renewals, crew list certifications
- **Relevance:** False certification under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 creates criminal exposure (fines, imprisonment up to 5 years)

**5. Jones Act Waiver Precedent (PMSC-Specific):**
- **Question:** Has PMSC previously sought or obtained MARAD Jones Act waivers?
- **Data Required:** MARAD correspondence, waiver applications (if any)
- **Relevance:** Precedent for MARAD waiver success probability (currently estimated 30-40%)

---

### D. Transaction-Specific Recommendations

**1. Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) Provisions:**

**(a) Representations and Warranties:**

---

### E. Risk Mitigation Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Immediate remediation reduces total exposure from **$842M (worst case)** to **$11M (likely case)** — a **98.7% risk reduction**.

| Risk | Pre-Remediation Exposure | Post-Remediation Exposure | Reduction |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Crew citizenship penalties** | $812,240 (5-year) + $170M forfeiture | $952,240 (compliance cost + minimal penalties) | **99.4%** |
| **Offshore wind penalties** | $56M-$600M (forfeiture + civil penalties) | $8M-$10M (revenue loss + redeployment) | **98.3%** |
| **TOTAL** | **$812M** | **$11M** | **98.7%** |

**TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION:** Condition closing on 90-day crew citizenship correction and immediate offshore wind operations cessation. Risk is **manageable and economically remediable** with proper corrective action.

## IX. APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Statutory Cross-Reference Table

| Statute | Title | Key Provisions | Relevance to PMSC |
|---------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **46 U.S.C. § 55102** | Jones Act (coastwise trade) | U.S.-built/flagged/owned/crewed requirement for domestic maritime commerce | COSCO vessels ineligible (foreign-built); crew citizenship non-compliance creates coastwise trade violation |
| **46 U.S.C. § 8103** | Crew citizenship requirements | 75% U.S. citizens for unlicensed crew | M/V Island Express and M/V Pacific Voyager at 73.3% (non-compliant) |
| **46 U.S.C. § 12112** | Coastwise endorsement requirements | U.S.-built requirement (absolute) | COSCO vessels statutory ineligible (foreign-built) |
| **46 U.S.C. § 501(b)** | MARAD Jones Act waiver authority | Case-by-case, vessel-by-vessel, voyage-by-voyage | Backup option for COSCO vessels (30-40% success probability) |
| **43 U.S.C. § 1333** | OCSLA (Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act) | 2021 amendment extends to "non-mineral energy resources" | Brings offshore wind installations within Jones Act jurisdiction |
| **28 U.S.C. § 2462** | Statute of limitations (civil penalties) | 5-year look-back period | Crew citizenship penalties: $162K annually × 5 years = $812K exposure |
| **18 U.S.C. § 1001** | False statements to federal agencies | Criminal liability for false certifications | Risk if PMSC certified Jones Act compliance to NVDC despite crew non-compliance |

### Appendix B: Penalty Calculation Worksheets

**Crew Citizenship Violations (46 U.S.C. § 8103(f)):**
```
Base penalty (statute): $500 per individual
Inflation-adjusted (2025): $1,562 per individual
Excess foreign crew: 1 per vessel (27% vs. 25% limit = 1 crew member)
Voyages per vessel annually: 52
Vessels affected: 2 (M/V Island Express, M/V Pacific Voyager)

Annual penalty per vessel: $1,562 × 52 = $81,224
Total annual penalty (2 vessels): $81,224 × 2 = $162,448
5-year look-back: $162,448 × 5 = $812,240
```

**Offshore Wind Civil Penalties (46 U.S.C. § 55102(c)):**
```
Penalty formula: Greater of (merchandise value) OR (transportation cost)
Turbine component value per voyage: $5M - $15M (estimated)
Transportation cost per voyage: $500K - $1M (estimated)
Penalty per voyage: $5M - $15M (merchandise value higher)

Annual exposure (10 voyages/vessel × 2 vessels):
Low: 10 × 2 × $5M = $100M
High: 10 × 2 × $15M = $300M

Historical exposure (2023-2024, 20 voyages total):
Low: 20 × $5M = $100M
High: 20 × $15M = $300M
```

### Appendix C: Timeline for Crew Citizenship Correction

**90-Day Corrective Action Plan:**

| Week | Milestone | Action | Responsible Party | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Job posting | Engage SIU hiring hall (Piney Point, MD), dispatch AB/QMED ratings | PMSC Crewing Dept | Pending |
| 2-4 | Background checks | USCG criminal history, drug testing | Selected candidates | Pending |
| 2-6 | TWIC application | TSA security threat assessment, fingerprints, photos | Selected candidates | Pending (60-day standard) |
| 3-6 | MMC endorsement | Medical exam, STCW certification verification | Selected candidates | Pending |
| 7-8 | Vessel training | 46 CFR § 15.1105 familiarization, emergency procedures | PMSC Training Dept | Pending |
| 9-10 | Vessel assignment | Assign to M/V Island Express and M/V Pacific Voyager | PMSC Crewing Dept | Pending |

| **Foreign-built statutory bar (COSCO)** | HIGH | 4 | User data + 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A) + CBP guidance + MARAD waiver limitations |
| **Civil penalty calculations** | MEDIUM | 3 | Statutory formulas (46 U.S.C. § 8103(f), § 55102(c)) + Federal Register inflation adjustment + expert judgment for merchandise value estimates |
| **International redeployment revenue** | MEDIUM | 2 | Industry charter rates (North Sea offshore wind) + expert judgment for utilization assumptions |
| **Forfeiture risk probability** | MEDIUM | 2 | CBP enforcement precedent (*Furie* $15M, Alaska fish $350M) + expert judgment for probability weighting |

**OVERALL CONFIDENCE: HIGH** (statutory requirements and CBP rulings provide high certainty; exposure calculations rely on reasonable estimates with disclosed methodologies)

### Known Limitations

1. **User-provided crew data not independently verified:** Crew manifests (22/30 U.S. citizens) require verification via Coast Guard NVDC crew lists in data room. If actual U.S. citizen percentage is lower (e.g., 21/30 = 70%), exposure increases.

2. **Offshore wind voyage count unknown:** Historical exposure calculation assumes 10 voyages/year per vessel (2023-2024). Actual voyage logs required from data room to refine exposure estimate ($5M-$15M per voyage × actual voyage count).

3. **Merchandise value estimates:** Turbine component value ($5M-$15M per voyage) based on industry knowledge. Actual cargo manifests and CBP merchandise value determinations may differ.

4. **MARAD waiver success probability:** Estimated 30-40% based on general MARAD waiver practice. PMSC-specific factors (U.S.-flag vessel availability, national interest arguments) may increase or decrease probability.

5. **International redeployment revenue:** Estimated $10M-$20M annually based on comparable North Sea offshore wind charter rates. Actual European/Asian market conditions, vessel specifications, and client demand may differ.

**MITIGATION:** All exposure ranges provided (low-high estimates) bracket uncertainty. Data room access will enable refinement of estimates to precise figures.
