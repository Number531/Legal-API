## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (PMSC) operates a 22-vessel fleet (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers) subject to comprehensive International Maritime Organization (IMO) environmental regulations under MARPOL 73/78. This report identifies **material environmental compliance risks totaling $65M-$99M exposure** (worst-case scenarios; base case $15M-$20M with mitigation), concentrated in two critical areas: (1) **IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) D-rated vessels** (2 bulk carriers, $55.95M impairment risk if scrapped), and (2) **MARPOL Annex VI NOx Tier III non-compliance** (2 vessels with inoperative Selective Catalytic Reduction systems, $9.55M-$15M repair and penalty exposure).

**Risk Rating: HIGH**. The combination of CII D-rating (year 1 of 3-year watch period requiring corrective action) and deliberate NOx non-compliance (PMSC management decision to defer SCR repairs since 2023) creates immediate regulatory and commercial risks. However, both issues are **remediable**: CII D-rating manageable via speed optimization ($1.4M/year cost); NOx non-compliance fixable via SCR repairs ($9.55M total cost including drydock revenue loss). Recommended SPA purchase price adjustment: **$26.5M-$38M** for environmental compliance liabilities.

### Critical Issues Summary (Research Plan Checklist #7)

#### **ISSUE #7: CII D-Rated Vessels (M/V Pacific Bulk I, M/V Pacific Bulk II) - $55.95M-$83.95M Exposure**

**Regulatory Framework:**
IMO MEPC.328(76) (June 2021) amended MARPOL Annex VI to establish operational Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) requirements effective January 1, 2023. All vessels ≥5,000 GT must calculate annual CII (gCO₂/ton-mile) and receive A-E rating. Ships rated **D for three consecutive years** or **E for one year** must submit mandatory corrective action plan (SEEMP Part III) to flag state administration.

**PMSC D-Rated Vessels:**

| Vessel | Built | DWT | 2024 CII Rating | gCO₂/ton-mile | C Threshold | Gap |
|--------|-------|-----|-----------------|---------------|-------------|-----|
| M/V Pacific Bulk I | 2008 | 74,000 | **D** | 12.8 | 12.5 | **2.3% above** |
| M/V Pacific Bulk II | 2009 | 76,000 | **D** | 13.2 | 12.5 | **5.3% above** |

**Three-Year Enforcement Timeline:**
- **2024 (year 1)**: D rating recorded; no immediate consequences
- **2025 (year 2)**: If D rating persists → increased flag state scrutiny, charterer concerns, 10-15% charter rate discount
- **2026 (year 3)**: If D rating persists → **MANDATORY** SEEMP Part III corrective action plan submission to U.S. Coast Guard within 1 month
- **2027 (year 4)**: If D rating persists → **SANCTIONS**: Port state control detention risk, charter market exclusion (major shippers specify C-rated or better vessels), commercial unviability

**Financial Exposure Analysis:**

*Scenario 1: Scrap Vessels (Worst Case)*
- Book value: $34.3M per vessel × 2 = **$68.6M**
- Scrap value: $6.25M-$6.4M per vessel × 2 = **$12.65M** (based on $500/LDT scrap market)
- **Impairment loss: $55.95M**
- Revenue loss: $14M/year × 2 vessels = **$28M/year**
- **Total worst-case exposure: $83.95M** (impairment + 1-year revenue loss)

*Scenario 2: Speed Optimization to Achieve C Rating (Base Case)*
- Reduce service speed from 14.5 knots to 13.5 knots (7% reduction)
- CII improvement: 10-12% reduction in gCO₂/ton-mile → achieves C rating (11.5-12.0 range)
- Revenue impact: ~5% fewer voyages/year = **$700K/year per vessel** ($1.4M total)
- **Annual ongoing cost: $1.4M/year** (acceptable as cost of environmental compliance)

*Scenario 3: Engine Retrofit (Medium-Term Option)*
- Engine Power Limitation (EPL) installation: $9M-$13M capital + $9M drydock revenue loss = **$18M-$22M total**
- CII improvement: 5-10% reduction → achieves C rating
- ROI: Payback 5.7 years (only economical if long-term vessel hold 8-10 years)

*Scenario 4: Scrap and Replace with Modern Tonnage (Long-Term Optimal)*
- Net replacement investment: $81.35M (secondhand 2018-2020 eco-design vessels) to $107.35M (newbuilding)
- Benefits: $9.8M/year fuel savings + $4.2M/year higher charter rates = **$14M/year**
- ROI: Payback 5.8 years (economically viable if 8-10 year hold)

**Charter Market Impact:**
Major commodity shippers (agricultural exporters, mining companies) increasingly specify **C-rated or better vessels** in charter party agreements due to ESG commitments (Scope 3 emissions reporting). Industry analysis indicates **10-15% charter rate discount** for D-rated vessels vs. C-rated comparable tonnage. Revenue impact: $14M annual revenue × 12.5% = **$1.75M per vessel per year** ($3.5M total for 2 vessels).

**Accounting Impact:**
If vessels scrapped in 2025, PMSC must record **$55.95M impairment charge** (write down book value $68.6M to scrap value $12.65M). Tax benefit: $55.95M ordinary loss × 21% corporate rate = **$11.75M** (reduces net after-tax loss to $44.2M). Impact on equity: $55.95M reduction in shareholders' equity; may trigger ship mortgage debt covenant review (vessel collateral value reduction).

#### **MARPOL Annex VI NOx Tier III Non-Compliance (M/V Pacific Odyssey, M/V Pacific Pioneer) - $9.55M-$15M Exposure**

**Regulatory Violation:**
MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 13 requires vessels with keel laid on/after January 1, 2016 to achieve NOx Tier III standards (80% reduction vs. Tier I) when operating in Emission Control Areas (ECAs). Technology: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). PMSC operates 8 Tier III vessels; 6 have operational SCR systems, **2 vessels have inoperative SCR systems** since 2023 Q4.

**Non-Compliance History:**
- **2023 Q2**: SCR catalyst degradation detected (both vessels)
- **2023 Q3**: SCR ammonia injection system failures (dosing pumps, urea crystallization)
- **2023 Q4**: **PMSC management decision: Do NOT repair SCR systems** (cost avoidance measure, defer $6.9M-$10M expense)
- **2024-present**: Vessels operating in North American ECA **without functional SCR** = MARPOL Annex VI violation
- **2024 violation days**: 345 days total (M/V Pacific Odyssey 180 days, M/V Pacific Pioneer 165 days)

**Legal Exposure:**

*Civil Penalties (33 U.S.C. § 1908(b)):*
- Statutory maximum: **$25,000 per day per violation**
- 345 days × $25,000/day = **$8.625M maximum penalty**
- **Realistic assessment** [METHODOLOGY: USCG settlement precedent]: 20-40% of statutory maximum for non-knowing violations
- Expected penalty: $8.625M × 30% = **$2.59M**
- Settlement range: **$1.5M-$3.5M**

*Port State Control Detection Risk:*
- U.S. Coast Guard PSC inspection rate: ~15% of port calls undergo full MARPOL Annex VI inspection
- Combined annual PSC exposure: ~7 inspections/year for both vessels
- Detection probability (if PSC inspection occurs): 80-90% (visual inspection of SCR catalyst, emissions testing)
- **Cumulative 2024-2025 detection risk: 50-60%** (if both vessels continue ECA operations unrepaired)

*PSC Detention Consequences:*
- Vessel detained until SCR repaired or vessel departs ECA
- Detention duration: 7-14 days average (propulsion/machinery deficiencies)
- Revenue loss: 10 days × $150K/day = **$1.5M per vessel**
- Reputational damage: PSC detention published in USCG Marine Safety Information Bulletin (visible to charterers/shippers)

**Remediation Cost:**

| Component | M/V Pacific Odyssey | M/V Pacific Pioneer | Total |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| SCR catalyst module replacement | $1.0M | $1.1M | $2.1M |
| Ammonia injection system overhaul | $600K | $650K | $1.25M |
| Drydock / shipyard fees | $400K | $400K | $800K |
| **Capital cost subtotal** | **$2.0M** | **$2.15M** | **$4.15M** |
| Revenue loss (18 days drydock) | $2.7M | $2.7M | $5.4M |
| **Total cost (incl. revenue loss)** | **$4.7M** | **$4.85M** | **$9.55M** |

**Timeline:** 4-5 months from decision to operational (30 days engineering + 90-120 days parts procurement + 18 days drydock/installation). **Immediate mitigation**: Limit vessels to non-ECA routes (Trans-Pacific China-Japan, Intra-Asia) until SCR repaired; eliminates PSC detention risk, revenue impact ~10% reduction = $1.4M/year per vessel.

**Total NOx Non-Compliance Exposure:**
- Base case (repair + no detection): **$9.55M**
- Adverse case (repair + penalty): **$11M-$13M** ($9.55M + $1.5M-$3.5M penalty)
- Worst case (repair + penalty + detention): **$12.5M-$15M** ($9.55M + $2.59M penalty + $3M detention)

### Secondary Environmental Compliance Issues

#### **M/V Pacific Titan BWMS Failure - $6.65M Net Cost (Already Incurred)**

**Incident:** March 2023 ballast water management system (BWMS) electrolysis unit failure led to inadequate treatment chemical generation. Untreated ballast water with high bacterial content accelerated microbial-induced corrosion (MIC) in ballast tanks. November 2024 emergency drydock for ballast tank corrosion repair.

**Financial Impact:**
- Total repair cost: **$18.7M** (ballast tank recoating $8.2M + structural steel replacement $6.8M + drydock fees $3.7M)
- Insurance recovery: **$12.05M** (marine hull policy, $2M deductible)
- **Net cost to PMSC: $6.65M**
- Revenue loss: 45 days out of service × $150K/day = **$6.75M**
- **Total net exposure: $13.4M** (net repair cost + revenue loss)

**Status:** BWMS replacement completed November 2024 ($2.8M); Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection renewed December 2024 through December 2025. **Ongoing risk**: Fleet-wide BWMS failures if maintenance inadequate. **Mitigation required**: Enhanced BWMS preventive maintenance program fleet-wide ($150K-$250K annual for 22 vessels).

#### **MARPOL Annex I Oil Pollution Prevention - LOW Risk (Verification Required)**

**Compliance Status:** 22 vessels equipped with IMO type-approved Oily Water Separators (OWS); no reported MARPOL Annex I violations or PSC detentions (2022-2024) [STATED]. Oil Record Book maintenance per MARPOL Annex I Regulation 17.

**Residual Risk:** **Virtually all MARPOL prosecutions** in U.S. involve false Oil Record Book entries or failure to record illegal discharges. Criminal penalties up to **$500,000 per violation** (33 U.S.C. § 1908(a)). **Verification required**: Independent audit of Oil Record Books (all 22 vessels, last 3 years), OWS calibration records, crew training documentation.

#### **EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) - CONTINGENT Risk (No Current Exposure)**

**Status:** PMSC operates NO Europe routes (Trans-Pacific, Intra-Asia, U.S. coastwise only). EU ETS applies only to vessels calling EU/EEA ports. **No immediate financial exposure.**

**Contingent Exposure (If Europe Routes Added Post-Acquisition):**
- 2026 full compliance (100% of emissions): **$6M/year** (assuming 4 vessels deployed to Trans-Atlantic or Asia-Europe routes)
- 2026 carbon price: €86/ton CO₂ ($99.78/ton at 1.16 EUR/USD)
- Competitive disadvantage: European carriers already absorbed EU ETS costs in pricing; PMSC late entrant faces margin compression

**Mitigation (If Europe Expansion Pursued):** Deploy A-rated or B-rated CII vessels (lower fuel consumption → lower EU ETS cost); negotiate EU ETS pass-through clauses in service contracts (shippers bear cost); evaluate profitability (Europe freight rates must exceed Trans-Pacific by $1.5M-$2M/vessel/year to offset EU ETS).

### Key Takeaways (Transaction Decision-Makers)

1. **CII D-Rated Vessels**: 2024 is **year 1 of 3-year watch period**. Immediate action required (speed optimization to 13.5 knots, $1.4M/year cost) to achieve C rating in 2025 and avoid year 2 D rating. If no improvement by 2027, vessels face charter market exclusion ($3.5M/year revenue loss) or scrapping ($55.95M impairment).

2. **NOx Tier III Non-Compliance**: Deliberate management decision to defer SCR repairs since 2023 Q4 creates **50-60% PSC detection probability** over 18 months. **Fixable** via SCR repairs ($9.55M total cost), but requires immediate action. Recommend **SPA purchase price adjustment $6.5M-$8M** OR seller repairs pre-closing.

3. **Environmental Compliance is Manageable**: Both critical issues are **remediable** with defined costs ($1.4M/year speed optimization + $9.55M SCR repairs = $10.95M-$11M total). Worst-case scenario ($65M-$99M exposure) avoidable via proactive mitigation. **Base case exposure: $15M-$20M** with recommended actions.

4. **SPA Purchase Price Adjustment**: Recommend **$26.5M-$38M reduction** from $4.8B to $4.762B-$4.774B for environmental compliance liabilities. Alternative: Seller remediates pre-closing (achieves C rating, repairs SCR systems), no purchase price adjustment.

5. **Post-Acquisition CapEx Budget**: Year 1 environmental compliance capital expenditures: SCR repairs $4.15M + CII improvement study $0.25M + enhanced BWMS maintenance $0.2M + classification society audit $0.4M = **$5M Year 1 CapEx** (if Seller does not remediate pre-closing).

---

### Risk Assessment: HIGH

**Overall IMO environmental compliance risk for $4.8B acquisition: HIGH**, driven by CII D-rated vessels ($55.95M-$83.95M exposure if scrapped) and NOx Tier III non-compliance ($9.55M-$15M repair/penalty/detention exposure). **Total quantified exposure: $65M-$99M worst-case; $15M-$20M base case with mitigation.**

**Mitigating factors**: Both issues remediable via speed optimization ($1.4M/year) and SCR repairs ($9.55M); MARPOL Annex I compliance appears adequate (verification required); EU ETS not applicable (no Europe routes). **Aggravating factors**: 2024 is year 1 of CII 3-year watch period (limited time to improve); NOx non-compliance high PSC detection probability (50-60%); bulk carrier market depression makes vessel write-downs economically painful.

**Recommendation**: Negotiate SPA purchase price adjustment $26.5M-$38M for environmental compliance liabilities OR require Seller to remediate pre-closing (achieve C rating, repair SCR systems). Implement speed optimization immediately post-closing; expedite SCR repairs Q2 2025. Fleet-wide environmental compliance audit via classification society ($280K-$450K) recommended pre-closing.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Legal Framework: IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)

#### 1. MARPOL Annex VI Amendments - IMO MEPC.328(76) [VERIFIED]

On June 17, 2021, the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 76) adopted resolution MEPC.328(76), introducing amendments to MARPOL Annex VI containing short-term greenhouse gas reduction measures.¹ These amendments established two critical regulatory mechanisms:

- **Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI)**: Technical measure requiring one-time compliance verification
- **Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)**: Operational measure requiring annual compliance rating

The amendments entered into force on **November 1, 2022**, with requirements for EEXI and CII certification taking effect from **January 1, 2023**.²

#### 2. CII Rating System (A-E Scale)

Starting January 1, 2023, all ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above must calculate and report their operational Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which links CO₂ emissions to the ship's capacity over distance traveled.³ The rating system classifies vessels from A (best) to E (worst):

| Rating | Performance Category | Distribution | Status |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| **A** | Major Superior | Top 20% | Exceeds requirements |
| **B** | Minor Superior | Next 20% | Above requirements |
| **C** | Moderate | Middle 30% | **COMPLIANT** |
| **D** | Minor Inferior | Next 20% | Below requirements |
| **E** | Inferior | Bottom 10% | Significantly below requirements |

**CII Calculation Formula:**
```
CII = (Mass of CO₂ emitted) / (Transport work)
Where: Transport work = Cargo capacity (DWT) × Distance traveled (nautical miles)
Units: gCO₂/ton-mile
```

#### 3. Three-Consecutive-Year Rule - Mandatory Corrective Action [CRITICAL]

**IMO MEPC.337(76) Section 2.1.3**: A ship rated **D for three consecutive years**, or **E for one year**, must submit a corrective action plan demonstrating how the required index of **C or above** will be achieved.⁴

**SEEMP Part III Requirements:**
- The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) Part III must be updated with a corrective action plan
- The revised SEEMP must be submitted within **one month** after reporting the attained annual operational CII
- The corrective action plan must be **verified by the flag state Administration or a Recognized Organization (RO)** before a Statement of Compliance can be issued⁵
- Ships cannot receive their Statement of Compliance without completing this process⁶

**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Year 1 (D rating): No immediate consequences, monitoring required
- Year 2 (D rating): Increased scrutiny from flag state, charterer concerns
- Year 3 (D rating): **MANDATORY** corrective action plan submission
- Year 4: Must achieve C rating or face sanctions (port state control detention, charter market exclusion)

#### 4. CII Reduction Factors (2023-2030 Timeline)

The required CII becomes progressively more stringent each year, with annual improvement targets relative to a 2019 baseline:⁷

| Year | Required Reduction (Z Factor) | Annual Improvement |
|------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| 2023 | 5% | Baseline compliance |
| 2024 | 7% | ~2% improvement |
| 2025 | 9% | ~2% improvement |
| **2026** | **11%** | ~2% improvement |
| 2027 | 13% | 2% improvement |
| 2028 | 15% | 2% improvement |
| 2029 | 17% | 2% improvement |
| 2030 | 19% | 2% improvement |

**2026 Significance:**
- **Mandatory IMO review**: The Marine Environment Protection Committee must review the effectiveness of CII and EEXI implementation by January 1, 2026 at the latest⁸
- **Two-phase review process**: Phase 1 concludes in 2026; Phase 2 commencing January 1, 2026 may tighten targets further⁹
- Analysis suggests **approximately one-third of vessels will be D or E rated** if current operational behavior continues, rising toward **50% by 2026** without modification of speed or specification¹⁰

#### 5. U.S. Implementation: Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships

**Statutory Authority:**
- 33 U.S.C. §§ 1901-1915 (Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships - APPS)
- 33 U.S.C. § 1902(a)(3): Secretary of Transportation authorized to enforce MARPOL Protocol
- 33 CFR Part 151, Subparts A-F: MARPOL implementation regulations

**Enforcement Agencies:**
- **U.S. Coast Guard**: Primary enforcement authority for vessel inspections, port state control
- **Environmental Protection Agency**: Joint enforcement authority under June 27, 2011 MOU¹¹

**Flag State Responsibilities (U.S.-flagged vessels):**
- U.S. Coast Guard calculates CII rating based on ship's reported fuel consumption via IMO Data Collection System (DCS)¹²
- Annual verification and Statement of Compliance issuance
- Monitoring of D-rated vessels for three-consecutive-year compliance

### B. MARPOL Annex VI Air Emissions Framework

#### 1. Sulfur Oxide (SOx) Limits - Global 0.5% Cap

**Regulation 14 - SOx Emissions:**
- **Global limit**: 0.50% sulfur content in fuel oil (effective January 1, 2020)¹³
- **Emission Control Area (ECA) limit**: 0.10% sulfur content
- **North American ECA**: Extends 200 nautical miles from U.S./Canadian coasts (Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf, Alaska, Hawaii)

**Compliance Methods:**
1. Use of compliant fuel oil (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil - VLSFO ≤ 0.5% sulfur)
2. Installation of exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) with equivalent emission reductions
3. Use of alternative fuels (LNG, methanol, ammonia)

**PMSC Fleet Compliance Method [STATED]:**
- 20 vessels: VLSFO (very low sulfur fuel oil)
- 2 vessels: Exhaust gas scrubbers (open-loop or hybrid systems)

#### 2. Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) Limits - Tier III Requirements

**Regulation 13 - NOx Emissions:**

| Tier | Ship Construction Date | NOx Limit | Reduction vs. Tier I | Applicability |
|------|----------------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| Tier I | 2000-2010 | 17.0 g/kWh (n=130 rpm) | Baseline | Global |
| Tier II | 2011-2015 | 14.4 g/kWh (n=130 rpm) | 15-20% | Global |
| **Tier III** | **2016+** | **3.4 g/kWh (n=130 rpm)** | **75-80%** | **ECA only** |

**NOx Tier III Applicability:**
- Engines installed on vessels with **keel laid on or after January 1, 2016**
- Operating in designated **Emission Control Areas (ECAs)**
- North American ECA (effective 2016), Baltic Sea ECA (effective 2021), North Sea ECA (effective 2021)

**Technology Requirements:**
Tier III standards require dedicated NOx emission control technologies:¹⁴
1. **Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)**: Primary technology, uses urea/ammonia injection at 300-400°C exhaust gas temperature, achieves 80%+ NOx reduction
2. **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)**: Alternative technology, recirculates cooled exhaust gas to combustion chamber
3. **Dual-fuel engines**: LNG as primary fuel, achieves Tier III compliance without aftertreatment

**Port State Control Verification:**
- PSC inspectors may conduct engine emissions testing if non-compliance suspected
- International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) members verify compliance as Recognized Organizations for flag administrations¹⁵

#### 3. MARPOL Annex VI Enforcement - 33 U.S.C. § 1908 Penalties [CRITICAL]

**Civil Penalties (33 U.S.C. § 1908(b)):**
- **General violations**: Up to **$25,000 per violation per day**¹⁶
- **False statements**: Up to **$5,000 per statement**, with each day of continuing violation constituting a separate violation¹⁷

**Criminal Penalties (33 U.S.C. § 1908(a)):**
- **Knowing violations**: Class D felony
- **Maximum fine for organizational defendants**: **$500,000 per violation**¹⁸

**Port State Control Detention Authority:**
- 33 U.S.C. § 1908(e): Secretary may detain vessel if violation presents threat to environment or public health
- Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) retains detention authority for serious violations
- Detention may continue until deficiency corrected or financial security posted¹⁹

**USCG/EPA Joint Enforcement Protocol:**
- June 27, 2011 Memorandum of Understanding: USCG and EPA jointly enforce Annex VI
- Enforcement options include: Letter of Warning, Notice of Violation (NOV), civil penalty referral to EPA, criminal referral to Department of Justice²⁰
- **Historical enforcement**: U.S. government prosecutes approximately **8-10 MARPOL cases per year**, primarily for oil record book falsification, resulting in high penalties²¹

**Port State Control Inspection Statistics:**
- Paris MoU (2014): 18,430 inspections, 612 detentions (3.79% detention rate)²²
- Tokyo MoU: 3.45% average detention rate²³
- **Pollution prevention deficiencies**: Among top four most common PSC detention categories²⁴
- **U.S. Coast Guard PSC inspection rate**: Approximately **15% of vessel port calls** undergo full MARPOL Annex VI inspection [METHODOLOGY: Industry average]

---

### C. MARPOL Annex I Oil Pollution Prevention

#### 1. Regulation 15 - Oil Discharge Limits

**Operational Discharge Standards (33 CFR § 151.10):**
- Oil content of discharge: ≤ **15 parts per million (ppm)** when vessel underway
- Oily Water Separator (OWS) required on all vessels ≥ 400 GT
- 15 ppm Bilge Alarm must be operational and calibrated

**Oil Record Book Requirements:**
- MARPOL Annex I requires detailed recording of all oil-related operations (ballast, bilge discharge, oil transfers, tank cleaning)
- **Virtually all MARPOL prosecutions** in the U.S. involve false entries in Oil Record Books or failure to record illegal discharges²⁵
- Consequences: Detention by port state control, monetary fines up to $500,000 per violation (criminal), vessel detention

#### 2. PMSC Fleet Compliance Status [STATED - PENDING VERIFICATION]

- 22 vessels equipped with IMO type-approved Oily Water Separators (OWS)
- Oil Record Book maintenance per MARPOL Annex I Regulation 17
- No reported MARPOL Annex I violations or port state control detentions (2022-2024)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **LOW**: Assuming OWS systems properly maintained and Oil Record Books accurately maintained
- **Verification required**: Independent OWS calibration records, Oil Record Book audit by classification society

---

### D. Ballast Water Management Convention Compliance

#### 1. IMO BWM Convention - D-2 Standard (Effective September 8, 2024)

**Regulation D-2 - Ballast Water Performance Standard:**
- Compliance deadline: **September 8, 2024** (final phase-in date)²⁶
- All vessels ≥ 400 GT engaged in international voyages must have IMO type-approved Ballast Water Management System (BWMS)
- D-2 discharge standard limits: < 10 viable organisms/m³ (≥50 μm), < 10 viable organisms/mL (10-50 μm)

#### 2. BWMS Operational Challenges and Failure Risks

**Challenging Water Quality (CWQ) Conditions:**
- IMO MEPC.387(81) addresses operational challenges when BWMS operates in challenging water quality conditions (high sediment, low salinity, extreme temperatures)²⁷
- **Common failure mode**: BWMS bypassed during ballasting operations when system cannot handle CWQ, making compliance with D-2 standard significantly more difficult²⁸

**Corrosion Risks from BWMS Chemical Treatment:**
- Active chemicals (hypochlorite, chlorine, ozone) are **highly corrosive** to ballast tank coatings²⁹
- Coating failure costly to owner (drydock repair, tank recoating) and poses adverse environmental impact
- **Approximately 5 billion tonnes of ballast water** transferred internationally every year, requiring pre-approved ballast tank coatings to mitigate corrosion³⁰

#### 3. M/V Pacific Titan Case Study - BWMS Failure and Hull Corrosion [CRITICAL ISSUE #11]

**Incident Timeline:**
- **March 2023**: M/V Pacific Titan ballast water management system malfunction detected
- **June-August 2023**: Continued BWMS operational issues, ballast tank corrosion accelerating
- **November 2024**: Emergency drydock for ballast tank corrosion repair

**Financial Impact:**
- Total repair cost: **$18.7 million** (ballast tank recoating $8.2M, structural steel replacement $6.8M, drydock fees $3.7M)
- Insurance recovery: **$12.05 million** (marine hull policy, $2 million deductible)
- Net cost to PMSC: **$6.65 million**
- Revenue loss: 45 days out of service (drydock 30 days + transit 15 days) × $150K/day = **$6.75 million**
- **Total net exposure: $13.4 million**

**Root Cause Analysis [STATED]:**
- BWMS electrolysis unit failure led to inadequate treatment chemical generation
- Untreated ballast water with high bacterial content accelerated microbial-induced corrosion (MIC)
- Ballast tank coating degradation from prior BWMS chemical treatment (chlorine exposure) exacerbated corrosion susceptibility

**Regulatory Compliance Status:**
- BWMS replacement completed November 2024: New IMO type-approved system installed ($2.8 million)
- Coast Guard annual inspection passed December 2024: Certificate of Inspection (COI) renewed through December 2025
- **Risk mitigation**: Enhanced BWMS preventive maintenance program implemented fleet-wide ($150K-$250K annual cost for 22 vessels)

### E. CII D-Rated Vessels - Detailed Analysis [CRITICAL ISSUE #7]

#### 1. Vessel Profiles: M/V Pacific Bulk I and M/V Pacific Bulk II

| Characteristic | M/V Pacific Bulk I | M/V Pacific Bulk II |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Vessel Type** | Panamax bulk carrier | Panamax bulk carrier |
| **Built** | 2008 | 2009 |
| **Deadweight (DWT)** | 74,000 DWT | 76,000 DWT |
| **Flag** | United States | United States |
| **Trade Route** | Trans-Pacific dry bulk (coal, grain, ore) | Trans-Pacific dry bulk |
| **2024 CII Rating** | **D** (12.8 gCO₂/ton-mile) | **D** (13.2 gCO₂/ton-mile) |
| **Purchase Price (2022)** | $37 million | $37 million |
| **Current Book Value (2024)** | $34.3 million (depreciated) | $34.3 million (depreciated) |
| **Current Market Value** | $23 million | $23 million |
| **Annual Revenue** | $14 million | $14 million |

#### 2. CII Rating Thresholds for Panamax Bulk Carriers (2024)

Based on IMO CII guidelines (MEPC.336(76)) for 74,000-76,000 DWT bulk carriers:³¹

| Rating | gCO₂/ton-mile Threshold | Status | Required Action |
|--------|------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| A | ≤ 9.5 | Major superior | None |
| B | 9.5 - 11.0 | Minor superior | None |
| **C** | **11.0 - 12.5** | **COMPLIANT** | **None** |
| D | 12.5 - 14.5 | Minor inferior | Monitor; corrective action if 3 consecutive years |
| E | > 14.5 | Inferior | Immediate corrective action required |

**PMSC Vessels:**
- **M/V Pacific Bulk I**: 12.8 gCO₂/ton-mile → **D rating** (0.3 above C threshold)
- **M/V Pacific Bulk II**: 13.2 gCO₂/ton-mile → **D rating** (0.7 above C threshold)

**Improvement Required to Achieve C Rating:**
- M/V Pacific Bulk I: Reduce from 12.8 to 12.5 → **2.3% reduction**
- M/V Pacific Bulk II: Reduce from 13.2 to 12.5 → **5.3% reduction**

#### 3. Three-Year Timeline and Enforcement Consequences

| Year | Scenario | Consequences | Required Actions |
|------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **2024** | D rating (year 1) | No immediate regulatory consequences | Monitor CII performance, evaluate improvement options |
| **2025** | If D rating (year 2) | Increased flag state scrutiny, charterer concerns, potential charter rate discounts | Begin implementation of improvement measures |
| **2026** | If D rating (year 3) | **MANDATORY**: Submit SEEMP Part III corrective action plan to U.S. Coast Guard within 1 month of CII report | Verified corrective action plan required for Statement of Compliance |
| **2027** | If D rating (year 4) | **SANCTIONS**: Port state control detention risk, charter market exclusion (shippers refuse D-rated vessels), potential vessel stranding | Must achieve C rating or face commercial unviability |

**Charter Market Impact:**
- Major commodity shippers (agricultural exporters, mining companies) increasingly specify **C-rated or better vessels** in charter party agreements
- **Estimated charter rate discount**: 10-15% for D-rated vessels vs. C-rated comparable vessels³²
- Revenue impact: $14M annual revenue × 12.5% discount = **$1.75M per vessel per year**

#### 4. CII Improvement Options - Cost-Benefit Analysis

##### **OPTION 1: Engine Retrofits (EEXI Compliance)**

**Technology: Engine Power Limitation (EPL)**

Engine Power Limitation restricts propulsion power at the main engine via fuel rack mechanical blockage or software limitation of fuel index.³³ For electronically controlled engines, compliance achievable within single port visit with no engine downtime.³⁴

**Implementation Costs:**
- Engineering study (naval architect): $300K-$500K per vessel
- EPL software/hardware installation: $1.2M-$2M per vessel
- Drydock coordination (if mechanical fuel rack modification required): $3M-$4M per vessel
- **Total per vessel**: $4.5M-$6.5M
- **Total for 2 vessels**: **$9M-$13M**

**Downtime:**
- Software EPL: 7-10 days port time (minimal revenue loss)
- Mechanical EPL: 25-30 days drydock + transit
- Revenue loss: 30 days × $150K/day = **$4.5M per vessel**

**Fuel Efficiency Improvement:**
- EPL reduces maximum engine power by 10-15%
- Corresponding CII improvement: **5-10% reduction in gCO₂/ton-mile**
- Expected outcome: M/V Pacific Bulk I → 11.5-12.2 gCO₂/ton-mile (achieves C rating)
- Expected outcome: M/V Pacific Bulk II → 11.9-12.6 gCO₂/ton-mile (likely achieves C rating)

**ROI Analysis:**
- Capital cost: $9M-$13M + $9M revenue loss (drydock) = **$18M-$22M total**
- Benefit: Avoid $1.75M/year charter discount × 2 vessels = $3.5M/year
- Payback period: $20M ÷ $3.5M/year = **5.7 years**
- **Conclusion**: Marginal ROI; only justified if vessels retained long-term (8-10 years)

##### **OPTION 2: Speed Reduction (Slow Steaming)**

**Implementation:**
- Reduce service speed from 14.5 knots (current) to 12 knots (17% reduction)
- No capital expenditure required (operational change only)

**CII Impact:**
Operating speed has greatest impact on CII due to cubic relationship between speed and fuel consumption.³⁵ Speed reduction from 14.5 to 12 knots:
- Fuel consumption reduction: **31.5% at 38% main engine load**³⁶
- CII improvement: 25-30% reduction in gCO₂/ton-mile
- Expected outcome: M/V Pacific Bulk I → 9.0-9.6 gCO₂/ton-mile (**A or B rating**)
- Expected outcome: M/V Pacific Bulk II → 9.2-9.9 gCO₂/ton-mile (**A or B rating**)

**Revenue Impact:**
- Longer voyage times → fewer voyages per year
- Current: 26 voyages/year at 14.5 knots
- Reduced: 22 voyages/year at 12 knots (15% reduction)
- Revenue loss per vessel: $14M × 15% = **$2.1M per year**
- **Total revenue loss: $4.2M/year for 2 vessels**

**Operational Constraints:**
- Charter party agreements may specify **minimum service speed** (typically 13-14 knots for bulk carriers)
- Breach of charter party speed clause → charterer claim for damages (lost cargo delivery time value)
- **Legal risk**: Review 850 service contracts for speed warranties

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- Capital cost: **$0** (operational change)
- Revenue loss: **$4.2M/year**
- Benefit: Avoid $1.75M/year charter discount × 2 vessels = $3.5M/year
- **Net annual cost: $700K/year** ($4.2M loss - $3.5M benefit saved)
- **Conclusion**: Speed reduction costs MORE than charter discount avoided; not economically optimal

##### **OPTION 3: Scrap Vessels and Replace with Modern Tonnage**

**Scrap Value Analysis:**

Based on 2024 bulk carrier scrap market data: Average scrap price **$500 per Light Displacement Ton (LDT)**, with monthly lows at **$445/LDT** (March 2024).³⁷

**M/V Pacific Bulk I (2008-built, 74,000 DWT):**
- Light Displacement Tonnage: ~12,500 LDT (typical for Panamax bulk carrier)
- Scrap value: 12,500 LDT × $500/LDT = **$6.25 million**

**M/V Pacific Bulk II (2009-built, 76,000 DWT):**
- Light Displacement Tonnage: ~12,800 LDT
- Scrap value: 12,800 LDT × $500/LDT = **$6.4 million**

**Total scrap proceeds: $12.65 million for 2 vessels**

**Accounting Impact (Write-Down Calculation):**
| Item | M/V Pacific Bulk I | M/V Pacific Bulk II | Total |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Purchase price (2022) | $37.0M | $37.0M | $74.0M |
| Accumulated depreciation (2 years) | $2.7M | $2.7M | $5.4M |
| **Book value (2024)** | **$34.3M** | **$34.3M** | **$68.6M** |
| Scrap value | $6.25M | $6.4M | $12.65M |
| **Impairment loss** | **$28.05M** | **$27.9M** | **$55.95M** |

**Replacement Cost:**

Purchase 2016+ eco-design Panamax bulk carriers (CII A/B rated):
- Newbuilding price (2026): $55M-$65M per vessel
- Secondhand (2018-2020 built): $42M-$52M per vessel

**Net replacement investment:**
- Scenario A (newbuilding): ($60M × 2) - $12.65M scrap = **$107.35M net investment**
- Scenario B (secondhand): ($47M × 2) - $12.65M scrap = **$81.35M net investment**

**Benefits of Replacement:**
- Eliminates CII risk entirely (A/B rated vessels)
- Fuel efficiency: 30-40% better than 2008-2009 vessels
- Fuel cost savings: $14M annual fuel cost × 35% = **$4.9M/year savings** per vessel
- Total fuel savings: **$9.8M/year** for 2 modern vessels
- Higher charter rates: Modern tonnage commands 15-20% premium = **$4.2M/year** additional revenue

**ROI on Replacement (Secondhand Scenario):**
- Net investment: $81.35M
- Annual benefit: $9.8M fuel savings + $4.2M higher rates - $28M revenue (2 vessels) + $28M (new vessels) = $14M/year net benefit
- Payback period: $81.35M ÷ $14M = **5.8 years**
- **Conclusion**: Economically viable if PMSC holds vessels 8-10 years; requires $81M capital deployment

**Accounting Treatment:**
- **2024 Q4 or 2025 Q1**: Record **$55.95M impairment charge** (write down book value to scrap value)
- **Impact on EBITDA**: Non-cash charge, excluded from adjusted EBITDA for lender covenant calculations
- **Impact on equity**: $55.95M reduction in shareholders' equity
- **Tax benefit**: $55.95M ordinary loss deductible at 21% corporate rate = **$11.75M tax benefit** (reduces net loss to $44.2M after-tax)

#### 5. Recommended Strategy (Phased Approach)

**Short-Term (2025 - Year 2 of CII D Rating):**
1. **Implement speed optimization** (NOT full slow steaming to 12 knots):
   - Target: 13.5 knots (7% reduction from 14.5 knots)
   - CII improvement: ~10-12%
   - Expected outcome: Achieve C rating (11.5-12.0 gCO₂/ton-mile)
   - Revenue impact: ~5% reduction = $700K/year per vessel ($1.4M total)
   - **Objective**: Avoid year 2 D rating, buy time for strategic decision

2. **Commission independent CII improvement study**:
   - Engage naval architect (DNV, ABS, or equivalent)
   - Cost: $150K-$250K for comprehensive fleet-wide analysis
   - Deliverable: Vessel-specific CII improvement roadmap with cost-benefit analysis

**Medium-Term (2026-2027):**
3. **Evaluate vessel replacement vs. long-term hold**:
   - If bulk carrier market remains depressed (scrap value < $25M per vessel): **Hold and retrofit**
   - If bulk carrier market recovers (vessel values > $35M): **Sell and replace with modern tonnage**
   - If acquisition financing available at favorable rates: **Scrap and replace** (leverage $9.8M/year fuel savings)

4. **Negotiate charter party amendments**:
   - Amend service contracts to allow 13-13.5 knot service speed (down from 14.5 knots)
   - Justify to shippers: Environmental compliance, CII rating improvement benefits shippers' Scope 3 emissions reporting
   - Target: 80% of contracts amended to permit speed reduction without breach

**Long-Term (2028+):**
5. **Fleet modernization program**:
   - Replace 2008-2009 bulk carriers with 2020+ eco-design vessels
   - Timeline: Align with IMO 2030 GHG reduction targets (50% reduction vs. 2008 baseline)
   - Financing: Ship mortgage refinancing, sale-leaseback, or private placement of maritime debt

#### 6. Financial Exposure Summary - CII D-Rated Vessels

| Scenario | Probability | Exposure | Timeline | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Scrap vessels immediately (worst case)** | 15% | $55.95M impairment + $28M revenue loss = **$83.95M total** | 2025 | Avoid by implementing speed optimization |
| **Hold vessels, fail to achieve C rating by 2027** | 25% (if no action taken) | Charter rate discount $3.5M/year + port state control detention risk $2M-$5M = **$5.5M-$8.5M/year** | 2027+ | Implement Option 1 or Option 2 |
| **Speed reduction to achieve C rating** | 100% (if implemented) | Revenue loss $1.4M/year | 2025-2030 | Accept as cost of CII compliance |
| **Engine retrofit (EPL)** | 90% success rate | Capital $18M-$22M | 2026-2027 | Payback 5.7 years; only if long-term hold |
| **Scrap and replace (optimal)** | 60% (if market conditions favorable) | Net investment $81.35M, payback 5.8 years | 2026-2028 | Requires $81M capital + lender approval |

**Recommended Action (Base Case):**
- **2025**: Speed optimization to 13.5 knots → achieve C rating → annual cost **$1.4M/year**
- **2026-2027**: Evaluate vessel replacement ROI as bulk carrier market evolves
- **SPA negotiation**: Reduce purchase price by **$55.95M** (impairment exposure) OR require Seller to achieve C rating pre-closing

### F. NOx Tier III Non-Compliance - 2 Vessels [MEDIUM RISK]

#### 1. NOx Tier III Fleet Compliance Status

PMSC operates 8 vessels with keel laid after January 1, 2016, subject to NOx Tier III requirements when operating in North American Emission Control Area (ECA):

| Vessel | Built | NOx Tier | SCR Status | ECA Compliance |
|--------|-------|----------|------------|----------------|
| M/V Pacific Endeavor | 2016 | Tier III | SCR installed, operational | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| M/V Pacific Explorer | 2017 | Tier III | SCR installed, operational | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| M/V Pacific Harmony | 2018 | Tier III | SCR installed, operational | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| M/V Pacific Innovation | 2019 | Tier III | SCR installed, operational | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| M/V Pacific Legacy | 2019 | Tier III | SCR installed, operational | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| M/V Pacific Momentum | 2020 | Tier III | SCR installed, operational | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| **M/V Pacific Odyssey** | **2017** | **Tier III** | **SCR NOT operational** | **❌ NON-COMPLIANT** |
| **M/V Pacific Pioneer** | **2018** | **Tier III** | **SCR NOT operational** | **❌ NON-COMPLIANT** |

#### 2. Non-Compliance Analysis: M/V Pacific Odyssey and M/V Pacific Pioneer

**Malfunction History:**
- Both vessels delivered new with IMO type-approved Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems installed
- **2023 Q2**: SCR catalyst degradation detected on both vessels (excessive ammonia slip, NOx reduction efficiency < 50%)
- **2023 Q3**: SCR ammonia injection system failures (dosing pump malfunctions, urea crystallization in piping)
- **2023 Q4**: PMSC management decision: **Do NOT repair SCR systems** (cost avoidance measure)
- **2024-present**: Vessels operating in North American ECA **without functional SCR** = NOx Tier III violation

**Cost Avoidance Calculation (2023 Decision):**
- SCR catalyst replacement: $800K-$1.2M per vessel (ceramic substrate, precious metal catalyst coating)
- Ammonia injection system overhaul: $400K-$800K per vessel (dosing pumps, control valves, piping)
- Drydock coordination: 15-20 days × $150K/day = $2.25M-$3M revenue loss per vessel
- **Total repair cost per vessel**: $3.45M-$5M
- **Total for 2 vessels**: $6.9M-$10M
- **Management rationale**: Defer expense to maximize near-term cash flow

#### 3. Legal Exposure: MARPOL Annex VI Enforcement

**Statutory Violation:**
- MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 13.5.2: Vessels subject to NOx Tier III must operate emission control systems **at all times** when in ECA
- 33 U.S.C. § 1908(b)(1): Civil penalty up to **$25,000 per day per violation**
- Each day of non-compliant ECA operation = separate violation

**Non-Compliance Duration (2024):**
- M/V Pacific Odyssey: 180 days ECA operations (U.S. West Coast port calls)
- M/V Pacific Pioneer: 165 days ECA operations
- **Total violation days: 345 days**

**Maximum Civil Penalty Exposure:**
- 345 days × $25,000/day = **$8.625 million**

**Realistic Penalty Assessment [METHODOLOGY: USCG settlement precedent]:**
- USCG typically assesses 20-40% of statutory maximum for non-knowing violations
- Expected penalty: $8.625M × 30% = **$2.59 million**
- Settlement negotiation range: **$1.5M-$3.5M**

#### 4. Port State Control Detection Risk

**PSC Inspection Probability:**
- U.S. Coast Guard PSC inspection rate: ~15% of port calls undergo full MARPOL Annex VI inspection³⁸
- M/V Pacific Odyssey: 24 U.S. port calls/year × 15% = 3.6 inspections/year
- M/V Pacific Pioneer: 22 U.S. port calls/year × 15% = 3.3 inspections/year
- **Combined annual PSC inspection exposure: ~7 inspections/year**

**NOx Compliance Verification Methods:**
- Document review: EIAPP (Engine International Air Pollution Prevention) Certificate, SCR maintenance records
- Visual inspection: SCR catalyst module condition, ammonia injection system operational status
- **Emissions testing**: Portable NOx analyzer (if PSC officer suspects non-compliance)

**Detection Probability:**
- If PSC inspection occurs AND inspector suspects SCR malfunction → **80-90% detection probability**
- Annual detection probability per vessel: 3.6 inspections × 85% detection = **~3 inspections likely to detect non-compliance**
- **Cumulative 2024-2025 detection risk: 50-60%** (if both vessels continue ECA operations)

**PSC Detention Consequences:**
- Vessel detained until SCR system repaired or vessel departs ECA
- Detention duration: 7-14 days (average for propulsion/machinery deficiencies)³⁹
- Revenue loss: 10 days × $150K/day = **$1.5M per vessel**
- **Reputational damage**: PSC detention published in USCG Marine Safety Information Bulletin, visible to charterers/shippers

#### 5. Remediation Cost and Timeline

**SCR System Repair (Both Vessels):**

| Component | M/V Pacific Odyssey | M/V Pacific Pioneer | Total |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| SCR catalyst module replacement | $1.0M | $1.1M | $2.1M |
| Ammonia injection system overhaul | $600K | $650K | $1.25M |
| Drydock / shipyard fees | $400K | $400K | $800K |
| **Subtotal per vessel** | **$2.0M** | **$2.15M** | **$4.15M** |
| Revenue loss (18 days drydock) | $2.7M | $2.7M | $5.4M |
| **Total cost (incl. revenue loss)** | **$4.7M** | **$4.85M** | **$9.55M** |

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Engineering assessment: 30 days
- Parts procurement (SCR catalyst, injection components): 90-120 days (long-lead items)
- Drydock scheduling: Coordinate with next scheduled drydock (Q2 2025 for both vessels)
- Installation: 15-18 days drydock + 3 days sea trials
- **Total timeline: 4-5 months from decision to operational**

**Immediate Mitigation (Pre-Repair):**
- **Option A**: Limit M/V Pacific Odyssey and M/V Pacific Pioneer to **non-ECA routes** (Trans-Pacific China-Japan, Intra-Asia) until SCR repaired
  - Revenue impact: ~10% reduction (fewer lucrative U.S. port calls) = $1.4M/year per vessel
  - Benefit: Eliminates PSC detention risk, reduces penalty exposure to zero
- **Option B**: Continue ECA operations, accept PSC detection risk
  - Expected cost: $2.59M penalty (if detected) + $1.5M detention revenue loss = **$4.09M**
  - Probability: 50-60% over 18-month period

#### 6. Recommended Action

**Pre-Closing (90 days before acquisition closing):**
1. **Require Seller to repair SCR systems** as condition precedent to closing
   - Seller bears $4.15M repair cost + $5.4M revenue loss = $9.55M
   - Justification: Non-compliance is Seller's pre-existing liability (2023 management decision)

**Alternative: Purchase Price Adjustment**
2. If Seller refuses to repair:
   - Reduce purchase price by **$6.5M-$8M** (repair cost $4.15M + penalty risk $2.59M)
   - Buyer (Global Logistics Partners) completes repairs post-closing

**Post-Closing (If no pre-closing resolution):**
3. **Expedite SCR repairs within 60 days of closing**:
   - Schedule drydocks immediately (air freight SCR catalyst modules from Europe: $100K expedite fee)
   - Complete repairs before next PSC inspection cycle
   - Total cost: $4.15M repairs + $5.4M revenue loss = **$9.55M**

4. **Voluntary self-disclosure to U.S. Coast Guard**:
   - Submit MARPOL Annex VI compliance plan to USCG District Commander
   - Demonstrate good faith: SCR repairs scheduled, interim ECA route avoidance
   - Benefit: Reduced penalty (50% reduction for voluntary disclosure = $1.3M vs. $2.59M)
   - Risk: USCG may order immediate vessel detention until repairs complete

**Financial Exposure Summary - NOx Tier III Non-Compliance:**

| Scenario | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| PSC detention (if continue ECA ops) | 50-60% | $1.5M-$3M revenue loss + $2.59M penalty = **$4.09M-$5.59M** | Limit to non-ECA routes until repaired |
| SCR repair (unavoidable) | 100% | $4.15M capital + $5.4M revenue loss = **$9.55M** | Schedule during Q2 2025 drydock, minimize revenue loss |
| SPA price adjustment | N/A | **$6.5M-$8M purchase price reduction** | Negotiate with Seller |

**CRITICAL**: NOx non-compliance is **fixable** but requires immediate action. Unlike CII D-rating (operational/strategic issue), SCR repair is straightforward technical solution with defined cost. Recommend **SPA purchase price reduction $6.5M** OR **Seller completes repairs pre-closing**.

### G. EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Exposure [CONTINGENT RISK]

#### 1. EU ETS Maritime Inclusion (Effective January 1, 2024)

**Regulatory Framework:**
- EU Directive 2023/959: Maritime transport included in EU ETS effective January 1, 2024⁴⁰
- **Phase-in schedule**:
  - 2024: Surrender allowances for **40% of verified CO₂ emissions**
  - 2025: **70% of emissions**
  - 2026: **100% of emissions** + inclusion of CH₄ (methane) and N₂O (nitrous oxide)⁴¹

**Applicability to PMSC Fleet:**
- Vessels calling at **EU or EEA ports** (27 EU member states + Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein)
- PMSC current trade routes: **NO regular Europe service** (Trans-Pacific, Intra-Asia, U.S. coastwise only)
- **Contingent exposure**: If PMSC adds Europe routes post-acquisition (diversification strategy)

#### 2. EU ETS Carbon Price Projections (2026)

**2026 Carbon Allowance Price:**
- Deutsche Bank forecast: **€60-€150 per ton CO₂** (range based on market conditions)⁴²
- Grey Epoch Europe average: **€86/ton CO₂** ($99.78/ton at 1.16 EUR/USD)⁴³
- **Base case for analysis: €86/ton CO₂**

#### 3. Cost Impact on Vessel Operations (2026 - 100% Compliance)

**Compliance Cost per Fuel Type (2026):**⁴⁴
- Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO): **$319.30 per ton fuel consumed**
- High Sulfur Fuel Oil (HSFO): **$315.60 per ton fuel**
- Marine Gas Oil (MGO): **$324.78 per ton fuel**

**Average Bulk Carrier (Panamax) EU ETS Cost:**
- Annual EU ETS cost: **€1.3 million** ($1.5M USD) per vessel trading within EU⁴⁵

**PMSC Fleet Exposure (If Europe Service Added):**
- Assume 4 vessels deployed to Trans-Atlantic or Asia-Europe routes
- Annual EU ETS cost: €1.3M × 4 vessels = **€5.2M ($6.0M USD)**
- 2026 full compliance (100% of emissions): **$6.0M/year**
- 2024-2025 phase-in: $6.0M × 55% (average of 40% and 70%) = **$3.3M/year**

#### 4. Risk Assessment

**Likelihood of Europe Service Addition:**
- **LOW (15-20% probability)**: PMSC currently no Europe routes; adding Europe requires:
  - Slot exchange agreements with European carriers
  - EU port terminal access (berth allocation, stevedoring contracts)
  - Repositioning vessels from Trans-Pacific to Trans-Atlantic (30-45 day voyage, revenue loss)

**Financial Impact (If Europe Service Added):**
- EU ETS cost: $6.0M/year (2026)
- Must pass through to shippers via BAF (Bunker Adjustment Factor) surcharges
- **Competitive disadvantage**: European carriers already absorbed EU ETS costs; PMSC late entrant faces margin compression

**Mitigation:**
- **Avoid Europe routes** unless freight rates justify $6M/year EU ETS costs
- If Europe expansion required: Deploy **A-rated or B-rated CII vessels** (lower fuel consumption → lower EU ETS cost)
- Negotiate **EU ETS pass-through clauses** in service contracts (shippers bear EU ETS cost)

**Conclusion:**
- EU ETS is **CONTINGENT** risk, not immediate exposure
- **No impact** on $4.8B acquisition valuation (PMSC has no Europe service)
- **Flag for post-acquisition strategic planning**: If Global Logistics Partners pursues Europe expansion, budget $6M/year EU ETS costs

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Summary Risk Assessment Table

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Quantified Exposure | Mitigation Strategy | Timeline |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **CII D-rated vessels (2 bulk carriers) - vessel write-down if scrapped** | **HIGH** | 60% (if no improvement action) | $55.95M impairment loss | Speed optimization to 13.5 knots (2025); achieve C rating | 2025-2027 |
| **CII D-rated vessels - revenue loss from speed reduction** | MEDIUM | 100% (if speed optimization implemented) | $1.4M/year ongoing | Accept as cost of environmental compliance | 2025+ |
| **CII D-rated vessels - charter rate discount if D rating persists** | HIGH | 80% (if 2027 still D-rated) | $3.5M/year for 2 vessels | Achieve C rating by 2026 | 2026-2027 |
| **NOx Tier III non-compliance (2 vessels) - penalty exposure** | MEDIUM | 25% detection probability | $1.5M-$3.5M penalty + $1.5M-$3M detention | Repair SCR systems Q2 2025; SPA price adjustment $6.5M-$8M | Pre-closing |
| **NOx Tier III - SCR repair cost (unavoidable)** | MEDIUM | 100% (must repair) | $4.15M capital + $5.4M revenue loss = $9.55M | Schedule during Q2 2025 drydock to minimize downtime | Q2 2025 |
| **M/V Pacific Titan BWMS failure - net cost (already incurred)** | LOW | N/A (past event) | $6.65M net (after insurance recovery) | Enhanced BWMS maintenance fleet-wide $150K-$250K/year | Complete |
| **Port state control detention (MARPOL Annex I/VI violations)** | LOW | 15% PSC inspection rate × 10% violation detection | $150K-$500K penalties + 7-14 days detention | Maintain OWS systems, accurate Oil Record Books, repair SCR systems | Ongoing |
| **EU ETS exposure (if Europe routes added post-acquisition)** | LOW | 15-20% (strategic decision) | $6M/year (2026, 100% compliance) | Avoid Europe routes OR deploy A/B-rated CII vessels; negotiate ETS pass-through with shippers | Post-acquisition |

### B. Material Environmental Compliance Issues Requiring Immediate Action

#### 1. CII D-Rated Vessels (M/V Pacific Bulk I, M/V Pacific Bulk II) - **CRITICAL**

**Issue:**
- 2024 = D rating (year 1 of 3-year watch period)
- If 2025 also D-rated → year 2, increasing risk
- If 2026 also D-rated → **MANDATORY** corrective action plan submission to U.S. Coast Guard
- If 2027 still D-rated → commercial unviability (charter market exclusion, PSC detention risk)

**Exposure:**
- **Worst case (scrap vessels)**: $55.95M impairment loss + $28M revenue loss = **$83.95M total**
- **Base case (speed optimization)**: $1.4M/year revenue loss from reduced voyage capacity
- **Failure case (no action, D rating persists to 2027)**: $3.5M/year charter rate discount + $2M-$5M PSC detention

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **2025 Q1**: Implement speed optimization to 13.5 knots (7% reduction) → achieve C rating in 2025
2. **2025 Q2**: Commission independent naval architect CII improvement study ($150K-$250K)
3. **SPA negotiation**: Reduce purchase price by $55.95M (impairment exposure) OR require Seller to demonstrate C rating achievement in 2025

#### 2. NOx Tier III Non-Compliance (M/V Pacific Odyssey, M/V Pacific Pioneer) - **HIGH**

**Issue:**
- SCR systems non-operational since 2023 Q4 (management decision to defer repairs)
- Vessels operating in North American ECA without functional NOx emission controls = MARPOL Annex VI violation
- 345 days non-compliance in 2024 alone

**Exposure:**
- **Penalty**: $1.5M-$3.5M (if USCG detects and prosecutes)
- **Repair cost**: $4.15M capital + $5.4M revenue loss = $9.55M total
- **PSC detention risk**: 50-60% cumulative probability over 18 months; $1.5M-$3M revenue loss if detained

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Pre-closing**: Require Seller to repair SCR systems as closing condition OR reduce purchase price $6.5M-$8M
2. **If post-closing**: Expedite SCR repairs within 60 days (air freight catalyst modules, $100K expedite fee)
3. **Interim mitigation**: Limit M/V Pacific Odyssey and M/V Pacific Pioneer to non-ECA routes (Trans-Pacific China-Japan, Intra-Asia) until repairs complete

#### 3. M/V Pacific Titan BWMS Failure - **RESOLVED (Monitoring Required)**

**Issue:**
- March 2023 BWMS malfunction led to ballast tank corrosion
- November 2024 emergency drydock: $18.7M total repair, $12.05M insurance recovery, $6.65M net cost
- BWMS replacement completed, COI renewed December 2024

**Exposure:**
- **Already incurred**: $6.65M net cost (2024 expense)
- **Ongoing risk**: Fleet-wide BWMS failures if maintenance inadequate

**Actions Required:**
1. **Post-closing**: Implement enhanced BWMS preventive maintenance program fleet-wide ($150K-$250K annual)
2. **Insurance**: Confirm marine hull policy coverage for BWMS-related corrosion damage (not all policies cover gradual deterioration)
3. **Fleet assessment**: Commission classification society (ABS, DNV) to audit BWMS systems on all 22 vessels (identify early failure indicators)

### C. Secondary Environmental Compliance Risks

#### 1. MARPOL Annex I Oil Pollution Prevention - **LOW (Verification Required)**

**Compliance Status:**
- 22 vessels equipped with IMO type-approved Oily Water Separators (OWS)
- No reported MARPOL Annex I violations or PSC detentions (2022-2024) [STATED]
- Oil Record Book maintenance per MARPOL Annex I Regulation 17

**Residual Risk:**
- **Virtually all MARPOL prosecutions** in U.S. involve false Oil Record Book entries or failure to record illegal discharges
- If OWS malfunctions and crew fails to document → criminal penalties up to $500,000 per violation

**Verification Required:**
- Independent audit of Oil Record Books (all 22 vessels, last 3 years)
- OWS calibration records verification
- Crew training documentation review (MARPOL Annex I recordkeeping requirements)

#### 2. EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) - **CONTINGENT (No Current Exposure)**

**Current Status:**
- PMSC operates NO Europe routes (Trans-Pacific, Intra-Asia, U.S. coastwise only)
- EU ETS applies only to vessels calling EU/EEA ports
- **No immediate financial exposure**

**Contingent Exposure (If Europe Routes Added Post-Acquisition):**
- 2026 full compliance (100% emissions): $6M/year (assuming 4 vessels deployed)
- Competitive disadvantage vs. European carriers (already absorbed EU ETS costs in pricing)

**Mitigation (If Europe Expansion Pursued):**
- Deploy A-rated or B-rated CII vessels (lower fuel consumption → lower EU ETS cost)
- Negotiate EU ETS pass-through clauses in service contracts (shippers bear cost)
- Evaluate profitability: Europe freight rates must exceed Trans-Pacific by $1.5M/vessel/year to offset EU ETS

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Overall IMO Environmental Compliance Risk Assessment

**Risk Rating: HIGH**

Pacific Maritime Services Corporation faces material environmental compliance risks concentrated in two critical areas:

1. **CII D-Rated Vessels (2 bulk carriers)**: $55.95M-$83.95M exposure if vessels scrapped; $1.4M-$3.5M/year ongoing exposure if speed optimization or charter rate discounts required
2. **NOx Tier III Non-Compliance (2 vessels)**: $9.55M-$15M exposure (repair costs + potential penalties + detention risk)

**Total Quantified Exposure: $65M-$99M** (worst-case scenarios; base case $15M-$20M with mitigation)

**Mitigating Factors:**
- CII D-rating is **manageable** via speed optimization (achieves C rating in 2025, annual cost $1.4M)
- NOx non-compliance is **fixable** via SCR repairs (defined cost $9.55M, 4-5 month timeline)
- MARPOL Annex I compliance appears adequate (verification required)
- EU ETS is **not applicable** (PMSC has no Europe routes)

**Aggravating Factors:**
- **2024 is year 1** of 3-year CII D-rating watch period → limited time to improve before mandatory corrective action
- NOx non-compliance has **50-60% cumulative detection probability** over 18 months → high likelihood of penalty/detention if not immediately remediated
- Bulk carrier market depression means vessel write-downs economically painful ($55.95M impairment if scrapped)

### B. Critical Issues Addressed (From Research Plan Checklist #7)

| Issue | Status | Exposure | Recommendation | See Section |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **CII D-rated vessels (2 bulk carriers) - potential scrapping/write-down** | ✅ Analyzed | $55.95M impairment (if scrapped) | Speed optimization to 13.5 knots (2025); SPA price adjustment $55.95M OR Seller achieves C rating | IV.E |
| **CII D-rated vessels - improvement options (engine retrofit, speed reduction, replacement)** | ✅ Analyzed | $1.4M-$22M (depending on option) | Base case: Speed optimization $1.4M/year; evaluate vessel replacement 2026-2027 | IV.E.4-5 |
| **MARPOL Annex VI NOx Tier III non-compliance (2 vessels SCR systems non-operational)** | ✅ Analyzed | $9.55M-$15M (repair + penalty + detention risk) | SPA price adjustment $6.5M-$8M OR Seller repairs SCR systems pre-closing | IV.F |
| **MARPOL Annex I oil pollution prevention compliance** | ✅ Analyzed | LOW risk (verification required) | Post-closing: Independent Oil Record Book audit | IV.C |
| **Ballast Water Management - M/V Pacific Titan failure and fleet-wide risk** | ✅ Analyzed | $6.65M (net, already incurred) | Enhanced BWMS maintenance $150K-$250K/year | IV.D |
| **EU ETS maritime exposure (if Europe routes added)** | ✅ Analyzed | $6M/year (contingent only) | Avoid Europe routes OR deploy A/B-rated vessels with ETS pass-through | IV.G |

### C. Cross-Domain Impacts (For Memorandum Synthesis)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| CII D-rated vessels ($55.95M impairment exposure) | Securities Disclosure / Accounting | securities-researcher | Does $55.95M vessel impairment trigger Item 303 MD&A disclosure? ASC 360 impairment testing? | HIGH |
| NOx Tier III non-compliance (MARPOL violation) | Coast Guard Vessel Safety | regulatory-analyst | Does NOx non-compliance affect Certificate of Inspection renewal? PSC detention authority? | HIGH |
| Speed optimization requirement (13.5 knots vs. 14.5 knots) | Commercial Contracts | commercial-contracts-analyst | Do 850 service contracts contain minimum speed warranties? Breach exposure if speed reduced? | MEDIUM |
| CII charter rate discount (10-15% for D-rated vessels) | Financial Performance / Valuation | N/A (memo-generator context) | Impact on $4.8B acquisition valuation if bulk carrier revenues decline $3.5M/year? | MEDIUM |
| EU ETS $6M/year exposure (if Europe routes added) | Transaction Structuring | N/A (strategic planning) | Does Global Logistics Partners intend Europe expansion post-acquisition? Budget EU ETS costs? | LOW |

**Note:** These cross-domain impacts should trigger targeted follow-up research if not addressed by other specialists in parallel research stream.

### D. Actionable Recommendations

#### Pre-Closing Actions (0-90 days)

**IMMEDIATE (Within 30 days of LOI execution):**

1. **CII D-Rated Vessels**:
   - Implement speed optimization to 13.5 knots on M/V Pacific Bulk I and M/V Pacific Bulk II effective February 1, 2025
   - Target: Achieve C rating in 2025 annual CII assessment (avoid year 2 D rating)
   - Cost: $700K/year per vessel ($1.4M total) = acceptable compliance cost
   - **Deliverable**: Vessel performance monitoring reports (monthly fuel consumption, gCO₂/ton-mile calculations)

2. **NOx Tier III Non-Compliance**:
   - **SPA negotiation**: Insert condition precedent requiring Seller to repair SCR systems on M/V Pacific Odyssey and M/V Pacific Pioneer pre-closing OR reduce purchase price by $6.5M-$8M
   - **Alternative**: If Seller refuses, Buyer negotiates purchase price adjustment + commits to post-closing repair within 60 days
   - **Interim**: Limit M/V Pacific Odyssey and M/V Pacific Pioneer to non-ECA routes (eliminate PSC detention risk during due diligence period)

**PRE-CLOSING (60-90 days before closing):**

3. **Independent Environmental Compliance Audit**:
   - Engage classification society (ABS, DNV, or Lloyd's Register) to conduct:
     - Fleet-wide CII improvement assessment (all 22 vessels): $150K-$250K
     - BWMS operational audit (identify early failure indicators): $80K-$120K
     - Oil Record Book audit (MARPOL Annex I compliance verification): $50K-$80K
   - **Total cost**: $280K-$450K
   - **Deliverable**: Pre-closing environmental compliance certification letter (for lender due diligence)

4. **Charter Party Amendment Negotiations**:
   - Review 850 service contracts for minimum speed warranties
   - Negotiate amendments permitting 13-13.5 knot service speed (environmental compliance justification)
   - Target: 80% of contracts amended to avoid breach risk
   - Benefit to shippers: CII-compliant vessels improve shippers' Scope 3 emissions reporting (ESG benefit)

5. **SPA Environmental Representations and Warranties**:
   - **Seller reps**: (a) No MARPOL violations (Annex I, VI) in past 5 years except as disclosed; (b) All vessels hold valid Certificates of Inspection; (c) All BWMS systems operational and IMO type-approved
   - **Seller covenants**: (a) Achieve C rating on CII D-rated vessels by December 31, 2025 OR indemnify Buyer for impairment loss; (b) Repair SCR systems on NOx non-compliant vessels OR reduce purchase price
   - **Indemnification cap**: $75M (environmental compliance issues)
   - **Survival period**: 3 years post-closing (matches CII 3-year watch period)

#### Post-Closing Actions (90-365 days)

6. **CII Improvement Roadmap (2025-2027)**:
   - **2025**: Monitor CII performance under 13.5-knot speed optimization; verify C rating achievement in 2025 annual assessment
   - **2026**: Evaluate vessel replacement vs. engine retrofit based on bulk carrier market conditions
     - If scrap value remains < $25M per vessel: Hold and consider EPL retrofit ($18M-$22M)
     - If vessel values recover > $35M: Sell and replace with modern eco-design tonnage
   - **2027**: Finalize fleet modernization strategy (align with IMO 2030 GHG reduction targets)

7. **Enhanced BWMS Maintenance Program**:
   - Implement fleet-wide preventive maintenance: $150K-$250K annually for 22 vessels
   - Quarterly BWMS performance testing (D-2 standard compliance verification)
   - Early replacement of electrolysis units, UV lamps, filtration systems (avoid M/V Pacific Titan repeat failure)
   - **Insurance**: Negotiate broader marine hull coverage for BWMS-related corrosion damage

8. **ESG Reporting and Stakeholder Communication**:
   - Develop annual CII ratings disclosure framework (transparency for investors, charterers)
   - Communicate environmental compliance improvements to shippers (competitive advantage: "C-rated fleet" marketing)
   - Align with Global Logistics Partners' ESG commitments (if publicly disclosed)

#### Long-Term Strategic Actions (2026-2030)

9. **Fleet Modernization and Decarbonization Strategy**:
   - **2026-2028**: Replace 2008-2009 bulk carriers (M/V Pacific Bulk I, M/V Pacific Bulk II) with 2020+ eco-design vessels
     - Net investment: $81.35M (secondhand) to $107.35M (newbuilding)
     - Benefit: $9.8M/year fuel savings + $4.2M/year higher charter rates = $14M/year
     - Payback: 5.8 years (economically viable if 8-10 year hold period)
   - **2028-2030**: Evaluate alternative fuels (LNG, methanol, ammonia) for newbuilding orders (align with IMO 2030 targets)

10. **Avoid Europe Route Expansion (Unless Economically Justified)**:
    - EU ETS adds $1.5M/vessel/year cost (2026, 100% compliance)
    - Only pursue Europe routes if freight rates exceed Trans-Pacific by $1.5M-$2M/vessel/year
    - If Europe expansion required: Deploy A-rated CII vessels (lower fuel consumption → lower EU ETS cost)

### E. Transaction Considerations for $4.8B Acquisition

#### Impact on Acquisition Valuation

**Environmental Compliance Adjustments to Purchase Price:**

| Item | Exposure | Recommended Adjustment | Rationale |
|------|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| CII D-rated vessels (impairment risk) | $55.95M | **($20M-$30M)** | Reduce purchase price by 35-54% of impairment exposure (probability-adjusted: 60% likelihood × $55.95M = $33.6M) |
| NOx Tier III non-compliance (repair + penalty risk) | $9.55M-$15M | **($6.5M-$8M)** | Reduce purchase price by repair cost + 50% of penalty/detention risk |
| M/V Pacific Titan BWMS failure (already incurred) | $6.65M | **($0)** | Historical cost, already reflected in 2024 financials (no adjustment) |
| **Total Purchase Price Adjustment** | | **($26.5M-$38M)** | Negotiate reduction from $4.8B to $4.762B-$4.774B |

**Alternative Structure: Seller Remediation Pre-Closing**
- Seller achieves C rating on CII D-rated vessels by December 31, 2025 (speed optimization implementation)
- Seller completes SCR repairs on M/V Pacific Odyssey and M/V Pacific Pioneer pre-closing ($9.55M Seller cost)
- **No purchase price adjustment** if Seller remediates
- **Buyer benefit**: Acquires fully compliant fleet, eliminates $65M-$99M environmental risk exposure

#### Lender Considerations

**Ship Mortgage Covenant Implications:**
- $2.8B existing ship mortgages likely contain environmental compliance covenants
- CII D-rating may trigger lender notification requirement (material adverse change to vessel value)
- $55.95M impairment (if vessels scrapped) reduces vessel collateral value → potential debt/EBITDA covenant breach

**Post-Acquisition Financing:**
- Disclose CII D-rating and NOx non-compliance to prospective lenders
- Budget $15M-$20M capital expenditures (SCR repairs $9.55M + CII improvement study $0.25M + BWMS enhancements $0.2M) in Year 1 post-closing
- Negotiate environmental compliance CapEx carve-out from debt covenants (necessary expenditures to maintain vessel operations)

## IX. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)

✅ All relevant databases queried: IMO official website, USCG/EPA enforcement guidance, EU ETS regulations, classification society technical guidance, bulk carrier market reports

✅ Multiple search strategies employed: (1) IMO CII regulatory framework, (2) MARPOL Annex VI enforcement, (3) NOx Tier III compliance, (4) Vessel scrapping/replacement economics, (5) EU ETS exposure

✅ Cross-referenced findings across sources: IMO resolutions verified via DNV/ClassNK technical guidance; USCG enforcement precedent verified via multiple law firm analyses; EU ETS costs verified via multiple industry sources

✅ Identified gaps clearly documented: Vessel-specific CII data not available (relied on hypothetical scenario); actual SCR repair quotes not obtained (used industry averages)

### Confidence Levels (Executive Summary Section)

Confidence levels assigned to all material findings based on:
- **HIGH**: Statutory certainty (IMO resolutions, U.S.C. provisions), verified accounting calculations
- **MEDIUM**: Hypothetical scenarios (CII ratings, SCR failures), industry average costs, enforcement precedent
- **LOW**: Stated compliance status requiring independent verification (Oil Record Books)

### Known Limitations

1. **CII D-rating scenario**: Based on hypothetical 2024 ratings provided in fact pattern; actual vessel CII ratings would require IMO Data Collection System (DCS) access via U.S. Coast Guard (flag state administration)

2. **NOx non-compliance scenario**: Based on hypothetical SCR system failures; actual SCR operational status would require vessel inspection and EIAPP Certificate review

3. **Vessel valuation**: Scrap values based on 2024 market averages ($500/LDT); actual scrap proceeds depend on steel market, vessel age, and dismantling yard location

4. **Penalty assessment**: USCG settlement amounts based on historical precedent (20-40% of statutory maximum); actual penalties depend on violation severity, cooperation, and voluntary disclosure

5. **Charter market discount**: 10-15% discount for D-rated vessels based on industry analysis; actual impact depends on commodity type, shipper ESG policies, and freight market conditions

---

**DISCLAIMER:** This research memorandum is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice. Findings are based on publicly available information accessed through web search queries. All conclusions should be independently verified before reliance. CII ratings and NOx compliance status are hypothetical scenarios provided in fact pattern; actual vessel environmental compliance status requires direct verification via U.S. Coast Guard, classification society, and vessel inspection.

**DATA PROVENANCE NOTICE:** All data retrieved via WebSearch tool integrations. Source systems include: International Maritime Organization (IMO) official website, U.S. Code (uscode.house.gov), EPA/USCG joint enforcement guidance, classification societies (DNV, ClassNK, Lloyd's Register), maritime industry publications (Safety4Sea, Marine Insight, Ship & Bunker), and bulk carrier market analysts (Breakwave Advisors, Axsmarine). Data accuracy dependent on source publication integrity at time of query (January 12, 2026).
