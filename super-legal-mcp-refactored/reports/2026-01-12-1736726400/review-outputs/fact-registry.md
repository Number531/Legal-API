#### B. Financial Metrics Validation

| Fact | Report 1 | Report 2 | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| Annual Revenue | $3.2B (T5, T9) | Consistent across reports | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| EBITDA | $580M (T8) | Consistent with terminal EBITDA aggregation | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| Ship Mortgage Debt | $2.8B (T8) | Referenced consistently | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| ILWU Workforce | 3,200 (T5, T9) | Consistent across reports | ✓ CONSISTENT |

| DSCR Minimum | 1.25x (T8) | Industry standard confirmed | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| CII C Threshold | 12.5 gCO₂/ton-mile (T6) | IMO regulation | ✓ CONSISTENT |

#### E. Minor Variations (Not Conflicts)

The following minor variations were noted but do not constitute material conflicts:

1. **Martinez Expected Verdict Range:**
   - Range stated as $2.7M-$4.9M (after comparative fault)
   - Expected value calculated as $2.0M (probability-weighted)
   - **Assessment:** Not a conflict - range vs. probability-weighted expected value serve different purposes

2. **Oakland Terminal EBITDA Margins:**
   - Current: 24.4% at $28M rent
   - At $33M rent: 22.2%
   - At $42M rent: 18.2%
   - **Assessment:** Not a conflict - different scenario analyses

3. **Bunker Spill Exposure:**
   - Hypothetical scenario corrected from $4.675M-$8.05M to $3.215M-$3.65M
   - Correction due to identification of non-existent statute (Gov Code § 8670.65.5)
   - **Assessment:** Factual correction, not a conflict between reports

### CRITICAL STATUTORY CORRECTION

**Finding:** Environmental litigation report (T10) identified that hypothetical scenario cited **"California Government Code § 8670.65.5"** prescribing "$25,000 per gallon" civil penalty for oil spills.

**Verification:** Comprehensive legal research confirmed **this statute does not exist**.

**Actual Statute:** Fish and Game Code § 5650 prescribes **$10 per gallon** (not $25,000).

**Impact:** Bunker spill civil penalty exposure corrected from $1.875M-$3.75M to $15,000-$50,000 (98-99% reduction).

**Confidence:** HIGH (statutory certainty via Cornell LII, California Legislature official sources)

| Environmental Litigation | 12 | 8 | 1.50 | COMPLETE |

**Overall Completeness:** 129 facts extracted / 80 threshold = 1.61 = **COMPLETE**

**Sparse Data Flag:** Jones Act Compliance report extracted only 4 facts vs. 7 threshold (57% completeness). However, this report focused on U.S. crew citizenship verification for 2 vessels rather than fleet-wide analysis, explaining lower fact density.

## X. QUALITY ASSURANCE NOTES

**Validation Methodology:**
- Cross-referenced all dates across 10 reports
- Verified financial metrics aggregate correctly (terminal EBITDA = $297M aligns with total EBITDA $580M when including vessel operations)
- Confirmed fleet composition consistency (22 owned vessels referenced uniformly)
- Validated regulatory standards against statutory sources

**Confidence Level Definitions:**
- **HIGH:** Statutory certainty, multiple source verification, or primary document citation
- **MEDIUM:** Single source with reasonable basis, industry estimates, or calculated values
- **MEDIUM-HIGH:** Single authoritative source with supporting context
- **LOW:** Assumptions or limited verification (none in this registry)

**Outstanding Verification Needs:**
- Jones Act crew citizenship percentages (stated as 73% for 2 vessels - requires crew manifest verification)
- CII D-ratings for bulk carriers (stated as hypothetical scenario - requires actual IMO DCS data)
- Martinez vessel ownership (critical to dual capacity analysis - requires USCG vessel registry confirmation)
