- **Critical issues**: Martinez v. PMSC (longshoreman crushed September 2023, container fell when lashing gear failed M/V Pacific Horizon, bilateral leg fractures permanent disability, LHWCA benefits $420K paid, tort claim $8.5M: medical $1.2M, lost wages $2.8M, pain/suffering $4.5M), PMSC defenses (gear inspected August 2023 passed, Martinez contributory negligence failed to stand clear), trial Q3 2025 jury, expected verdict $2M-$5M after 30-50% comparative fault reduction
- **Cross-reference with**: T8 (maritime liens, tort judgment creates lien ranking above preferred mortgages, vessel arrest risk), T5 (LHWCA workers' comp for 3,200 longshoremen, annual claims $32M, reserve $180M)

**T10 (environmental-compliance-analyst - Environmental Litigation):**
- **Focus areas**: California Clean Air Act (Health & Safety Code Division 26), Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP voluntary), federal Clean Air Act preemption (42 U.S.C. § 7401, mobile source preemption), OPA 90 (33 U.S.C. § 2701, oil spill liability)

PMSC filed March 2024, demands 100% ZEV trucks by 2030, electric CHE $270M replacing 108 diesel units, shore power 6 berths $45M, total $315M+ capex, PMSC defenses Clean Air Act preemption of vessel regulations/lease termination right if uneconomic), Long Beach bunker spill (March 2023, 18,000 gallons HFO during bunkering hose rupture, Coast Guard penalty $185K paid August 2023, NOAA NRD claim $2M-$5M pending for killed fish/birds/oiled shoreline)
- **Cross-reference with**: T7 (port leases, LA lawsuit if City wins PMSC may exercise lease termination right rather than invest $315M), T6 (IMO environmental, shore power/vessel hotelling emissions interface)

**T11 (antitrust-competition-analyst - TPSA):**
- **Focus areas**: 46 U.S.C. § 40307 (antitrust immunity for FMC-filed agreements), Sherman Act Section 1 (15 U.S.C. § 1, per se illegal price fixing vs. rule of reason), Ocean Shipping Reform Act 1998 (OSRA limitations on immunity)

## EXECUTION PHASES

### PHASE 1: Parallel Research (T1-T11)

**Objective:** Execute 11 specialists concurrently

**Timeline:** 0-60 minutes

**Deliverables:** 11 specialist reports in `/Users/ej/Super-Legal/super-legal-mcp-refactored/reports/2026-01-10-1736546040/specialist-reports/`

**Execution Notes:**
- All 11 tasks independent, execute in parallel (maximum 8-10 concurrent recommended, stagger T11 if needed)
- Each specialist receives identical session directory: `2026-01-10-1736546040`
- Each specialist saves to: `specialist-reports/[domain-slug]-report.md`

### PHASE 2: Research Plan Refinement (CONTINUOUS)

**Objective:** Invoke `research-plan-refiner` after EACH specialist completes (if 3+ specialists still pending)

**Timeline:** Concurrent with Phase 1 (after each specialist completion)

**Trigger:** When specialist N completes and 3+ specialists still pending

**Process:**
1. Check completed count vs. pending count
2. If pending ≥ 3, invoke `research-plan-refiner` with:
   - `just_completed`: "[specialist-name]-report.md"
   - `completed_reports`: [list of all completed]
   - `pending_specialists`: [list of pending assignments]
   - `refinement_iteration`: N
3. Apply refinements to NEXT pending specialist only
4. Continue to next specialist with updated context

### PHASE 3: Tiered Parallel Validation (V1)

**Objective:** Quality assurance review via research-review-analyst (V1.1 GATE), then parallel validation via fact-validator + coverage-gap-analyzer + risk-aggregator (V1.2-4)

**Timeline:** 60-75 minutes

**Decision Gate:** V1.1 returns PROCEED or REMEDIATE (if REMEDIATE, spawn additional specialists, max 2 iterations)

**Parallel Phase:** After V1.1 PROCEED, invoke V1.2 + V1.3 + V1.4 simultaneously

**Deliverables:**
- `review-outputs/research-review-report.md` (V1.1)
- `review-outputs/fact-registry.md` (V1.2, canonical values for all section writers)
- `review-outputs/conflict-report.md` (V1.2, if conflicts detected)
- `review-outputs/coverage-gaps.md` (V1.3)
- `review-outputs/risk-summary.json` (V1.4, pre-aggregated for G1.2 executive summary)

### PHASE 4: Memorandum Synthesis (G1 + A1)

**Objective:** Generate complete memorandum via modular architecture

**Timeline:** 75-120 minutes

**Sub-Phases:**
- **G1.1**: Section generation (10 parallel `memo-section-writer` agents, one per section IV.A-K)
- **G1.1.5**: Section quality review (`section-report-reviewer` validates all sections before G1.2)
- **G1.2**: Executive summary (`memo-executive-summary-writer`, 2,500-3,500 words decision-focused)
- **G1.3**: Citation validation (`citation-validator`, consolidate footnotes with global numbering)
- **A1.1**: Final assembly (`final-assembly` subagent, concatenate all components)
- **A1.2**: Two-pass QA (diagnostic → remediation → certification)

**Output:** `final-memorandum.md` (60,000-85,000 words, 250-400 footnotes)

## RESEARCH QUALITY STANDARDS

### For Each Specialist Report:

- [ ] Executive Summary: 2,000-5,000 words, self-contained decision summary
- [ ] All critical issues from checklist addressed (or noted as N/A with reason)
- [ ] Quantified exposure ranges for material findings (dollar amounts, probabilities)
- [ ] Cross-domain impacts flagged with target section references (per anticipated patterns above)
- [ ] Bluebook citations with database provenance (U.S.C., CFR, case reporters, FMC dockets, Coast Guard records)
- [ ] Recommendations: specific, actionable, tied to legal authority (e.g., "hire 2 U.S. crew within 90 days per 46 U.S.C. § 55102")

### Citation Density Targets:

| Report Type | Target Citations | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Regulatory (FMC, Coast Guard, MTSA, IMO) | 60-100 | Heavy CFR/U.S.C./international conventions |
| Case Law (Jones Act, Section 905(b)) | 40-80 | Focus on maritime precedents, circuit splits |

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Document key assumptions for specialist context:

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| FMC License No. 024587 valid and current | User-provided (issued 1985) | If revoked/suspended, PMSC cannot operate as ocean common carrier (deal-blocking) |
| 22 vessels owned, 8 chartered per user data | User-provided fleet inventory | If vessel count incorrect, drydock costs/debt calculations off |
| $2.8B ship mortgage debt accurate | User-provided (Bank of America $850M, Citibank $720M, HSBC $680M, DVB Bank $550M) | If higher debt, debt/EBITDA covenant breach risk increases |
| ILWU contract expires July 1, 2028 | User-provided (PMA agreement) | If earlier expiration, strike risk timeline accelerates |
| Seattle TWIC reader extension pending | User-provided (filed October 2024) | If extension already denied, $25K/day penalty accruing since January 1 |
| M/V Pacific Titan repairs completed December 2024 | User-provided | If vessel still out of service, ongoing lost revenue |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual insurance policy terms not provided (using industry standard assumptions: hull & machinery $2M deductible, loss of hire 14-day exclusion)
- Target employee count estimated from user data (2,400 mariners, 3,200 longshoremen, 2,900 shoreside = 8,500 total, but no detailed org chart)
- Martinez 905(b) case discovery status unknown (assume standard discovery timeline, trial Q3 2025 per user data)

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:**
- Jones Act crew compliance (T2) must resolve before closing (2 vessels hire U.S. crew, 90-day timeline, condition precedent)
- Ship mortgage lender consents (T8) required before closing (if any lender refuses, must refinance $2.8B, delays closing 60-90 days)
- Seattle TWIC reader extension (T4) decision expected December-January (if denied, $25K/day penalty accrues from January 1, expedite installation to mitigate)

**Potential Issues:**
- If ILWU strike occurs Q1-Q2 2026 (before closing), West Coast ports shut down, PMSC terminal revenue $2.5M/day lost, potential MAE (material adverse effect) triggering buyer walk-away right
- If LA air quality lawsuit ruling before closing (motion to dismiss hearing Q1 2025), City wins and demands $315M capex, PMSC may exercise lease termination right for LA terminal ($420M annual revenue loss 13% of total), potential MAE
- If Oakland lease negotiation fails (Port insists on >$35M rent), PMSC exits Oakland terminal ($135M revenue loss 4% of total), modest impact but combined with LA terminal loss = 17% revenue decline

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Any finding >$100M exposure (e.g., Jones Act fleet-wide violation, ILWU 6-month strike, LA+Oakland terminal exits combined) → flag immediately for Investment Committee
- Deal-blocking regulatory issues (FMC license revocation, Jones Act vessel forfeiture, Coast Guard fleet-wide detention) → escalate to Investment Committee urgent review
- Lender consent refusal (any of 4 lenders refuses change of control) → escalate to M&A team for refinancing strategy

**RESEARCH PLAN STATUS:** READY FOR EXECUTION

**NEXT STEP:** Spawn T1-T11 specialists in parallel (Phase 1)
