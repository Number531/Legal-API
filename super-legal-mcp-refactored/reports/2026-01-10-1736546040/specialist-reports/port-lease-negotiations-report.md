## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

**Primary Research Questions:**
1. Oakland terminal lease renewal analysis: Fair market value assessment of $42M demand vs. $28M current rent
2. Walk-away threshold calculation: At what rent level does Oakland terminal become operationally unprofitable?
3. Change of control and assignment provisions across all 4 West Coast terminals
4. Port authority consent requirements and approval timelines
5. Alternative terminal availability in Oakland/Bay Area region
6. Lease termination rights and exit provisions
7. Port authority financial health and strategic priorities

**Terminals Under Review:**
- **Port of Oakland** (Outer Harbor Terminal, 50-acre facility)
- **Port of Los Angeles** (Pier 300)
- **Port of Long Beach** (Pier J)
- **Port of Seattle** (Terminal 46)

### B. Oakland Terminal Lease Renewal Dispute

**Current Lease Terms:**
- **Annual Rent:** $28M
- **Lease Term:** 5 years (expires June 30, 2026)
- **Facility Size:** 50 acres
- **Rent Per Acre:** $560,000/acre/year
- **Rent as % of Revenue:** 20.7% ($28M rent / $135M revenue)

**Port of Oakland Renewal Demand:**
- **Proposed Annual Rent:** $42M (+50% increase)
- **Proposed Rent Per Acre:** $840,000/acre/year
- **Rent as % of Revenue:** 31.1% ($42M / $135M)

**Terminal Operating Economics (Current):**
- **Revenue:** $135M annually
- **Current Rent:** $28M (20.7% of revenue)
- **Estimated EBITDA:** $45M (33.3% EBITDA margin) [METHODOLOGY: Based on research plan statement: "PMSC's terminal EBITDA $45M"]
- **EBITDA After Rent:** $17M (12.6% margin)

**Terminal Operating Economics (If $42M Rent Accepted):**
- **Revenue:** $135M annually
- **Proposed Rent:** $42M (31.1% of revenue)
- **Estimated EBITDA:** $45M
- **EBITDA After Rent:** **$3M (2.2% margin)** [UNECONOMIC]

### C. Port of Oakland Financial Context

**Credit Ratings (2024-2025):**
- **Fitch Ratings:** A+ (senior lien bonds), A (intermediate lien bonds), Outlook: Positive (June 2025)
- **Moody's:** A1 (senior lien), Stable Outlook (December 2024)

**Rating Rationale:** Strong liquidity, healthy debt service coverage, diverse revenue streams (aviation, maritime, commercial real estate), significant debt reduction, manageable capital spending, substantial long-term debt capacity.

**Lease Revenue Context:** SSA Terminals (Port of Oakland's largest tenant, handling ~70% of maritime business) pays average annual fixed rent of $72M + variable rent of $26M = $98M total under 2020 lease extension through 2027.

### D. Alternative Terminal Availability - Bay Area

**Six Bay Area Seaports:**
1. **Port of Oakland** (primary container terminal)
2. Port of San Francisco
3. **Port of Richmond** (third largest CA tonnage: 19M short tons annually)
4. **Port of Benicia**
5. Port of Redwood City
6. Port of Stockton

**Port of Richmond:**
- **Cargo Profile:** Liquid bulk, automobiles, break-bulk (steel, lumber, heavy machinery)
- **Container Handling:** Limited/none (specialized in Ro-Ro and bulk)
- **Capacity Status:** Operating at or near capacity for Ro-Ro operations
- **Facilities:** 5 City-owned terminals + 10 privately-owned terminals

**Port of Benicia:**
- **Cargo Profile:** Automobiles, petrocoke
- **Container Handling:** No container terminal facilities
- **Capacity Status:** Operating near capacity for auto Ro-Ro

**CRITICAL FINDING:** No viable alternative container terminal exists in the Oakland/Bay Area region. Port of Richmond and Port of Benicia are specialized for Ro-Ro/bulk cargo and operating near capacity. Relocating PMSC's Oakland container operations would require moving to Los Angeles/Long Beach complex (330+ miles south) or Port of Seattle/Tacoma (815+ miles north), incurring substantial customer service disruption and logistics costs.
