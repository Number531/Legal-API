### B. Jones Act Legal Framework

The Jones Act, codified at 46 U.S.C. § 55102, is the cornerstone of U.S. maritime cabotage law. Originally enacted as Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the Jones Act establishes a comprehensive regulatory regime requiring vessels engaged in coastwise trade to satisfy three core requirements: U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged (documented with coastwise endorsement), and U.S.-crewed.

**Primary Statutory Authority:**
- **46 U.S.C. § 55102**: Transportation of merchandise between U.S. points
- **46 U.S.C. § 8103**: Citizenship and crew requirements
- **46 U.S.C. § 12112**: Coastwise endorsement requirements
- **46 CFR Part 67**: Documentation of vessels and citizenship requirements

**Enforcement Authority:**
- **U.S. Coast Guard**: Build determinations, ownership qualifications, crew citizenship verification
- **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)**: Cargo transportation compliance, coastwise trade enforcement
- **Maritime Administration (MARAD)**: Policy guidance and vessel documentation oversight

CBP established the Jones Act Division of Enforcement (JADE) in New Orleans as a centralized enforcement office for all coastwise trade matters. [The Jones Act - U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Jones%20Act%20ICP_Complete_04DEC24.pdf)

### C. Historical Context and Policy Rationale

The Jones Act serves multiple policy objectives:
1. **National Security**: Maintains U.S.-flag merchant fleet and trained mariners available for military sealift during national emergencies
2. **Economic Protection**: Preserves U.S. shipbuilding industrial base and maritime employment
3. **Regulatory Jurisdiction**: Ensures vessels in coastwise trade remain subject to U.S. labor, safety, and environmental laws

The statute applies to transportation of "merchandise" between "points in the United States," defined to include all U.S. states, territories, and possessions. [46 U.S. Code § 55102 - Transportation of merchandise](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/55102)

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Three Core Jones Act Requirements (46 U.S.C. § 55102)

#### 1. U.S.-Built Requirement

**Statutory Provision**: 46 U.S.C. § 55102(b) requires vessels engaged in coastwise trade to be wholly owned by U.S. citizens and documented with a coastwise endorsement, which requires U.S. construction.

**Coast Guard Standard**: Coast Guard regulations provide that a vessel must be "assembled entirely in the United States" and all "major components of the hull and superstructure" must be fabricated in the United States. [U.S. Coast Guard Issues Jones Act Build and Rebuilt Guidance](https://www.winston.com/en/blogs-and-podcasts/maritime-fedwatch/u-s-coast-guard-issues-jones-act-build-and-rebuilt-guidance)

**Foreign Component Tolerance**: The Coast Guard applies a de minimis exception for foreign-built components. In a July 25 determination for two container vessels at Philly Shipyard, Inc., the Coast Guard determined that components (including stern block and bulbous bow plates) weighing less than 1.5 percent of total vessel weight could be imported and installed without affecting Jones Act eligibility. [U.S. Coast Guard Issues Jones Act Build and Rebuilt Guidance](https://www.winston.com/en/blogs-and-podcasts/maritime-fedwatch/u-s-coast-guard-issues-jones-act-build-and-rebuilt-guidance)

**Verification Method**: CBP issues Ruling Letters advising whether vessels meet U.S.-built requirements. These rulings enable parties to seek interpretation before commencing coastwise operations. [Jones Act Compliance for Offshore Operations](https://seaofgravity.com/jones-act-offshore/)

**Application to PMSC Fleet**: The research plan indicates that 6 of PMSC's 22 vessels are designated as Jones Act-compliant, suggesting U.S. build verification has been completed. However, the plan also references "offshore wind vessels COSCO-built ineligible" representing a "$35M stranded investment" because foreign-built vessels cannot serve U.S. offshore renewable energy installations requiring coastwise trade. This demonstrates the strict enforcement of the U.S.-built requirement with no exceptions absent a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security.

**Penalty for Foreign-Built Vessels**: If a foreign-built vessel engages in coastwise trade without a DHS waiver, the vessel and cargo are subject to seizure and forfeiture. CBP may impose civil penalties up to the value of the merchandise transported or the cost of the transportation, whichever is greater. [46 U.S. Code § 55102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/55102)

#### 2. U.S.-Flagged Requirement (Coastwise Endorsement)

**Statutory Provision**: 46 U.S.C. § 12112 establishes that only vessels holding a Certificate of Documentation issued by the U.S. Coast Guard with a coastwise endorsement may engage in coastwise trade.

**Citizenship Requirements for Coastwise Endorsement** (46 CFR Part 67 Subpart C):

**For Corporations** (PMSC Structure):
- At least 75% of stock interest must be owned by U.S. citizens
- Corporation must be organized under U.S. laws
- Chief executive officer and chairman of board must be U.S. citizens
- No more than a minority of directors may be non-citizens

**For Individual Owners**:
- All owners must be U.S. citizens (native-born, naturalized, or derivative citizenship)

**For Partnerships**:
- At least 75% of equity interest must be owned by U.S. citizens

**For Trusts**:
- At least 75% of equity interest must be owned by U.S. citizens
[46 U.S.C. § 12112 - Coastwise endorsement](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/12112)
[46 CFR Part 67 Subpart C - Citizenship Requirements](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-46/chapter-I/subchapter-G/part-67/subpart-C)

**Change of Control Implications**: When PMSC is acquired by Global Logistics Partners LLC, the vessels' coastwise endorsements remain valid only if Global Logistics Partners satisfies the 75% U.S. citizen ownership requirement for the acquiring entity. If the private equity structure includes foreign limited partners exceeding 25% ownership, the vessels would lose coastwise endorsement eligibility, rendering them unable to engage in U.S. coastwise trade.

**Documentary Evidence Required During Due Diligence**:
- Certificate of Documentation for each of 6 Jones Act vessels
- Verification that coastwise endorsements are current and not suspended
- Corporate ownership structure demonstrating 75% U.S. citizen ownership
- Verification that chief executive officer and board chairman are U.S. citizens

**Penalty for Operating Without Coastwise Endorsement**: A vessel employed in coastwise trade without appropriate endorsement is "liable to seizure by and forfeiture to, the United States government." [Jones Act Compliance for Offshore Operations](https://seaofgravity.com/jones-act-offshore/)

#### 3. U.S.-Crewed Requirement (46 U.S.C. § 8103) - **CRITICAL COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY**

**Statutory Provisions**:

**Licensed Officers** (46 U.S.C. § 8103(a)):
"Only a citizen of the United States may serve as master, chief engineer, radio officer, or officer in charge of a deck watch or engineering watch on a documented vessel."

**Unlicensed Seamen** (46 U.S.C. § 8103(b)):
On a documented vessel, at least **75 percent of the unlicensed seamen** (excluding licensed officers) must be:
- United States citizens, OR
- Aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence, OR
- Merchant Marine Academy students

The statute permits up to 25% of unlicensed crew to be lawful permanent residents (green card holders), but not more than 25% may be non-citizen permanent residents. [46 U.S.C. § 8103 - Citizenship and Navy Reserve requirements](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/8103)

**Exclusions from the 75% Calculation**:
- Licensed officers are excluded from the 75% calculation (but must be 100% U.S. citizens per subsection (a))
- Fishing vessels, whaling vessels, and yachts have separate standards
- Vessels operating outside the U.S. exclusive economic zone may qualify for waivers

**Secretary's Waiver Authority** (46 U.S.C. § 8103(c)):
The Secretary of Homeland Security "may reduce the percentage" if investigation determines that "United States seamen are not available." However, waivers are **rarely granted** and typically limited to:
- Offshore supply vessels under 1,600 gross tons operating from foreign ports
- Mobile offshore drilling units beyond the Continental Shelf
- Emergency situations where qualified U.S. mariners demonstrably unavailable

**Historical Waiver Frequency**: Federal Register notices indicate waivers are primarily granted for commercial fishing vessels experiencing seasonal crew shortages. During 2005-2009, the Coast Guard issued an average of 108 reports of violations of 46 U.S.C. § 8103, with 75 such reports issued in 2009 alone, demonstrating active enforcement. [Federal Register - Waiver of Citizenship Requirements for Crewmembers on Commercial Fishing Vessels](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/02/14/2014-03302/waiver-of-citizenship-requirements-for-crewmembers-on-commercial-fishing-vessels)

**Penalties for Crew Citizenship Violations** (46 U.S.C. § 8103(f)):

**Original Statutory Penalty**: $500 per individual employed in violation

**Inflation-Adjusted Penalty (2025)**: **$1,562 per individual** per violation [Coast Guard Civil Monetary Penalty Adjustments for Inflation, 33 CFR § 27.3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/33/27.3)

**CRITICAL CORRECTION**: The research plan and task assignment reference a penalty of "$1,100 per ton of cargo carried + vessel forfeiture." This appears to conflate two separate penalty provisions:

1. **46 U.S.C. § 8103(f)**: Crew citizenship violations carry **$1,562 per individual** (inflation-adjusted 2025)
2. **46 U.S.C. § 55111**: Vessel towing violations carry "$1,100 and $60 per ton of the towed vessel"

The correct penalty for **crew citizenship violations under § 8103** is **$1,562 per non-compliant crew member**, NOT per ton of cargo. However, vessels operating in violation of coastwise trade laws (including crew requirements) remain subject to cargo forfeiture under 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c).

### B. PMSC Crew Compliance Analysis: M/V Pacific Titan and M/V Pacific Guardian

#### 1. Current Crew Composition

**Research Plan Data**:
- M/V Pacific Titan: Currently at 73% U.S. crew (NON-COMPLIANT)
- M/V Pacific Guardian: Currently at 73% U.S. crew (NON-COMPLIANT)
- Both vessels: 41,800 DWT container ships

**Assumed Crew Complement**: Container vessels of 41,800 DWT typically operate with 20-24 crew members total, consisting of:
- **Licensed Officers**: 8-10 (Master, Chief Mate, 2nd Mate, 3rd Mate, Chief Engineer, 1st Engineer, 2nd Engineer, 3rd Engineer, plus Radio Officer on some vessels)
- **Unlicensed Crew**: 12-14 (Able Seamen, Ordinary Seamen, Qualified Members Engine Department (QMED), Steward Department)

**Baseline Assumption**: Using 22 total crew (industry standard for this vessel class):
- Licensed Officers: 9 (must be 100% U.S. citizens per § 8103(a))
- Unlicensed Crew: 13

#### 2. Calculating Non-Compliance

**75% Requirement Applied to Unlicensed Crew**:
- 13 unlicensed crew × 75% = **9.75 crew members must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents**
- Rounding up (as Coast Guard applies): **10 of 13 unlicensed crew must satisfy citizenship requirements**

**Current Status at 73%**:
- 13 unlicensed crew × 73% = **9.49 crew members** currently satisfy citizenship requirements
- Rounding: **9 of 13 unlicensed crew** currently compliant

**Shortfall**: Each vessel requires **1 additional U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident unlicensed crew member** to achieve 75% compliance (10/13 = 76.9% compliant)

**Total Hiring Need**:
- M/V Pacific Titan: 1 additional U.S. crew member
- M/V Pacific Guardian: 1 additional U.S. crew member
- **Combined: 2 additional U.S. citizen unlicensed mariners required fleet-wide**

#### 3. Penalty Exposure Calculation

**Per-Violation Penalty** (46 U.S.C. § 8103(f)):
- **$1,562 per individual** employed in violation (2025 inflation-adjusted)

**M/V Pacific Titan**:
- 1 non-compliant crew member × $1,562 = **$1,562 per voyage**

**M/V Pacific Guardian**:
- 1 non-compliant crew member × $1,562 = **$1,562 per voyage**

**Annual Voyage Frequency** (Assumption):
Trans-Pacific container vessels typically complete:
- 12-15 round-trip voyages per year (approximately 24-30 days per round trip, including port time)
- Assuming 12 coastwise voyages per year per vessel (conservative estimate, as research plan indicates only 10% of revenue is U.S. coastwise)

**Annual Penalty Exposure**:
- M/V Pacific Titan: $1,562 × 12 voyages = **$18,744 per year**
- M/V Pacific Guardian: $1,562 × 12 voyages = **$18,744 per year**
- **Combined Annual Exposure: $37,488**

**Cumulative Exposure** (if violations date back):
Coast Guard statute of limitations for civil penalties is typically 5 years. If both vessels have operated at 73% crew for the past 3 years:
- Combined 3-year exposure: $37,488 × 3 = **$112,464**

#### 4. Vessel Forfeiture Risk

**Statutory Authority**: 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c) provides that "merchandise transported in violation of subsection (b) is liable to seizure by and forfeiture to the Government." While § 8103 does not expressly authorize vessel forfeiture for crew citizenship violations, vessels operating in coastwise trade without satisfying all three Jones Act requirements (U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, **U.S.-crewed**) may be deemed to lack proper coastwise endorsement authority.

**Precedent - Trico Marine Investigation**:
In the Trico Marine citizenship enforcement case, the Coast Guard:
- Calculated penalties both per vessel ($5,978,000) and per owner ($1,096,000)
- Recommended the higher per-vessel penalty
- **Considered vessel seizure and forfeiture**, but those recommendations were not ultimately approved
- Settled for significant civil penalties without forfeiture

[Coast Guard Request for Comments on Mechanisms used by Publicly Traded Jones Act Companies to Prove Citizenship Following the Trico Investigation](https://www.blankrome.com/publications/coast-guard-request-comments-mechanisms-used-publicly-traded-jones-act-companies-prove)

**Risk Assessment**: While the Coast Guard has statutory authority to recommend vessel forfeiture for Jones Act violations, actual forfeitures are exceedingly rare and typically reserved for:
- Willful, knowing violations
- Systematic fraud in citizenship documentation
- Violations involving foreign ownership disguised as U.S. ownership

For PMSC's 2% crew citizenship shortfall (73% vs. 75%), vessel forfeiture is **unlikely** but cannot be categorically ruled out if the Coast Guard determines the violation was intentional or longstanding. The greater risk is civil penalties, reputational harm, and potential suspension of coastwise endorsements until compliance achieved.

#### 5. Cargo Forfeiture Risk

**Statutory Authority**: 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c) provides for seizure and forfeiture of "merchandise transported in violation" of the Jones Act.

**Penalty Alternative**: "An amount equal to the value of the merchandise (as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security) or the actual cost of the transportation, whichever is greater, may be recovered from any person transporting the merchandise or causing the merchandise to be transported."

**Application to Container Vessels**:
If CBP determines that M/V Pacific Titan or M/V Pacific Guardian violated coastwise trade laws due to crew non-compliance, CBP could:
1. **Seize cargo** transported on non-compliant voyages, OR
2. **Assess civil penalty** equal to the greater of:
   - Value of merchandise transported, OR
   - Cost of transportation

**Example Exposure Calculation** (Per Voyage):
- 41,800 DWT vessel carrying containers valued at $50M (typical high-value consumer goods)
- Transportation cost (freight revenue): $2M per voyage
- CBP could assess penalty of **$50M** (value of merchandise, the greater amount)

**Historic Jones Act Cargo Penalty - Furie Operating Alaska**:

**Facts**: Furie shipped the Spartan 151 jack-up drill rig from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Cook Inlet, Alaska via a foreign-flag heavy lift vessel in 2011, routing through Canada.

**Initial Penalty**: CBP assessed **$15 million** (later settled for $10 million)

**Legal Issue**: Furie argued the rig was a "vessel" (subject to lower towing penalties under 46 U.S.C. § 55111: $1,100 + $60/ton), not "merchandise" (subject to full forfeiture under § 55102).

**Court Holding**: U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska held that when jack-up drilling rigs are carried aboard another vessel on coastwise voyages, they are being transported in a commercial sense and lose their function as vessels, thus constituting "merchandise" subject to full Jones Act penalties.

**Significance**: The court upheld CBP's authority to assess penalties equal to the value of the "merchandise" transported, not merely a per-ton penalty. This was the **largest Jones Act penalty ever assessed** and demonstrates aggressive enforcement posture.

[Furie Operating Alaska LLC Settlement - DOJ Press Release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ak/pr/alaska-oil-company-agrees-pay-10-million-penalties-settle-federal-claims-violating-jones)

**Risk Assessment for PMSC**:
While crew citizenship violations (73% vs. 75%) are less egregious than operating entirely foreign-crewed or foreign-built vessels, CBP retains discretion to pursue cargo-based penalties. If CBP determines violations were knowing and systematic, each non-compliant voyage could theoretically expose PMSC to penalties equal to the value of cargo transported.

**Mitigating Factors**:
- Crew shortfall is only 2 percentage points (2% vs. 25% foreign crew)
- Likely attributable to hiring difficulties rather than intentional evasion
- Prompt remediation demonstrates good faith

**Realistic Exposure**: More likely outcome is per-crew-member penalties ($1,562 per violation) rather than cargo forfeiture, but acquirer should secure **seller indemnification** for any CBP or Coast Guard enforcement actions arising from pre-closing violations.
