## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Transaction and Fleet Context

Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (PMSC) operates a 22-vessel fleet subject to comprehensive International Maritime Organization (IMO) environmental regulations under MARPOL 73/78 and related conventions. The fleet includes:

- **18 container ships**: 4 Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs, 18,000-20,000 TEU), 8 New Panamax (10,000-13,000 TEU), 6 Post-Panamax (6,000-8,000 TEU)
- **4 bulk carriers**: Including M/V Pacific Voyager and M/V Pacific Explorer
- **Annual fuel consumption**: Approximately 2.4 million tons at estimated costs of $480 million (using Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil at 0.1% sulfur content)
- **Primary trade routes**: Trans-Pacific eastbound (China → U.S., 65% revenue), westbound (15%), intra-Asia (10%), U.S. coastwise Jones Act (10%)

### B. Critical CII Compliance Issue

Two PMSC bulk carriers received "D" (minor inferior performance) ratings under the IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) system for consecutive years:

1. **M/V Pacific Voyager**: CII D rating for 2023 and 2024 (user-provided data) [PENDING VERIFICATION - actual IMO CII rating requires flag state/classification society confirmation]
2. **M/V Pacific Explorer**: CII D rating for 2023 and 2024 (user-provided data) [PENDING VERIFICATION]

**Regulatory Risk**: If either vessel receives a third consecutive "D" rating in 2025, it will trigger mandatory corrective action plan requirements under IMO Resolution MEPC.328(76) and MARPOL Annex VI amendments that entered into force November 1, 2022.

**Financial Exposure**: Both vessels face potential:
- **Vessel value write-down**: $23M-$37M per vessel (estimated range based on book value vs. distressed market value for D-rated vessels)
- **Operational restrictions**: Speed reduction requirements, route limitations, reduced charter attractiveness
- **Premature scrapping risk**: If corrective action plans fail to achieve "C" or better rating by 2026-2027

### C. Regulatory Timeline Context

- **January 1, 2023**: EEXI (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index) and CII requirements became mandatory (IMO Resolution MEPC.328(76))
- **2024**: First CII ratings issued based on 2023 operational data
- **March 31, 2025**: Deadline for PMSC to submit 2024 annual operational CII data to flag state
- **Q2 2025**: PMSC will receive 2024 CII ratings (determining if vessels receive third consecutive "D")
- **By January 1, 2026**: IMO required review of CII/EEXI effectiveness
- **2026 onwards**: Increasingly stringent CII reference lines (reduction factors compound annually)

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) - Critical Compliance Risk

#### 1. Regulatory Framework

**Primary Authority**: MARPOL Annex VI, as amended by IMO Resolution MEPC.328(76) (adopted June 17, 2021, entered into force November 1, 2022).

**CII Rating System**: The IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator measures operational carbon intensity on an A-E scale:
- **A**: Major superior performance (best)
- **B**: Minor superior performance
- **C**: Moderate performance
- **D**: Minor inferior performance
- **E**: Inferior performance (worst)

**Applicability**: All cargo, RoPax, and cruise vessels above 5,000 gross tonnage trading internationally must calculate annual operational CII and receive ratings starting with 2023 operational data (first ratings issued 2024).

**CII Calculation**: The CII unit is "grams of CO2 emitted per cargo-carrying capacity times nautical mile," with cargo capacity measured as deadweight or gross tonnage depending on ship type. The required CII becomes more stringent each year through reduction factors.

**Legal Citation**:
- MARPOL 73/78, Annex VI, Regulation 28 (Attained Annual Operational CII and CII Rating)
- IMO Resolution MEPC.328(76), *2021 Revised MARPOL Annex VI*
- IMO Resolution MEPC.355(78), *2022 Interim Guidelines on Correction Factors and Voyage Adjustments for CII Calculations*

#### 2. Corrective Action Plan Requirement

**Trigger**: A vessel rated "D" for three consecutive years OR "E" for one year must develop a corrective action plan as part of the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) Part III.

**SEEMP Part III Requirements** (IMO Resolution MEPC.346(78)):
- CII calculation methodology
- Required CII values for next 3 years
- Implementation plan for achieving required CII
- Procedures for self-evaluation and improvement
- **If D-rated 3 years or E-rated 1 year**: Corrective action plan analyzing why required CII not achieved and revised implementation plan

**Verification**: The corrective action plan must be verified by the flag state Administration or Recognized Organization (classification society) before a Statement of Compliance can be issued. A revised SEEMP must be submitted within one month of reporting the attained annual operational CII.

**Plan Characteristics**: Ship-specific, must follow SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound), outline corrective measures with timelines and expected impact on CII rating.

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION**: There is **NO IMO-mandated scrapping requirement** for vessels receiving three consecutive D ratings. The requirement is solely to develop and implement a corrective action plan demonstrating how the vessel will achieve at least a "C" rating. However, commercial and financial pressures create *de facto* scrapping risk (discussed below in Section IV.A.5).

**Legal Citation**:
- IMO Resolution MEPC.346(78), *2022 Guidelines on the Method of Calculation of the Attained Annual Operational CII* (SEEMP Part III requirements)
- 33 U.S.C. § 1901 et seq. (U.S. implementation authority for international conventions)

#### 3. PMSC D-Rated Vessels: Specific Risk Profile

**M/V Pacific Voyager** [HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO - vessel names and data provided by user for due diligence exercise]:
- **Vessel Type**: Bulk carrier
- **CII Ratings**: D (2023), D (2024) [PENDING VERIFICATION - requires flag state IMO Data Collection System (DCS) confirmation]
- **2025 Rating Risk**: If vessel receives D rating in 2025 (based on 2024 operations), triggers mandatory corrective action plan requirement
- **Operational Context**: Bulk carriers typically face CII challenges due to ballast voyages (empty return legs with zero cargo-carrying capacity but full fuel consumption)

**M/V Pacific Explorer** [HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO]:
- **Vessel Type**: Bulk carrier
- **CII Ratings**: D (2023), D (2024) [PENDING VERIFICATION]
- **2025 Rating Risk**: Same trigger as M/V Pacific Voyager
- **Operational Context**: Similar bulk carrier CII challenges

**Compliance Timeline**:
- **March 31, 2025**: PMSC submits 2024 fuel consumption data to flag state via IMO DCS
- **Q2 2025**: Flag state (or delegated classification society) calculates and issues 2024 CII rating
- **If D rating received**: Within 1 month, submit revised SEEMP Part III with corrective action plan to classification society for verification
- **By end of 2025**: Implement corrective measures to achieve C rating for 2025 operations
- **March 31, 2026**: Submit 2025 data; Q2 2026 rating determines success or failure of corrective action plan

**Verification Status**: [HYPOTHETICAL - for purposes of this legal memorandum, actual IMO DCS data access requires:]
- Flag state coordination (vessels flagged in [jurisdiction to be confirmed from vessel registry data])
- Classification society verification (e.g., ABS, DNV, Lloyd's Register)
- IMO Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) query for public CII ratings (if released)

#### 4. Corrective Action Plan Strategies for D-Rated Bulk Carriers

If either vessel receives a third consecutive D rating, PMSC must implement one or more of the following strategies to achieve C rating:

##### a. Speed Reduction (Slow Steaming)

**Description**: Reduce sailing speed to lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions per voyage. Slow steaming is the most common CII improvement strategy.

**Effectiveness**: Research indicates speed optimization can reduce fuel consumption by 4.54% compared to original operational modes (source: Ocean Engineering journal, 2023 study on CII compliance).

**Drawbacks**:
- Longer voyage times reduce vessel earning capacity
- May breach charter party obligations requiring "utmost despatch"
- Reduces vessel attractiveness to time-sensitive cargo charterers
- May require additional vessels to maintain same trade route frequency (capital expenditure)

**Cost-Benefit**: Lower fuel costs offset by reduced revenue-earning days; net impact depends on charter rate market

**Legal Considerations**:
- Review charter party clauses: Does "full speed" or "utmost despatch" language prevent speed reduction?
- Negotiate charter party addenda with charterers allowing speed flexibility for CII compliance
- Consider voyage charter vs. time charter implications (time charter hirer controls speed, owner bears fuel cost)

##### b. Route Optimization

**Description**: Select most direct routes, avoid adverse weather, optimize for favorable currents, reduce port waiting time ("just-in-time" arrival coordination).

**Effectiveness**: Can reduce fuel consumption by 2-5% depending on trade route and weather routing capabilities

**Drawbacks**:
- Requires sophisticated weather routing software and real-time operational coordination
- Port congestion/berth unavailability may limit just-in-time arrival effectiveness
- Not all routes offer significant optimization potential (trans-Pacific routes relatively direct)

**Technology Investment**: $50K-$150K per vessel for advanced weather routing and voyage optimization systems

##### c. Energy-Saving Devices (ESDs)

**Description**: Retrofit vessels with energy-saving devices to improve propulsion efficiency:
- **Propeller upgrades**: Optimized propeller designs (4-7% fuel savings)
- **Hull surface treatments**: Anti-fouling coatings, air lubrication systems (2-5% savings)
- **EnergoProFin/EnergoFlow**: Fin and flow optimization devices (3-6% savings)
- **Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS)**: Capture engine exhaust heat to generate auxiliary power (4-8% savings)

**Effectiveness**: Combined ESD retrofits can reduce CO2 emissions by 5-9% (source: classification society research for bulkers)

**Capital Expenditure**:
- Propeller upgrade: $200K-$400K per vessel (requires drydocking)
- Air lubrication system: $1M-$3M per vessel (major retrofit)
- WHRS: $500K-$2M per vessel (space constraints on older vessels may preclude installation)
- Hull coatings: $150K-$300K per vessel (during scheduled drydock)

**ROI Timeline**: 3-7 years depending on fuel prices and operational profile

**Drydock Coordination**: Most ESDs require drydocking, which can be coordinated with mandatory surveys to minimize off-hire time. For PMSC fleet with 22 vessels on 2.5-4 year drydock cycles, annual drydock expenditure is already $25M-$40M; ESD retrofits add incremental cost.

##### d. Engine Power Limitation (EPL)

**Description**: Physically limit maximum engine power output to reduce fuel consumption and meet EEXI requirements (complementary to CII).

**Effectiveness**: Can improve EEXI/CII ratings by restricting maximum speed, but permanently reduces vessel operational flexibility

**Drawbacks**:
- Irreversible (or requires costly reversal if future regulations change)
- Reduces maximum speed capability, limiting vessel employment opportunities
- Charterers may reject EPL-equipped vessels for time-sensitive cargo

**Cost**: Relatively low ($50K-$150K for EPL installation) but significant operational trade-off

**Strategic Consideration**: EPL is a "last resort" measure suitable for aging vessels nearing end of economic life, not optimal for mid-life bulk carriers with 10-15 years remaining service

##### e. Operational Efficiency Measures

**Description**: No-cost or low-cost operational changes:
- Enhanced hull cleaning frequency (reduces drag, 1-3% fuel savings)
- Propeller polishing (reduces resistance, 1-2% fuel savings)
- Trim optimization (adjust vessel loading to minimize resistance)
- Improved voyage planning (reduce ballast legs, coordinate cargoes)

**Effectiveness**: Combined operational measures can yield 3-5% fuel savings

**Implementation**: Requires crew training, enhanced monitoring systems, and operational discipline

**Cost**: $20K-$50K per vessel for monitoring systems and crew training programs

#### 5. Financial Exposure Analysis: Vessel Write-Down and Scrapping Risk

While IMO regulations do NOT mandate scrapping for D-rated vessels, commercial and financial pressures create *de facto* scrapping risk:

##### a. Vessel Devaluation Data (Market Evidence)

**CII Rating Impact on Vessel Values** (source: VesselsValue, maritime valuation firm, 2024 analysis):
- **A-rated vessels**: +7% resale value premium vs. baseline
- **C-rated vessels**: Baseline market value
- **E-rated vessels**: -12% to -15% resale value discount vs. baseline

**D-rated vessels fall between C and E**: Estimated -8% to -10% discount for D-rated vessels with no corrective action plan; -15% to -20% discount for D-rated vessels with failed corrective action plans or third consecutive D rating.

**Liquidity Impact**: E-rated vessels traded 4.2% less frequently than higher-rated vessels due to buyer concerns about capital requirements and earnings potential (source: shipping market research, 2024).

##### b. PMSC Vessel Write-Down Exposure Calculation

**Assumptions** (for hypothetical write-down scenario):
- **M/V Pacific Voyager current book value**: $30 million (estimated for bulk carrier of ~50,000 DWT, 15 years old, straight-line depreciation over 25-year life)
- **M/V Pacific Explorer current book value**: $32 million (similar vessel, slightly newer or larger)
- **Combined book value**: $62 million

**Scenario 1: Third Consecutive D Rating, Corrective Action Plan Implemented (Moderate Risk)**

Market discount for D-rated vessel with active corrective action plan: **-10%**

- M/V Pacific Voyager impaired value: $27 million (write-down: $3 million)
- M/V Pacific Explorer impaired value: $28.8 million (write-down: $3.2 million)
- **Total write-down exposure: $6.2 million**

**Scenario 2: Third Consecutive D Rating, Corrective Action Plan Fails, Fourth Consecutive D Rating (High Risk)**

Market discount for persistently D-rated vessel: **-18%**

- M/V Pacific Voyager impaired value: $24.6 million (write-down: $5.4 million)
- M/V Pacific Explorer impaired value: $26.24 million (write-down: $5.76 million)
- **Total write-down exposure: $11.16 million**

**Scenario 3: E Rating or Scrapping Decision (Extreme Risk)**

If corrective action plans fail and vessels slip to E rating, or if owner determines corrective measures uneconomic:

- **Scrap value**: Bulk carrier scrap value based on lightweight tonnage (LWT) × steel scrap price
- **Estimated scrap value**: $4-8 million per vessel (assuming 8,000-12,000 LWT × $350-550/LWT scrap steel prices)
- M/V Pacific Voyager write-down: $30M - $6M = **$24 million loss**
- M/V Pacific Explorer write-down: $32M - $6M = **$26 million loss**
- **Total write-down exposure: $50 million** (catastrophic scenario)

**User-Provided Range Validation**: The user-provided write-down estimate of **$23M-$37M per vessel** aligns with Scenario 3 (scrapping decision), representing book value minus scrap value. This is the maximum credible exposure if vessels are deemed uneconomic to operate under CII constraints.

##### c. Ship Mortgage Covenant Breach Risk

PMSC has $2.8 billion in preferred ship mortgages across 22 vessels (see research-plan.md, Task T8). Typical ship mortgage covenants require:
- **Vessel value covenant**: Market value must exceed 130% of outstanding loan balance (standard vessel LTV ratio)

**Covenant Breach Scenario**:
- If M/V Pacific Voyager has $15 million outstanding mortgage balance, vessel must maintain market value ≥ $19.5 million
- If vessel written down to $24.6 million (Scenario 2), covenant remains satisfied
- If vessel written down to $6 million (Scenario 3 scrap value), covenant breached: **$19.5M required - $6M actual = $13.5M deficiency**
- **Lender remedies**: Demand additional collateral, accelerate loan, or require vessel sale/refinancing

**Cross-Reference to T8 (Maritime Liens and Mortgages)**: CII-driven vessel devaluation directly impacts ship mortgage covenants. If covenant breach occurs across multiple vessels, lenders may declare cross-default across entire $2.8B mortgage portfolio.

##### d. Operational Restrictions and Charter Market Impact

**Charterer Avoidance**: Vessels with D or E ratings face commercial discrimination:
- Time charterers and voyage charterers prefer C-rated or better vessels to minimize reputational risk and potential port state control scrutiny
- Charter rates for D-rated vessels may trade at 5-10% discount to C-rated peers
- Some cargo interests (particularly European Union shippers subject to FuelEU Maritime and corporate ESG commitments) may explicitly exclude D/E-rated vessels from tender processes

**Lost Revenue Exposure**:
- If M/V Pacific Voyager and M/V Pacific Explorer each earn $8 million annually in charter revenue
- 10% charter rate discount due to D rating = $800K annual lost revenue per vessel
- Over 3-year corrective action period: $2.4 million per vessel, $4.8 million combined lost revenue

**Idle Time Risk**: If charterers reject vessels entirely, owner faces:
- Zero revenue during idle period
- Ongoing operating expenses (~$5,000-$7,000/day for crew, insurance, maintenance)
- Forced layup or distressed sale scenarios

##### e. Scrapping Decision Analysis

**Economic Scrapping Triggers**:
1. **Corrective action costs exceed vessel value**: If ESD retrofits cost $3-5M per vessel but market value (D-rated) is only $24-27M, ROI is poor
2. **Charter market rejects vessel**: If cannot secure employment above operating cost break-even (~$8,000-$10,000/day for bulk carrier)
3. **Mortgage covenant breach**: Lender forces sale; distressed market yields only scrap value
4. **Regulatory obsolescence**: Future IMO regulations (e.g., 2030 targets) make compliance prohibitively expensive

**Fleet Rationalization Strategy**: Rather than invest $3-5M per vessel in ESDs + ongoing operational inefficiency (slow steaming), PMSC may elect to:
- Scrap both D-rated bulk carriers (recover $12-16M scrap value)
- Redeploy capital to younger, more efficient vessels or alternative vessel types
- Write off $46-50M loss as one-time charge vs. ongoing D-rating operational drag

**Precedent**: Industry data shows bulker scrapping more than doubled from 17 vessels in H1 2022 to 42 vessels in H1 2023, driven in part by CII regulations making older tonnage uneconomic (source: maritime analytics firms, 2023 scrapping reports).

#### 6. 2025 Rating Projection and Mitigation Timeline

**Critical Path to Avoid Third Consecutive D Rating**:

**Now - March 2025**:
- Analyze 2024 operational data (fuel consumption, cargo carried, distances sailed)
- Model 2024 CII rating (engage classification society for preliminary calculation)
- If projection shows D rating likely, implement immediate operational measures:
  - Speed reduction on remaining 2024 voyages (if any)
  - Enhanced hull cleaning before year-end
  - Optimize Q1 2025 voyage planning

**April - June 2025** (upon receiving official 2024 CII rating):
- **If C or better**: Continue current operations with vigilance
- **If D (third consecutive)**:
  - Within 30 days: Submit revised SEEMP Part III with corrective action plan to classification society
  - Engage naval architects and energy efficiency consultants to model ESD retrofit options
  - Negotiate with charterers for speed flexibility clauses in new fixtures
  - Budget for ESD retrofits during next scheduled drydock (coordinate with T3 Coast Guard vessel safety drydock schedule)

**July 2025 - December 2025**:
- Implement operational efficiency measures (low-cost, immediate impact)
- If drydock scheduled, install ESDs (propeller upgrade, hull coating, energy-saving fins)
- Monitor monthly CII performance via onboard data collection systems

**January - March 2026**:
- Submit 2025 fuel consumption data to flag state
- Await Q2 2026 rating to confirm corrective action plan success

**Contingency Planning**:
- If corrective action plan fails (D rating in 2026), evaluate scrapping vs. continued operation
- Model financial impact: Write-down exposure vs. ongoing operational losses vs. charter market rejection risk
- Coordinate with T8 (ship mortgage lenders) to assess covenant breach risk and negotiate waivers if needed

#### 7. Port State Control (PSC) Scrutiny and CII Ratings

**CII Rating as PSC Targeting Factor**:

While CII ratings are not currently formal Port State Control (PSC) targeting criteria under Paris MOU, Tokyo MOU, or U.S. Coast Guard regimes, there is emerging evidence that PSC officers consider CII ratings during risk assessment:

- **Netherlands PSC**: Reported emphasis on MARPOL Convention compliance, with air pollution regulations (MARPOL Annex VI, which includes CII) as common detention causes (source: 2024 PSC annual reports)
- **Enhanced Survey Risk**: Vessels with D or E ratings may face more thorough MARPOL Annex VI inspections, including verification of:
  - SEEMP Part III documentation
  - Fuel oil quality records (IMO 2020 sulfur cap compliance)
  - IMO Data Collection System (DCS) reporting accuracy
  - Energy Efficiency Certificate and Statement of Compliance

**PMSC Fleet PSC Context**:
- User-provided data: PMSC fleet PSC detention rate is 2.5% (below 5% industry average, indicating good compliance history)
- **Risk**: If D-rated vessels detained for MARPOL Annex VI deficiencies, detention costs $200K-$400K/day in lost charter revenue plus repair/correction costs

**Detention Statistics (2024)**:
- Paris MOU, Tokyo MOU, and USCG: 1,936 vessels detained total (4.03% detention rate, up from 3.81% in 2023)
- MARPOL-related deficiencies: Among top detention causes, particularly fire safety (majority) and air pollution regulations (growing)
- ISM (International Safety Management) deficiencies: Over 12% of detained ships (2022-2024) had major ISM issues, including missing internal audits and untrained crew

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Ensure D-rated vessels have verified SEEMP Part III with corrective action plan readily available for PSC inspection
- Train crew on CII documentation requirements and IMO DCS reporting procedures
- Schedule pre-PSC internal audits to identify and correct MARPOL Annex VI deficiencies before external inspection
