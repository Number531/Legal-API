## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed

This research memorandum addresses the following critical antitrust and vessel-sharing agreement issues for Project Neptune ($4.8B acquisition of PMSC):

1. **Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Filing Requirements**: Mandatory HSR filing analysis, threshold applicability, waiting periods, Second Request risk assessment.

2. **Trans-Pacific Strategic Alliance (TPSA) Vessel-Sharing Agreement**: PMSC's participation in TPSA, change of control impact, partner termination rights, antitrust immunity scope under 46 U.S.C. § 40303.

3. **Shipping Act Antitrust Immunity**: Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 amendments, scope and limitations of VSA antitrust immunity, FMC filing requirements.

4. **Market Definition and Concentration Analysis**: Relevant product/geographic markets, HHI calculations, 2023 Merger Guidelines application to ocean container shipping.

5. **Vertical Integration Concerns**: Foreclosure risks from PMSC integration with Global Logistics Partners' downstream logistics operations.

6. **Offshore Wind Vessel Market**: Jones Act-qualified wind installation vessel concentration (3 vessels in U.S. market), market power concerns in nascent offshore wind industry.

7. **FTC/DOJ Maritime Merger Enforcement Trends**: Private equity roll-up scrutiny, Biden administration ocean shipping consolidation policy, recent precedents.

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted

- Federal Trade Commission public documents (HSR thresholds, Merger Guidelines, enforcement actions)
- Federal Maritime Commission agreement library (vessel-sharing agreement filings)
- 46 U.S.C. Subtitle IV (Shipping Act of 1984 as amended)
- 15 U.S.C. § 18a (Hart-Scott-Rodino Act)
- 16 C.F.R. Part 801 (HSR Rules)
- 2023 DOJ/FTC Merger Guidelines (December 2023)
- Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022, Pub. L. 117-146
- Maritime industry concentration studies (HHI analysis)
- Legal literature on private equity antitrust enforcement (2024)

### C. Limitations and Caveats

1. **TPSA Agreement Terms**: Specific TPSA alliance agreement terms (change of control provisions, partner approval requirements, exit procedures) are not publicly available. Analysis based on typical FMC-filed vessel-sharing agreement provisions.

2. **Market Share Data**: Precise West Coast container shipping market shares for PMSC and competitors not available in public domain. HHI estimates based on industry studies and terminal capacity data.

3. **HSR Second Request Probability**: No published FTC/DOJ statistics specific to maritime merger Second Requests. Assessment based on general Second Request trends (1.6% of all HSR filings) and Biden administration ocean shipping policy statements.

4. **Offshore Wind Vessel Market**: Nascent market with limited transaction history. Market definition and concentration analysis based on Jones Act vessel eligibility constraints and current fleet inventory.

5. **Revenue Attribution**: PMSC's 35% revenue tied to TPSA slot exchanges is user-provided estimate. Actual revenue impact from alliance exit depends on contractual terms and alternative capacity procurement options.

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Transaction Structure

**Parties:**
- **Acquirer**: Global Logistics Partners LLC (PE-backed, Delaware/New York)
- **Target**: Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (PMSC) (Delaware corporation, Long Beach, CA headquarters)

**Transaction Value**: $4.8 billion (stock purchase, 100% equity acquisition)

**Target Operations**:
- **Shipping**: 22 owned vessels (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers) + 8 chartered vessels
- **Terminals**: 4 West Coast facilities (Los Angeles, Long Beach, Oakland, Seattle)
- **Revenue**: $3.2B annually (FY2024), $580M EBITDA (18.1% margin)
- **Trade Routes**: Trans-Pacific eastbound (65% revenue), westbound (15%), intra-Asia (10%), U.S. coastwise (10%)
- **Fleet Capacity**: 4 ULCVs (18,000-20,000 TEU), 8 New Panamax (10,000-13,000 TEU), 6 Post-Panamax (6,000-8,000 TEU)

### B. Trans-Pacific Strategic Alliance (TPSA)

**Alliance Structure**:
- **Members**: PMSC + 3 other ocean common carriers [HYPOTHETICAL: member identities not disclosed in user data]
- **Geographic Scope**: Asia-West Coast trade lanes (China/Korea/Japan → Los Angeles/Long Beach/Oakland/Seattle)
- **Operational Coordination**: Vessel slot exchanges, joint schedules, terminal facility sharing
- **FMC Filing**: Filed under 46 U.S.C. § 40303 for antitrust immunity [HYPOTHETICAL: FMC Agreement No. and filing date not provided]
- **Revenue Impact**: 35% of PMSC revenue ($1.12B annually) tied to TPSA slot exchanges

**Competitive Significance**: TPSA provides PMSC access to partner vessels on routes where PMSC lacks sufficient capacity, enabling PMSC to fulfill service contract commitments to major shippers without deploying additional owned/chartered vessels. Loss of TPSA membership would require PMSC to charter replacement capacity (estimated $180M-$250M annual incremental cost) or reduce service contract commitments.

### C. PMSC's Service Contract Portfolio

- **850 service contracts** with major shippers (importers/exporters)
- Contracts filed with FMC under 46 U.S.C. § 40501
- Typical terms: 1-3 years, minimum volume commitments (MQC), rate structures
- **Operational Dependency**: Approximately 40% of service contracts rely on TPSA slot exchange capacity to meet MQC obligations

**Change of Control Risk**: If TPSA partners terminate PMSC's membership post-acquisition, PMSC may face breach of service contract MQCs, triggering shipper claims and potential FMC detention/demurrage complaints (compounding existing 12 pending D&D complaints).

### D. Global Logistics Partners Downstream Operations

**Acquirer Profile**: Global Logistics Partners operates freight forwarding, warehousing, and third-party logistics (3PL) services. Key services include:
- **NVOCC (Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier)** services (consolidation/deconsolidation)
- **Drayage/trucking**: Port-to-warehouse container transport
- **Warehouse operations**: Distribution centers near West Coast ports

**Vertical Integration Concern**: Post-acquisition, PMSC (ocean carrier) and Global Logistics Partners (freight forwarder/NVOCC) would be under common ownership, raising potential foreclosure concerns:
1. **Customer Foreclosure**: PMSC prioritizing Global Logistics' NVOCC cargo over competing freight forwarders
2. **Information Advantage**: Global Logistics accessing competitor rate/volume data via PMSC
3. **Bundling**: Tying ocean shipping services to Global Logistics' drayage/warehousing services
