## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Transaction Context

Global Logistics Partners LLC (the "Acquirer") proposes to acquire Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (PMSC) (the "Target") for $4.8 billion in a stock purchase transaction. PMSC operates an integrated maritime services business comprising:

- **Shipping Operations**: 22 owned vessels (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers) plus 8 chartered vessels
- **Terminal Operations**: Four West Coast port terminals:
  - Los Angeles (Pier 300): 2.5M TEU capacity, $420M annual revenue
  - Long Beach (Pier J): 1.8M TEU capacity, $310M annual revenue
  - Oakland (Outer Harbor): 800K TEU capacity, $135M annual revenue
  - Seattle (Terminal 46): 500K TEU capacity, $82M annual revenue
- **Total Annual Revenue**: $3.2B (FY2024)
- **EBITDA**: $580M (18.1% margin)

### B. Environmental Regulatory Context

PMSC's terminal operations occur in California and Washington jurisdictions with stringent environmental regulations governing air quality, diesel emissions, and port operations. The Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach collectively form the San Pedro Bay Ports, the largest container port complex in North America, located in communities designated by California as environmental justice areas due to disproportionate air quality impacts.

**San Pedro-Wilmington Community Profile:**
- Designated AB 617 community (California Health & Safety Code § 40920.6)
- Disproportionate exposure to diesel particulate matter (PM2.5) from port-related truck, rail, and vessel traffic
- Cancer risk from diesel emissions identified as primary community health concern
- Community Steering Committee identified ports, refineries, and truck traffic as top three air quality concerns

**Applicable Clean Air Action Plan:**
The 2017 San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP) Update establishes voluntary emission reduction targets, including:
- Zero tailpipe emissions from all drayage trucks by 2035
- Shore power (cold ironing) for vessel hotelling at berth
- Cargo handling equipment (CHE) electrification (pending CARB regulation)

### C. Critical Environmental Issues Identified

**CRITICAL ISSUE #8 - Los Angeles Air Quality Lawsuit [HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO]:**

The user query references *Coalition for Clean Air v. Pacific Maritime Services Corp.*, C.D. Cal. Case No. 2:24-cv-07832, filed September 2024, alleging:
- Clean Air Act violations
- Diesel truck emissions from terminal operations
- California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) non-compliance
- Terminal operations contribute to Port of LA ozone non-attainment
- Relief sought: Injunctive relief (terminal operations restrictions) + civil penalties

**RESEARCH FINDING:** Extensive searches of PACER, Coalition for Clean Air litigation records, federal court databases, and news sources **returned no results** for this specific case or company name. Coalition for Clean Air has litigated extensively against the Port of Los Angeles and individual terminal operators regarding CEQA compliance, but no lawsuit against "Pacific Maritime Services Corp" or "PMSC" was identified in public records.

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** This case appears to be a **[HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO]** created for due diligence analysis purposes. The company name "Pacific Maritime Services Corporation" is not identified in public port operator databases for Los Angeles terminals.

**For Analytical Purposes:** This analysis proceeds under the assumption that this is a realistic hypothetical scenario based on actual Coalition for Clean Air litigation patterns against Port of LA terminal operators, using verified regulatory frameworks and penalty structures that would apply to such litigation if it existed.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Clean Air Act Enforcement Framework and Penalty Exposure

#### 1. Statutory Authority and Civil Penalty Structure

**42 U.S.C. § 7413 (Clean Air Act Section 113) - Federal Enforcement**

The Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to pursue civil penalties against violators through:
- **Administrative penalties** (§ 7413(d)): Up to $25,000 per day per violation (statutory base amount)
- **Judicial penalties** (§ 7413(b)): Up to $25,000 per day per violation in field-issued civil penalties

**Critical Note:** These statutory amounts are subject to **mandatory inflation adjustments** under the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (28 U.S.C. § 2461 note).

#### 2. 2024-2025 Inflation-Adjusted Penalty Rates

**EPA Inflation Adjustment - Effective January 8, 2025:**

Based on the Federal Register final rule published January 8, 2025 (*Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment*, 90 Fed. Reg. [page TBD] (Jan. 8, 2025)):
- **2025 adjustment multiplier:** 1.02598 (representing October 2023 to October 2024 CPI-U increase)
- **Penalties apply to:** Violations occurring on or after January 8, 2025
- **Previous adjustment (2024):** 1.03241 multiplier effective January 15, 2024

The current maximum penalty rates per day per violation under 42 U.S.C. § 7413 are codified in **40 C.F.R. § 19.4, Table 1** (Statutory Civil Monetary Penalties). Based on historical EPA penalty inflation patterns:

**Estimated 2024 Clean Air Act Penalties (based on 2023 baseline with 3.2% adjustment):**
- **Administrative penalties (§ 7413(d)(1)):** Approximately **$59,950 to $119,900 per day per violation** (depending on violation type and whether assessed through field citation or formal administrative complaint)
- **Judicial penalties (§ 7413(b)):** Approximately **$59,950 to $119,900 per day per violation**

**2025 Penalties (estimated with 2.6% adjustment):**
- **Projected range:** Approximately **$61,500 to $123,000 per day per violation**

**METHODOLOGY DISCLOSURE:** [METHODOLOGY: Inflation adjustment calculations based on EPA's published multipliers applied to 2023 baseline penalty amounts. Exact 2024-2025 penalty figures require consultation of 40 C.F.R. § 19.4 Table 1, Column 3, which was not accessible due to Federal Register redirect issues during research. Industry sources and EPA enforcement settlement patterns from 2023-2024 support this $60,000-$120,000 per day range for stationary source air quality violations.]

#### 3. Penalty Calculation Methodology - EPA Policy

EPA calculates actual penalties using the **Clean Air Act Stationary Source Civil Penalty Policy** (1991, as amended), considering:

**Gravity-Based Penalty Factors:**
1. **Economic benefit of noncompliance** (avoided compliance costs, delayed expenditures)
2. **Seriousness of violation:**
   - Extent of deviation from regulatory requirement
   - Health/environmental harm potential
   - Duration of violation
3. **Size of business** (ability to pay)
4. **Compliance history** (prior violations)
5. **Good faith efforts to comply**
6. **Other unique factors**

**Penalty Adjustment Factors:**
- **Litigation risk** (strength of EPA's case)
- **Pollutant-specific multipliers** (hazardous air pollutants receive higher penalties)
- **Ability to pay** (may reduce penalty for demonstrated financial hardship)

**Multi-Day Violations:**
Each day of continuing violation constitutes a separate violation for penalty calculation purposes. For ongoing operational violations (e.g., diesel truck emissions exceeding permitted levels), penalties accrue **daily** until compliance achieved.

**Example Calculation for Hypothetical LA Air Quality Lawsuit:**

*Assumption: Coalition for Clean Air alleges PMSC's LA terminal diesel truck operations violated Clean Air Act ozone nonattainment requirements for 365 days (one year prior to filing)*

- **Days of violation:** 365 days
- **Penalty rate (2024):** $60,000/day (conservative estimate)
- **Maximum statutory exposure:** 365 × $60,000 = **$21.9 million**

*Adjustment for settlement realities:*
- EPA/court penalties typically settle at 20-40% of maximum statutory exposure for first-time violations with good faith compliance efforts
- **Realistic settlement range:** $4.4M - $8.8M (20-40% of maximum)

**If allegations include multiple violation categories** (e.g., diesel truck emissions + CHE emissions + vessel hotelling), each constitutes separate violation stream with independent penalty calculation.
