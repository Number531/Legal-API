## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. CRITICAL FINDING: TWIC READER DEADLINE FACTUAL ERROR

**ISSUE #2 RESOLUTION: Seattle Terminal TWIC Reader Deadline Is NOT December 31, 2024**

#### 1. Actual Regulatory Status

The user-provided factual assertion that Seattle terminal faces a December 31, 2024 TWIC reader installation deadline with $25,000/day penalty exposure starting January 1, 2025 is **INCORRECT** based on current federal regulations.

**Congressional Delay - May 8, 2026 (or May 8, 2029):**

On December 23, 2022, Congress enacted the **James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023** (H.R. 7776), Section 11804(c), which statutorily delayed implementation of TWIC reader requirements for "covered facilities" until **at least May 8, 2026**. [VERIFIED: Pub. L. 117-263, § 11804(c), 136 Stat. 2395 (Dec. 23, 2022)]

**Coast Guard Conforming Amendments:**

- **April 17, 2023**: Coast Guard published conforming amendment changing implementation dates in 33 CFR 105.253(a)(2)-(4) from May 8, 2023, to **May 8, 2026**. 88 Fed. Reg. 23,602 (Apr. 17, 2023) [VERIFIED via FederalRegister.gov]

- **October 31, 2024**: Coast Guard published second delay final rule, further extending deadline to **May 8, 2029** for three categories of facilities handling Certain Dangerous Cargoes (CDC). 89 Fed. Reg. 86,723 (Oct. 31, 2024) (effective Dec. 2, 2024) [VERIFIED via FederalRegister.gov]

#### 2. Facility Classification Analysis

**Container Terminals vs. CDC Facilities:**

Container terminals (Seattle, Oakland, Los Angeles, Long Beach) are **NOT** classified as "covered facilities" under Section 11804(c) unless they handle **Certain Dangerous Cargoes (CDC)** in bulk:

**CDC Definition (33 CFR 160.203):**
- Division 1.1 or 1.2 explosives
- Division 1.5D blasting agents (in bulk requiring permits)
- Division 2.3 poisonous gases (>1 metric ton per vessel)
- Division 5.1 oxidizing materials (in bulk requiring permits)
- **All bulk liquefied gas cargo that is flammable and/or toxic** (including LNG, LPG)

**33 CFR § 105.253(a) Risk Group A Classification:**

Facilities in Risk Group A (requiring TWIC readers) include:

**(1)** Facilities receiving vessels certificated to carry **>1,000 passengers** (effective June 8, 2020 - already in effect)

**(2)-(4)** Beginning **May 8, 2029**:
- Facilities that handle CDC in bulk and transfer such cargoes from or to a vessel
- Facilities that handle CDC in bulk but do not transfer it from or to a vessel
- Facilities that receive vessels carrying CDC in bulk but do not transfer it during vessel-to-facility interface

**Container Terminal Classification:**

Standard container terminals handling dry cargo containers and non-bulk liquid containers are **NOT** classified as Risk Group A facilities for TWIC reader purposes unless they:
- Receive cruise ships/ferries with >1,000 passenger capacity (unlikely for cargo terminals), OR
- Handle CDC in bulk (liquefied gas terminals, not typical container operations)

#### 3. Penalty Exposure Analysis

**If Seattle Terminal Does NOT Handle CDC:**

- **No TWIC reader requirement** as of January 2026
- **No penalty exposure** for non-installation
- Visual TWIC inspection (current escort procedures) remains compliant under 33 CFR § 105.255(b)

**If Seattle Terminal DOES Handle CDC (requires factual verification):**

- TWIC reader deadline: **May 8, 2029** (not December 31, 2024)
- Extension request filed "October 2024" (per user data) would be **irrelevant** if statutory delay applies
- No penalty accrues until after May 8, 2029 compliance deadline

#### 4. Extension Request Status - Verification Required

User data states: "Extension request pending (filed November 15, 2024)" for Seattle terminal TWIC readers.

**Three Scenarios:**

**Scenario A - Terminal Is NOT Risk Group A (Most Likely):**
- Extension request **unnecessary** - no TWIC reader requirement exists for non-CDC container terminals
- Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound may have informed facility that extension is moot due to regulatory delay
- **Penalty Exposure: $0**

**Scenario B - Terminal Handles CDC, Covered by May 8, 2029 Delay:**
- Extension request **unnecessary** - compliance not required until May 8, 2029
- Facility has 3+ years to install TWIC readers
- **Penalty Exposure: $0** until May 8, 2029

**Scenario C - Terminal Receives >1,000 Passenger Vessels (Unlikely):**
- TWIC reader requirement effective June 8, 2020 (already 4+ years overdue)
- If non-compliant since June 2020, facility would have accumulated **$50M+** in penalties ($25,000/day × 1,600+ days)
- Extension request filed November 2024 would not retroactively cure 4-year violation
- This scenario is **implausible** - Coast Guard would have issued civil penalties long before acquisition due diligence

#### 5. Recommendations

**IMMEDIATE ACTION (Before Investment Committee Approval):**

1. **Verify Seattle Terminal Operations:**
   - Does Terminal 46 handle bulk liquefied gas (LNG/LPG) or other CDC?
   - Does Terminal 46 receive cruise ships or ferries with >1,000 passenger capacity?
   - Request copy of Coast Guard-approved Facility Security Plan (FSP) to confirm Risk Group classification

2. **Contact Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound:**
   - Confirm Seattle terminal's Risk Group A/B classification
   - If extension request was filed, obtain written response from COTP
   - Verify no outstanding MTSA civil penalties or Notices of Violation

3. **Review LA/Long Beach/Oakland Terminals:**
   - Confirm none of the four terminals handle CDC in bulk
   - Verify all terminals currently compliant with visual TWIC inspection requirements
   - Ensure FSPs reflect accurate Risk Group classifications

**ACQUISITION IMPACT:**

If Seattle terminal is **NOT** Risk Group A (standard container terminal):
- **Remove** from Critical Issues Checklist #2
- **No capital expenditure** required for TWIC readers at closing
- **No penalty exposure** - user's $2.25M-$4.525M estimate is inapplicable
- Condition precedent "Seattle TWIC readers installed OR extension obtained" should be **deleted** from acquisition agreement

**LEGAL AUTHORITY:**

- 33 U.S.C. § 70103 (MTSA facility security requirements)
- 33 CFR § 105.253 (Risk Group classifications for facilities) [VERIFIED: eCFR.gov, current through Jan. 9, 2026]
- 88 Fed. Reg. 23,602 (Apr. 17, 2023) (TWIC-Facility Reader Requirement; Conforming Amendment) [VERIFIED]
- 89 Fed. Reg. 86,723 (Oct. 31, 2024) (TWIC-Reader Requirements; Second Delay of Effective Date) [VERIFIED]
- Pub. L. 117-263, § 11804, 136 Stat. 2395 (Dec. 23, 2022) (FY2023 NDAA)

### B. Facility Security Plan (FSP) Requirements - Change of Ownership

#### 1. FSP Amendment for Ownership Transfer

**Regulatory Requirement (33 CFR § 105.415):**

When there is a **change in the owner or operator**, the Facility Security Officer (FSO) must:

1. **Amend the FSP** to include the name and contact information of the new facility owner or operator
2. **Submit the affected portion of the FSP** for review and approval to the cognizant Captain of the Port (COTP) in accordance with § 105.410

[VERIFIED: 33 CFR § 105.415(a), eCFR.gov]

**Submission Timeline:**

- If initiated by the facility owner/operator, proposed amendment must be submitted **at least 30 days before the amendment is to take effect**, unless the cognizant COTP allows a shorter period
- COTP will approve or disapprove the proposed amendment in accordance with § 105.410 (general FSP approval procedures)

[VERIFIED: 33 CFR § 105.415(c), eCFR.gov]

**FSP Validity Period:**

- An FSP approved by the cognizant COTP is **valid for five years** from the date of its approval
- Security plans must be reviewed by the Coast Guard every time there is a change in ownership or operational control

[VERIFIED: 33 CFR § 105.400(b), eCFR.gov]

#### 2. Application to Project Neptune

**Four PMSC Terminals Affected:**

| Terminal | Location | Current FSP Status | Amendment Required |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Terminal 46 | Seattle, WA (Sector Puget Sound) | Approved FSP on file (assumed) | Yes - ownership change to Global Logistics Partners |
| Outer Harbor Terminal | Oakland, CA (Sector San Francisco) | Approved FSP on file (assumed) | Yes - ownership change |
| Pier 300 | Los Angeles, CA (Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach) | Approved FSP on file (assumed) | Yes - ownership change |
| Pier J | Long Beach, CA (Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach) | Approved FSP on file (assumed) | Yes - ownership change |

**Timeline for Q1 2026 Closing:**

1. **Pre-Closing (30-60 days before closing):**
   - PMSC FSO (or designated successor) must submit FSP amendments to all four cognizant COTPs
   - Amendment scope: Update owner/operator name (Pacific Maritime Services Corporation → Global Logistics Partners LLC), contact information, FSO designation (if changing)

2. **COTP Review Period:**
   - Regulations do not specify mandatory COTP review timeline for ownership amendments
   - Industry practice: 15-45 days for administrative amendments (name/contact changes only)
   - More complex amendments (security measures, infrastructure changes): 60-90 days

3. **Acquisition Agreement Coordination:**
   - Condition precedent: "FSP amendments approved by all four COTPs" (or waivable if approval pending but no COTP objection)
   - Alternatively: Close with PMSC FSO remaining temporarily, transfer FSO designation post-closing after COTP approvals

**Risk Assessment:**

- **LOW RISK**: Ownership change amendments are administrative in nature
- COTP approval typically routine unless facility changes security measures/infrastructure concurrently
- No indication that PMSC facilities have outstanding MTSA violations that would delay COTP approval
- **RECOMMENDED**: Submit FSP amendments 60 days pre-closing to ensure approval by Q1 2026 closing date

#### 3. Facility Security Officer (FSO) Designation

**33 CFR § 105.205 Requirements:**

Facility owners or operators must **designate, in writing, by name or by title**, a Facility Security Officer (FSO) and identify how the officer can be contacted at any time.

**FSO Qualifications (33 CFR § 105.205(b)):**

The FSO must have general knowledge, through training or equivalent job experience, in:
- Vessel and facility security measures
- MARSEC Levels and implementation
- Emergency preparedness, contingency planning, and response
- Security equipment and systems
- Methods of conducting audits, inspections, control, and monitoring techniques
- Relevant international laws and codes (ISPS Code for vessel/facility interface)
- Recognizing behavioral patterns of persons who may threaten security
- Handling sensitive security information (SSI under 49 CFR Part 1520)

**Certification Status:**

Under current regulations, FSOs are **NOT required** to undergo formal training and certification. However, Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010, Section 821, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish comprehensive FSO training requirements designed to provide full security training leading to certification. [PENDING IMPLEMENTATION - no final rule issued as of January 2026]

**Multiple Facility Service:**

The **same person may serve as FSO for more than one facility**, provided:
- Facilities are in the same COTP zone, AND
- Facilities are not more than 50 miles apart

[VERIFIED: 33 CFR § 105.205(a)(2)]

**Application to Project Neptune:**

| Terminal Pair | Distance | Same COTP Zone? | Single FSO Permissible? |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| LA Pier 300 + Long Beach Pier J | ~5 miles | Yes (Sector LA-Long Beach) | **YES** |
| Seattle Terminal 46 + Oakland Outer Harbor | ~700 miles | No (different Sectors) | **NO** |

**Recommendation:**
- Designate **two FSOs minimum**: (1) FSO for LA/Long Beach terminals, (2) FSO for Seattle, (3) FSO for Oakland
- Alternatively: Three separate FSOs if acquiring FSOs prefer terminal-specific accountability
- Verify current PMSC FSO designations and determine retention vs. replacement post-closing
