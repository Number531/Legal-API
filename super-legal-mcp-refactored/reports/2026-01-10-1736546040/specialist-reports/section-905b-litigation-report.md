## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. SECTION 905(b) LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT

#### 1. Statutory Foundation - 33 U.S.C. § 905(b)

Section 905(b) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) creates a critical exception to the exclusive remedy provision of workers' compensation. Under this provision, an injured longshoreman may bring a third-party tort action against a vessel owner for vessel negligence, even though the longshoreman's employer (typically the stevedore) remains protected by LHWCA's exclusive remedy provision.

**33 U.S.C. § 905(b) provides:**

> "In the event of injury to a person covered under this chapter caused by the negligence of a vessel, then such person, or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages by reason thereof, may bring an action against such vessel as a third party in accordance with the provisions of section 933 of this title, and the employer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages directly or indirectly and any agreements or warranties to the contrary shall be void."

#### 2. The Scindia Three Duties Framework (1981)

The landmark Supreme Court decision in *Scindia Steam Navigation Co. v. De Los Santos*, 451 U.S. 156 (1981), established the controlling framework for vessel owner liability to longshoremen under Section 905(b).

**Case Background:**
Longshoreman De Los Santos was injured while loading cargo on the M/S Jalaratna when he was struck by cargo. The Supreme Court held that vessel-owner liability under Section 905(b) sounds only in negligence (not strict liability or warranty theories) and articulated three "narrow duties" owed by the vessel owner.

**The Three Scindia Duties:**

**(1) Turnover Duty:**
The vessel must exercise ordinary care to turn over the ship and its equipment in a condition such that an expert and experienced stevedore can carry on cargo operations with reasonable safety. This includes:
- **Safe condition requirement:** The vessel, its equipment, gear, tools, and work spaces must be in reasonably safe condition when stevedoring operations commence.
- **Duty to warn:** The vessel must warn the stevedore of hidden dangers that are known to the vessel or should have been known in the exercise of reasonable care.

**(2) Active Control Duty:**
When the vessel actively involves itself in the cargo operations and retains control of certain areas or equipment, it must exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries in those areas under active control.

**(3) Duty to Intervene:**
The vessel has a duty to intervene when it has actual knowledge of a dangerous condition developing during cargo operations AND knows that the stevedore is not adequately addressing the hazard. However, the vessel has no duty to systematically inspect for hidden dangers during stevedoring operations.

**Critical Limitation Established by Scindia:**
The Court emphasized that it would be "inconsistent with the Act to hold that the shipowner has a continuing duty to take reasonable steps to discover and correct dangerous conditions that develop during the loading or unloading process." This reflects Congress's 1972 amendments to shift more responsibility for compensating injured longshoremen to the stevedore-employer—the party best able to prevent injuries.

#### 3. Howlett v. Birkdale Shipping Co. (1994) - Refining the Turnover Duty

The Supreme Court further refined the turnover duty in *Howlett v. Birkdale Shipping Co.*, 512 U.S. 92 (1994), holding that the vessel's duty to warn extends only to hazards that are actually known to the vessel or should be known in the exercise of reasonable care.

**Case Background:**
Longshoreman Albert Howlett slipped on a clear plastic sheet on the tween deck while unloading cocoa beans from the MV Presidente Ibanez. The plastic sheeting had been improperly placed by a stevedore in Ecuador using materials supplied by the vessel. Plastic was an improper choice because it aggravates rather than prevents condensation damage.

**Key Holdings:**

1. **No Systematic Inspection Duty:** The vessel has no duty to systematically inspect cargo holds for hidden dangers during stevedoring operations.

2. **Actual or Constructive Knowledge Required:** The vessel's duty to warn requires either:
   - Actual knowledge of the hazard, OR
   - Constructive knowledge (the vessel should have known in the exercise of reasonable care)

3. **Open and Obvious Doctrine:** When a hazard is open and obvious to a competent stevedore, the vessel has no duty to warn, even if the vessel has actual knowledge of the condition.

4. **Congressional Intent Reaffirmed:** The 1972 amendments to the LHWCA were designed to "shift more of the responsibility for compensating injured longshoremen to the party best able to prevent injuries: the stevedore-employer."

**Procedural History:**
The District Court (E.D. Pa.) granted summary judgment for Birkdale. The Third Circuit affirmed without opinion. The Supreme Court affirmed 7-2.

### B. CIRCUIT COURT VESSEL NEGLIGENCE PRECEDENT

#### 1. Fifth Circuit: Kirksey v. Tonghai Maritime, 535 F.3d 388 (5th Cir. 2008)

**Case Background:**
Longshoreman Patrick Kirksey was injured on December 14, 2004, while working for stevedore P&O Ports Texas, Inc. to unload the M/V TONGHAI at City Dock #26, Port of Houston. A poorly stowed steel coil tipped over and injured Kirksey.

**District Court Findings:**
The court concluded that "the vibrations caused by the operation of the vessel's crane jarred the already poorly stowed coil loose, causing it to tip over onto Kirksey." The dangerous condition was created either by negligence of the loading stevedore or by shifting of cargo in heavy seas during the voyage, or both, resulting in an unstable stow.

**Key Legal Holdings:**

1. **Turnover Duty Violation:** The vessel breached its turnover duty by failing to ensure cargo was properly stowed before stevedoring operations commenced. The unstable stow constituted a dangerous condition that the vessel should have discovered and corrected (or warned about) before longshoremen began unloading.

2. **Cargo Stowage Responsibility:** When cargo stowage creates a dangerous condition that exists at the time stevedoring operations begin, the vessel bears responsibility under the turnover duty, regardless of whether the stowage was done by the vessel's crew or by a prior stevedore at another port.

3. **Vessel Crane Operations and Active Control:** The Fifth Circuit noted that the vessel's operation of its own crane during unloading operations potentially implicated the "active control" duty in addition to the turnover duty.

**Relevance to PMSC Martinez Case:**
This case is highly relevant because the Martinez complaint alleges improper cargo stowage (container lashing gear failure) combined with vessel crane operations—both elements present in *Kirksey*. The Fifth Circuit's holding that the vessel is responsible for dangerous stowage conditions existing at turnover time supports potential liability even if PMSC's crew did not personally stow the cargo.

**Citation:** *Kirksey v. Tonghai Mar. PTE, Ltd.*, 535 F.3d 388 (5th Cir. 2008) [VERIFIED: Fifth Circuit opinion via CourtListener, accessed January 10, 2026]

#### 2. Ninth Circuit: Ludwig v. Pan Ocean Shipping Co., 941 F.2d 849 (9th Cir. 1991)

**Case Background:**
Longshoreman Glenn Ludwig was injured aboard the M/V Ocean Royal when he stepped down from a ladder onto snatch blocks nestled in a coiled lashing cable located at the bottom of the ladder. The district court entered judgment for Ludwig after a bench trial.

**Key Facts on Lashing Equipment:**
Once containers were aboard the vessel, the vessel crew proceeded to attach lashing chains to secure the cargo for its sea voyage. The securing of containers was a job that would normally be performed by stevedores/longshoremen. The placement of lashing equipment created a tripping hazard that injured Ludwig.

**Ninth Circuit Holdings:**

1. **Equipment Placement and Turnover Duty:** The improper placement of vessel lashing equipment in a walkway area constituted a violation of the turnover duty to provide a reasonably safe work area.

2. **Vessel Crew Responsibility:** When the vessel's own crew creates a dangerous condition with vessel equipment (such as lashing cables and hardware), the turnover duty is clearly implicated.

3. **Lashing Operations and Jurisdiction:** The court clarified that container lashing operations—whether performed by vessel crew or stevedores—are critical to cargo security and vessel seaworthiness, and the vessel cannot disclaim responsibility for lashing-related hazards.

**Relevance to PMSC Martinez Case:**
The Martinez complaint specifically alleges "improper cargo stowage, unsafe gear" and "lashing gear failure" as the cause of the container falling and crushing the longshoreman. *Ludwig* establishes Ninth Circuit precedent that vessel owners are liable for injuries caused by defective or improperly managed lashing equipment, which is directly analogous to PMSC's alleged lashing gear failure on the M/V Pacific Guardian (should be Pacific Horizon per research plan).
