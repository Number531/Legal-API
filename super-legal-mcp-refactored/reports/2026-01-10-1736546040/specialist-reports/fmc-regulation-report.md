## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Ocean Common Carrier Licensing Requirements

#### 1. Statutory Framework

**Definition of Ocean Common Carrier**

Under 46 U.S.C. § 40102(6), an "ocean common carrier" means a person that:
(i) holds itself out to the general public to provide transportation by water of passengers or cargo between the United States and a foreign country for compensation;
(ii) assumes responsibility for the transportation from the port or point of receipt to the port or point of destination; and
(iii) uses, for all or part of that transportation, a vessel operating on the high seas or the Great Lakes between a port in the United States and a port in a foreign country.¹

**Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (VOCCs) Distinguished from NVOCCs**

PMSC operates as a VOCC, which has different licensing requirements than Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (NVOCCs). VOCCs are not subject to the licensing and financial responsibility bonding requirements that apply to Ocean Transportation Intermediaries under 46 CFR Part 515.²

#### 2. Form FMC-1 Notification Requirements

**Initial Filing**

All new VOCCs must notify the Federal Maritime Commission **prior to commencement of operations** using Form FMC-1 (Common Carrier Tariff and MTO Schedule Registration Form).³ Form FMC-1 notifies the Commission of the location of the VOCC's electronically available tariff, as required by 46 CFR § 520.3.⁴

**Change of Control Notification Timeline**

**CRITICAL FINDING**: FMC regulations require that VOCCs keep the Commission informed of changes in their business information, such as address, telephone number, ports of call, and **vessel ownership/control**, with such updates being **reported to the Commission within 30 days** after the change occurs.⁵

For PMSC License No. 024587 [HYPOTHETICAL - verification not possible for fictional license number], Global Logistics Partners must file an updated Form FMC-1 within 30 days after the closing date (expected Q2 2026).

**Form FMC-1 Contents**

The Form FMC-1 registration requires:
- Legal name and business address of the carrier
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Location of electronically published tariff
- Ports of call and service routes
- Vessel ownership/control information

#### 3. Tariff Publication Requirements

**Statutory Obligation**

All VOCCs must publish a tariff under 46 CFR § 520.3. Tariffs must be:
- Open for public inspection
- Show all rates, charges, classifications, rules, and practices between all points or ports on their service routes⁶
- Maintained in an electronic format accessible to the public
- Updated to reflect current rates and terms

**Enforcement Implications**

Failure to maintain a current, published tariff violates 46 U.S.C. § 41104(a) and subjects the carrier to civil penalties under 46 U.S.C. § 41107. As of January 15, 2024, maximum penalties are:
- **$73,045** for knowing and willful violations
- **$14,608** for violations that are not knowing and willful⁷

#### 4. Financial Responsibility for VOCCs

**No Bonding Requirement for VOCCs**

Unlike NVOCCs (which must maintain $75,000 surety bonds) and Ocean Freight Forwarders (which must maintain $50,000 bonds), vessel-operating common carriers are **not subject to financial responsibility bonding requirements** under 46 CFR Part 515.⁸

The financial responsibility provisions in 46 CFR Part 515 apply only to Ocean Transportation Intermediaries (OTIs), not to vessel operators. PMSC's acquisition by Global Logistics Partners does not trigger any FMC bonding requirements.

#### 5. License Transfer vs. Business Change Notification

**Key Distinction**

FMC regulations distinguish between:
- **License transfers** (applicable to OTI licenses under 46 CFR § 515.20, requiring Form FMC-18 and $125 filing fee)
- **Business information updates** (applicable to VOCCs under 46 CFR § 520.3, requiring updated Form FMC-1)

PMSC's change of ownership constitutes a business information update rather than a license transfer. The FMC does not issue "licenses" to VOCCs in the same manner as it licenses NVOCCs and Ocean Freight Forwarders. Instead, VOCCs operate under the general regulatory framework of the Shipping Act of 1984, as amended.⁹

#### 6. Compliance Timeline for Q2 2026 Closing

**30-Day Window**

Assuming closing occurs in April-June 2026:
- Closing date: Day 0
- Form FMC-1 update deadline: Day 30
- Updated tariff (if carrier legal name changes): concurrent with Form FMC-1

**Recommended Action**

Prepare Form FMC-1 update in advance of closing. File within 5 business days of closing to ensure compliance buffer and avoid any enforcement scrutiny during the 30-day window.
