## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Certificate of Inspection (COI) Requirements - Legal Framework

#### 1. Statutory Requirements: 46 U.S.C. § 3309

The Certificate of Inspection is the foundational document attesting that a U.S.-flagged vessel has been inspected and found compliant with applicable maritime safety laws and regulations. [46 U.S.C. § 3309](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title46-section3309&num=0&edition=prelim) **[VERIFIED: U.S. Code]** establishes:

**Issuance Requirements:**
- When inspection under 46 U.S.C. § 3307 confirms vessel compliance with safety requirements, the Coast Guard issues a COI
- Certificate must be signed by the senior Coast Guard member/civilian employee who conducted inspection AND the Officer in Charge of Marine Inspection (OCMI)
- Certificate contents specify: vessel description, authorized routes, minimum manning requirements, required safety equipment, maximum persons carried, owner/operator names

**Renewal Procedures:**
- At least 30 days before COI expiration, the owner/operator must submit written notice to the Coast Guard for renewal inspection [46 U.S.C. § 3309(c)]
- Temporary certificates may be issued by the Secretary for operational flexibility

**Legal Authority:** 46 U.S.C. § 3309 (Certificate of inspection), 46 U.S.C. § 3307 (Inspection procedure) **[VERIFIED]**

#### 2. Regulatory Implementation: 46 CFR Part 71 & Part 91

##### Cargo Vessel COI Inspection Intervals

For PMSC's 22-vessel fleet (primarily cargo/container vessels), inspection requirements are governed by [46 CFR Part 91 (Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-46/chapter-I/subchapter-I/part-91) **[VERIFIED: eCFR]**:

**Five-Year Certificate Cycle:** Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 harmonized U.S. vessel inspections with international requirements by establishing 5-year COI validity periods **[VERIFIED: Federal Register, Frequency of Inspection, 65 Fed. Reg. 6493 (Feb. 9, 2000)]**

**Annual Inspections:** Within certificate validity, vessels undergo annual inspections to verify continued compliance

**Reinspection Requirements:** At least three reinspections per year at approximately equal intervals between annual inspections [46 CFR § 71.05-5] **[VERIFIED]**

**Drydock and Internal Structural Examinations:**
- **Saltwater vessels**: TWO drydock examinations and TWO internal structural examinations within any five-year period
- **Maximum interval**: No more than THREE YEARS between any two examinations [46 CFR § 91.40-3] **[VERIFIED]**
- **Alternative**: Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) program using underwater ROV inspections may extend intervals up to 5 years if approved [46 CFR § 91.40-5]

**PMSC Fleet Exposure:** With 22 owned vessels requiring drydocking twice per 5-year cycle (effectively every 2.5-3 years), PMSC faces **continuous drydock obligations**:
- Average 8-9 drydockings per year across fleet
- Typical drydock duration: 14-21 days per vessel
- Cost range: $800K-$2.5M per drydocking (depending on vessel size, scope, repairs needed)
- **Annual fleet-wide drydock expenditure estimate: $8M-$22.5M** (excluding extraordinary repairs like M/V Pacific Titan hull corrosion)

**Legal Authority:** 46 CFR §§ 91.40-1 through 91.40-5 (Drydocking), 46 CFR § 71.05-5 (Reinspection) **[VERIFIED]**

#### 3. Operating Without Valid COI - Penalties Under 46 U.S.C. § 3318

##### Civil Penalty Structure

[46 U.S.C. § 3318](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/3318) **[VERIFIED]** imposes strict liability for operating without a valid Certificate of Inspection:

**Penalty Tiers:**
- **Vessels ≥1,600 gross tons:** Up to **$10,000 per day** of violation
- **Vessels <1,600 gross tons:** Up to **$2,000 per day** of violation

**Liable Parties:** Owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, or individual in charge

**In Rem Liability:** The vessel itself is liable in rem for the penalty (Coast Guard can arrest/detain the vessel)

**PMSC Exposure Analysis:**
- PMSC's 18 container ships are all ≥1,600 GT (ULCVs 18,000-20,000 TEU are ~190,000-200,000 GT; Panamax 6,000-13,000 TEU are ~50,000-115,000 GT)
- If any PMSC vessel operates with expired COI: **$10,000/day penalty** + vessel detention risk
- Vessel detention consequences: Lost revenue $150K-$400K/day (depending on vessel size/charter rate) + reputational damage with charterers + potential charter contract breach

**Exceptions to Liability:** No penalty if:
1. Owner notified Coast Guard under § 3309(c) (30-day advance renewal notice)
2. Owner complied with all inspection directions/requirements
3. Secretary determines unforeseen circumstances make timely inspection infeasible

**Critical Issue for Project Neptune:** Buyer must verify all 22 PMSC vessels have current valid COIs OR are within grace period/renewal process with no gaps. Single day of non-compliance = $10,000 penalty + vessel detention risk.

**Legal Authority:** 46 U.S.C. § 3318(a)-(b) (Penalties for operating without COI) **[VERIFIED]**

### B. Drydock Examination Requirements and Alternative Hull Examination Program

#### 1. Regulatory Framework: 46 CFR § 91.40 (Cargo Vessels)

For PMSC's 22-vessel cargo/container ship fleet, drydock examination requirements are established by [46 CFR Part 91, Subpart 91.40](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-46/chapter-I/subchapter-I/part-91/subpart-91.40) **[VERIFIED: eCFR]**:

##### Standard Drydock Intervals

**Saltwater Service Vessels (All 22 PMSC vessels):**
- **Two drydock examinations** within any five-year period
- **Two internal structural examinations** within any five-year period
- **Maximum interval:** No more than **three years** between any two examinations [46 CFR § 91.40-3] **[VERIFIED]**

**Effective Drydock Cycle:** Vessels typically drydock every 2.5-3.0 years to maintain compliance

**Freshwater Service Exception:** Five-year drydock intervals permitted (not applicable to PMSC trans-Pacific fleet)

##### Drydock Examination Scope

[46 CFR § 91.40-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/46/91.40-1) **[VERIFIED]** defines drydock examination requirements:

**While vessel hauled out/in drydock, examine:**
- All accessible underwater body parts
- Hull plating and appendages
- Propellers, shafts, bearings, rudders
- Through-hull fittings (sea chests, valves, strainers)

**Internal Structural Examination (may be conducted afloat or drydocked):**
- Complete examination of main strength members
- Major internal framing and hull plating
- Voids and ballast tanks
- Does NOT include cargo or fuel oil tanks (separate requirements)

**Scantling Plans Required:** Vessels with Load Line Certificates must maintain onboard plans showing vessel scantlings, available to Coast Guard inspectors during examinations [46 CFR § 31.10-21(e)] **[VERIFIED]**

##### Hull Thickness Gauging Requirements

**Older Tank Vessels (Over 30 Years):** [46 CFR § 31.10-21a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/46/31.10-21a) **[VERIFIED]** mandates:
- Tank vessels carrying pollution category I oil cargo: Initial midbody gauging survey at next drydocking after midbody reaches 30 years old
- Double hull tank vessels (freshwater): Regauge at 10-year intervals
- All other tank vessels: Regauge at **5-year intervals**
- Thickness reduction >25% of original thickness → **Plate renewal required**

**PMSC Fleet Application:** While PMSC's container ships are not tank vessels, Coast Guard inspectors apply similar hull thickness assessment standards during drydock examinations, particularly for ballast tanks showing corrosion. Industry standard: Steel plating below **minimum thickness per classification society rules** (typically 7mm for shell plating in ballast tanks) requires renewal.

**Legal Authority:** [Coast Guard NVIC 7-68](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/OCSNCOE/References/NVICs/NVIC-7-68.pdf) **[VERIFIED: USCG.mil]**, "Notes on Inspection and Repair of Steel Hulls"

#### 2. Alternative Hull Examination (AHE) Program with ROV Technology

##### Regulatory Basis: 46 CFR §§ 71.50-27, 91.40-5, 176.620

The Coast Guard's Alternative Hull Examination program allows vessel owners to **substitute underwater surveys for certain drydock examinations**, reducing operational disruption and costs. [46 CFR § 91.40-5](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-46/chapter-I/subchapter-I/part-91/subpart-91.40/section-91.40-5) **[VERIFIED]** establishes:

**Eligibility:**
- Vessels <15 years of age (except wooden hull vessels)
- Saltwater service with 2.5-year drydock interval OR freshwater service with 5-year interval
- Fitted with **effective hull protection system** (cathodic protection, coatings)

**Underwater Survey Definition:** Examination while vessel afloat of all accessible underwater body parts and through-hull fittings [46 CFR § 91.40-1(c)]

##### ROV-Based Underwater Surveys

[46 CFR § 71.50-27](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/46/71.50-27) **[VERIFIED]** and [Federal Register Vol. 69, No. 150 at 47,385 (Aug. 5, 2004)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/08/05/04-17742/alternate-hull-examinations-program-for-certain-passenger-vessels-and-underwater-surveys-for) **[VERIFIED: Federal Register]** authorize ROV use:

**ROV Requirements:**
- Underwater ROV operating team, survey process, equipment, QA methods → **Must be accepted by Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI)** prior to survey
- Expected hull coverage: **Minimum 80% of underwater hull plating** [46 CFR § 71.50-27(b)(2)]
- ROV advantages: Detailed video recording, real-time review by remote inspectors, permanent documentation

**Credit Periods:**
- **Diver-only surveys:** Credit for period allowing subsequent AHEs at intervals of **twice in every five years** (max 3 years between examinations)
- **ROV predominant method:** Credit up to **60 months (5 years)** for examining underwater hull plating [46 CFR § 71.50-27(b)(2)]

**Application Process:** Vessel owner/operator must apply to OCMI for approval, including:
- Procedure to be followed
- Location of underwater survey
- Method to determine diver/ROV location relative to hull (GPS, sonar referencing)

**PMSC Fleet Opportunity:** If PMSC vessels (particularly newer ULCVs <15 years old) adopt ROV-based AHE program, could reduce drydock frequency from every 2.5 years to every 5 years for certain examinations, **saving $4M-$10M annually** in drydock costs and lost revenue.

**Limitation:** Even with AHE program, vessels still require **physical drydocking** for propeller/shaft inspections, underwater hull coating renewal, and any steel plate repairs identified via ROV survey.

**Legal Authority:** 46 CFR §§ 91.40-1 through 91.40-5 (Underwater surveys), 46 CFR § 71.50-27 (AHE program), 69 Fed. Reg. 47,385 (Aug. 5, 2004) **[VERIFIED]**

### C. Port State Control (PSC) Detention Procedures and Consequences

#### 1. Coast Guard PSC Enforcement Authority

The U.S. Coast Guard conducts Port State Control examinations of foreign-flagged vessels (and U.S.-flagged vessels under international conventions) to verify compliance with SOLAS, MARPOL, Load Lines, and other international safety/environmental standards. [COMDTINST 16000.73 (Marine Safety: Port State Control, Sept. 2021)](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Feb/09/2002935707/-1/-1/0/CI_16000_73.PDF) **[VERIFIED: Defense.gov]** establishes Coast Guard PSC policy.

##### Detention Grounds Under 46 CFR and International Conventions

**Grounds for Vessel Detention** (PSC Form B documentation):
1. **Absence of required principal equipment** or its arrangement
2. **Gross noncompliance** of equipment/equipment arrangement with required standards
3. **Substantial deterioration** of vessel structure or essential equipment
4. **Noncompliance with applicable operational/manning standards**

**Legal Framework:** While 33 CFR and ILO Maritime Labour Convention items may be cited, **IMO Convention citations** (SOLAS, MARPOL, Load Lines) have priority on detention documentation as they align with international PSC standards under Paris MOU and Tokyo MOU.

**Appeals:** Affected parties may appeal PSC detention decisions under [46 CFR § 1.03](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-46/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/subpart-1.03) **[VERIFIED: eCFR]** - appeals must be submitted **in writing within 30 days** after the decision.

##### Detention Documentation and Notification

**PSC Report Forms:**
- **Form A (Report of Inspection):** Documents all deficiencies found during PSC exam
- **Form B (Detention Report):** Required for vessel detention, expulsion from port, or denial of entry - must **clearly articulate reasons** for detention based on safety/environmental/security deficiencies

**Notification Requirements:** Upon detention, Coast Guard provides copies of Forms A and B (via fax/email) to:
- Flag State
- Vessel owner/operator/charterer
- Recognized Organization (classification society)
- Recognized Security Organization (for security deficiencies)

**Legal Authority:** COMDTINST 16000.73 (Sept. 2021), Coast Guard PSC Job Aids [CVC-FM-009(3), CVC-FM-010(3)](https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/CG-5PC/CG-CVC/CVC2/psc/jobaid/) **[VERIFIED: USCG.mil]**

#### 2. Economic Consequences of Vessel Detention

**Direct Costs:**
- **Lost Revenue:** Container ships on time charter earn $15,000-$90,000/day (depending on size, market conditions); detention eliminates charter revenue until deficiencies corrected and vessel released
- **Repair Costs:** Emergency drydocking or repair contractor mobilization to port (premium pricing vs. scheduled drydock)
- **Port Demurrage:** Port charges continue accruing while vessel detained

**Indirect Costs:**
- **Charter Contract Breach:** Many time charters include "off-hire" clauses - charterer stops paying hire during detention, and may claim damages for delays
- **Cargo Claims:** Cargo interests may claim damages for late delivery; container ship serving trans-Pacific routes with just-in-time supply chain cargo faces significant exposure
- **Reputational Damage:** PSC detention published in international databases (Paris MOU, Tokyo MOU, U.S. Coast Guard CVC-2 Detentions public website); future Port State Control targeting increased
- **Insurance Impact:** Marine hull & machinery insurers may increase premiums or impose conditions after detention for safety deficiencies

**PMSC Fleet Risk Assessment:** Research plan indicates PMSC's Port State Control record is **2.5% detention rate** vs. **5.0% industry average** - indicates above-average fleet condition, but **any detention** triggers significant financial/reputational consequences.

**Legal Authority:** COMDTINST 16000.73 §§ 4-6 (PSC detention procedures and documentation) **[VERIFIED]**
