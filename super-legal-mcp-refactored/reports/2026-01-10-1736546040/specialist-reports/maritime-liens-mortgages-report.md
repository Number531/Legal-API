## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Preferred Ship Mortgages Under 46 U.S.C. § 31322

#### 1. Statutory Framework for Preferred Ship Mortgages

A **preferred ship mortgage** is a specialized security interest recognized under federal maritime law that provides lenders with enhanced protections compared to ordinary security interests. Under [46 U.S.C. § 31322](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/31322), a mortgage becomes a "preferred mortgage" when specific statutory requirements are met:

**Requirements for Preferred Status:**

1. The mortgage must be filed with the Coast Guard National Vessel Documentation Center (NVDC)
2. The vessel must be documented under U.S. law or covered by an application for documentation
3. The mortgage must cover the entire vessel (not partial interests)
4. The mortgage must be executed in proper form and acknowledged

**Date of Preferred Status:** A mortgage attains preferred status from the time the documentation application and mortgage instrument are filed with the NVDC, not from the date documentation is finally issued. This allows lenders to secure their priority position early in the transaction process.¹

**State-Titled Vessels:** For vessels titled under state law (rather than federally documented), a state mortgage is deemed to be a preferred mortgage if: (1) the Secretary of Transportation certifies that the state titling system complies with federal guidelines, and (2) the state makes vessel information available to the federal vessel identification system. No additional federal recording is required for such mortgages to obtain preferred status.²

#### 2. PMSC Fleet Mortgage Debt Structure

According to the transaction materials, PMSC's 22-vessel fleet is encumbered by **$2.8 billion** in preferred ship mortgage debt distributed across multiple lenders:

| Lender | Outstanding Principal | Number of Vessels | Average per Vessel |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Bank of America | $1.2 billion | ~8 vessels | $150 million |
| Wells Fargo | $900 million | ~6 vessels | $150 million |
| U.S. Bank | $700 million | ~5 vessels | $140 million |
| [Fourth Lender - TBD] | [Balance to $2.8B] | ~3 vessels | [Variable] |

**Note on Lender Discrepancy:** The research plan references Citibank ($720M), HSBC ($680M), and DVB Bank ($550M) as lenders, while the task description references Bank of America ($1.2B), Wells Fargo ($900M), and U.S. Bank ($700M). This discrepancy requires verification from the actual credit agreements and NVDC mortgage records. For purposes of this analysis, I use the task description figures as they were provided most recently and specifically for this assignment.

[VERIFICATION REQUIRED: Obtain NVDC Abstract of Title for all 22 vessels to confirm exact lender identity, mortgage amounts, and recording dates]

#### 3. Current Interest Rate Environment and Refinancing Risk

**Existing Mortgage Terms:**
- Current weighted average interest rate: **4.5%** (per transaction description)
- Annual debt service on $2.8B at 4.5%: **$126 million** (interest only)

**Current Market Rates (2026):**
- Ship mortgage market rate (investment grade): **7.2%** (per transaction description)
- Annual debt service on $2.8B at 7.2%: **$201.6 million** (interest only)

**Refinancing Cost Exposure:**
- **Annual cost differential: $75.6 million** ($201.6M - $126M)
- **10-year present value (5% discount rate): ~$584 million**

This represents a material economic risk if any lender withholds consent to the change of control and PMSC must refinance at market rates.

[FINDING 1: Refinancing Risk] If lenders withhold consent to change of control, buyer must refinance $2.8B at current market rates (~7.2%), resulting in **$75.6M annual increased debt service cost**, with 10-year NPV impact of approximately **$584M**.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Based on market interest rate data and mathematical calculation of differential

### B. Maritime Lien Priority Hierarchy Under 46 U.S.C. § 31301

#### 1. Statutory Definition of Maritime Liens

[46 U.S.C. § 31301](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/31301) defines a **"preferred maritime lien"** as a maritime lien on a vessel that arises *before* a preferred mortgage was filed, for:

(A) **Maritime tort damages** (collision, personal injury, environmental damage)
(B) **Wages of stevedores** when employed directly by vessel owner or operator
(C) **Crew wages** (officers and unlicensed mariners)
(D) **General average** contributions
(E) **Salvage**, including contract salvage³

**Critical Distinction:** These "preferred maritime liens" have **priority over preferred ship mortgages**, even though the mortgages are recorded earlier. This reverses the traditional "first in time, first in right" principle applicable to most security interests.

#### 2. The Traditional Maritime Lien Priority Hierarchy

Although there is no comprehensive statutory scheme ranking all maritime liens, federal courts have developed a well-established hierarchy through case law:

**Rank 1: Expenses of Justice**
Costs incurred during *custodia legis* (when vessel is in custody of the court) have absolute priority, including court costs, marshal fees, and vessel maintenance expenses during arrest.

**Rank 2: Preferred Maritime Liens** (per 46 U.S.C. § 31301(5))
- **Crew wages and maintenance/cure** (highest priority among preferred liens)
- **Salvage and general average**
- **Maritime torts** (collision, personal injury, cargo damage, environmental damage)
- **Stevedore wages** (when directly employed by owner/operator)

**Rank 3: Maritime Contract Liens (Pre-Mortgage)**
All maritime liens arising from contract *before* the preferred mortgage was recorded, including:
- **Necessaries** (fuel, repairs, supplies, towage, drydock, provisions)
- **Cargo damage claims** (contract-based)
- **Charter hire disputes**

**Rank 4: Preferred Ship Mortgages**
Properly recorded preferred mortgages under 46 U.S.C. § 31322

**Rank 5: Maritime Contract Liens (Post-Mortgage)**
Maritime liens arising from contracts *after* the preferred mortgage was recorded⁴

**Rank 6: General Unsecured Claims**

#### 3. Landmark Cases Establishing Maritime Lien Priority

**a. *The J.E. Rumbell*, 148 U.S. 1 (1893)**

This Supreme Court case established foundational principles for maritime lien priority:

- **Foreign Port Necessaries:** For repairs or supplies furnished to a vessel in a foreign port, a maritime lien exists under general maritime law (derived from civil law) and may be enforced in admiralty.

- **Home Port Necessaries:** For repairs or supplies in the vessel's home port, no lien exists under general maritime law; a lien may exist only under state statute.

- **Priority Over Mortgages:** Maritime liens for necessary supplies and repairs take precedence over prior recorded mortgages, *unless* the maritime lien is for seamen's wages or salvage (which have even higher priority).

- **Nature of Maritime Liens:** A maritime lien is a *jus in re* (right in the thing itself) without requiring actual possession, accompanies the property into the hands of bona fide purchasers, and can be executed only through an *in rem* proceeding.⁵

**b. *The John G. Stevens*, 170 U.S. 113 (1898)**

This case established that **tort-based maritime liens have priority over earlier contract-based maritime liens**:

- **Facts:** A tug collided with another vessel due to negligence on March 8, 1886. Between December 1885 and March 1886, a supplier had furnished coal to the tug and filed statutory lien notices under New York law.

- **Holding:** The maritime lien for collision damages (arising March 8, 1886) has **priority over the earlier supply lien** (December 1885 - March 1886), even though the supply lien arose first chronologically and was filed first.

- **Rationale:** The foundation of the collision lien rule is the maritime law principle that "the ship, by whomsoever owned or navigated, is considered as herself the wrongdoer, liable for the tort, and subject to a maritime lien for the damages." Tort liens have a unique status because they arise involuntarily from wrongful conduct, not from consensual transactions.⁶

**c. *Rainbow Line, Inc. v. M/V Tequila*, 480 F.2d 1024 (2d Cir. 1973)**

This Second Circuit case addressed maritime liens for charter party breaches and necessaries:

- **Facts:** The vessel *TEQUILA* was arrested in New York for multiple claims totaling $392,312.40, including $60,000 for salvage/towage services and charter party breach claims. The vessel was sold by U.S. Marshal for $162,000.

- **Holdings:**
  (1) Under U.S. admiralty law, a breach of charter party gives rise to a maritime lien when damages are of a maritime nature and flow directly from the breach.
  (2) "The rights of third persons cannot be affected by the intent of the parties to the contract" - a principle subsequently applied to maritime liens for necessaries.⁷

#### 4. Implications for PMSC Transaction

The maritime lien priority hierarchy creates **significant risk** for the preferred mortgage lenders in the PMSC transaction:

**Crew Wage Risk:**
PMSC employs 2,400 mariners (800 officers, 1,600 unlicensed). If PMSC experiences cash flow difficulties post-closing and fails to pay crew wages, those unpaid wages create **preferred maritime liens** that rank **above the $2.8B in preferred mortgages**.

**Calculation:** At average maritime wages of $80,000/year per crew member, 2,400 mariners × $80,000 = **$192 million annual payroll**. If payroll goes unpaid for 90 days during a liquidity crisis, **$48 million in crew wage liens** would have priority over all mortgages.

**Maritime Tort Risk:**
The pending *Martinez v. PMSC* Section 905(b) litigation ($8.5M claimed, analyzed in separate specialist report T9) could result in a tort judgment creating a maritime lien with **priority over the preferred mortgages**. Any judgment in excess of insurance coverage would rank ahead of the mortgage holders' claims.

**Necessaries Risk:**
PMSC operates 22 vessels requiring continuous supplies of:
- **Fuel/bunkers:** ~$480M annually (per IMO specialist report T6)
- **Repairs and drydocking:** $25M-$40M annually (per Coast Guard specialist report T3)
- **Port services, provisions, supplies:** ~$50M+ annually (estimated)

If PMSC defaults on payment to suppliers during financial distress, suppliers can assert maritime liens for necessaries. While these liens rank *below* preferred mortgages (if they arise after mortgage recording), they rank *above* mortgages if they arose before mortgage filing.

[FINDING 2: Maritime Lien Priority Risk] Preferred maritime liens for crew wages, salvage, and maritime torts have **statutory priority over the $2.8B preferred mortgages**. During financial distress, unpaid crew wages ($192M annual payroll, ~$48M per quarter) and tort judgments (Martinez case $2M-$5M expected verdict) would rank ahead of mortgage holders.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Based on statutory framework 46 U.S.C. § 31301 and Supreme Court precedent

### C. Vessel Arrest Procedures Under 46 U.S.C. § 31342

#### 1. Statutory Basis for Vessel Arrest

[46 U.S.C. § 31342](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/46/31342) provides the statutory mechanism for enforcing maritime liens:

**"Establishing Maritime Liens"**

(a) A person providing **necessaries** to a vessel on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner—
(1) has a maritime lien on the vessel;
(2) may bring a **civil action *in rem*** to enforce the lien; and
(3) is not required to allege or prove in the action that credit was given to the vessel.

**Key Elements:**
- **Necessaries** include repairs, supplies, towage, wharfage, and other goods/services essential to vessel operation
- The lien arises automatically upon provision of necessaries
- The lien can be enforced through an *in rem* action (lawsuit against the vessel itself)
- No proof required that credit was extended to the vessel (as opposed to the owner personally)

**Authority to Procure:** Under [46 U.S.C. § 31341](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title46/subtitle3/chapter313/subchapter3&edition=prelim), the following persons are presumed to have authority to procure necessaries:
- The owner
- The master (captain)
- A person entrusted with the management of the vessel at the port of supply

However, any person "tortiously or unlawfully in possession" has **no authority** to procure necessaries that create maritime liens.⁸

#### 2. Vessel Arrest Procedures

To enforce a maritime lien, a claimant files a complaint in federal district court under the court's admiralty jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1333) and follows **Supplemental Rule C** of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Admiralty and Maritime Claims).

**Step 1: Verified Complaint**
The claimant files a verified complaint (under oath) alleging:
- Admiralty/maritime jurisdiction
- The nature of the maritime claim (necessaries, tort, crew wages, etc.)
- The amount owed
- That the claim gives rise to a maritime lien
- That the vessel is located within the jurisdiction or will be within the jurisdiction

**Step 2: Motion for Process of Arrest**
Simultaneously with the complaint, claimant files a motion seeking a warrant for arrest of the vessel.

**Step 3: Warrant of Arrest Issued**
If the court finds probable cause, it issues a warrant directing the U.S. Marshal to arrest the vessel.

**Step 4: Marshal Arrests Vessel**
The U.S. Marshal physically arrests the vessel by posting notice on the vessel and taking custody. The vessel cannot depart until the lien is satisfied or bond is posted.

**Step 5: Publication Notice**
The Marshal publishes notice of the arrest in newspapers and/or electronically to notify other potential claimants.

**Step 6: Intervention by Other Claimants**
Other maritime lien holders may intervene in the proceeding to assert their claims.

**Step 7: Sale or Release on Bond**
The vessel owner may:
- Post a bond to release the vessel from arrest (typically 110%-150% of claim value)
- Allow the vessel to be sold by the Marshal, with proceeds distributed according to maritime lien priority

**Timing:** Vessel arrest can occur **within 24-48 hours** of filing the complaint if the court finds exigent circumstances. This creates substantial operational disruption.

**Cost of Arrest:** When a vessel is arrested:
- **Lost revenue:** Container ships generate $200K-$400K per day in charter hire; ULCVs up to $80,000+ per day
- **Marshal fees:** Daily custody fees while vessel under arrest
- **Crew wages continue:** Crew must continue to be paid during arrest
- **Demurrage claims:** Shippers may claim damages for delayed cargo delivery⁹

[FINDING 3: Vessel Arrest Risk] Under 46 U.S.C. § 31342, suppliers, crew members, and tort claimants can arrest PMSC vessels within 24-48 hours through federal admiralty proceedings. Each arrested vessel loses $200K-$400K per day in revenue. With 22 vessels, cascade arrest risk during financial distress could be catastrophic.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Based on statutory provisions and Supplemental Rule C procedures

### D. Change of Control Consent Provisions in Ship Mortgage Credit Agreements

#### 1. Typical Change of Control Covenants

While the specific credit agreements for PMSC's $2.8B mortgage debt have not been provided for review [DOCUMENT REQUEST: all four credit agreements], industry-standard ship mortgage loan agreements contain **change of control provisions** as a protective covenant for lenders. Based on market practice research, these provisions typically include:

**a. Definition of "Change of Control"**

Change of control is typically triggered by one or more of the following events:

1. **Acquisition of Control:** Any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of more than 50% (sometimes 35% or 40%) of the voting equity interests in the borrower

2. **Change in Board Control:** A majority of the board of directors ceases to be composed of individuals who were directors as of the closing date or whose appointment was approved by a majority of existing directors

3. **Sale of Substantially All Assets:** Sale, lease, transfer, or disposition of all or substantially all assets (typically defined as >50% or >75% of asset value)

4. **Change in Ownership of Vessel-Owning Subsidiaries:** For multi-vessel financing structures, any change in ownership of the special purpose entities (SPEs) that own individual vessels

**b. Prohibition on Change of Control Without Consent**

Standard covenant language:

> "Borrower shall not permit a Change of Control to occur without the prior written consent of Required Lenders [typically defined as lenders holding >50% or >66.7% of aggregate commitments]."

**c. Consequences of Unauthorized Change of Control**

If a change of control occurs without lender consent:

1. **Event of Default:** The change of control constitutes an immediate Event of Default under the credit agreement

2. **Acceleration Rights:** Upon Event of Default, lenders may:
   - Declare all outstanding loans immediately due and payable
   - Terminate all commitments to extend further credit
   - Foreclose on the mortgaged vessels
   - Exercise all rights and remedies under the mortgages and security agreements

3. **Default Interest Rate:** Interest rate typically increases by 2% (e.g., from 4.5% to 6.5%) upon Event of Default

**d. Lender Consent Process**

When borrower requests consent to a change of control transaction:

**Timeline:**
- Borrower submits written request with details of proposed transaction (buyer identity, financing plan, pro forma financials)
- Lender agent circulates request to all lenders in syndicate
- Lenders have 15-30 business days to respond (varies by agreement)
- Required Lender threshold votes to approve or deny (typically >50% or >66.7% of commitments)

**Conditions for Consent:**
Lenders typically condition consent on:
- Creditworthiness of new borrower/guarantor
- No reduction in collateral value or quality
- Compliance with all financial covenants after transaction
- Payment of consent fees (typically 0.25% - 0.50% of outstanding principal)
- Legal opinions confirming continued enforceability of loan documents
- Reaffirmation or renewal of guarantees
- Updated vessel appraisals confirming LTV covenant compliance

#### 2. Probability of Lender Consent in PMSC Transaction

**Factors Favoring Consent:**

1. **Borrower Remains Same:** If the transaction is structured as a stock purchase of PMSC (with PMSC continuing as borrower), lenders retain same obligor and same collateral

2. **Stronger Guarantor:** If acquirer Global Logistics Partners LLC provides parent guarantee or upstream guarantee, lenders obtain additional credit support

3. **Covenant Compliance:** PMSC currently in compliance with all financial covenants (assumed, subject to verification)

4. **Consent Fees:** Lenders receive consent fees of 0.25%-0.50% × $2.8B = **$7M - $14M** in additional consideration

**Factors Against Consent:**

1. **Private Equity Ownership:** PE-backed acquirers are viewed as higher risk due to leverage, shorter hold periods, and potential asset stripping

2. **Additional Leverage:** Transaction contemplates **$3.2B in new debt** at PMSC level (per research plan), substantially increasing leverage

3. **Current High Interest Rate Environment:** Lenders financed mortgages at 4.5% (likely originated 2020-2022 when rates were lower); current market rates 7.2%; lenders may prefer to force refinancing to capture higher market rates

4. **Operational Risks:** Multiple critical issues flagged in due diligence (Jones Act violations, ILWU strike risk, CII D-rated vessels, Martinez litigation) may concern lenders

5. **Covenant Breach Risk Post-Transaction:** Increased leverage and operational risks may increase probability of future covenant breaches

**Consent Probability Assessment:**

Based on these factors, I assess the probability of obtaining unanimous or Required Lender consent as:

| Scenario | Probability | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **All lenders consent** | 40-50% | Lenders benefit from fees and stronger guarantee, but concerned about PE ownership and additional leverage |
| **Required Lenders consent (>50%)** | 60-70% | Majority of syndicate likely consents for economic reasons; dissenters may be refinanced out |
| **Lenders withhold consent / demand refinancing** | 30-40% | Some lenders (particularly those with <5 years until maturity) may prefer refinancing at 7.2% market rates to capture rate increase |

[METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) industry practice for PE-backed maritime M&A transactions; (2) current interest rate differential favoring lenders who force refinancing; (3) operational risk factors in target company]

**If Lenders Withhold Consent:**

The buyer faces three options:

1. **Refinance Non-Consenting Lenders:** Secure replacement financing at market rates (~7.2%) for non-consenting lenders' portion of the debt. If 30% of lenders withhold consent, refinance $840M at 7.2% vs. 4.5% = additional **$22.7M annual cost**.

2. **Refinance Entire Facility:** Replace all $2.8B at 7.2% market rate = additional **$75.6M annual cost** (as calculated in Section IV.A.3 above).

3. **Abandon Transaction:** If refinancing costs make transaction uneconomic, buyer may terminate acquisition pursuant to financing condition in purchase agreement.

[FINDING 4: Lender Consent Risk] Probability of obtaining change of control consent from all lenders: **40-50%**. Probability of Required Lender consent: **60-70%**. If 30-40% of lenders withhold consent, buyer must refinance $840M-$1.12B at market rates, adding **$22.7M-$30.2M in annual debt service costs**.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - Based on industry practice and market conditions; actual probability depends on specific lender identities, maturity dates, and negotiation dynamics
