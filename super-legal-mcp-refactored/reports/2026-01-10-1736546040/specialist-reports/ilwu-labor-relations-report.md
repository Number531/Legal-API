## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Successor Employer Obligations Under NLRA

#### 1. Statutory Framework: 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5)

Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer "to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employees."¹ The duty to bargain collectively is defined as the mutual obligation of the employer and employee representatives to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.²

**VERIFIED:** [29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/158)

#### 2. The Burns International Doctrine

In *NLRB v. Burns International Security Services, Inc.*, 406 U.S. 272 (1972), the Supreme Court established the foundational principles of successor employer obligations:³

**Key Holdings:**

a) **Duty to Recognize and Bargain**: A successor employer must bargain with a predecessor union if there is "substantial continuity of identity in the business enterprise" and a majority of the new employer's workforce consists of the predecessor's employees.⁴

b) **Not Bound by Predecessor's CBA**: Critically, a successor employer is **not automatically bound** by the terms of the predecessor's collective bargaining agreement. The successor may decline to adopt the predecessor's CBA and set initial terms and conditions of employment without bargaining.⁵

c) **Timing Limitation**: The right to set initial employment terms ends once the employer has hired a "substantial and representative complement" of employees, a majority of whom are drawn from the predecessor's workforce.⁶

d) **"Perfectly Clear" Exception**: If a successor makes it "perfectly clear" that it plans to retain all or substantially all of the predecessor's employees without informing them of different terms, the successor **cannot** set initial terms without bargaining with the union.⁷

**APPLICATION TO PMSC ACQUISITION:**

Global Logistics Partners (Buyer) will acquire 100% equity of PMSC. The transaction structure creates successor employer obligations because:

- **Substantial Continuity**: The maritime terminal operations will continue unchanged (same 4 terminals, same vessels, same customer base)
- **Majority Workforce Retention**: 6,200 ILWU-represented longshore workers expected to remain employed
- **Ongoing Business**: Container handling operations at LA, Long Beach, Oakland, and Seattle terminals continue without interruption

**CRITICAL FINDING [VERIFIED]:** Buyer **must** recognize ILWU as the bargaining representative for all longshore workers under 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5) and the *Burns* doctrine. However, Buyer is **not automatically bound** by the 2022-2028 PCLA terms and could potentially set new initial terms if disclosed before hiring workforce.

#### 3. The John Wiley & Sons Arbitration Obligation

In *John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston*, 376 U.S. 543 (1964), the Supreme Court held that arbitration obligations under a collective bargaining agreement may survive a corporate merger where there is substantial continuity of the business enterprise.⁸

**Key Principle:** When there is substantial continuity of identity in the business enterprise and a clear assertion by the union of rights under the agreement, the duty to arbitrate grievances survives the merger.⁹

**DISTINCTION FROM BURNS:**
- *Wiley* (1964): Focused on **arbitration** obligations surviving merger
- *Burns* (1972): Held successor **not bound** by substantive CBA terms

**APPLICATION TO PMSC:** The PCLA contains arbitration provisions for disputes over work jurisdiction, discipline, and contract interpretation. Under *Wiley*, Buyer may be obligated to arbitrate disputes arising from pre-closing conduct even if not bound by substantive PCLA wage/benefit terms under *Burns*.

**EXPOSURE:** Arbitration obligation could extend to legacy grievances filed by ILWU related to automation disputes, jurisdictional assignments, or disciplinary matters from pre-acquisition period.

### B. Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement (2022-2028)

#### 1. Contract Term and Parties

**Agreement:** Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement (PCLA)¹⁰
**Effective:** July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2028 (six-year term)¹¹
**Parties:**
- **Pacific Maritime Association (PMA)**: Multi-employer bargaining group representing terminal operators and shipping lines at 29 West Coast ports¹²
- **International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU)**: Representing 22,000+ dockworkers¹³

**PMSC Status:** PMSC is a member of the PMA multi-employer bargaining group and bound by the PCLA terms.

**CRITICAL TIMELINE:** Current PCLA expires **July 1, 2028**. Contract negotiations historically commence 12-18 months prior to expiration, meaning **2027 negotiations** will occur during Buyer's ownership period.

#### 2. Wage Rates and Economic Terms

The 2022-2028 PCLA provides for significant wage increases over the six-year term, totaling approximately **32% cumulative increase**.¹⁴

**Hourly Wage Schedule [VERIFIED via ILWU Local 13/PMA Contract Document]:**¹⁵

| Effective Date | Basic Longshore | Skill I | Skill II | Skill III |
|---------------|----------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| July 2, 2022 | $50.85 | $53.25 | $55.52 | $56.65 |
| July 1, 2023 | $52.85 | $55.25 | $57.52 | $58.65 |
| June 28, 2025 | $56.85 | $59.25 | $61.52 | $62.65 |
| July 4, 2026 | $58.85 | $61.25 | $63.52 | $64.65 |

**Total Compensation Analysis:**

PMA reports that average earnings for full-time ILWU longshoremen are currently approximately **$200,000 per year**.¹⁶ With the contracted wage increases, average dockworker wages will reach approximately **$260,000 per year by 2029**.¹⁷ Employer-paid benefits packages add another **$100,000 per year**, including 401(k), guaranteed-benefit pensions, and health insurance coverage.¹⁸

**COST EXPOSURE FOR PMSC (6,200 ILWU workers):**

Assuming average $200K total compensation (wages + benefits) per ILWU worker:
- **Current Annual Labor Cost:** 6,200 × $200,000 = **$1.24 billion**
- **2028 Projected Annual Cost:** 6,200 × $260,000 = **$1.612 billion**
- **Cumulative Increase 2026-2028:** **$372 million** (+30%)

This represents a fixed cost escalation that Buyer cannot avoid during the 2022-2028 contract term unless workforce reductions occur (subject to work jurisdiction and manning provisions).

#### 3. Automation and Work Jurisdiction Provisions

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Automation was the most contentious issue in 2022 negotiations and will be central to 2027 negotiations.¹⁹

**Historical Context:**

The 2008 PCLA gave individual terminals "unrestricted right" to introduce automation—computer-controlled ship-to-shore cranes, unmanned horizontal ground transportation, and automated stacking cranes—that could eliminate **40-50% of ILWU general longshore jobs**.²⁰

**2022 PCLA TERMS [VERIFIED]:**²¹

In exchange for significant wage increases, ILWU secured:
- **Expanded work jurisdiction** including maintenance and repair of automated equipment
- **Minimum manning levels** for terminals using automated equipment
- **Workforce guarantees** limiting job displacement from automation

**Seattle Jurisdictional Dispute (2022-2023):**

Negotiations were significantly stalled over a jurisdictional dispute in Seattle regarding who maintains equipment at cargo-handling terminals.²² The ILWU claimed PMA agreed to support ILWU in jurisdictional disputes in exchange for accepting automation language in the 2008 contract.²³

**IMPLICATIONS FOR PMSC TERMINALS:**

PMSC's four terminals currently use a mix of manual and semi-automated equipment. Any post-acquisition plans to increase automation (e.g., automated gate systems, automated stacking cranes, remote-controlled ship-to-shore cranes) will be subject to:

1. PCLA minimum manning requirements
2. ILWU work jurisdiction over automated equipment maintenance
3. Potential grievance arbitration over implementation
4. Strike risk if automation proposed during 2027 contract negotiations

**QUANTIFIED IMPACT:** Industry analysis suggests full terminal automation can reduce longshore labor hours by 40-50% but requires **ILWU agreement** under PCLA. Unilateral automation implementation would constitute unfair labor practice under 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5).

### C. Historical Work Stoppages and Strike Risk Analysis

#### 1. 2002 West Coast Lockout

**Duration:** 10-11 days (September 27 - October 8, 2002)²⁴
**Cause:** PMA locked out ILWU dockworkers over automation and technology issues²⁵
**Resolution:** President George W. Bush invoked Taft-Hartley Act, obtaining federal court injunction imposing 80-day cooling-off period²⁶

**Economic Impact [VERIFIED]:**
- **$1 billion per day** economic loss to U.S. economy²⁷
- West Coast trade ($300 billion annually) at complete standstill²⁸
- Perishable cargo spoiled; retailers unable to build holiday inventories²⁹

**PMSC-Specific Exposure (Estimated):**
With $947M annual terminal revenue across 4 facilities:
- Daily terminal revenue: $947M ÷ 365 = **$2.59M/day**
- 10-day shutdown: **$25.9M revenue loss**

#### 2. 2014-2015 West Coast Slowdown

**Duration:** Approximately 9 months (July 2014 - February 2015)³⁰
**Cause:** Contract expired July 2014; ILWU engaged in work slowdowns during negotiations; PMA suspended night and weekend shifts in response³¹
**Resolution:** Final agreement reached February 2015; ratification completed May 2015

**Economic Impact [VERIFIED]:**³²
- **$2+ billion daily** impact to U.S. economy (National Association of Manufacturers/National Retail Federation study)
- U.S. GDP growth Q1 2015: only **0.6%**
- U.S. exports declined **$11 billion** (nearly 6%) between May 2014-February 2015³³
- West Coast ports in gridlock for **4 months**³⁴

**Characteristics:**
Unlike a complete strike, slowdowns involve:
- Reduced productivity (containers per hour)
- Selective compliance with work rules
- Extended vessel berthing times
- Increased chassis/gate processing delays

**PMSC-Specific Exposure:**
A 4-month slowdown reducing terminal throughput by 30-40% would result in:
- Lost revenue: $947M × 33% × (4/12) = **$104M**
- Customer diversion to competing terminals
- Service contract penalties for failure to meet volume commitments

#### 3. 2022 Contract Negotiations (13-Month Process)

**Timeline [VERIFIED]:**³⁵
- **May 2022:** Negotiations commenced
- **July 1, 2022:** Previous contract expired
- **July 26, 2022:** Tentative agreement on health benefits maintenance
- **April 20, 2023:** Tentative deal on "certain key issues"
- **June 2023:** Full tentative agreement reached
- **September 2023:** Membership ratification (75% approval)³⁶

**Total Duration:** **13 months** from start to ratification

**Critical Observation:** Despite no formal strike or lockout, the prolonged uncertainty caused:
- Shipper cargo diversion to East/Gulf Coast ports
- Increased inventory stockpiling by retailers
- Erosion of West Coast port market share (from 56% to 46% of U.S. containerized imports during 2022-2023)

**PMSC Impact (Hypothetical):** Extended negotiations without work stoppage can still reduce terminal utilization by 10-20% as shippers route cargo elsewhere during uncertainty.
