## VII. LOCAL CONTROL, ZONING, AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS

State cannabis legalization creates a dual regulatory framework: state agencies grant licenses authorizing cannabis operations under state law, while local governments (cities and counties) retain sovereign authority to ban, restrict, or impose conditions on cannabis businesses within their jurisdictions through zoning ordinances and conditional use permits. This section analyzes the Target's reliance on 76 conditional use permits (CUPs) and local approvals across 72 facilities in eight states, the legal framework enabling local control despite state legalization, change-of-control risks requiring public hearings and local re-approvals, four pending California variance applications creating closing timeline uncertainty, and zoning litigation risk from neighbor challenges and environmental review requirements under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

The fundamental tension in cannabis local control jurisprudence is that state legalization does not preempt municipal home rule authority. State legislatures authorize cannabis activity statewide but explicitly preserve local governments' police powers to regulate land use, impose operating conditions, and ban cannabis entirely within municipal boundaries. For multi-state operators like the Target, this creates **72 separate local approval dependencies**, each subject to revocation, modification, or non-renewal based on community opposition, political shifts, or technical non-compliance with permit conditions.

### A. State Enabling Statutes: Local Control Provisions

#### 1. California: Dual State-Local Licensing Requirement

California Business and Professions Code § 26200 establishes the most explicit dual licensing framework in the nation:¹

> **Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26200(a)(1):** "A city, county, or city and county may completely prohibit the establishment or operation of one or more types of cannabis businesses within its jurisdiction."

> **Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26200(a)(2):** "If a city, county, or city and county allows a particular type of cannabis business within its jurisdiction, the jurisdiction may impose additional standards, requirements, and conditions so long as the standards, requirements, and conditions do not conflict with state law or violate the prohibition contained in Section 26201."

**Operative Legal Principle:** California requires **both** a state license from the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) **and** local authorization from the city or county where operations are located. A state license alone is insufficient to operate; the licensee must obtain local approval, which may take the form of:
- A local cannabis business license or permit
- A conditional use permit (CUP) issued under zoning ordinances
- A development agreement with the municipality
- Compliance with a local regulatory ordinance (if the jurisdiction issues no separate permits)²

**Practical Consequence:** If a city bans cannabis cultivation, the Target cannot operate a cultivation facility in that jurisdiction even with a valid state DCC license. The state license authorizes activity *if* local law permits it; state licenses do not preempt local bans.³

**PCG California Operations:**
- **33 state licenses:** 18 retail, 8 cultivation, 5 manufacturing, 2 distribution
- **33 local approvals required:** Each license requires corresponding local authorization
- **22 conditional use permits:** CUPs issued by city/county planning departments for retail dispensaries
- **8 local cannabis business licenses:** Issued by cities with comprehensive cannabis ordinances (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento)
- **3 development agreements:** Negotiated agreements with municipalities (cultivation facilities in unincorporated counties)⁴

**Change-of-Control Implications:** The proposed acquisition constitutes a "change of ownership" under most California local ordinances. While DCC approval is federally mandated under state law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26051.5), local approval of ownership changes is **discretionary** and subject to:
- Public hearing requirements (noticed hearings with community input)
- Planning Commission or City Council approval
- Potential reopening of operating conditions (hours, security, odor control)
- Community opposition campaigns (particularly for retail dispensaries near schools or residential areas)⁵

[XREF:LOCAL → STATE LICENSING: Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26200 requires local approval as prerequisite to state license effectiveness; state approval insufficient without local authorization]

#### 2. Colorado: Local Autonomy Under Home Rule

Colorado Revised Statutes § 44-10-103(3) explicitly reserves local control authority:⁶

> **C.R.S. § 44-10-103(3):** "A local jurisdiction may prohibit the operation of marijuana establishments... through the enactment of an ordinance or through an initiated or referred measure. A local jurisdiction may not prohibit persons from lawfully transporting marijuana through its jurisdiction."

**Home Rule Cities:** Colorado's constitutional home rule doctrine (Colo. Const. art. XX) grants cities with populations exceeding 2,000 residents the authority to self-govern on local matters, including land use and business licensing. Home rule cities (Denver, Boulder, Colorado Springs, Aurora) may enact cannabis regulations more restrictive than state law, including:
- Complete bans on retail marijuana establishments (even if medical marijuana is permitted)
- Distance restrictions (minimum separation from schools, residential zones, other dispensaries)
- Numerical caps on licenses (e.g., Denver's cap on retail marijuana stores)
- Operating hour restrictions (Colorado Springs limits retail sales to 8 AM - 7 PM)⁷

**PCG Colorado Operations:**
- **14 state licenses:** 8 retail, 3 cultivation, 3 manufacturing
- **14 local licenses/permits:** Each facility operates under local municipal license
- **8 conditional use permits:** CUPs for retail dispensaries in Denver, Boulder, Colorado Springs
- **3 special use permits:** Cultivation facilities in unincorporated counties (Boulder County, Jefferson County)⁸

**Local Approval Uncertainty:** Colorado municipalities may impose transfer approval requirements as conditions of local licenses. Review of Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs ordinances reveals:
- **Denver:** Ownership transfer requires Marijuana Licensing Division approval; public hearing not required if no operating condition changes requested⁹
- **Boulder:** Transfer applications require City Council approval after public hearing if >50% ownership change¹⁰
- **Colorado Springs:** Transfer applications reviewed by City Clerk; approval "may be" denied if new owner has criminal history or prior license violations¹¹

**Timeline Risk:** Local approval processes in Colorado range from 30 days (ministerial transfers) to 4-6 months (discretionary approvals with hearings). The Target's 14 Colorado licenses face **sequential approval risk**: Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED) approval (state level) is unlikely until local approvals are secured, creating a 6-10 month aggregate timeline for Colorado operations alone.¹²

[XREF:LOCAL → STATE LICENSING: Colorado local approval prerequisite to state MED license effectiveness; home rule cities may impose additional restrictions beyond state requirements]

#### 3. Multi-State Local Control Survey

**Nevada (NRS Chapter 453D):** Local governments may ban cannabis establishments or limit the number of licenses. Clark County (Las Vegas) and Washoe County (Reno) permit cannabis but impose CUP requirements and distance restrictions.¹³

**Oregon (ORS Chapter 475C):** Local jurisdictions may ban cannabis businesses through ordinance or ballot measure. As of 2024, 235 of Oregon's 242 cities ban recreational dispensaries, forcing the Target to operate primarily in Portland metro and unincorporated counties.¹⁴

**Washington (RCW 69.50.331):** Local jurisdictions may adopt zoning ordinances but cannot "adopt an ordinance prohibiting retail marijuana businesses" (limited preemption). However, jurisdictions may impose CUPs, distance restrictions, and operating conditions effectively excluding cannabis through restrictive zoning.¹⁵

**Arizona (A.R.S. § 36-2857):** Counties and municipalities may "regulate the time, place, and manner of marijuana establishment operations" but cannot prohibit establishments if voters approved Proposition 207 (2020) in that jurisdiction. Maricopa County (Phoenix metro) permits cannabis with CUPs; rural counties may ban entirely.¹⁶

**Massachusetts (M.G.L. c. 94G § 3(a)(2)):** Local approval required before state Cannabis Control Commission will accept license application. Municipalities may impose local bylaws, host community agreements (HCAs), and may ban cannabis through local ballot measure. Boston and Cambridge require HCAs negotiating community impact fees (typically 3% of gross revenue).¹⁷

**Illinois (410 ILCS 705/7-15):** Home rule units may regulate but not ban cannabis. Non-home rule units may prohibit cannabis establishments through referendum. Chicago requires zoning compliance and aldermanic approval (political risk).¹⁸

**Aggregate Observation:** All eight states where the Target operates explicitly preserve local control authority. The state license is a **necessary but insufficient** condition for operations; local zoning and permit approvals are independently required and independently revocable.

### B. Conditional Use Permits: Scope and Operating Conditions

#### 1. CUP Legal Framework

A **conditional use permit** (also termed "special use permit" or "discretionary use permit") authorizes a land use that is not permitted as-of-right in a zoning district but may be allowed subject to conditions mitigating potential adverse impacts on surrounding properties. CUPs are issued under local zoning ordinances pursuant to state land use enabling statutes.¹⁹

**Legal Standard for Issuance:** Most jurisdictions require applicants to demonstrate:
1. The proposed use is compatible with surrounding land uses
2. The use will not adversely affect public health, safety, or welfare
3. Adequate infrastructure (parking, traffic circulation, utilities) exists
4. The use complies with general plan and zoning ordinance objectives
5. Conditions can be imposed to mitigate adverse impacts²⁰

**Discretionary Nature:** CUPs are discretionary approvals, not ministerial permits. Planning commissions and city councils may deny CUP applications even if all technical criteria are satisfied, based on:
- Community opposition testimony at public hearings
- Compatibility concerns with neighborhood character
- Cumulative impact (too many cannabis businesses in one area)
- Policy concerns (elected officials' views on cannabis desirability)²¹

**PCG's CUP Portfolio:**

The Target holds **76 conditional use permits** across 72 facilities (four facilities hold multiple CUPs for different activity types):

| State | CUPs Held | Facility Types | Issuing Jurisdictions |
|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| California | 28 | 18 retail, 7 cultivation, 3 manufacturing | Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, Oakland, Fresno, San Francisco, unincorporated counties |
| Colorado | 12 | 8 retail, 3 cultivation, 1 manufacturing | Denver, Boulder, Colorado Springs, unincorporated Boulder County |
| Nevada | 6 | 4 retail, 2 cultivation | Las Vegas (Clark County), Reno (Washoe County) |
| Oregon | 8 | 5 retail, 3 cultivation | Portland, Eugene, unincorporated Multnomah County |
| Washington | 9 | 6 retail, 2 cultivation, 1 manufacturing | Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, unincorporated King County |
| Arizona | 7 | 5 retail, 2 cultivation | Phoenix, Tucson, Scottsdale, Mesa |
| Massachusetts | 4 | 3 retail, 1 cultivation | Boston, Cambridge, Worcester |
| Illinois | 2 | 2 retail | Chicago |
| **TOTAL** | **76** | **52 retail, 17 cultivation, 7 manufacturing** | **38 jurisdictions** |²²

**Critical Dependency:** The Target's operations are legally contingent on maintaining these 76 CUPs in good standing. Revocation or non-renewal of any single CUP renders the affected facility non-operational, triggering:
- Immediate cessation of operations (zoning violation)
- State license suspension (state regulators require local authorization)
- Lease termination (landlords may terminate for loss of operating permits)
- Revenue loss (retail CUPs represent $6.3M average annual revenue per location)²³

#### 2. Standard CUP Conditions for Cannabis Operations

**Distance Restrictions (Buffer Zones):**

All 76 CUPs impose minimum separation distances from sensitive uses. Typical requirements:²⁴

| Sensitive Use Category | California Minimum | Colorado Minimum | National Range |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| K-12 schools (public/private) | 600 feet | 1,000 feet | 500-1,000 feet |
| Day care centers | 600 feet | 1,000 feet | 500-1,000 feet |
| Youth centers, parks | 600 feet | 1,000 feet | 600-1,000 feet |
| Other cannabis retailers | 600 feet | 1,000 feet | 500-1,500 feet |
| Residential zones (some jurisdictions) | 100-300 feet | Not typically required | Varies widely |
| Places of worship (some jurisdictions) | Not typically required | 100 feet | 100-500 feet (rare) |

**Measurement Method:** Distances measured "as the crow flies" (straight-line) from property line to property line, not door-to-door or walking distance.²⁵ This creates ongoing compliance risk: if a new school opens within the buffer zone after the CUP is granted, the dispensary may be deemed non-conforming and face closure unless grandfathered.

**Operating Hours:**

| Jurisdiction Type | Typical Permitted Hours | Rationale |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Urban retail (California, Colorado)** | 6 AM - 10 PM daily | Aligns with retail norms; limits late-night activity |
| **Suburban retail** | 8 AM - 9 PM daily | Reduces evening traffic/parking impacts |
| **Cultivation/manufacturing (all states)** | 24/7 operations permitted | Industrial use; employee shifts require flexibility |

The Target's 52 retail CUPs impose operating hour restrictions ranging from 8 AM - 8 PM (Colorado Springs, most restrictive) to 6 AM - 10 PM (Los Angeles, Oakland).²⁶ Violations of operating hours constitute CUP violations and may trigger:
- Warning letters and corrective action requirements
- Fines ($500-$5,000 per violation)
- CUP revocation proceedings (repeat violations)
- State license discipline (regulators coordinate with local enforcement)²⁷

**Security Requirements:**

CUPs uniformly require physical security measures exceeding standard commercial requirements:²⁸
- **Video surveillance:** 24/7 recording, 90-day retention, covering all entrances, exits, sales areas, and limited-access areas
- **Alarm systems:** Intrusion detection with direct notification to local police
- **Access control:** Keycard or biometric entry systems for limited-access areas (cultivation, manufacturing, inventory storage)
- **On-site security personnel:** Required for high-volume retail locations (>$5M annual revenue) in Los Angeles, Denver, Las Vegas
- **Cash management protocols:** Armored car transport for cash deposits (dispensaries operate cash-only due to federal banking restrictions)

**Cost Implications:** Security compliance costs the Target $1.8M annually across 72 facilities (average $25K per location), including:
- Security equipment maintenance: $850K
- Security guard services: $620K (8 retail locations require on-site guards)
- Video storage and monitoring: $180K
- Armored car transport: $150K²⁹

**Odor Control Requirements:**

Cultivation and manufacturing CUPs impose **strict odor mitigation conditions** due to cannabis's distinctive and pervasive smell. Typical requirements:³⁰

**HVAC Filtration Systems:**
- Activated carbon filtration for all exhaust air (99%+ odor removal efficiency)
- Negative air pressure (interior air pressure below exterior to prevent odor escape)
- Air exchange rates: 1-2 complete air exchanges per hour minimum
- Regular filter replacement schedules (quarterly for high-volume cultivation)

**Compliance Verification:**
- Annual odor impact reports by certified environmental consultants
- Neighbor complaint investigation protocols (local code enforcement)
- "Odor neutrality" standard: No detectable cannabis odor at property line when measured by code enforcement officer

**Violation Consequences:** Odor complaints are the **leading cause** of CUP enforcement actions against cultivation facilities. Neighbor complaints trigger:
1. Code enforcement site inspection within 48-72 hours
2. Compliance order requiring remediation within 30 days
3. Follow-up inspection; continued violations → CUP revocation proceedings³¹

**PCG Compliance Record:** The Target received 14 odor-related complaints across 8 cultivation facilities between 2022-2024. All complaints were resolved through voluntary HVAC system upgrades (total cost: $420K). No CUP revocation proceedings resulted, but three facilities received conditional compliance orders requiring quarterly odor monitoring reports for two years.³²

**Parking and Traffic Management:**

Retail CUPs require minimum parking ratios (typically 1 space per 200-300 square feet of retail floor area) and traffic impact mitigation:³³
- **Parking requirements:** Target's 52 retail locations average 18 parking spaces per location (range: 8-35 spaces)
- **Peak hour traffic:** Evening/weekend peak (6-8 PM) generates 25-40 vehicle trips per hour at high-volume locations
- **Delivery truck restrictions:** Off-peak delivery hours (typically 7 AM - 4 PM) to avoid customer traffic conflicts
- **Queue management:** Interior queuing required (no outdoor lines) to minimize sidewalk congestion

#### 3. CUP Renewal and Revocation Risk

**Renewal Requirements:**

CUPs for cannabis operations typically expire after **1-3 years**, requiring formal renewal applications:³⁴

| State | Typical CUP Term | Renewal Process | Public Hearing Required? |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| California | 1-2 years | Planning staff review; Commission hearing if complaints | Yes (if complaints) |
| Colorado | 2 years | Administrative renewal if no violations | No (if compliant) |
| Nevada | 2 years | Planning Commission approval | Yes (noticed hearing) |
| Oregon | 3 years | Administrative if no complaints | No (if compliant) |

**Renewal Timeline Risk:** The Target faces **28 CUP renewals in 2026** (8 California, 6 Colorado, 4 Nevada, 10 other states). Renewals require:
- Application fees: $2,500-$10,000 per CUP
- Updated site plans and operational documentation
- Community outreach (proactive neighbor notifications)
- Planning staff inspections
- Public hearings (if required)
- Processing time: 60-120 days per renewal³⁵

**Aggregate Cost:** Estimated $780K for 28 renewals in 2026 (application fees $210K, consultant services $420K, legal representation $150K).³⁶

**Revocation Grounds:**

CUPs may be revoked for:³⁷
1. **Material violations of operating conditions** (hours, security, odor)
2. **State license suspension or revocation** (local permits dependent on state authorization)
3. **Nuisance complaints** (neighborhood opposition, demonstrated adverse impacts)
4. **Criminal activity on premises** (theft, violence, sales to minors)
5. **False statements in CUP application** (material misrepresentations)

**Revocation Process:** Local governments must provide due process before revocation:
- **Notice:** Written notice of alleged violations, specifying grounds for revocation
- **Opportunity to cure:** 30-60 days to correct violations (unless immediate threat to public safety)
- **Hearing:** Public hearing before Planning Commission or City Council
- **Findings:** Written findings of fact supporting revocation decision
- **Appeal rights:** Judicial review by writ of mandate (California) or administrative appeal³⁸

**Revocation Statistics (Industry-Wide):** National Cannabis Industry Association data indicates cannabis CUP revocations occur at a rate of **0.5-1.0% annually**. Primary causes:
- Odor violations: 40% of revocations
- Operating without required security measures: 25%
- Sales to minors (undercover stings): 20%
- Neighborhood opposition campaigns: 10%
- Other (zoning violations, nuisance): 5%³⁹

**PCG Revocation Risk Assessment:** The Target has no CUP revocations in its operating history (2018-2024). This clean compliance record suggests **below-average revocation risk** (estimated 0.3-0.5% per facility annually, or 2-4 facilities at risk over a 10-year period).⁴⁰

### C. Change-of-Control Implications for Local Approvals

#### 1. Local Ownership Transfer Approval Requirements

**Transfer Approval Paradigms:**

Local jurisdictions adopt varying approaches to cannabis business ownership changes:

**Model 1: Administrative Approval (Ministerial):**
Some jurisdictions treat ownership transfers as administrative amendments requiring:
- Notification to local licensing department
- Updated ownership disclosure forms
- Background check clearance for new owners
- No public hearing required
- Processing time: 30-60 days
- **Example jurisdictions:** San Francisco, Oakland, Seattle⁴¹

**Model 2: Discretionary Approval (Hearing Required):**
Other jurisdictions treat ownership changes as new permit applications requiring:
- Full CUP transfer application
- Public hearing before Planning Commission or City Council
- Community notice (mailed notice to neighbors within 300-500 feet)
- Public testimony opportunity (supporters and opponents)
- Discretionary approval (may be denied even if applicant qualifies)
- Processing time: 90-180 days
- **Example jurisdictions:** Los Angeles, Denver, Boulder, Las Vegas⁴²

**Model 3: Hybrid Approach (Threshold-Based):**
Some jurisdictions distinguish between minor and major ownership changes:
- **Minor changes** (<25% ownership transfer): Administrative approval
- **Major changes** (>50% ownership transfer): Discretionary hearing
- The proposed acquisition (100% equity purchase) = **major change** in all hybrid jurisdictions
- **Example jurisdictions:** San Diego, Colorado Springs, Phoenix⁴³

**PCG Exposure:** The proposed acquisition transfers **100% ownership** of the Target entity, triggering:
- **Discretionary approval requirements** in 42 of 72 facilities (jurisdictions using Model 2 or Model 3)
- **Public hearings** in 42 jurisdictions (opportunity for community opposition)
- **Processing timelines** of 90-180 days **per jurisdiction** (cannot be accelerated)⁴⁴

#### 2. Public Hearing Dynamics and Community Opposition Risk

**Hearing Notice Requirements:**

Jurisdictions require advance notice to:
- **Property owners:** Within 300-500 feet of the facility (mailed notice, 15-30 days pre-hearing)
- **Neighborhood associations:** Registered community groups (email/mail notice)
- **General public:** Published notice in newspapers of general circulation, posted on-site signage
- **Online posting:** Municipal websites, public hearing calendars⁴⁵

**Typical Hearing Process:**

1. **Applicant presentation** (10-15 minutes): Acquirer representatives describe acquisition, operational plans, compliance record
2. **Staff report** (5-10 minutes): Planning staff recommendation (approve/deny/approve with conditions)
3. **Public testimony** (open-ended): Community members, neighbors, advocacy groups testify
4. **Applicant rebuttal** (5-10 minutes): Response to opposition concerns
5. **Commission/Council deliberation:** Questions, discussion, motion, vote⁴⁶

**Opposition Tactics:**

Anti-cannabis activists and NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) groups deploy standard opposition strategies:⁴⁷
- **"Protect our children" arguments:** Proximity to schools, youth exposure concerns (effective rhetoric even if facility is code-compliant)
- **Property value claims:** Assertions that cannabis businesses reduce residential property values (empirical evidence mixed; studies show minimal impact)
- **Crime and safety concerns:** Allegations of increased crime, loitering, traffic (actual data shows licensed dispensaries do not increase crime rates)
- **Odor and nuisance complaints:** Cultivation facility neighbors allege quality-of-life impacts
- **"Oversaturation" arguments:** Claims that neighborhood has "too many" cannabis businesses (subjective; politically resonant)

**Opposition Success Rates:**

Empirical analysis of California and Colorado CUP hearings (2020-2024) indicates:⁴⁸
- **Uncontested hearings** (no opposition testimony): 95% approval rate
- **Mild opposition** (1-5 speakers): 78% approval rate
- **Moderate opposition** (6-15 speakers): 62% approval rate
- **Organized opposition** (15+ speakers, petition campaigns): 43% approval rate

**Critical Variable:** The Target's **existing operations** provide significant strategic advantage over new applicants. Incumbent operators benefit from:
- **Demonstrated compliance:** Operating history with no violations demonstrates community compatibility
- **Neighbor familiarity:** Existing neighbors have adapted to operations; unknown new operator generates uncertainty
- **Economic continuity:** Employee retention, tax revenue continuation, supply chain stability
- **Staff recommendations:** Planning staff typically recommend approval for compliant incumbents⁴⁹

**PCG-Specific Risk Assessment:**

Of the Target's 42 facilities requiring discretionary hearings:
- **Low opposition risk** (34 facilities): Industrial/commercial zones, no residential proximity, no complaint history
- **Moderate opposition risk** (6 facilities): Mixed-use areas, prior odor complaints resolved, active neighborhood associations
- **High opposition risk** (2 facilities):
  - Los Angeles retail dispensary (Boyle Heights): Prior community opposition at initial approval (2019), neighborhood coalition opposes cannabis proliferation
  - Denver cultivation facility (Montbello): Residential proximity, 3 odor complaints (2022-2023), city council member publicly skeptical of cannabis expansion⁵⁰

**Probability-Weighted Denial Risk:**
- **Low-risk facilities** (34): 5% denial probability = 1.7 expected denials
- **Moderate-risk facilities** (6): 20% denial probability = 1.2 expected denials
- **High-risk facilities** (2): 40% denial probability = 0.8 expected denials
- **Aggregate expected denials:** **3-4 facilities** (7-10% of discretionary approvals)⁵¹

#### 3. Conditional Approval Scenarios: Reopening Operating Conditions

Even if local authorities approve the ownership transfer, they may impose **new or modified conditions** as a condition of approval. Common modifications requested:⁵²

**Enhanced Security Requirements:**
- Increased on-site security guard hours (cost: $40K-$80K per location annually)
- Upgraded surveillance systems (capital cost: $25K-$50K per location)
- Additional lighting (exterior premises security)

**Operating Hour Restrictions:**
- Reduction of permitted hours (e.g., 6 AM - 10 PM reduced to 8 AM - 9 PM)
- Revenue impact: 10-15% reduction for evening-peak retail locations

**Additional Odor Controls:**
- Upgraded HVAC systems (capital cost: $75K-$150K per cultivation facility)
- Quarterly odor monitoring reports (ongoing cost: $12K annually per facility)

**Community Benefit Agreements:**
Some jurisdictions (particularly Massachusetts, Illinois) require **host community agreements** (HCAs) imposing:
- Community impact fees: 1-3% of gross revenue paid to municipality
- Local hiring requirements: 25-50% of employees from local jurisdiction
- Community investment commitments: Donations to local nonprofits, youth programs
- Massachusetts Boston/Cambridge Target locations: HCAs require 3% gross revenue payments = $180K annually for 4 facilities⁵³

**Financial Impact of Conditional Approvals:**

If 15-20 of the 42 discretionary approval facilities receive modified conditions requiring enhanced security, reduced hours, or community payments:
- **Enhanced security:** 15 locations × $60K average = $900K annual increase
- **Revenue reduction (reduced hours):** 8 retail locations × $850K average revenue × 12% reduction = $816K annual loss
- **Odor control upgrades:** 5 cultivation facilities × $100K average = $500K one-time capital cost
- **Community benefit payments:** 4 Massachusetts facilities = $180K annual + potential expansion to other jurisdictions
- **Aggregate impact:** $1.9M annual + $500K one-time⁵⁴

[XREF:LOCAL → VALUATION: Local approval conditions and denials create $2-4M annual downside risk; earnout structure should account for local approval contingencies]

- **Property:** 5621 S Chestnut Avenue, Fresno, CA (unincorporated Fresno County)
- **Variance requested:** Reduce rear yard setback from 50 feet to 35 feet for warehouse expansion
- **Issue:** Proposed 12,000 sq ft warehouse addition requires 50-foot setback under County zoning; existing site configuration limits usable buildable area
- **Requested relief:** 35-foot setback (30% reduction)
- **Justification:** Irregular lot shape, existing utility easements constrain development
- **Status:** Application filed August 2024; County Planning Commission hearing scheduled February 2025
- **Estimated processing time:** 8-9 months total (3-4 months remaining)
- **Application fee paid:** $7,200
- **Capital investment contingent on approval:** $1.8M (warehouse construction)⁵⁹

**Aggregate Pending Approvals Summary:**

| Application | Jurisdiction | Issue | Filing Date | Expected Decision | Denial Risk | Capital Contingent |
|-------------|--------------|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sacramento expansion | City of Sacramento | FAR variance | July 2024 | March 2025 | 25% | $4.2M |
| LA dispensary buffer | City of Los Angeles | Distance waiver | October 2024 | June 2025 | 45% | $0 (existing ops) |
| SD manufacturing parking | City of San Diego | Parking reduction | September 2024 | January 2025 | 10% | $0 (existing ops) |
| Fresno warehouse setback | Fresno County | Setback variance | August 2024 | April 2025 | 20% | $1.8M |
| **TOTAL** | **4 jurisdictions** | **4 variances** | **Q3-Q4 2024** | **Q1-Q2 2025** | **Weighted 28%** | **$6M** |⁶⁰

#### 2. Variance Approval Standards and Denial Risk

**Legal Standard for Variances:**

California zoning law requires variance applicants to demonstrate **four findings** (Cal. Gov't Code § 65906):⁶¹

1. **Practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship:** Strict application of zoning ordinance would deprive applicant of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the same zone
2. **Unique circumstances:** Special circumstances (lot size, shape, topography) distinguish the property from others in the vicinity
3. **Not self-created hardship:** Applicant did not create the hardship by purchasing property with knowledge of limitations
4. **Not contrary to public interest:** Variance will not be detrimental to public health, safety, or welfare

**Application to PCG Pending Variances:**

**Sacramento FAR Variance (Expansion):**
- **Practical difficulty:** ✓ Irregular lot shape (triangular parcel) limits efficient building placement
- **Unique circumstances:** ✓ Lot geometry differs from rectangular industrial parcels in area
- **Not self-created:** ✓ Lot shape pre-existing; Target acquired property in current configuration (2021)
- **Not contrary to public interest:** ✓ Industrial zone; no residential adjacency; expansion generates jobs, tax revenue
- **Predicted outcome:** **75% approval probability** — variance meets all statutory criteria⁶²

**Los Angeles Buffer Waiver (School Distance):**
- **Practical difficulty:** ✓ School boundary change created non-conformity (not applicant's action)
- **Unique circumstances:** ✓ Municipal boundary adjustment is unique external event
- **Not self-created:** ⚠ Dispensary opened before school boundary change, but acquisition of business with pending variance = assumed risk
- **Not contrary to public interest:** ✗ School proximity politically sensitive; opposition expected to argue child safety concerns
- **Predicted outcome:** **50-55% approval probability** — legally supportable but politically risky; depends on hearing testimony dynamics⁶³

**San Diego Parking Variance:**
- **Practical difficulty:** ✓ Lot dimensions physically prevent 45-space layout
- **Unique circumstances:** ✓ Irregular lot configuration (40-foot width constraint)
- **Not self-created:** ✓ Lot geometry pre-existing
- **Not contrary to public interest:** ✓ Industrial park; adequate street parking; carpooling program mitigates demand
- **Predicted outcome:** **90% approval probability** — Planning Commission approval indicates City Council concurrence⁶⁴

**Fresno Setback Variance:**
- **Practical difficulty:** ✓ Existing utility easements and lot shape limit development options
- **Unique circumstances:** ✓ Easement configuration unique to this parcel
- **Not self-created:** ✓ Utility easements date to 1987 (pre-acquisition)
- **Not contrary to public interest:** ✓ Unincorporated county; nearest residence 450 feet away; no compatibility concerns
- **Predicted outcome:** **80% approval probability** — Fresno County traditionally grants setback variances for industrial properties with demonstrated constraints⁶⁵

#### 3. Timeline Implications for Closing

**Critical Path Analysis:**

The four pending variance applications create **closing timeline dependencies**:

**Scenario A: All Variances Approved**
- Sacramento decision: March 2025
- San Diego decision: January 2025 (substantially certain)
- Fresno decision: April 2025
- Los Angeles decision: June 2025 (latest)
- **Earliest closing date (if all approved):** **July 2025** (assumes 30-day post-approval due diligence period)⁶⁶

**Scenario B: Los Angeles Waiver Denied**
- Denial triggers **divestiture requirement**: Los Angeles dispensary cannot operate within 700 feet of school
- Options:
  1. **Relocate dispensary:** Identify new compliant location, obtain new CUP (12-18 months, $1.2M cost)
  2. **Divest location:** Exclude LA dispensary from acquisition (reduce purchase price by $4.5M = 3× annual EBITDA)
  3. **Challenge denial:** Writ of mandate in Los Angeles Superior Court (12-24 months litigation, uncertain outcome)
- **Impact on closing:** Negotiation required; likely **60-90 day delay** while parties agree on resolution⁶⁷

**Scenario C: Sacramento or Fresno Variance Denied**
- Sacramento denial: $4.2M expansion project abandoned (minimal impact on current operations; reduces growth projections)
- Fresno denial: $1.8M warehouse project abandoned (constrains distribution capacity; operational workaround feasible)
- **Impact on closing:** Minimal delay; parties may adjust purchase price to reflect lost expansion value (estimated $2-3M reduction)⁶⁸

**Recommended Closing Condition Language:**

```
Section 7.12 — Local Zoning Approvals

(a) Pending Variances. The parties acknowledge that the following variance applications are pending as of the Effective Date:
    (i) Sacramento cultivation expansion variance (Application No. P24-078)
    (ii) Los Angeles Boyle Heights buffer distance waiver (Application No. CPC-2024-3892)
    (iii) San Diego manufacturing parking variance (Application No. PDS2024-VAR-24-019)
    (iv) Fresno distribution warehouse setback variance (Application No. Z-2024-187-V)

(b) LA Boyle Heights Condition Precedent. The approval of the Los Angeles buffer distance waiver (item (ii) above) by final non-appealable action of the Los Angeles City Council shall be a condition precedent to Closing. If such approval is not obtained by June 30, 2025, Seller shall, at Buyer's election:
    (i) Exclude the Los Angeles Boyle Heights dispensary from the Purchased Assets and reduce the Purchase Price by $4,500,000; or
    (ii) Provide a remediation plan (acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion) demonstrating compliance with distance requirements through property modification or alternative zoning relief within 90 days of Closing.

(c) Other Variances. The approval or denial of variance applications (i), (iii), and (iv) shall not constitute a condition to Closing. If any such variance is denied prior to Closing, the parties shall negotiate in good faith an equitable adjustment to the Purchase Price reflecting the loss of expansion capacity (not to exceed $6,000,000 in aggregate).

(d) Obligation to Prosecute. Seller shall diligently prosecute all pending variance applications through final decision, including attending hearings, responding to planning staff requests, and providing all required documentation. Seller shall consult with Buyer regarding hearing strategy and shall not withdraw any application without Buyer's prior written consent.
```⁶⁹

**Cost Estimates:**

| Variance | Application Fee | Consultant Services | Legal Representation | Public Hearing Costs | Total Per Application |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Sacramento | $12,500 | $18,000 (traffic study, site plan) | $22,000 | $3,500 (exhibits, presentation) | $56,000 |
| Los Angeles | $8,800 | $14,000 (community outreach) | $28,000 (contested hearing) | $5,200 | $56,000 |
| San Diego | $6,400 | $8,500 (parking study) | $12,000 | $2,100 | $29,000 |
| Fresno | $7,200 | $11,000 (site engineering) | $15,000 | $2,800 | $36,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$34,900** | **$51,500** | **$77,000** | **$13,600** | **$177,000** |⁷⁰

[XREF:LOCAL → CLOSING CONDITIONS: Pending variance approvals create 3-6 month timeline extension; LA buffer waiver should be closing condition precedent]

### E. Zoning Litigation Risk: Neighbor Challenges and Environmental Review

#### 1. Third-Party Legal Challenges to CUPs

**Standing to Challenge:**

Aggrieved parties may challenge CUP approvals through:
- **Administrative appeals:** Filed within 10-15 days of Planning Commission decision, heard by City Council
- **Judicial review:** Writ of mandate (California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5) filed within 90 days of final agency decision
- **CEQA lawsuits:** Challenges to environmental review adequacy (California only) filed within 30 days of Notice of Determination⁷¹

**Who Has Standing:**

| Challenger Type | Standing Requirement | Likelihood of Challenge |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Adjacent property owners** | Property within 300-500 feet of facility | HIGH — most common challengers |
| **Neighborhood associations** | Members residing in affected area | MODERATE — organized opposition groups |
| **Competing cannabis businesses** | Economic injury (reduced market share) | LOW — courts skeptical of competitor standing |
| **Anti-cannabis advocacy groups** | Must demonstrate particularized harm beyond general policy disagreement | LOW — often dismissed for lack of standing |⁷²

**Grounds for Challenge:**

**Procedural Challenges:**
- Inadequate notice to property owners (notice radius too narrow, defective mailing)
- Failure to make required findings (CUP approval without addressing compatibility criteria)
- CEQA violations (environmental review inadequacy — California only)⁷³

**Substantive Challenges:**
- Approval not supported by substantial evidence (planning commission ignored evidence of adverse impacts)
- Abuse of discretion (decision arbitrary or capricious)
- Inconsistency with general plan or zoning ordinance objectives
- Failure to impose adequate mitigation conditions⁷⁴

**Historical Success Rates:**

Empirical analysis of cannabis CUP challenges (2018-2024, California and Colorado):⁷⁵
- **Administrative appeals:** 15% success rate (85% of Planning Commission approvals upheld by City Council)
- **Judicial review (procedural challenges):** 8% success rate (most CUP approvals survive legal review)
- **Judicial review (CEQA violations):** 22% success rate (environmental review challenges more successful)
- **Overall:** 88% of cannabis CUP approvals survive all challenges and become final

**PCG Litigation Exposure:**

Based on the Target's 76 CUPs and industry challenge rates:
- **Expected challenges over 10-year period:** 76 CUPs × 12% challenge rate = **9 expected challenges**
- **Expected reversals:** 9 challenges × 12% reversal rate = **1.1 expected CUP reversals**
- **Probability-weighted exposure:** 1.1 CUP losses over 10 years = **11% chance per decade** of losing one location to litigation⁷⁶

#### 2. California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Compliance

**CEQA Applicability to Cannabis Projects:**

CEQA requires environmental review for "projects" requiring discretionary governmental approval. Cannabis CUPs constitute "projects" subject to CEQA (Cal. Pub. Resources Code § 21065).⁷⁷

**Three Levels of CEQA Review:**

**1. Categorical Exemption:**
Projects with no potential for significant environmental impact may be categorically exempt. Common exemptions for cannabis:
- **Class 1 (Existing Facilities):** Operation of existing private structures with no expansion (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15301)
- **Class 3 (New Construction/Conversion):** New small structures or conversion of small structures (up to 10,000 sq ft retail; up to 2,500 sq ft industrial) (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15303)
- **Class 32 (Infill Development):** Projects on infill sites with adequate infrastructure⁷⁸

**2. Negative Declaration (ND) or Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND):**
Projects with potential environmental impacts that can be mitigated to less-than-significant levels require ND/MND. Cannabis cultivation facilities typically require MND addressing:
- **Odor impacts:** Mitigation measures (HVAC filtration) reduce impacts to less-than-significant
- **Water usage:** Cultivation water demand (1-6 gallons per plant per day)
- **Energy consumption:** High-intensity grow lights (electricity demand)
- **Traffic:** Employee and delivery vehicle trips⁷⁹

**3. Environmental Impact Report (EIR):**
Projects with significant unavoidable environmental impacts require full EIR. Cannabis projects rarely trigger EIR requirements unless:
- Large-scale cultivation (>100,000 sq ft canopy)
- Significant water supply constraints (drought-impacted regions)
- Cumulative impacts (many cannabis projects in same area)⁸⁰

**PCG California CEQA Compliance:**

Of the Target's 33 California licenses:
- **18 projects:** Categorical exemptions (existing facilities, no expansion)
- **12 projects:** Mitigated Negative Declarations (cultivation/manufacturing with odor/water mitigation)
- **3 projects:** Exempt (ministerial permits, no CEQA review required)
- **0 projects:** EIRs (no projects triggered full EIR)⁸¹

**CEQA Challenge Risk:**

CEQA lawsuits must be filed within **30 days** of Notice of Determination filing (Pub. Resources Code § 21167(c)). Common CEQA challenges allege:⁸²
- **Improper use of categorical exemption:** Challenger argues project has unusual circumstances precluding exemption (Pub. Resources Code § 21084)
- **Inadequate impact analysis:** MND fails to analyze significant environmental effects (e.g., cumulative water impacts)
- **Inadequate mitigation measures:** Proposed mitigation insufficient to reduce impacts to less-than-significant
- **Failure to consider alternatives:** Agency failed to consider feasible alternatives (different location, reduced scale)

**Empirical Success Rates (CEQA Cannabis Litigation):**⁸³
- **Categorical exemption challenges:** 30% success rate (courts more willing to invalidate exemptions)
- **MND challenges:** 18% success rate
- **EIR adequacy challenges:** 35% success rate (EIRs held to higher standard)

**Remedy if CEQA Challenge Succeeds:**
If court invalidates CEQA determination, the CUP approval is typically **suspended** (not permanently revoked). The agency must:
1. Prepare adequate environmental review (upgraded from exemption to MND, or from MND to EIR)
2. Re-notice and re-circulate for public comment
3. Hold new hearing and re-approve CUP with proper environmental documentation
4. **Timeline:** 6-18 months to cure CEQA violation and re-approve project⁸⁴

**PCG CEQA Litigation History:**

The Target has faced **zero CEQA lawsuits** to date (2018-2024). This clean record reflects:
- Conservative approach to CEQA exemptions (Target's counsel prepared MNDs for projects where exemptions were arguable)
- Proactive community engagement (reduced neighbor opposition)
- Robust mitigation measures (odor control, water conservation)⁸⁵

**Prospective CEQA Risk Assessment:**

Probability of CEQA challenge to PCG facilities over next 5 years:
- 33 California facilities × 5% challenge probability = **1.65 expected challenges**
- 1.65 challenges × 25% success rate = **0.41 expected invalidations**
- **Financial impact per invalidation:** $450K (legal defense $180K, re-permitting $120K, operational suspension $150K)
- **Probability-weighted exposure:** 0.41 × $450K = **$185K over 5 years** ($37K annualized)⁸⁶

[XREF:LOCAL → ENVIRONMENTAL: CEQA compliance overlaps with environmental regulatory compliance; aquifer impacts, hazardous waste, air quality]

#### 3. Federal Preemption Challenges (Rejected by Courts)

**Theoretical Argument:**

Cannabis opponents occasionally argue that state and local cannabis regulations are preempted by the federal Controlled Substances Act under the Supremacy Clause (U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2). The argument: local governments cannot authorize activity that violates federal criminal law.⁸⁷

**Universal Judicial Rejection:**

Every court to consider this argument has rejected it, holding:⁸⁸

***City of Riverside v. Inland Empire Patients Health & Wellness Center*, 56 Cal. 4th 729 (2013):** California Supreme Court held that local bans on medical marijuana dispensaries are not preempted by state medical marijuana law (Compassionate Use Act). Cities retain police power to regulate land use even where state law permits activity. Preemption applies only where local law conflicts with state law; local bans do not conflict because state law does not mandate permitting cannabis businesses.⁸⁹

***Emerald Steel Fabricators, Inc. v. Bureau of Labor & Industries*, 348 P.3d 429 (Or. 2015):** Oregon Supreme Court held that state cannabis legalization does not preempt federal CSA. State law does not purport to authorize violations of federal law; it merely decriminalizes conduct under state law. Federal and state law can coexist because they operate in separate sovereignties.⁹⁰

***State v. Christensen*, 478 P.3d 871 (Nev. 2020):** (discussed in Real Estate section) Nevada Supreme Court held that federal CSA does not preempt Nevada's regulation of cannabis or Nevada contract law. Federal preemption requires congressional intent to preempt; CSA contains no express preemption provision, and conflict preemption does not apply because states are not required to criminalize conduct that federal law prohibits.⁹¹

**Practical Implication:** Federal preemption challenges to local cannabis regulations are **uniformly unsuccessful**. No court has invalidated a local cannabis ordinance or CUP on preemption grounds. This is a **legally meritless** argument with zero probability of success based on existing precedent.⁹²

### F. Risk Assessment and Financial Exposure

#### 1. Aggregate Local Control Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Severity | Probability | Gross Exposure | Probability-Weighted Impact | Timeframe |
|--------------|----------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| **CUP revocation (odor/compliance violations)** | HIGH | 5-10% over 5 years (2-4 facilities) | $8M-$16M (2-4 locations @ $4M avg replacement value) | $800K-$1.6M | Ongoing |
| **Ownership transfer denials** | HIGH | 7-10% (3-4 of 42 discretionary approvals) | $12M-$16M (3-4 locations @ $4M avg) | $1.2M-$1.6M | Q1-Q4 2025 |
| **Conditional approvals (modified operating conditions)** | MEDIUM | 35-40% (15-17 facilities receive new conditions) | $1.9M annually (security, hours, fees) | $760K-$950K | Q1-Q4 2025 |
| **Pending variance denials** | MEDIUM | 28% weighted (LA buffer waiver high-risk) | $4.5M (LA location divestiture) + $6M (lost expansion) | $1.26M (LA) + $1.68M (expansions) | Q1-Q2 2025 |
| **CEQA litigation** | LOW | 12% (1 invalidation over 5 years) | $450K per invalidation | $54K | 2025-2029 |
| **Zoning litigation (non-CEQA)** | LOW | 11% (1 CUP loss over 10 years) | $4M (1 location replacement) | $440K | 2025-2034 |
| **CUP renewal denials** | LOW | 3-5% (1-2 renewals denied over 5 years) | $4M-$8M (1-2 locations) | $200K-$400K | 2026-2029 |
| **TOTAL WEIGHTED EXPOSURE** | **MEDIUM** | **Various** | **$30M-$50M (5-year gross)** | **$5.2M-$7.0M (NPV)** | **2025-2029** |⁹³

**Severity Justification:**

Local control risks are rated **MEDIUM severity** (not HIGH) because:
1. **Site-specific impact:** CUP loss affects individual locations, not enterprise-wide operations (compare to Section 280E tax, which affects all revenue)
2. **Diversification:** 72 facilities across 38 jurisdictions; loss of 2-4 locations = 5-10% capacity reduction
3. **Replacement feasibility:** Target can relocate operations to alternative compliant sites within same market (12-24 months, $3M-$5M per location)
4. **Probability distribution:** High-impact events (multiple denials) have low probability; most likely outcome is 1-2 locations affected⁹⁴

**Comparison to Other Risk Categories:**

| Risk Category | NPV Impact (5-Year) | Severity Rating | Probability | Rank |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|------|
| Section 280E tax penalty | $59.07M | HIGH | 100% | 1 |
| UFCW union organizing | $65.07M | HIGH | 50-75% | 2 |
| IRS audit deficiency | $4.87M | MEDIUM | 80% | 3 |
| **Local control (CUP/zoning)** | **$5.2M-$7.0M** | **MEDIUM** | **Various** | **4** |
| METRC compliance remediation | $5.04M | MEDIUM | 100% | 5 |
| Product liability | $1.53M | LOW | 40% | 6 |⁹⁵

Local control risk ranks **4th** among identified risk categories, representing **5-6% of aggregate risk exposure** (compared to 280E at 41% and UFCW at 46%).

#### 2. Mitigation Strategies and Recommendations

**Pre-Closing Mitigation:**

**1. Accelerate Ownership Transfer Applications (High Priority)**
- File all 42 discretionary transfer applications **immediately** (Q4 2024) to maximize processing time before Investment Committee deadline
- Engage local land use counsel in each jurisdiction to manage hearing strategy
- Prepare standardized presentation materials (Target's compliance record, operational continuity commitments, economic benefits)
- Estimated cost: $840K (42 applications × $20K average legal/consulting fees)⁹⁶

**2. Proactive Community Engagement**
- Pre-hearing outreach to neighborhood associations, adjacent property owners
- Offer operational concessions preemptively (enhanced security, reduced hours) to defuse opposition
- Coordinate with local elected officials (city council members, county supervisors) to gauge political support
- Estimated cost: $180K (community relations consultants, 6-month engagement campaign)⁹⁷

**3. Resolve Pending Variances**
- **LA buffer waiver:** Engage community-based organization (CBO) partnerships to demonstrate community support
- Prepare alternative compliance plan (facility modifications, enhanced youth protection measures) if waiver denied
- **Sacramento/Fresno expansions:** Accelerate applications to obtain decisions pre-closing
- Estimated cost: $120K (expediting fees, additional consultant services)⁹⁸

**Post-Closing Mitigation:**

**4. CUP Compliance Audit Program**
- Engage third-party compliance auditors to inspect all 76 CUP-regulated facilities annually
- Audit checklist: Operating hours, security systems, odor control, parking, signage, employee badging
- Remediate violations **before** code enforcement discovers them
- Estimated cost: $380K annually (76 facilities × $5K per audit)⁹⁹

**5. Odor Control Infrastructure Upgrades**
- Proactive HVAC system upgrades at 12 cultivation facilities with elevated complaint risk
- Install real-time odor monitoring sensors (pre-emptive detection before neighbor complaints)
- Establish quarterly preventive maintenance schedules (filter replacements)
- Estimated cost: $1.2M one-time + $180K annually (maintenance)¹⁰⁰

**6. CUP Renewal Tracking System**
- Implement software tracking system for 76 CUP expiration dates, renewal deadlines, fee payment schedules
- Assign dedicated regulatory compliance manager (1.0 FTE) to manage renewals across all jurisdictions
- File renewals 90-120 days in advance (exceed minimum filing deadlines)
- Estimated cost: $140K annually (1 FTE compliance manager + software)¹⁰¹

**7. Landlord Coordination for Leased Locations**
- Notify landlords of acquisition; obtain landlord consent letters supporting ownership transfer
- Amend leases to clarify landlord obligations to support CUP renewals (landlord property maintenance, cooperation with inspections)
- For cannabis-specialized REIT landlords (IIPR, Power REIT), negotiate landlord testimony at hearings (demonstrate institutional support)
- Estimated cost: $90K (legal counsel for lease amendments)¹⁰²

#### 3. Purchase Agreement Provisions: Allocation of Local Approval Risk

**Recommended Contract Language:**

```
SECTION 8.7 — LOCAL ZONING APPROVALS AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS

(a) Schedule of Local Approvals. Schedule 8.7(a) lists all 76 conditional use permits, local cannabis business licenses, development agreements, and other local governmental approvals required for the operation of the Business (collectively, "Local Approvals"). Seller represents that all Local Approvals are valid, in full force and effect, and not subject to pending revocation, suspension, or non-renewal proceedings as of the Effective Date.

(b) Ownership Transfer Applications. Within ten (10) business days following the Effective Date, Seller shall file applications for approval of the ownership transfer contemplated by this Agreement with all applicable local governmental authorities requiring such approval (the "Transfer Applications"). Seller shall diligently prosecute all Transfer Applications, attend all hearings, respond to all agency requests, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval of all Transfer Applications prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Cooperation. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in prosecuting Transfer Applications, including: (i) providing ownership disclosure information and background check authorizations; (ii) attending hearings and presenting testimony regarding Buyer's qualifications and operational plans; (iii) engaging local land use counsel (at Buyer's expense) to support Seller's counsel; and (iv) participating in community engagement activities requested by local agencies.

(d) Conditional Closing — Material Locations. The approval of Transfer Applications for the locations identified on Schedule 8.7(d) as "Material Locations" (defined as locations generating annual revenue exceeding $5,000,000 or representing >5% of total cultivation capacity) shall be conditions precedent to Closing. If any Material Location Transfer Application is denied by final non-appealable action prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may elect to:
    (i) Terminate this Agreement and receive return of the Earnest Money Deposit; or
    (ii) Proceed to Closing and exclude the affected Material Location from the Purchased Assets, with the Purchase Price reduced by an amount equal to 3.0× the trailing twelve-month EBITDA of such Material Location; or
    (iii) Proceed to Closing and require Seller to establish an escrow holdback (12 months' revenue of affected Material Location) pending resolution through appeal or alternative compliance plan.

(e) Non-Material Locations. The denial of Transfer Applications for non-Material Locations shall not constitute a basis for terminating this Agreement. If any non-Material Location Transfer Application is denied, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $2,000,000 per denied location, and Seller shall have no further obligation with respect to such location.

(f) Modified Conditions. If any local governmental authority approves a Transfer Application subject to new or modified operating conditions (including reduced operating hours, enhanced security requirements, increased fees, or community benefit payments), the parties shall negotiate in good faith an equitable adjustment to the Purchase Price reflecting the incremental annual cost of compliance (capitalized at 5× multiple). If the parties cannot agree on the adjustment within ten (10) business days, the matter shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for determination.

(g) Pending Variances. The status and treatment of pending variance applications (Sacramento expansion, Los Angeles buffer waiver, San Diego parking, Fresno setback) shall be governed by Section 7.12 (Local Zoning Approvals) above.

(h) Post-Closing Cooperation. For a period of twelve (12) months following Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate (at Buyer's expense) with Buyer's efforts to maintain Local Approvals in good standing, including: (i) providing testimony at CUP renewal hearings; (ii) providing historical operational records demonstrating compliance; and (iii) assisting with neighborhood relations and community outreach.

(i) CUP Compliance Representation. Seller represents and warrants that, as of the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date:
    (i) Each Purchased Asset location is in material compliance with all conditions imposed by Local Approvals applicable to such location;
    (ii) No location has received written notice of violation, non-compliance, or enforcement action from any local governmental authority within the preceding twelve (12) months, except as disclosed on Schedule 8.7(i)(ii);
    (iii) No Local Approval is subject to pending revocation, suspension, or non-renewal proceedings; and
    (iv) Seller has not received oral or written notice from any local governmental authority indicating intent to deny any pending Transfer Application.

(j) Indemnification. Seller shall indemnify Buyer for Losses arising from: (i) breach of representations in Section 8.7(i); (ii) pre-Closing violations of Local Approval operating conditions that result in post-Closing revocation or suspension; or (iii) Seller's failure to diligently prosecute Transfer Applications as required by Section 8.7(b). Buyer shall indemnify Seller for Losses arising from Buyer's post-Closing violations of Local Approval operating conditions.
```¹⁰³

**Purchase Price Adjustment Formula:**

For each discretionary approval denial or materially adverse conditional approval:
- **Material Location denial:** Purchase Price reduced by 3.0× trailing 12-month EBITDA of affected location
- **Non-Material Location denial:** Purchase Price reduced by flat $2M per location
- **Modified operating conditions:** Purchase Price reduced by 5.0× incremental annual compliance cost

**Example Calculation (Moderate Denial Scenario):**
- 3 Material Locations denied (avg EBITDA $2.1M each): 3 × 3.0× × $2.1M = $18.9M reduction
- 2 Non-Material Locations denied: 2 × $2M = $4M reduction
- 8 locations receive modified conditions (+$120K annual cost avg): 8 × 5× × $120K = $4.8M reduction
- **Total Purchase Price Adjustment:** $27.7M (4.8% of $580M asking price)¹⁰⁴

**Alternative Structure: Earnout Adjustment**

Rather than reduce fixed purchase price, structure local approval risk as earnout modifier:
- Base purchase price: $520M (10% holdback for local approval risk)
- Earnout: $60M payable over 24 months based on:
  - **Year 1 earnout ($30M):** Payable if ≥90% of Transfer Applications approved (≤4 denials)
  - **Year 2 earnout ($30M):** Payable if denied locations successfully relocated OR affected locations' revenue replaced through expansion at other locations
- **Advantage:** Incentivizes Seller to support transfer applications and post-closing remediation¹⁰⁵

[XREF:LOCAL → VALUATION: Local approval risk justifies 4-8% purchase price holdback; earnout structure aligns incentives for seller cooperation]

---

### G. Cross-Sectional Implications

#### 1. Local Control and State Licensing Interdependency

**Dual Approval Requirement:** State cannabis licenses are ineffective without corresponding local authorization. California DCC, Colorado MED, and other state agencies explicitly require proof of local approval before issuing or renewing state licenses.¹⁰⁶

**Cascade Effect:** Local CUP revocation triggers:
- State license suspension (state regulations require continued local authorization)
- Inventory quarantine (state tracks inventory to licensed premises; relocation requires approval)
- Loss of supplier/vendor relationships (supply contracts contingent on valid licenses)¹⁰⁷

[XREF:LOCAL → STATE LICENSING: State license validity contingent on local approval maintenance; CUP loss cascades to state license suspension]

#### 2. Local Control and Real Estate Leasing

**Lease Termination Clauses:** Cannabis leases uniformly include provisions permitting landlord termination if tenant loses required licenses or permits:¹⁰⁸

> "Tenant shall maintain in full force and effect all governmental licenses, permits, and approvals required for the Permitted Use (cannabis cultivation), including state cannabis licenses and local conditional use permits. Failure to maintain any required authorization shall constitute a material breach, entitling Landlord to terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days' written notice."

**CUP Loss = Automatic Lease Termination:** If Target loses a CUP, affected lease(s) terminate automatically, requiring:
- Immediate facility vacation
- Forfeiture of tenant improvements (typically $500K-$2M per cultivation facility)
- Loss of security deposits and prepaid rent
- Contractual damages exposure (landlord's lost future rent)¹⁰⁹

[XREF:LOCAL → REAL ESTATE: CUP revocation triggers lease termination; leasehold improvements become landlord property without compensation]

#### 3. Local Control and Banking Relationships

**Partner Community Bank** (Target's primary banking provider) requires the Target to maintain all required state and local licenses as a condition of maintaining deposit accounts:¹¹⁰

> "Customer represents that it operates in strict compliance with all applicable state and local laws, and maintains all required licenses and permits. Bank may terminate this agreement immediately upon Customer's loss of any cannabis license or local operating permit."

**Domino Effect:** Local CUP loss → State license suspension → Bank account closure → Inability to process payroll → Operational shutdown at all locations (not just the location that lost its CUP).¹¹¹

[XREF:LOCAL → BANKING: Loss of local approvals may trigger banking relationship termination; systemic operational risk beyond individual facility]

#### 4. Local Control and Change-of-Control Closing Timeline

**Critical Path Analysis:** State regulatory approvals (DCC, MED, etc.) require 6-12 months. Local approval processes add **sequential delays** of 90-180 days per jurisdiction if hearings are required:¹¹²

**Sequential Timeline Example (California):**
1. File local transfer applications: Month 1
2. Planning staff review and report preparation: Months 2-3
3. Public hearing notice period: Month 4 (30-day advance notice)
4. Planning Commission hearing: Month 5
5. City Council ratification (if required): Month 6
6. Appeal period: Month 7 (30 days post-approval)
7. **Local approval final:** Month 7
8. Submit proof of local approval to DCC: Month 8
9. DCC change-of-control processing: Months 8-14 (6 additional months)
10. **Total timeline:** **14 months** (local + state sequential)

**Multiplied Across Jurisdictions:** 38 separate jurisdictions = potentially **38 sequential approval processes** unless coordinated filing achieves parallel processing.¹¹³

### H. Conclusion: Material But Manageable Operational Risk

Local control and conditional use permit dependencies represent a **material operational risk** distinct from federal enforcement and tax risks. Unlike Section 280E (which affects all revenue uniformly) or UFCW organizing (which affects labor costs enterprise-wide), local control risks are **site-specific and probabilistic**: most locations will successfully obtain transfer approvals and maintain CUPs, but 5-10% of locations face moderate-to-high denial or revocation risk over a 5-year period.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Dual approval framework:** State legalization does not preempt local control; all 72 facilities depend on maintaining 76 local approvals in 38 jurisdictions

2. **Change-of-control risk:** 42 facilities require discretionary public hearings for ownership transfer approval; 7-10% denial probability (3-4 locations) based on community opposition and political factors

3. **Pending variance exposure:** Four California variance applications create closing timeline uncertainty; Los Angeles buffer waiver denial (45% probability) triggers $4.5M purchase price adjustment or 90-day closing delay

4. **CUP revocation risk:** 5-10% probability of losing 2-4 locations over 5 years due to odor complaints, operating violations, or renewal denials; $8M-$16M gross exposure

5. **Aggregate financial impact:** $5.2M-$7.0M NPV (5-year weighted exposure), ranking 4th among identified risk categories

6. **Mitigation feasibility:** Unlike federal tax risks (no mitigation available absent rescheduling), local control risks are manageable through proactive compliance, community engagement, and operational best practices

**Recommended Risk Allocation:**

- **Material Location denials:** Closing condition precedent with purchase price adjustment (3× EBITDA) or earnout modification
- **Non-Material denials:** Purchase price reduction ($2M per location)
- **Modified operating conditions:** Purchase price adjustment based on incremental compliance cost (5× multiplier)
- **Post-closing mitigation:** $1.9M annual investment in compliance audits, odor control upgrades, and renewal management systems

**Strategic Implications:**

Local control risk does not constitute a "deal-breaker" but requires (1) extended closing timeline to accommodate 38 local approval processes, (2) purchase price holdback or earnout structure reflecting 7-10% denial probability, and (3) post-closing operational investment to maintain CUPs in good standing across diverse regulatory jurisdictions. The Target's clean compliance record (zero CUP revocations, zero CEQA litigation) provides strong foundation for navigating change-of-control approvals successfully.
