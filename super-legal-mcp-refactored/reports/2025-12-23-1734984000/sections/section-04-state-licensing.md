## IV. STATE LICENSING TRANSFER COORDINATION (8 STATES)

The proposed acquisition of Pacific Cannabis Group requires regulatory approval for the transfer of 72 cannabis licenses across eight states: California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Massachusetts, and Illinois. This approval process constitutes the **critical path to closing**, with aggregate timeline estimates ranging from 9 to 12 months under optimal conditions. Unlike conventional M&A transactions where regulatory approval may be a formality, cannabis licensing transfers involve substantive background investigations, financial source-of-funds scrutiny, and discretionary agency review that can result in license denials and forced divestitures. Each of the 72 licenses represents a separate regulatory proceeding with unique approval criteria, disqualifying factors, and local jurisdiction requirements.

The severity of state licensing risk is **HIGH** because denial of any single license may require divestiture of that facility and license denials are not appealable to federal courts due to Rooker-Feldman doctrine limitations. The probability of material delay (9-12 months) is **CERTAIN**, and the probability of one or more license denials is **MEDIUM** (5-15%), depending on the results of acquirer background investigations. This section analyzes the state-by-state regulatory frameworks, common disqualifying factors, acquirer due diligence requirements, project management strategy, and draft remediation language to mitigate licensing transfer risk.

### A. Overview of Multi-State Licensing Transfer Framework

#### 1. Total Licensing Landscape

Pacific Cannabis Group operates 72 licensed facilities across eight states, distributed as follows:

| State | Total Licenses | Retail | Cultivation | Manufacturing | Distribution | Regulatory Agency |
|-------|---------------|--------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| California | 33 | 18 | 8 | 5 | 2 | Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) |
| Colorado | 14 | 8 | 3 | 3 | 0 | Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED) |
| Oregon | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Oregon Liquor & Cannabis Commission (OLCC) |
| Washington | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | WA Liquor & Cannabis Board (WSLCB) |
| Nevada | 5 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB) |
| Arizona | 4 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Department of Health Services (DHS) |
| Massachusetts | 4 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) |
| Illinois | 5 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | Dept. of Financial & Professional Regulation (IDFPR) |
| **TOTAL** | **72** | **42** | **18** | **10** | **2** | **8 agencies** |

Each license requires a separate change-of-control application and approval. Licenses are **not transferable as property rights**—they are regulatory privileges that must be affirmatively approved by the issuing agency for each new owner or controlling person.¹

#### 2. Legal Framework: Licenses as Regulatory Privileges, Not Property Rights

Cannabis licenses are **regulatory privileges**, not vested property rights, and therefore provide no federal constitutional protection against revocation or transfer denial.² State cannabis licensing statutes uniformly characterize licenses as "privileges" subject to ongoing compliance with all state and local requirements.³ As a result:

- **No Vested Right to Transfer**: Transfer of a cannabis license requires affirmative agency approval; acquirer has no constitutional right to assume seller's license.⁴
- **Agency Discretion**: Licensing agencies possess broad discretion to deny transfers based on "public interest" or "good moral character" standards.⁵
- **Limited Judicial Review**: Agency licensing decisions are reviewed under highly deferential "arbitrary and capricious" standard; agency findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.⁶
- **No Federal Forum**: Rooker-Feldman doctrine bars federal courts from reviewing state licensing decisions; only state appellate courts have jurisdiction.⁷

This legal framework creates **transaction execution risk** distinct from conventional M&A transactions. In a typical acquisition, regulatory approval is a formality absent antitrust concerns or national security issues. In cannabis M&A, licensing approval is **substantive and discretionary**, with agencies conducting independent investigations into acquirer backgrounds, source of funds, and compliance history.

#### 3. Critical Path Analysis: 9-12 Month Timeline

The aggregate timeline to obtain all 72 license approvals ranges from **9 to 12 months** under optimal conditions, assuming parallel processing where permitted and no material delays. The critical path is determined by the slowest states:

**Critical Path States (6-9 months each):**
- **California**: 6-9 months for 33 licenses (largest license portfolio; dual state and local approval required)
- **Massachusetts**: 6-9 months for 4 licenses (historically slowest approval process; frequent requests for additional information)

**Medium Timeline States (4-6 months each):**
- **Colorado**: 4-6 months for 14 licenses (statutory 90-day deadline routinely extended)
- **Nevada**: 4-6 months for 5 licenses (background check threshold ≥5% ownership captures most beneficial owners)
- **Illinois**: 4-6 months for 5 licenses (social equity license residency requirements create complexity)

**Fast-Track States (3-6 months each):**
- **Oregon**: 3-6 months for 4 licenses (statutory 60-day deadline with extensions)
- **Washington**: 3-6 months for 3 licenses (historically faster than statutory 60 days)
- **Arizona**: 3-6 months for 4 licenses (streamlined process for established operators)

**Sequential vs. Parallel Processing**: Most states permit simultaneous filings across jurisdictions, but some states (notably California) require parent company approvals before processing subsidiary license transfers, creating sequential dependencies that extend the aggregate timeline.⁸ Additionally, local jurisdiction approvals in California may be sequential to state approvals, adding 60-90 days to the California timeline.

**Best-Case Scenario**: 9 months (all applications filed simultaneously, no material delays, all agencies meet statutory deadlines).

**Expected Scenario**: 10-11 months (routine requests for additional information, minor delays).

**Worst-Case Scenario**: 12-18 months (multiple requests for additional information, one or more license denials requiring re-application or divestiture).

The state licensing approval timeline exceeds typical M&A closing timelines (90-180 days) and therefore requires **interim operating covenants** to maintain Target operations during the pre-closing period, as well as **outside date provisions** allowing sufficient time for regulatory approval without triggering termination rights.

### B. State-by-State Regulatory Analysis

#### 1. California: MAUCRSA Framework (33 Licenses — Critical Path)

California represents the **largest single licensing challenge** in this transaction, accounting for 33 of 72 total licenses (46%). California's regulatory framework is the most complex of all eight states, requiring both state and local approvals for every license, and imposing the longest approval timelines (6-9 months).

**Statutory Framework**: California's cannabis licensing regime is governed by the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), codified at Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 26000-26231.⁹ MAUCRSA consolidated three previously separate regulatory agencies into the Department of Cannabis Control (DCC), effective January 1, 2021.¹⁰

**Regulatory Agency**: Department of Cannabis Control (DCC), which consolidated the former Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC), CalCannabis (Department of Food and Agriculture), and CDPH Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch.¹¹

**Change of Control Definition**: Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26051.5 defines a "change of ownership" requiring DCC approval to include:
- Transfer of more than **20% of the ownership interest** in a licensed business;
- Merger, consolidation, or reorganization of a licensed business; or
- Transfer of controlling interest in a parent company of a licensed business.¹²

This 20% threshold is **lower** than most other states (which use 10% thresholds), meaning the DCC will require background checks for all Green Horizon Capital Partners fund principals and any limited partners holding >20% fund interests.

**Approval Timeline**: Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26051.5 provides a **90-day statutory deadline** for DCC approval or denial, but this deadline is routinely extended through requests for additional information (RFIs) or "tolling" of the review period pending receipt of additional documentation.¹³ **Typical timeline in practice: 6-9 months** from initial filing to final approval.

**Background Check Requirements**: All new owners or officers holding >20% interests must pass comprehensive background checks, including:
- **Live Scan fingerprinting** and FBI criminal history check;
- **Financial disclosures** including tax returns, bank statements, and source of funds documentation;
- **Attestations regarding criminal history**, prior license revocations, and outstanding tax liabilities; and
- **Personal history questionnaire** detailing residential history, employment history, and business associations.¹⁴

**Disqualifying Factors**: Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26057 provides that the DCC may deny licensure or change of control for any of the following disqualifying factors:
1. **Felony conviction related to controlled substances** within the past 10 years for adult-use licenses (5 years for medical licenses);
2. **Violent felony conviction** (no time limit);
3. **Prior cannabis license revocation** in California or any other jurisdiction;
4. **Outstanding tax liabilities** to the State of California, the IRS, or any other taxing authority;
5. **Failure to disclose ownership interests** or providing false information on the application;
6. **Failure to demonstrate "good moral character"** (undefined standard providing agency discretion).¹⁵

The "good moral character" standard is **deliberately vague** and provides the DCC with broad discretion to deny applications based on non-felony misconduct, including misdemeanor convictions, civil judgments for fraud or misrepresentation, disciplinary actions by professional licensing boards, or "association with disqualified persons."¹⁶

**Local Approval Requirement (Dual Licensing)**: California uniquely requires **both state and local licenses** for every cannabis operation. Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26200 provides that "[a]ny local jurisdiction may establish additional standards, requirements, and regulations" and may "completely prohibit the establishment or operation of" cannabis businesses.¹⁷ As a result:
- Each of PCG's 33 California licenses requires **both DCC approval and local jurisdiction approval** of the change of control;
- Local jurisdictions (cities and counties) may impose **more restrictive** disqualifying factors than the state (e.g., longer lookback periods for criminal convictions, additional financial disclosures, residency requirements);
- Local approval processes are **not uniform**—each city and county has its own application process, fees, and timeline;
- Local approvals may be **sequential** to state approval (some jurisdictions require DCC approval before processing local change-of-control applications), adding 60-90 days to the total timeline.

**PCG California Operations**: Target's 33 California licenses are distributed across 12 local jurisdictions (8 cities and 4 counties). Each jurisdiction will conduct its own review of the change of control, creating **33 separate state proceedings and 33 separate local proceedings**—effectively **66 regulatory approval processes** for the California portfolio alone.

**Local Jurisdiction Risk**: California presents unique risk of **inconsistent outcomes**—it is possible (and has occurred in practice) for the DCC to approve a change of control at the state level while a local jurisdiction denies the corresponding local license, resulting in forced divestiture of that facility. Acquirer must therefore conduct separate due diligence on **each local jurisdiction's ordinances, approval criteria, and political dynamics** to assess denial risk.

**Track-and-Trace Compliance**: California uses the **Metrc** track-and-trace system to monitor all cannabis from seed to sale. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 16, § 5048 requires licensees to tag all plants and products with unique identifiers and report all transfers, sales, and destructions in real-time.¹⁸ During the change-of-control approval period, Target must maintain perfect Metrc compliance; any violations or discrepancies will be cited by the DCC as grounds for delay or denial.

**Risk Assessment — California**:
- **Severity**: HIGH (largest license portfolio; dual state/local approval creates execution risk)
- **Probability of Material Delay (6-9 months)**: 95% (routine in California)
- **Probability of One or More License Denials**: 10-15% (depends on acquirer background screening and local jurisdiction politics)
- **Gross Exposure**: $180M-$280M (California represents approximately 45% of Target enterprise value based on revenue allocation; loss of material California licenses could constitute Material Adverse Effect)

**Mitigation Strategy — California**:
1. **Early Engagement**: Initiate informal meetings with DCC staff and local jurisdiction officials **before** filing formal applications to identify potential issues and negotiate remediation;
2. **Parallel Processing**: File all 33 state applications and all 33 local applications **simultaneously** on the same day to maximize parallel processing;
3. **Regulatory Consultants**: Retain California-licensed regulatory consultants with DCC relationships in **each local jurisdiction** to shepherd applications and respond to RFIs quickly;
4. **Escrow for Local Denials**: Structure purchase agreement with **license-specific indemnification**—if any California license is denied, Seller indemnifies Buyer for the fair market value of that facility, calculated as 2.5x facility EBITDA.

[XREF:CALIFORNIA_LICENSING → LOCAL_ZONING: Local approval requires compliance with zoning ordinances; Target has 4 facilities with pending zoning variance applications that must be resolved before change of control]

#### 2. Colorado: Marijuana Enforcement Division (14 Licenses)

Colorado represents the **second-largest license portfolio** (14 licenses) and benefits from a more streamlined approval process than California, with typical timelines of 4-6 months.

**Statutory Framework**: Colorado's cannabis licensing regime is governed by the Colorado Marijuana Code, codified at C.R.S. §§ 44-10-101 to 44-10-1801 (retail/adult-use marijuana) and C.R.S. §§ 44-11-101 to 44-11-1001 (medical marijuana).¹⁹ Colorado's regulatory framework is considered the most mature in the United States, having implemented adult-use sales in January 2014 (first in the nation).²⁰

**Regulatory Agency**: Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED), part of the Colorado Department of Revenue.²¹

**Change of Control Definition**: C.R.S. § 44-10-501 defines a change of control requiring MED approval to include:
- Transfer of ownership interest in a licensed entity;
- Change in controlling beneficial owner (defined as person with **10% or more** direct or indirect ownership);
- Transfer of stock or membership interests in licensed entity; or
- Merger or consolidation.²²

Colorado's 10% threshold means fewer beneficial owners will require background checks compared to California's 20% threshold, but still captures all Green Horizon Capital Partners fund principals.

**Approval Timeline**: C.R.S. § 44-10-501 provides a **90-day statutory deadline** for MED approval or denial, subject to extension.²³ **Typical timeline in practice: 4-6 months** (faster than California due to MED's efficiency and lack of local approval requirement for change of control).

**Background Check Requirements**: All new owners with 10%+ ownership interest must pass background checks, including:
- **Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) fingerprint-based criminal history check**;
- **FBI criminal history check**;
- **Financial disclosures** (source of funds, tax returns, bank statements);
- **Attestations regarding criminal history, residency, and tax compliance**.²⁴

**Residency Requirement (Eliminated)**: Colorado initially required all marijuana license owners to be Colorado residents for 2 years prior to application. This requirement was **eliminated in 2017**, opening Colorado cannabis licenses to out-of-state investors.²⁵ Green Horizon Capital Partners' non-Colorado residency is therefore **not disqualifying**.

**Disqualifying Factors**: C.R.S. § 44-10-306 provides that the MED shall deny a license or change-of-control application if the applicant:
1. Has been convicted of a **felony drug offense** (no time limit specified; MED has discretion to consider older convictions);
2. Has been convicted of any **felony involving fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation** within the past 5 years;
3. Has had a **prior marijuana license revoked** for cause;
4. Has **outstanding tax liabilities** (state or federal);
5. Fails to demonstrate **"good moral character"** (undefined standard).²⁶

Colorado's "good moral character" standard is applied more leniently than California's, with the MED historically approving applicants with older (10+ years) non-violent felony convictions and misdemeanor records. However, any felony involving **dishonesty or financial crimes** within 5 years is an absolute bar.

**Local Approval Requirement**: Unlike California, Colorado **does not require local approval of change-of-control applications** at the state level. However, local jurisdictions retain the authority to ban cannabis establishments entirely or limit the number of licenses. C.R.S. § 44-10-103(3).²⁷ PCG's 14 Colorado licenses operate in 6 local jurisdictions, all of which currently permit cannabis operations. **Risk of local ban or restriction is low** but should be monitored for changes in local political dynamics (e.g., ballot initiatives to ban cannabis in specific cities).

**Vertical Integration**: Colorado initially prohibited vertical integration (ownership of multiple license types by the same entity). This restriction has been **eliminated**, and licensees may now hold multiple license types (retail, cultivation, manufacturing) subject to local approval.²⁸ PCG's 14 Colorado licenses include 8 retail, 3 cultivation, and 3 manufacturing licenses, all under common ownership. This structure is permissible and will not require divestiture post-acquisition.

**Track-and-Trace Compliance**: Colorado uses the **Metrc** system for seed-to-sale tracking. 1 CCR 212-3.²⁹ As with California, Target must maintain perfect Metrc compliance during the change-of-control approval period to avoid grounds for denial.

**Risk Assessment — Colorado**:
- **Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH (second-largest license portfolio; loss of Colorado licenses could affect valuation)
- **Probability of Material Delay (4-6 months)**: 85% (routine for multi-license transfers)
- **Probability of One or More License Denials**: 5-10% (lower than California; MED is more predictable and efficient)
- **Gross Exposure**: $70M-$110M (Colorado represents approximately 18% of Target enterprise value)

**Mitigation Strategy — Colorado**:
1. **Batch Filing**: File all 14 applications simultaneously in a single batch to streamline MED review;
2. **Pre-Filing Background Checks**: Conduct private background checks on all Green Horizon principals **before** filing to identify and remediate any disqualifying factors;
3. **MED Engagement**: Retain Colorado regulatory counsel with MED relationships to facilitate expedited review.

#### 3. Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona (16 Licenses — Fast-Track States)

These four states collectively account for 16 licenses and have the **shortest approval timelines** (3-6 months). Each state's framework is summarized below.

##### Oregon (4 Licenses — OLCC)

**Statutory Framework**: ORS Chapter 475C (Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission).³⁰

**Regulatory Agency**: Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC).³¹

**Change of Control Trigger**: Transfer of ownership interest; controlling person threshold is **>10% ownership**. ORS 475C.097.³²

**Approval Timeline**: Statutory deadline is **60 days**, with extensions permitted. **Typical timeline: 3-6 months**.³³

**Background Checks**: All new owners with >10% interest must pass criminal history checks.

**Disqualifying Factors**:
- Felony drug conviction (within 5 years);
- Violent felony conviction;
- Prior license revocation;
- Outstanding tax liabilities.³⁴

**Risk Assessment**: **Severity: LOW-MEDIUM** | **Denial Probability: <5%** | **Exposure: $15M-$25M** (4 licenses represent ~5% of enterprise value).

##### Washington (3 Licenses — WSLCB)

**Statutory Framework**: RCW 69.50 (Uniform Controlled Substances Act, as amended by Initiative 502).³⁵

**Regulatory Agency**: Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB).³⁶

**Change of Control Trigger**: Transfer of ownership interest; controlling person threshold is **≥10% ownership**. RCW 69.50.331.³⁷

**Approval Timeline**: Statutory deadline is **60 days**, with extensions permitted. **Typical timeline: 3-6 months**.³⁸

**Background Checks**: All new owners with ≥10% interest must pass criminal history checks.

**Disqualifying Factors**:
- Felony drug conviction (within 5 years);
- Violent felony conviction;
- Prior license revocation;
- Outstanding tax liabilities;
- Failure to demonstrate "good moral character."³⁹

**Risk Assessment**: **Severity: LOW** | **Denial Probability: <5%** | **Exposure: $10M-$20M** (3 licenses represent ~4% of enterprise value).

##### Nevada (5 Licenses — CCB)

**Statutory Framework**: NRS Chapters 453A (medical marijuana) and 453D (adult-use cannabis).⁴⁰

**Regulatory Agency**: Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB).⁴¹

**Change of Control Trigger**: Transfer of ownership interest; controlling person threshold is **≥5% ownership** (lowest threshold among all 8 states). NRS 453D.200.⁴²

**Approval Timeline**: Statutory deadline is **90 days**, with extensions permitted. **Typical timeline: 4-6 months**.⁴³

**Background Checks**: All new owners with ≥5% interest must pass criminal history checks. Nevada's 5% threshold captures **more beneficial owners** than any other state and may require background checks for **all Green Horizon limited partners** holding ≥5% fund interests.

**Disqualifying Factors**:
- Felony conviction (within 10 years);
- Prior license revocation;
- Outstanding tax liabilities;
- Association with organized crime (Nevada retains legacy anti-mob provisions from casino gaming regulation).⁴⁴

**Risk Assessment**: **Severity: MEDIUM** | **Denial Probability: 5-10%** | **Exposure: $20M-$35M** (5 licenses represent ~6% of enterprise value). Nevada's 5% ownership threshold creates **higher background check risk** than other states.

##### Arizona (4 Licenses — DHS)

**Statutory Framework**: A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 28.2 (Arizona Medical Marijuana Act) and Proposition 207 (Smart and Safe Arizona Act, adult-use).⁴⁵

**Regulatory Agency**: Arizona Department of Health Services (DHS).⁴⁶

**Change of Control Trigger**: Transfer of ownership interest; controlling person threshold is **≥10% ownership**. A.R.S. § 36-2857.⁴⁷

**Approval Timeline**: Statutory deadline is **90 days**, with extensions permitted. **Typical timeline: 3-6 months**.⁴⁸

**Background Checks**: All new owners with ≥10% interest must pass criminal history checks.

**Disqualifying Factors**:
- Felony drug conviction (within 10 years);
- Violent felony conviction;
- Prior license revocation;
- Outstanding tax liabilities.⁴⁹

**Risk Assessment**: **Severity: LOW-MEDIUM** | **Denial Probability: <5%** | **Exposure: $15M-$25M** (4 licenses represent ~5% of enterprise value).

#### 4. Massachusetts: Cannabis Control Commission (4 Licenses — Critical Path)

Massachusetts has the **slowest approval process** after California, with typical timelines of 6-9 months. Massachusetts is unique in requiring **community outreach** and prioritizing **social equity applicants**.

**Statutory Framework**: M.G.L. c. 94G (Regulation of the Use and Distribution of Marijuana Not Medically Prescribed).⁵⁰

**Regulatory Agency**: Cannabis Control Commission (CCC).⁵¹

**Change of Control Trigger**: Transfer of ownership interest; controlling person threshold is **>10% ownership**. 935 CMR 500.105.⁵²

**Approval Timeline**: Statutory deadline is **90 days**, but the CCC routinely issues **extensive requests for additional information (RFIs)** that toll the review period. **Typical timeline in practice: 6-9 months** (among the slowest of all 8 states).⁵³

**Background Checks**: All new owners with >10% interest must pass criminal history checks, including:
- **Massachusetts CORI (Criminal Offender Record Information) check**;
- **FBI criminal history check**;
- **Financial disclosures** (source of funds, tax returns);
- **Personal interview** with CCC staff (Massachusetts is the only state that routinely conducts in-person interviews).⁵⁴

**Social Equity Priority**: Massachusetts law prioritizes **social equity applicants**—individuals from communities disproportionately harmed by prior marijuana prohibition enforcement. The CCC reviews change-of-control applications to ensure the acquirer demonstrates a "commitment to social equity" and does not displace existing social equity license holders.⁵⁵ This creates **additional scrutiny** for private equity acquirers.

**Disqualifying Factors**: 935 CMR 500.105 provides that the CCC may deny a change-of-control application for:
1. Felony drug conviction (within 10 years);
2. Violent felony conviction;
3. Prior license revocation;
4. Outstanding tax liabilities;
5. Failure to demonstrate "good moral character";
6. **Failure to demonstrate commitment to social equity** (unique to Massachusetts).⁵⁶

**Community Outreach Requirement**: Massachusetts requires licensees to conduct **community outreach meetings** and demonstrate community support before obtaining initial licenses. Change-of-control applications may trigger **renewed community outreach obligations** depending on CCC discretion.⁵⁷

**Risk Assessment — Massachusetts**:
- **Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH (slowest approval process; social equity scrutiny creates private equity risk)
- **Probability of Material Delay (6-9 months)**: 90% (routine in Massachusetts)
- **Probability of One or More License Denials**: 10-15% (highest among fast-track states; CCC scrutinizes private equity heavily)
- **Gross Exposure**: $15M-$30M (4 licenses represent ~5% of enterprise value, but denial risk is higher than other small-portfolio states)

**Mitigation Strategy — Massachusetts**:
1. **Social Equity Plan**: Include detailed social equity commitments in change-of-control application (e.g., hiring from disproportionately impacted communities, supporting local social equity applicants);
2. **Community Outreach**: Conduct voluntary community outreach meetings in each municipality to preempt CCC concerns;
3. **CCC Engagement**: Retain Massachusetts regulatory counsel with CCC relationships and social equity expertise.

#### 5. Illinois: Social Equity and Residency Requirements (5 Licenses — Unique Complexity)

Illinois presents **unique legal complexity** due to social equity license residency requirements that may create structural barriers for out-of-state private equity acquirers.

**Statutory Framework**: 410 ILCS 705 (Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act).⁵⁸

**Regulatory Agency**: Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR).⁵⁹

**Change of Control Trigger**: Transfer of ownership interest; controlling person threshold is **≥5% ownership** (tied with Nevada for lowest threshold). 410 ILCS 705/15-30.⁶⁰

**Approval Timeline**: Statutory deadline is **90 days**, with extensions permitted. **Typical timeline: 4-6 months**.⁶¹

**Background Checks**: All new owners with ≥5% interest must pass criminal history checks.

**Social Equity License Residency Requirement (CRITICAL ISSUE)**: Illinois law creates two classes of cannabis licenses:
1. **General licenses**: No residency requirement (available to any qualified applicant);
2. **Social Equity licenses**: Require **51% Illinois resident ownership** to qualify for social equity benefits (reduced application fees, technical assistance, low-interest loans).⁶²

If any of PCG's 5 Illinois licenses are **social equity licenses**, the change of control to Green Horizon Capital Partners (a non-Illinois entity) may trigger **loss of social equity status** and require:
- Re-application as a general license (subject to higher fees and fewer licenses available);
- Divestiture to an Illinois-resident buyer; or
- Restructuring to ensure 51% Illinois resident ownership (potentially requiring Green Horizon to bring in an Illinois-based co-investor as majority owner).

**Due Diligence Required**: Acquirer must **immediately determine** whether any of PCG's 5 Illinois licenses are social equity licenses. This information is not public and must be obtained from Target. If any Illinois licenses are social equity licenses, Acquirer faces a binary choice:
- **Option A (Divestiture)**: Divest social equity licenses to an Illinois-resident buyer before closing;
- **Option B (Restructuring)**: Restructure ownership to include 51% Illinois-resident ownership (e.g., Green Horizon acquires 49%, Illinois-based co-investor acquires 51%);
- **Option C (General License Conversion)**: Convert social equity licenses to general licenses (may be prohibited by IDFPR regulations; requires legal analysis).

**Disqualifying Factors**: 410 ILCS 705/15-30 provides that IDFPR may deny a change-of-control application for:
1. Felony drug conviction (within 10 years);
2. Violent felony conviction;
3. Prior license revocation;
4. Outstanding tax liabilities;
5. Failure to demonstrate "good moral character";
6. **Loss of social equity qualifications** (if applicable).⁶³

**Risk Assessment — Illinois**:
- **Severity**: HIGH (if any licenses are social equity licenses; otherwise MEDIUM)
- **Probability of Material Delay (4-6 months)**: 80%
- **Probability of License Denial or Required Divestiture**: **50-75% if social equity licenses** (residency requirement creates structural barrier); **<5% if general licenses**
- **Gross Exposure**: $20M-$40M (5 licenses represent ~6% of enterprise value, but forced divestiture at distressed prices could double exposure)

**Mitigation Strategy — Illinois**:
1. **Immediate Due Diligence**: Obtain from Target **within 5 business days** documentation showing which (if any) Illinois licenses are social equity licenses;
2. **Pre-Closing Restructuring**: If any licenses are social equity licenses, either (a) divest to Illinois-resident buyer, or (b) restructure transaction to bring in 51% Illinois-resident co-investor;
3. **Purchase Price Adjustment**: If Illinois licenses must be divested, reduce purchase price by fair market value of divested licenses (2.5x facility EBITDA).

[XREF:ILLINOIS_SOCIAL_EQUITY → VALUATION: Illinois social equity license divestiture risk may require 5-10% purchase price reduction if restructuring not feasible]

### C. Common Disqualifying Factors Across All 8 States

While each state's licensing statute contains unique disqualifying factors, seven categories of disqualifiers appear across most or all eight states. Acquirer background screening must focus on these seven categories to assess denial risk.

#### 1. Cannabis-Related Felony Convictions

**Disqualification Standard**: All eight states disqualify applicants with felony convictions related to controlled substances, with lookback periods ranging from 5 to 10 years (or no limit in some states).⁶⁴

**Rationale**: States prohibit individuals with recent drug trafficking convictions from holding cannabis licenses to prevent diversion to illicit markets and ensure licensees have a history of legal business operations.

**Variation by State**:
- **California**: 10 years for adult-use licenses; 5 years for medical licenses;⁶⁵
- **Colorado**: No time limit specified; MED has discretion to consider older convictions;⁶⁶
- **Nevada**: 10 years;⁶⁷
- **Illinois**: 10 years;⁶⁸
- **Other states**: 5-10 years (varies).

**Application to Transaction**: Green Horizon Capital Partners must conduct **criminal background checks** on all fund principals and limited partners holding ownership interests above the applicable state thresholds (ranging from 5% to 20%). Any principal or LP with a felony drug conviction within the applicable lookback period **cannot hold ownership interests** in the acquiring entity for that state and must divest or be excluded from the ownership structure.

**Mitigation**: If any principal or LP has a disqualifying drug conviction:
- **Option A (Exclusion)**: Structure transaction so that individual does not hold ownership interest in acquiring entity for that state (e.g., use state-specific holding companies with different ownership);
- **Option B (Divestiture)**: Require individual to divest fund interest before acquisition closes;
- **Option C (Waiver)**: In some states (Colorado, Oregon), agencies have discretion to grant waivers for older convictions or convictions that occurred before state legalization; pursue waiver if feasible.

#### 2. Violent Felony Convictions

**Disqualification Standard**: All eight states disqualify applicants with violent felony convictions, typically with **no time limit** or longer lookback periods (15+ years).⁶⁹

**Rationale**: States prohibit individuals with violent criminal histories from holding cannabis licenses to protect public safety and prevent criminal enterprises from entering the legal cannabis market.

**Examples of Violent Felonies** (for screening purposes):
- Murder, manslaughter, assault with deadly weapon;
- Robbery, armed robbery, burglary;
- Rape, sexual assault, domestic violence;
- Kidnapping, arson.

**Application to Transaction**: Any Green Horizon principal or LP with a violent felony conviction is **absolutely disqualified** in all eight states. No waivers are available. Individual must be excluded from ownership structure.

#### 3. Financial Crimes (Fraud, Embezzlement, Money Laundering)

**Disqualification Standard**: All eight states disqualify applicants with felony convictions involving fraud, deceit, embezzlement, money laundering, or other financial crimes, typically with lookback periods of 5-10 years.⁷⁰

**Rationale**: Cannabis is a cash-intensive business with significant money laundering and tax evasion risk. States require licensees to have clean financial histories to ensure tax compliance and prevent illicit financial flows.

**Examples of Financial Crimes** (for screening purposes):
- Securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud;
- Embezzlement, theft by conversion;
- Money laundering (18 U.S.C. § 1956-1957);
- Tax evasion (26 U.S.C. § 7201);
- False statements to banks (18 U.S.C. § 1014).

**Application to Transaction**: Any Green Horizon principal or LP with a financial crime conviction within 5-10 years is disqualified in most states. Colorado's 5-year lookback period for financial crimes is the **shortest**; older convictions may not be disqualifying in Colorado but remain disqualifying in California and other states.⁷¹

**Special Risk — Securities Fraud**: Private equity fund principals may have exposure to SEC enforcement actions or securities fraud allegations arising from prior fund operations. Any **admitted** or **adjudicated** securities fraud (civil or criminal) within 10 years is likely disqualifying in all states. **Settled-without-admission** SEC cases may not be disqualifying but will trigger additional scrutiny.

#### 4. Prior Cannabis License Revocations

**Disqualification Standard**: All eight states disqualify applicants who have had a cannabis license revoked **in any jurisdiction** for cause (i.e., for regulatory violations, not voluntary surrender).⁷²

**Rationale**: Prior license revocation demonstrates inability to comply with cannabis regulations and is an absolute bar to licensure in all states.

**Application to Transaction**: Green Horizon must confirm that **no principal, LP, or fund portfolio company** has ever had a cannabis license revoked in any U.S. state or Canadian province. License revocations are **public records** in most jurisdictions and are discoverable through regulatory agency searches.

**Mitigation**: If any principal or fund has a prior license revocation, that individual or entity must be **excluded from ownership structure** (no waivers available).

#### 5. Outstanding Tax Liabilities

**Disqualification Standard**: All eight states disqualify applicants with outstanding tax liabilities (federal or state), defined as unpaid taxes for which no payment plan is in effect.⁷³

**Rationale**: Cannabis is subject to high effective tax rates (due to Section 280E at federal level and state/local cannabis excise taxes). States require licensees to demonstrate tax compliance to ensure revenue collection.

**Application to Transaction**: Green Horizon and all principals/LPs must demonstrate **tax compliance** through:
- **IRS tax clearance letters** (confirming no outstanding federal tax liabilities);
- **State tax clearance letters** for each of the 8 states (confirming no outstanding state tax liabilities);
- **Attestations** that all taxes are current or subject to approved payment plans.

**Special Issue — Section 280E Deficiencies**: Target (PCG) may have **outstanding IRS deficiencies** from Section 280E audits of prior tax years. If PCG has unpaid IRS deficiencies, this could be **imputed to Acquirer** as an indicator of poor tax compliance. Acquirer must confirm that:
- All Target IRS deficiencies are either (a) fully paid, (b) under appeal, or (c) subject to approved IRS payment plan;
- Acquirer will not assume liability for Target's pre-closing tax liabilities (structure as asset purchase or obtain full indemnification).

[XREF:TAX_LIABILITIES → SECTION_280E: Target IRS audit exposure ($7.2M) must be resolved or placed in escrow before state licensing applications filed]

#### 6. Association with Disqualified Persons

**Disqualification Standard**: Most states (6 of 8) include "association with disqualified persons" as a grounds for denial, prohibiting applicants from holding ownership interests if they have business or personal relationships with individuals who would themselves be disqualified.⁷⁴

**Rationale**: Prevents disqualified individuals from exercising indirect control over cannabis businesses through front persons or straw owners.

**Examples of Disqualifying Associations**:
- **Business partnership** with disqualified person (e.g., serving on board of directors with individual who has violent felony conviction);
- **Family relationship** (spouse, parent, child) with disqualified person who has financial interest in the business;
- **Prior employment** by or with disqualified person in cannabis industry.

**Application to Transaction**: This is the **most subjective and unpredictable** disqualifying factor. Licensing agencies have broad discretion to determine what constitutes a disqualifying "association." Risk areas include:
- **Green Horizon portfolio companies**: If Green Horizon owns other cannabis businesses, and any principal of those businesses is disqualified, agencies may find a disqualifying association;
- **Prior investments**: If any Green Horizon principal previously invested in a cannabis business that had its license revoked, agencies may find a disqualifying association;
- **Family relationships**: If any Green Horizon principal has a spouse or close family member with a disqualifying conviction, agencies may require that individual to divest fund interest.

**Mitigation**: Disclosure is critical. Green Horizon must **proactively disclose** all business and personal relationships with individuals who may be disqualified and provide explanations for why those relationships do not create control or influence over the licensed business.

#### 7. Good Moral Character (Undefined Catch-All Standard)

**Disqualification Standard**: All eight states include a "good moral character" requirement, typically undefined and providing agencies with broad discretion to deny applications based on conduct that does not constitute a criminal conviction.⁷⁵

**Rationale**: Provides agencies with residual authority to deny applications for individuals who do not meet criminal disqualification criteria but nonetheless raise regulatory concerns (e.g., history of civil fraud, professional license suspensions, bankruptcy fraud).

**Examples of "Good Moral Character" Denials in Practice** (based on published agency decisions):
- **Misdemeanor convictions**: DUI, domestic violence, assault;
- **Civil fraud judgments**: Securities fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, fraudulent misrepresentation;
- **Professional license suspensions**: Attorney disbarment, CPA license revocation, medical license suspension;
- **Bankruptcy fraud**: False statements in bankruptcy proceedings, fraudulent transfers;
- **Landlord-tenant violations**: Repeated housing code violations, illegal evictions.⁷⁶

**Application to Transaction**: "Good moral character" is the **most dangerous** disqualifying factor because it is **undefined** and provides agencies with **unchecked discretion**. Green Horizon must conduct **comprehensive due diligence** on all principals and LPs, including:
- **Civil litigation history** (search PACER for federal civil cases);
- **Professional licensing history** (check bar admissions, CPA licenses, medical licenses);
- **Bankruptcy history** (search PACER for bankruptcy filings);
- **Media searches** (LexisNexis, Google News) to identify reputational issues.

Any adverse finding—even if not a criminal conviction—should be **proactively disclosed** in licensing applications with mitigating explanations.

### D. Acquirer Background Screening Requirements

The acquisition is structured as a purchase by **Green Horizon Capital Partners**, a private equity fund. State licensing agencies will require background checks on **all fund principals and beneficial owners** holding ownership interests above the applicable state thresholds.

#### 1. Fund Structure and Control Person Identification

Typical private equity fund structures involve:
- **General Partner (GP)**: Exercises day-to-day control over fund operations and investments; typically owns 1-2% of fund equity but controls 100% of voting power;
- **Limited Partners (LPs)**: Provide capital but have no control rights; typically own 98-99% of fund equity but zero voting power;
- **Management Company**: Employs fund professionals (investment managers, analysts); typically owned by GP or senior fund principals.

**Control Person Analysis**: State licensing agencies use different standards to determine which individuals require background checks:
- **De Jure Control** (voting power): Individuals with voting control over the acquiring entity (GP and senior GP principals) always require background checks in all states;
- **De Facto Control** (economic interest): Individuals with large economic interests but no voting power (LPs) may require background checks if their ownership percentage exceeds the state's threshold (5%-20% depending on state).

**State Thresholds for LP Background Checks**:

| State | Threshold | LPs Requiring Background Checks |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Nevada | ≥5% ownership | All LPs holding ≥5% of fund |
| Illinois | ≥5% ownership | All LPs holding ≥5% of fund |
| Colorado | ≥10% ownership | All LPs holding ≥10% of fund |
| Oregon | >10% ownership | All LPs holding >10% of fund |
| Washington | ≥10% ownership | All LPs holding ≥10% of fund |
| Arizona | ≥10% ownership | All LPs holding ≥10% of fund |
| Massachusetts | >10% ownership | All LPs holding >10% of fund |
| California | >20% ownership | All LPs holding >20% of fund |

**Practical Implication**: If Green Horizon has **any LP holding ≥5% of the fund**, that LP will require background checks in Nevada and Illinois. If Green Horizon has institutional LPs (pension funds, endowments, insurance companies) holding large stakes, those institutions may require **institutional background checks** (including background checks on the institution's senior executives and board members), creating significant complexity.

**Mitigation**: Green Horizon should **restructure fund ownership** before filing licensing applications to ensure no LP holds ≥5% ownership (or accept that LPs holding ≥5% will require background checks).

#### 2. Required Background Check Documentation (All 8 States)

Each of the 8 states will require the following documentation for all control persons and beneficial owners above the threshold:

**Personal Information**:
- Full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number;
- Residential address history (10 years);
- Employment history (10 years);
- Educational background (degrees, certifications).

**Criminal History**:
- **Live Scan fingerprinting** (California, Colorado) or equivalent fingerprint-based criminal history check;
- **FBI criminal history check** (all states);
- **State criminal history check** for each state of residence (past 10 years);
- **Attestations** regarding criminal convictions (felonies and misdemeanors), including convictions that have been expunged or sealed (some states require disclosure even if expunged).

**Financial Disclosures**:
- **Personal tax returns** (3-5 years, depending on state);
- **Personal financial statement** (assets, liabilities, net worth);
- **Source of funds documentation** for investment in Green Horizon (bank statements, brokerage statements, loan documents);
- **Business tax returns** for any business entities controlled by individual (3 years).

**Regulatory and Litigation History**:
- **Professional licenses** held (attorney, CPA, medical, real estate);
- **Civil litigation history** (plaintiff or defendant in past 10 years);
- **Bankruptcy history** (personal or business bankruptcies in past 10 years);
- **Regulatory actions** (SEC, FINRA, state securities regulators, professional licensing boards).

**Attestations and Certifications**:
- Attestation that individual has **not been convicted** of disqualifying offenses;
- Attestation that individual has **no outstanding tax liabilities**;
- Attestation that individual has **not had a cannabis license revoked**;
- Attestation that individual is **not associated with disqualified persons**;
- Certification that all information provided is **true and accurate** (subject to perjury).

**Timeline for Document Collection**: Assembling the required background check documentation for all control persons and beneficial owners typically requires **60-90 days** and should be completed **before** filing licensing applications to avoid delays.

#### 3. Private Background Investigation (Recommended Pre-Filing)

In addition to the background checks conducted by state licensing agencies, Acquirer should conduct **private background investigations** on all Green Horizon principals and LPs holding ≥5% ownership **before** filing licensing applications. This allows Acquirer to identify and remediate disqualifying factors before agencies discover them.

**Scope of Private Investigation**:
- **Criminal records search**: Federal, state, and county criminal records in all jurisdictions where individual has resided (past 10 years);
- **Civil litigation search**: PACER (federal courts) and state court dockets for all civil cases (past 10 years);
- **Bankruptcy search**: PACER bankruptcy filings (past 10 years);
- **Professional licensing search**: State bar, CPA board, medical board records;
- **Media search**: LexisNexis, Google News, social media (identify reputational issues);
- **Corporate records search**: Secretary of State filings for all business entities controlled by individual (identify prior cannabis businesses, license revocations).

**Cost**: Private background investigations typically cost **$5,000-$15,000 per individual**, depending on scope and number of jurisdictions searched. For Green Horizon with 10-15 principals/LPs requiring background checks, total cost is approximately **$75,000-$150,000**.

**Value**: Private investigations allow Acquirer to **identify disqualifying factors before agencies do**, creating opportunity to:
- **Restructure ownership** to exclude disqualified individuals;
- **Prepare mitigating explanations** for disclosed issues;
- **Withdraw applications** before denial (avoiding public record of denial that would be disqualifying in other states).

**Recommendation**: Conduct private background investigations on all Green Horizon principals and LPs holding ≥5% ownership **immediately** (within 30 days of LOI execution).

### E. Project Management Strategy for 72-License Approval Process

Managing the approval process for 72 licenses across 8 states requires sophisticated project management, regulatory expertise in each state, and real-time tracking of application status.

#### 1. Centralized Regulatory Coordination Team

**Structure**: Establish a centralized regulatory coordination team reporting to transaction counsel, consisting of:
- **National Regulatory Coordinator** (single point of contact for all 8 states);
- **State-Specific Regulatory Consultants** (one consultant per state, with local agency relationships);
- **Application Manager** (tracks all 72 applications, deadlines, RFIs, and approvals);
- **Background Check Coordinator** (collects and organizes all background check documentation for principals/LPs).

**Roles and Responsibilities**:

| Role | Responsibilities | Estimated Cost |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| National Regulatory Coordinator | Overall strategy, timeline management, escalation of issues | $150K-$200K (12 months) |
| CA Regulatory Consultant | 33 California applications (state + local) | $150K-$250K |
| CO Regulatory Consultant | 14 Colorado applications | $50K-$75K |
| MA Regulatory Consultant | 4 Massachusetts applications | $40K-$60K |
| OR/WA/NV/AZ/IL Consultants | 21 applications across 5 states | $80K-$120K (total) |
| Application Manager | Software, tracking, reporting | $30K-$50K |
| Background Check Coordinator | Document collection, organization | $40K-$60K |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED COST** | | **$540K-$815K** |

This estimated cost range aligns with the briefing guidance of **$500K-$1M** in application fees and consultant costs.

#### 2. Parallel vs. Sequential Filing Strategy

**Parallel Filing (Preferred)**: File all 72 applications **simultaneously** in all 8 states on the same day to maximize parallel processing and minimize aggregate timeline.

**Advantages**:
- **Shortest aggregate timeline**: All states process in parallel; total time = slowest state (California/Massachusetts, 6-9 months);
- **Reduced carrying costs**: Shorter timeline reduces Target's pre-closing operating costs and Acquirer's opportunity cost of capital;
- **Single background check package**: Use same background check documentation for all 8 states (minor state-specific variations).

**Disadvantages**:
- **Higher upfront cost**: All application fees ($150K-$250K) and consultant retainers ($400K-$600K) paid upfront;
- **Risk of sequential agency requests**: If California requires additional documentation, other states may wait for California's resolution before proceeding, converting parallel processing to sequential processing;
- **Higher denial risk**: If one state denies, that denial becomes public record and may influence other states' decisions.

**Sequential Filing (Alternative)**: File applications in stages, beginning with fastest states (OR, WA, AZ) and progressing to slowest states (CA, MA).

**Advantages**:
- **Lower upfront cost**: Application fees and consultant costs spread over 12-18 months;
- **Learning curve**: Early-state approvals create precedent and template for later-state applications;
- **Reduced denial risk**: If early state denies, Acquirer can remediate issue before filing in remaining states.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Longer aggregate timeline**: Sequential processing extends total timeline to **15-18 months** (sum of all states, not parallel maximum);
- **Higher carrying costs**: Extended timeline increases Target's pre-closing operating costs and Acquirer's opportunity cost of capital;
- **Separate background checks**: Some states may require updated background checks if filing occurs >6 months after initial background check, requiring duplicate document collection.

**Recommendation**: Use **parallel filing strategy** for all 72 applications. The advantages of shorter aggregate timeline (9-12 months) and reduced carrying costs outweigh the disadvantages of higher upfront cost and denial risk. Denial risk can be mitigated through comprehensive private background investigations (see Section D.3 above).

#### 3. Application Timeline and Milestone Tracking

**Key Milestones**:

| Milestone | Target Date | Responsible Party | Deliverables |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **1. LOI Execution** | Day 0 (Assumed: Jan 1, 2026) | Transaction counsel | Signed LOI |
| **2. Private Background Investigations** | Day 30 | Background check coordinator | Background reports on all principals/LPs |
| **3. Background Check Document Collection** | Day 90 | Background check coordinator | Complete background packages for all control persons |
| **4. Definitive Agreement Execution** | Day 90 | Transaction counsel | Signed SPA with regulatory conditions precedent |
| **5. Simultaneous Filing (All 8 States)** | Day 120 | State regulatory consultants | 72 applications filed in 8 states |
| **6. First RFI Responses** | Day 150 | State regulatory consultants | Responses to initial agency RFIs |
| **7. OR/WA/AZ Approvals (Fast-Track)** | Day 240 (Month 8) | OR/WA/AZ consultants | 11 licenses approved |
| **8. CO/NV/IL Approvals (Medium Timeline)** | Day 270 (Month 9) | CO/NV/IL consultants | 24 licenses approved |
| **9. CA/MA Approvals (Critical Path)** | Day 330 (Month 11) | CA/MA consultants | 37 licenses approved |
| **10. Closing** | Day 360 (Month 12) | Transaction counsel | All 72 licenses approved; closing occurs |

**Contingency Buffer**: Add **60-day buffer** to critical path (California/Massachusetts) to account for unanticipated delays. Recommended **outside date**: 14 months from signing (Month 14).

#### 4. Request for Information (RFI) Management

State licensing agencies routinely issue **Requests for Additional Information (RFIs)** during the application review process, tolling the statutory approval deadline until the applicant responds. RFIs are the **primary cause of delay** beyond statutory deadlines.

**Common RFI Topics**:
- **Source of funds**: Agencies request additional documentation proving the source of funds for the acquisition (bank statements, loan documents, investor commitment letters);
- **Criminal history clarifications**: Agencies request explanations for disclosed criminal convictions (arrest reports, court dockets, sentencing documents);
- **Business relationships**: Agencies request documentation of business relationships with other cannabis businesses or individuals (contracts, board minutes, ownership charts);
- **Financial statements**: Agencies request audited financial statements or tax returns for entities not originally submitted;
- **Local approvals**: California agencies request proof that local jurisdiction approval is pending or has been obtained.

**RFI Response Timeline**: Most states require responses within **10-30 business days** of RFI issuance. Failure to respond timely results in application denial.

**RFI Management Strategy**:
- **Pre-Emption**: Anticipate common RFI topics and include responsive documentation in initial application to reduce RFI frequency;
- **Rapid Response Team**: Designate single point of contact (Application Manager) to receive RFIs and coordinate responses within 5 business days;
- **Document Repository**: Maintain centralized repository of all background check documents, financial documents, and legal documents accessible to all state consultants for rapid RFI response.

---

### F. Risk Assessment and Quantified Exposures

The state licensing transfer process presents multiple risk categories with quantified financial exposures.

#### 1. Timeline Delay Risk (Certain)

**Risk Description**: Material delay beyond anticipated 6-9 month closing timeline.

**Severity**: MEDIUM (does not kill deal but increases carrying costs and opportunity cost of capital).

**Probability**: **95%** (regulatory approval delays are routine in cannabis M&A).

**Gross Exposure**:
- **Carrying costs**: $3.5M per month (Target operating expenses, debt service, Acquirer advisory fees);
- **3-month delay**: $10.5M additional carrying costs;
- **6-month delay**: $21M additional carrying costs.

**Mitigation**:
- **Outside date extension**: Include provision allowing outside date extension if regulatory approvals are pending and parties are proceeding in good faith;
- **Interim operating covenants**: Require Target to maintain operations in ordinary course, maintain license compliance, and avoid material changes during pre-closing period;
- **Regulatory hell clause**: Allow either party to terminate if regulatory approvals not obtained within 18 months despite good faith efforts (with breakup fee to compensate Acquirer for sunk costs).

#### 2. Individual License Denial Risk (Medium Probability)

**Risk Description**: One or more of the 72 licenses is denied, requiring divestiture of that facility.

**Severity**: HIGH (individual license denials reduce enterprise value and may trigger Material Adverse Effect if material).

**Probability**: **10-15%** (one or more licenses denied), based on:
- California risk: 10-15% (highest risk due to local jurisdiction unpredictability);
- Massachusetts risk: 10-15% (social equity scrutiny);
- Illinois risk: 50-75% if social equity licenses (residency requirement); <5% if general licenses;
- All other states: <5% (routine approvals for qualified applicants).

**Gross Exposure** (by facility type):

| Facility Type | Average EBITDA | Valuation Multiple | Per-Facility Exposure |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| High-volume retail dispensary | $1.5M | 8-10x | $12M-$15M |
| Low-volume retail dispensary | $500K | 6-8x | $3M-$4M |
| Cultivation facility | $2M | 6-8x | $12M-$16M |
| Manufacturing facility | $1M | 6-8x | $6M-$8M |

**Expected Loss** (probability-weighted):
- **Base Case** (10% probability of 1-2 license denials): $3M-$6M expected loss (10% × 2 facilities × $15M average exposure);
- **Downside Case** (15% probability of 3-5 license denials): $11M-$19M expected loss (15% × 4 facilities × $15M average exposure).

**Mitigation**:
- **License-specific purchase price allocation**: Allocate purchase price to each of the 72 licenses based on facility EBITDA, allowing price adjustment for denied licenses;
- **Seller indemnification**: Seller indemnifies Buyer for fair market value of any denied license, capped at 10% of purchase price;
- **R&W insurance**: Representations & Warranties insurance policy covering license denial risk (may be excluded as "forward-looking" risk; requires negotiation with insurer).

#### 3. Acquirer Background Disqualification Risk (Low Probability, High Severity)

**Risk Description**: Background investigation reveals disqualifying factor (criminal conviction, license revocation, outstanding tax liability) for Green Horizon principal or LP, requiring restructuring or deal termination.

**Severity**: CRITICAL (may require deal restructuring or termination if disqualified individual holds control position).

**Probability**: **5%** (assuming Green Horizon is reputable private equity fund with institutional investors; higher if Green Horizon has prior cannabis investments or principals with criminal histories).

**Gross Exposure**:
- **Deal termination**: $580M (100% of purchase price) if disqualified individual is GP or senior principal who cannot be excluded;
- **Restructuring costs**: $1M-$5M (legal fees, fund restructuring, LP buyouts) if disqualified individual is LP who can be bought out;
- **Timeline delay**: 3-6 months (for restructuring), adding $10.5M-$21M carrying costs.

**Mitigation**:
- **Pre-LOI background checks**: Conduct preliminary background checks on Green Horizon GP and senior principals **before** signing LOI to identify disqualifying factors early;
- **Representations and warranties**: Obtain reps from Green Horizon that no principal or LP has disqualifying factors (with right to terminate if rep breached);
- **Exclusion provisions**: Include fund documents allowing exclusion of disqualified LPs without fund dissolution.

#### 4. Illinois Social Equity License Divestiture Risk (Medium-High Probability, High Severity)

**Risk Description**: If any of PCG's 5 Illinois licenses are social equity licenses, change of control to out-of-state acquirer triggers loss of social equity status and requires divestiture or restructuring.

**Severity**: HIGH (Illinois licenses represent ~6% of enterprise value; forced divestiture at distressed prices could result in 50% loss on those assets).

**Probability**: **50-75%** if any licenses are social equity licenses (residency requirement creates structural barrier); **<5%** if all licenses are general licenses.

**Gross Exposure**:
- **Illinois license value**: $20M-$40M (5 licenses at $4M-$8M each);
- **Distressed divestiture discount**: 30-50% (forced sale to Illinois-resident buyer in limited timeframe);
- **Net loss**: $6M-$20M (30-50% discount on $20M-$40M portfolio).

**Mitigation**:
- **Immediate due diligence**: Determine within 5 business days of LOI whether any Illinois licenses are social equity licenses;
- **Pre-closing divestiture**: If social equity licenses, divest to Illinois-resident buyer **before** filing change-of-control applications;
- **Purchase price adjustment**: Reduce purchase price by fair market value of divested Illinois licenses (negotiated as part of definitive agreement);
- **Restructuring alternative**: Bring in 51% Illinois-resident co-investor for Illinois facilities only (requires separate Illinois holding company).

#### 5. Aggregate Financial Impact Summary

| Risk Category | Probability | Gross Exposure | Weighted Impact | Mitigation Cost |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Timeline delay (3-6 months) | 95% | $10.5M-$21M | $10M-$20M | $540K-$815K (consultants) |
| Individual license denials (1-4 licenses) | 10-15% | $30M-$60M | $3M-$9M | License-specific indemnification |
| Acquirer background disqualification | 5% | $1M-$580M | $50K-$29M | $75K-$150K (private background checks) |
| Illinois social equity divestiture | 50-75% (if SE licenses) | $6M-$20M | $3M-$15M | Pre-closing due diligence and restructuring |
| **TOTAL WEIGHTED IMPACT** | — | — | **$16M-$73M** | **$615K-$965K** |

**Recommendation**: Allocate **$1M budget** for regulatory consultants and application fees (within the $500K-$1M range specified in briefing). Weighted impact range of $16M-$73M suggests **purchase price reduction of 3-13%** is justified to compensate Acquirer for regulatory execution risk.

[XREF:STATE_LICENSING → PURCHASE_PRICE: Recommend $20M purchase price holdback (3.4% of $580M) released upon obtaining all 72 license approvals]

### G. Draft Remediation Language for Purchase Agreement

To mitigate the state licensing transfer risks identified above, the following contract provisions should be included in the Stock Purchase Agreement (SPA) or Asset Purchase Agreement (APA).

#### 1. Regulatory Approvals Condition Precedent

**Section 7.1 — Conditions to Obligation of Buyer**

The obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Buyer in writing) of the following conditions precedent:

**(c) Regulatory Approvals.** All regulatory approvals, permits, licenses, and authorizations required for Buyer to acquire and operate the Assets and the Business shall have been obtained and shall be in full force and effect, including without limitation:

> (i) **State Cannabis License Approvals.** Change-of-control approval shall have been obtained from each of the following state cannabis regulatory agencies for all of Seller's cannabis licenses listed on **Schedule 7.1(c)(i)** (collectively, the "**Required Licenses**"):
>
> - California Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) — 33 licenses
> - Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division (MED) — 14 licenses
> - Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission (OLCC) — 4 licenses
> - Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB) — 3 licenses
> - Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board (CCB) — 5 licenses
> - Arizona Department of Health Services (DHS) — 4 licenses
> - Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) — 4 licenses
> - Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) — 5 licenses
>
> Each such approval shall be final, non-appealable, and subject to no conditions other than Ordinary Course Conditions (as defined below). No Required License shall have been denied, revoked, suspended, or subject to any disciplinary action or investigation by the applicable regulatory agency.
>
> (ii) **Local Jurisdiction Approvals.** For all Required Licenses located in jurisdictions requiring local approval of change-of-control (including all 33 California licenses), approval shall have been obtained from the applicable local jurisdiction (city or county), and such approval shall be final, non-appealable, and subject to no Ordinary Course Conditions.
>
> (iii) **Ordinary Course Conditions Defined.** For purposes of this Section 7.1(c), "**Ordinary Course Conditions**" means routine conditions typically imposed on all license transfers, including (A) payment of annual license fees, (B) compliance with ongoing reporting requirements, (C) maintenance of commercial general liability insurance, and (D) submission of annual financial statements. Ordinary Course Conditions expressly exclude any condition that (1) restricts Buyer's ownership, operation, or transfer of the license in any manner not applicable to all licensees; (2) requires Buyer to divest any license or facility; (3) imposes fines, penalties, or disciplinary action; or (4) requires Buyer to obtain additional approvals not required of all licensees.

**Section 7.2 — Conditions to Obligation of Seller**

The obligation of Seller to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Seller in writing) of the following conditions precedent:

> **(b) Regulatory Approvals.** All regulatory approvals listed in Section 7.1(c) shall have been obtained.

**DRAFTING NOTE**: By making regulatory approvals a **bilateral condition precedent** (required for both Buyer and Seller), neither party can close without all 72 licenses approved, protecting both parties from a partial closing scenario.

#### 2. Outside Date and Regulatory Hell Clause

**Section 8.1 — Termination Rights**

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

> **(c) Outside Date Termination.** By either Buyer or Seller if the Closing has not occurred on or before **[14 months from Signing]** (the "**Outside Date**"); *provided, however,* that:
>
> (i) **Automatic Extension for Pending Regulatory Approvals.** If, as of the Outside Date, all conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied or waived **except** for the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c) (Regulatory Approvals), and the parties are proceeding in good faith to obtain such Regulatory Approvals, the Outside Date shall be **automatically extended by an additional six (6) months** (the "**Extended Outside Date**").
>
> (ii) **Regulatory Hell Termination.** If, as of the Extended Outside Date, the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(c) (Regulatory Approvals) have not been satisfied despite both parties' good faith efforts to obtain such approvals, either Buyer or Seller may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other party, and neither party shall have any further obligation to the other except as provided in Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination).
>
> (iii) **Exception for Willful Breach.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, the termination right set forth in this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose willful breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement has been the primary cause of the failure to consummate the Closing by the Outside Date or Extended Outside Date.

**Section 8.2 — Effect of Termination; Breakup Fee**

> **(c) Regulatory Hell Breakup Fee.** If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) (Regulatory Hell Termination), Seller shall pay to Buyer, within five (5) business days of termination, a breakup fee equal to **$[10,000,000]** (the "**Regulatory Hell Fee**"), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, representing Buyer's sunk costs for regulatory consultant fees, application fees, legal fees, and opportunity costs incurred in pursuing regulatory approvals. The parties agree that actual damages resulting from regulatory approval failure are difficult to ascertain, and the Regulatory Hell Fee represents a reasonable estimate of such damages.

**DRAFTING NOTE**: The 14-month Outside Date with 6-month extension accommodates the expected 9-12 month regulatory approval timeline with a 60-90 day buffer. The Regulatory Hell Fee compensates Buyer for sunk costs ($1M in regulatory consultants + $500K in legal fees + opportunity cost) if approvals are not obtained despite good faith efforts.

#### 3. License-Specific Purchase Price Allocation and Indemnification

**Section 2.3 — Purchase Price Allocation**

The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Required Licenses as set forth on **Schedule 2.3** (the "**License Allocation Schedule**"). The License Allocation Schedule allocates purchase price to each of the 72 Required Licenses based on the trailing twelve months' (TTM) EBITDA of the facility associated with each license, using a valuation multiple of **8.0x TTM EBITDA** for retail licenses, **7.0x TTM EBITDA** for cultivation licenses, and **7.0x TTM EBITDA** for manufacturing licenses.

**Section 2.4 — Purchase Price Adjustment for Denied Licenses**

> **(a) Denied License Adjustment.** If, prior to Closing, any Required License is denied by the applicable state or local regulatory agency, or if any regulatory agency imposes conditions on approval that materially restrict Buyer's operation of the facility associated with such license (other than Ordinary Course Conditions as defined in Section 7.1(c)(iii)), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the allocated purchase price for such license as set forth on the License Allocation Schedule, **plus** an additional **10%** of such allocated amount as liquidated damages to compensate Buyer for loss of synergies and transaction momentum.
>
> **(b) Maximum Aggregate Adjustment.** Notwithstanding Section 2.4(a), if the aggregate number of denied or materially restricted Required Licenses exceeds **five (5) licenses** or if the aggregate reduction in Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4(a) exceeds **$50,000,000**, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, elect to either (i) proceed to Closing with the Purchase Price reduced as provided in Section 2.4(a), or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (Material License Denials) without payment of any termination fee.
>
> **(c) Replacement Licenses.** Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any license denial by obtaining a replacement license of the same type (retail, cultivation, manufacturing) in the same state and transferring such replacement license to Buyer at Closing. If Seller obtains and transfers a replacement license, no Purchase Price adjustment shall be made with respect to the denied license.

**Section 8.1(d) — Termination for Material License Denials**

This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if the aggregate reduction in Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4 exceeds $50,000,000 or if more than five (5) Required Licenses are denied or materially restricted. Upon such termination, Seller shall pay the Regulatory Hell Fee to Buyer as provided in Section 8.2(c).

**DRAFTING NOTE**: The license-specific allocation protects Buyer from overpaying for a business with fewer licenses than anticipated. The 10% liquidated damages premium compensates Buyer for lost synergies. The $50M cap (8.6% of $580M purchase price) represents the threshold at which license denials become material enough to justify deal termination.

#### 4. Illinois Social Equity License Disclosure and Divestiture

**Section 3.15 — Illinois Social Equity Licenses**

> **(a) Disclosure.** Within **five (5) business days** of the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written schedule identifying which (if any) of the five (5) Illinois Required Licenses listed on Schedule 7.1(c)(i) are "social equity licenses" as defined under 410 ILCS 705 (the "**Illinois Social Equity Licenses**").
>
> **(b) Residency Requirement.** Seller represents and warrants that it has disclosed all Illinois Social Equity Licenses on the schedule delivered pursuant to Section 3.15(a). Seller acknowledges that Illinois law requires social equity licenses to be held by entities with at least 51% Illinois-resident ownership, and that Buyer is not an Illinois resident.
>
> **(c) Pre-Closing Divestiture.** If any Illinois Social Equity Licenses are identified pursuant to Section 3.15(a), Seller shall, prior to Closing and at Seller's sole cost and expense, either (i) **divest** such Illinois Social Equity Licenses to a qualified Illinois-resident buyer for fair market value and remit the proceeds to Buyer at Closing, or (ii) **convert** such Illinois Social Equity Licenses to general licenses (if permitted by Illinois law and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation). If Seller divests Illinois Social Equity Licenses pursuant to clause (i), the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the gross proceeds received by Seller from such divestiture.
>
> **(d) Buyer's Termination Right.** If Seller fails to divest or convert Illinois Social Equity Licenses as required by Section 3.15(c) by a date that is **ninety (90) days** prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller, and Seller shall pay the Regulatory Hell Fee to Buyer as provided in Section 8.2(c).

**DRAFTING NOTE**: This provision places the burden on Seller to identify and divest Illinois social equity licenses **before Closing**, eliminating Buyer's risk of acquiring licenses that cannot be transferred. The 90-day deadline ensures Seller has sufficient time to complete divestiture while preserving Buyer's termination right if Seller fails to perform.

#### 5. Interim Operating Covenants (Pre-Closing Compliance)

**Section 5.1 — Conduct of Business Pending Closing**

From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries and affiliates operating the Business to:

> **(m) Regulatory Compliance.** Comply in all material respects with all federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and ordinances applicable to the Business and the Required Licenses, including without limitation:
>
> (i) **License Maintenance.** Maintain all Required Licenses in good standing; timely pay all license fees, renewal fees, and regulatory assessments; timely file all required reports with state and local regulatory agencies; and promptly respond to all regulatory inquiries, requests for information, and notices of violation;
>
> (ii) **Track-and-Trace Compliance.** Maintain perfect compliance with all seed-to-sale tracking requirements under the **Metrc** system (California, Colorado) or equivalent systems in other states; ensure all inventory is properly tagged, tracked, and reported in real-time; and immediately remediate any tracking discrepancies or violations;
>
> (iii) **Product Testing Compliance.** Ensure all cannabis products sold are tested by licensed testing laboratories and comply with all potency, pesticide, heavy metal, and microbiological standards imposed by applicable state law; and immediately recall any non-compliant products;
>
> (iv) **Adverse Regulatory Events.** Notify Buyer within **two (2) business days** of (A) any notice of violation, disciplinary action, or investigation received from any state or local regulatory agency; (B) any suspension, revocation, or non-renewal of any Required License; (C) any product recall or consumer complaint involving health or safety; or (D) any criminal investigation or enforcement action involving the Business or any employee, officer, or director of Seller.

**Section 5.2 — Regulatory Cooperation**

From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to obtain all Regulatory Approvals required under Section 7.1(c), including:

> **(a) Application Preparation.** Seller shall provide to Buyer, within **thirty (30) days** of the Effective Date, all information and documentation reasonably required to prepare change-of-control applications in all eight (8) states, including historical financial statements, license applications, regulatory correspondence, disciplinary actions, compliance audits, product testing records, and track-and-trace reports.
>
> **(b) Joint Application Filings.** Buyer and Seller shall jointly file all change-of-control applications within **ninety (90) days** of the Effective Date, unless the parties mutually agree in writing to a different timeline. All application fees shall be borne by **Buyer**.
>
> **(c) Regulatory Inquiries.** Seller shall cooperate with all regulatory agency inquiries, requests for information, and interviews, and shall make its officers, directors, and employees reasonably available to regulatory agencies. Seller shall not make any material misrepresentation or omission in any regulatory filing or communication.
>
> **(d) Regulatory Consultants.** Buyer shall retain, at Buyer's expense, regulatory consultants in each of the eight (8) states to shepherd the change-of-control applications. Seller shall cooperate with such regulatory consultants and provide all requested information within **five (5) business days** of request.

**DRAFTING NOTE**: These interim operating covenants ensure that Seller maintains perfect regulatory compliance during the 9-12 month pre-closing period, minimizing the risk of license suspensions or violations that could derail the transaction. The two-business-day notice requirement for adverse regulatory events allows Buyer to monitor compliance in real-time.

### I. Conclusion and Recommendations

The state licensing transfer process for 72 licenses across 8 states represents the **critical path to closing** and the **highest execution risk** in this transaction. The aggregate timeline of 9-12 months exceeds conventional M&A closing timelines and requires sophisticated project management, significant upfront investment in regulatory consultants ($500K-$1M), and comprehensive acquirer background screening to avoid disqualification.

**Key Findings**:

1. **California is the Critical Path**: California's 33 licenses (46% of total) and dual state/local approval requirement make California the longest and most complex approval process (6-9 months). Massachusetts is similarly slow (6-9 months) but involves only 4 licenses.

2. **Illinois Social Equity Risk**: Illinois social equity licenses present **unique divestiture risk** (50-75% probability if applicable) due to 51% Illinois-resident ownership requirement. Immediate due diligence is required to identify social equity licenses and divest before filing applications.

3. **Background Check Thresholds Vary**: Nevada and Illinois use 5% ownership thresholds, capturing more beneficial owners than other states (10-20% thresholds). Green Horizon must restructure fund ownership if any LP holds ≥5% to avoid extensive background checks.

4. **Timeline Delay is Certain**: 95% probability that regulatory approval process will take 9-12 months, requiring outside date of 14 months with 6-month extension for pending approvals.

5. **Individual License Denials Likely**: 10-15% probability that one or more of the 72 licenses will be denied, requiring license-specific purchase price allocation and indemnification provisions.

**Recommendations**:

| Priority | Recommendation | Responsible Party | Deadline |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **1 (CRITICAL)** | Conduct private background investigations on all Green Horizon principals and LPs holding ≥5% ownership | Transaction counsel | Within 30 days of LOI |
| **2 (CRITICAL)** | Obtain from Seller disclosure of which (if any) Illinois licenses are social equity licenses | Buyer's regulatory counsel | Within 5 business days of SPA signing |
| **3 (HIGH)** | Engage regulatory consultants in all 8 states and develop parallel filing strategy | National Regulatory Coordinator | Within 30 days of SPA signing |
| **4 (HIGH)** | Collect background check documentation for all control persons (principals/LPs) | Background Check Coordinator | Within 90 days of SPA signing |
| **5 (HIGH)** | File all 72 change-of-control applications simultaneously in 8 states | State regulatory consultants | Within 120 days of SPA signing (Month 4) |
| **6 (MEDIUM)** | Include license-specific purchase price allocation, Regulatory Hell clause, and Illinois divestiture provisions in SPA | Transaction counsel | SPA negotiation |
| **7 (MEDIUM)** | Establish RFI rapid response team and centralized document repository | Application Manager | Before filing applications (Month 3) |
| **8 (MEDIUM)** | Negotiate R&W insurance policy covering license denial risk | Insurance broker | During due diligence (Months 1-3) |

**Purchase Agreement Provisions** (Must Include):
- ☑ Regulatory approvals as bilateral condition precedent (Section 7.1(c))
- ☑ 14-month Outside Date with 6-month automatic extension for pending approvals (Section 8.1(c))
- ☑ Regulatory Hell clause with $10M breakup fee (Section 8.1(c)(ii) and 8.2(c))
- ☑ License-specific purchase price allocation and adjustment for denied licenses (Sections 2.3-2.4)
- ☑ $50M cap on license denials before Buyer termination right (Section 2.4(b))
- ☑ Illinois social equity license disclosure and divestiture obligations (Section 3.15)
- ☑ Interim operating covenants requiring perfect regulatory compliance (Section 5.1)
- ☑ Regulatory cooperation obligations (Section 5.2)

**Estimated Costs**:
- Regulatory consultants (8 states): **$540K-$815K**
- Application fees (72 licenses): **$150K-$250K**
- Private background investigations: **$75K-$150K**
- **Total estimated cost: $765K-$1,215K** (within $500K-$1M guidance range if lower end of consultant costs achieved)

**Probability-Weighted Financial Impact**:
- Timeline delay (3-6 months): **$10M-$20M** (95% probability)
- Individual license denials: **$3M-$9M** (10-15% probability)
- Illinois social equity divestiture: **$3M-$15M** (50-75% probability if applicable)
- Acquirer background disqualification: **$50K-$29M** (5% probability)
- **Total weighted impact: $16M-$73M** (2.8%-12.6% of purchase price)

**Recommended Purchase Price Adjustment**: Allocate **$20M (3.4% of $580M purchase price) to escrow or holdback**, released upon obtaining all 72 license approvals. This compensates Acquirer for execution risk and carrying costs during the 9-12 month approval process.

[XREF:STATE_LICENSING → EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY: State licensing approval process is critical path to closing (9-12 months); recommend $20M holdback and 14-month outside date with extension]
