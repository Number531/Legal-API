# BOARD BRIEFING: PROJECT PHOENIX
## Acquisition of Pacific Cannabis Group

**Prepared for:** [Client] Board of Directors
**Date:** December 23, 2025
**Transaction Value:** $580,000,000 (Asking Price)
**Recommended Offer:** $420,000,000 Fixed + $35,000,000 Earnout = $455,000,000

---

## I. BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT (BLUF)

**RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH ACQUISITION** at $420 million fixed payment plus $35 million regulatory milestone earnout, subject to enhanced due diligence and documented risk mitigation protocols.

The transaction presents an attractive entry valuation (8.1x post-280E EBITDA versus 15.2x sector median) with embedded optionality on Schedule III rescheduling that could eliminate $59.07 million in NPV tax burden, but requires disciplined execution of COGS optimization and proactive labor relations programs to capture value.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Investment Committee must authorize term sheet delivery within 14 business days to maintain exclusivity; parallel workstreams must commence for enhanced due diligence ($275,000-$475,000 budget), R&W insurance placement ($50 million policy), and state regulatory pre-filings across 8 jurisdictions.

## III. KEY FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Section 280E Tax Penalty Creates Largest Quantifiable Burden

**Finding:** Pacific Cannabis Group incurs $38.5 million annually in non-deductible expenses under 26 U.S.C. Section 280E, representing the single largest recurring cost attributable to federal cannabis prohibition, with 5-year NPV impact of $59.07 million after COGS mitigation implementation.

**Severity:** HIGH. Section 280E applies with absolute certainty to all cannabis businesses until Schedule III reclassification occurs. The penalty cannot be eliminated through operational changes but can be reduced 40-65% through aggressive COGS optimization strategies validated in Tax Court precedent (*Californians Helping to Alleviate Medical Problems, Inc. v. Commissioner*, 128 T.C. 173 (2007)).

**Cross-Domain Impact:** Federal Schedule I status simultaneously triggers Section 280E tax burden, FinCEN SAR reporting requirements, banking access limitations, and theoretical asset forfeiture exposure under 21 U.S.C. Section 881. Schedule III rescheduling (70% probability by end 2026 per DEA proposed rule) would eliminate 280E entirely while maintaining state licensing frameworks.

**Recommended Action:** Retain Big 4 cannabis tax specialist ($250,000-$500,000 annual retainer) within 30 days of closing to implement COGS maximization program targeting $16-25 million annual recovery. Structure $35 million earnout tied to Schedule III Federal Register publication: $30 million if within 12 months, $20 million if months 13-24, $10 million if months 25-36, $0 thereafter.

---

### Finding 2: UFCW Union Organizing Risk Exceeds Tax Burden in Terminal Value Impact

**Finding:** Thirty-four of 78 Pacific Cannabis Group dispensaries are currently non-union, creating organizing campaign exposure with 50-75% probability of UFCW penetration within three years post-closing, translating to $9.1-18.1 million annual incremental labor costs if fully organized, with total NPV impact of $65.07 million including terminal value effects.

**Severity:** HIGH. Cannabis retail has become a priority organizing target for UFCW, with industry-wide penetration rates significantly exceeding general retail. Under NLRA successorship doctrine, acquirer will be bound to recognize existing UFCW Local 770 CBA at 44 currently unionized locations (100% certainty), while non-union locations remain vulnerable to card-check campaigns that typically succeed in 60-70% of cannabis retail elections.

**Cross-Domain Impact:** Labor cost increases directly reduce EBITDA and enterprise value. Union organizing can trigger banking relationship instability if campaigns create operational disruption. Current CBA expires December 31, 2026, requiring renegotiation ($4.9 million over 3 years) regardless of organizing campaign outcomes.

**Recommended Action:** Implement positive employee relations program immediately post-closing ($6 million annually for wage/benefit parity with union locations) to reduce organizing success rate from 60% baseline to 35-40%. Budget $200,000-$300,000 annually for union avoidance training and early warning systems. Investment of $6 million annually to prevent $13.6 million annual cost increase yields 126% ROI.

---

### Finding 3: Federal Criminal Prosecution Risk is Remote but Uninsurable at Face Value

**Finding:** Pacific Cannabis Group's annual production of 103,000 kilograms of cannabis exceeds the 1,000 kilogram threshold triggering mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years to life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. Section 841(b)(1)(A), but zero prosecutions of state-compliant multi-state operators have occurred since 2013, yielding probability-weighted NPV exposure of only $3.6 million against theoretical exposure exceeding $1 billion.

**Severity:** LOW (probability-adjusted). The gap between theoretical exposure (catastrophic) and actual risk (near-zero) reflects 12 years of consistent DOJ enforcement restraint under Cole Memo legacy principles, Rohrabacher-Farr appropriations riders, and prosecutorial discretion favoring other priorities.

**Cross-Domain Impact:** Federal illegality is the root cause of Section 280E tax penalties, banking limitations, and asset forfeiture exposure. Policy reversal would cascade across all risk categories simultaneously. State licenses provide no federal law defense but establish "state-compliant" status that has proven protective under current enforcement posture.

**Recommended Action:** Secure R&W insurance policy with $10 million sublimit for federal enforcement consequences excluding criminal conviction. Include MAC/MAE provision in purchase agreement triggered by DOJ policy announcement targeting state-compliant operators. Monitor DEA rescheduling proceedings and Congressional action on SAFE Banking Act.

---

### Finding 4: State License Transfer Timeline is Critical Path to Closing

**Finding:** Transfer of 72 state licenses across 8 jurisdictions requires regulatory approval from each state cannabis authority, with California Department of Cannabis Control representing longest timeline (6-9 months) and critical path to closing, necessitating minimum 14-month outside date from signing to closing.

**Severity:** MEDIUM. License transfer applications require comprehensive background checks, financial disclosures, and compliance history review. METRC compliance violations (8 violations over 30 months) may trigger enhanced scrutiny and potential delays in California and Colorado. Denial in any single jurisdiction would prevent operation in that market, affecting revenue and valuation.

**Cross-Domain Impact:** Local zoning approvals (4 pending variance applications) are prerequisites to state license effectiveness in those locations. IIPR lease assignment consent (90-180 days) runs parallel to state approval timelines. Regulatory denial triggers purchase price adjustment or termination right.

**Recommended Action:** Pre-file change of control applications before definitive agreement signing. Engage local regulatory counsel in each of 8 states ($500,000-$750,000 budget). Include "Regulatory Hell" clause permitting outside date extension by 3 months if delays caused by regulatory processing rather than substantive objection. Require seller completion of Phase 1 METRC remediation as condition precedent.

---

### Finding 5: IIPR Sale-Leaseback Creates $65 Million Contingent Obligation with Assignment Risk

**Finding:** Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR) holds sale-leaseback interests in Pacific Cannabis Group cultivation facilities representing $65 million present value of remaining triple-net lease obligations ($8.2 million annually), with IIPR consent required for change of control that could be withheld or conditioned on buyer credit enhancement.

**Severity:** MEDIUM. IIPR consent is a third-party closing condition outside direct control of buyer or seller. IIPR's financial condition and strategic priorities may affect consent timeline or conditions. However, IIPR has approved similar change of control transactions in prior MSO acquisitions without material conditions.

**Cross-Domain Impact:** IIPR ownership of underlying real estate transfers federal asset forfeiture risk from Target to REIT, reducing buyer exposure under 21 U.S.C. Section 881(a)(7). Lease obligations are assumed liabilities under stock purchase structure, affecting working capital and debt covenants.

**Recommended Action:** Initiate IIPR consent discussions within 30 days of term sheet execution. Obtain seller representation regarding IIPR relationship history and compliance with lease covenants. Include IIPR consent as express closing condition in Article 7.1(g) with reverse termination fee if consent unreasonably withheld.

---

## IV. CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

### A. Data Limitations

1. **IRS Audit Status:** Tax analysis assumes 80% probability of IRS examination for tax years 2021-2024 based on industry audit patterns, but actual examination notices may confirm or refute this assumption pre-closing.

2. **Union Organizing Intelligence:** UFCW organizing probability estimates derive from industry-wide data; site-specific workforce sentiment analysis has not been conducted and could materially affect 50-75% probability range.

3. **METRC Violation History:** Eight violations over 30 months are documented; additional unreported or self-remediated compliance issues may exist that were not captured in state regulatory records reviewed.

4. **Product Liability Claims:** Pending claim analysis assumes no additional claims filed pre-closing; product liability is inherently unpredictable and claims frequency could exceed historical patterns.

### B. Regulatory Uncertainty

1. **Schedule III Rescheduling:** 70% probability estimate by end 2026 reflects DEA proposed rule status as of May 2024 and HHS recommendation August 2023, but administrative law timelines are subject to political intervention and procedural delays.

2. **DOJ Enforcement Policy:** Zero prosecutions of state-compliant MSOs since 2013 provides empirical basis for <1% probability estimate, but policy can change without notice and new administration priorities are uncertain.

3. **SAFE Banking Act:** Legislation remains stalled in Congress; passage would fundamentally improve banking access and reduce operational costs, but probability and timing are speculative.

4. **State Regulatory Changes:** License transfer requirements and compliance standards may change during 9-12 month approval period, potentially creating new conditions or costs.

### C. Market Condition Dependencies

1. **Cannabis M&A Multiples:** Recommended valuation assumes continuation of current sector median multiples (15.2x EV/EBITDA for profitable MSOs); market deterioration would reduce exit valuations and IRR projections.

2. **Consumer Demand:** Revenue projections assume stable or growing cannabis demand; oversupply conditions in California and other mature markets could compress margins.

3. **Interest Rate Environment:** 12% WACC used in NPV calculations reflects current cannabis industry risk premium; rate changes would affect discounted cash flow valuations.

### D. Timeline Assumptions

1. **Closing Timeline:** 9-12 months from signing to closing assumed based on state licensing critical path; delays in any jurisdiction extend all timeline projections.

2. **COGS Mitigation Implementation:** $16-25 million annual recovery assumes Year 1 implementation of tax optimization program; delayed implementation reduces NPV benefit.

3. **Schedule III Earnout Period:** 36-month earnout window assumes DEA rescheduling occurs within that period; extended delays could result in $0 earnout payment despite eventual rescheduling.

## VII. DECISION REQUIRED

**DECISION REQUIRED:** Authorization to deliver term sheet and commence enhanced due diligence by Investment Committee by **January 6, 2026** (14 business days).

### Options:

**Option A: PROCEED AT RECOMMENDED TERMS**
- $420M fixed + $35M earnout = $455M maximum consideration
- $15M escrow + $10M holdback
- $50M R&W insurance
- Enhanced due diligence investment: $275,000-$475,000
- **Risk/Benefit:** Captures 21.6% discount from ask; earnout aligns incentives on Section 280E elimination; downside protected at 7.4x post-280E EBITDA; 18-22% target IRR with 25%+ upside if Schedule III occurs Year 1
- **Status: RECOMMENDED**

**Option B: PROCEED AT REDUCED PRICE**
- $400M fixed + $20M earnout = $420M maximum consideration
- Same escrow/insurance structure
- **Risk/Benefit:** Increases discount to 28%; may require significant negotiation or lose deal; appropriate only if enhanced due diligence reveals additional material liabilities or if regulatory environment deteriorates pre-signing
- **Status: CONDITIONAL (Bear Case trigger required)**

**Option C: DECLINE TRANSACTION**
- Walk away from acquisition
- **Risk/Benefit:** Eliminates all cannabis-specific regulatory and operational risks; forfeits attractive entry valuation and Schedule III optionality; competitor may acquire Target
- **Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (absent deal-breaking diligence findings or policy change)**

---

### RECOMMENDED: Option A

Authorization to deliver term sheet at $420 million fixed payment plus $35 million Schedule III earnout, with $15 million escrow, $10 million holdback, and $50 million R&W insurance coverage is justified by:

1. **Attractive Entry Multiple:** 8.1x post-280E EBITDA versus 15.2x sector median represents significant margin of safety.

2. **Embedded Optionality:** 70% probability of Schedule III rescheduling by end 2026 creates potential for $59 million NPV tax burden elimination and earnout trigger.

3. **Controllable Risk Profile:** Top two risks (280E and UFCW) totaling $124 million NPV are addressable through post-closing mitigation programs with 5-7x ROI.

4. **Downside Protection:** Fixed price of $420 million provides 27.6% discount from ask; walk-away triggers clearly defined for policy change or diligence findings.

5. **Strategic Rationale:** Eight-state footprint provides geographic diversification; 42 dispensaries and cultivation infrastructure offer operational scale.
