# SHARED CONTEXT BRIEF - PROJECT PHOENIX
## For Section Writers - Cross-Reference Guidance

**Transaction**: $580M acquisition of Pacific Cannabis Group (cannabis MSO, 8 states, 42 dispensaries)
**Target**: Produces 103,000 kg cannabis annually (federally Schedule I controlled substance)

### HIGH SEVERITY FINDINGS (For [XREF] Cross-References)

**FEDERAL SCHEDULE I STATUS**
- Cannabis = Schedule I controlled substance (21 U.S.C. § 812)
- Criminal penalties: 10 years to life for 1,000+ kg (Target = 103× threshold)
- **ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT**: ZERO prosecutions of state-compliant businesses (2013-2025)
- **Critical**: Gap between theoretical risk (life imprisonment) vs. actual risk (zero)

**SECTION 280E TAX**
- $38.5M annual penalty (26 U.S.C. § 280E - no deductions for Schedule I trafficking)
- **NPV Impact**: $59.07M over 5 years at 12% WACC
- **MITIGATION**: COGS optimization ($16M-$25M additional deductions possible)
- **UPSIDE**: Schedule III rescheduling (70% prob by end 2026) eliminates 280E entirely

**UFCW UNIONIZATION**
- 420 employees currently unionized (UFCW Local 5, Bay Area)
- CBA expires 12/31/2026 - renegotiation $4.9M over 3 years
- **34 non-union dispensaries at risk**: $9.1M-$18.1M annual if unionized (50-75% prob)
- **NPV Impact**: $65.07M (largest single exposure after 280E)
- **NLRA Successorship**: 100% certain acquirer must recognize union

**IRS AUDIT EXPOSURE**
- 2021-2024 returns: 80% audit probability
- Expected deficiency: $7.2M (range: $5M-$20M)
- **NPV Impact**: $4.87M

**METRC VIOLATIONS**
- 8 violations, $42K historical fines
- Remediation costs: $4.2M-$7.1M (one-time)
- **NPV Impact**: $5.04M

**PRODUCT LIABILITY**
- Pending claim: $500K-$2M (pesticide contamination)
- Ongoing risk: $500K-$1M annually
- **NPV Impact**: $1.53M

**FEDERAL ASSET FORFEITURE**
- 21 U.S.C. § 881 - $142M owned real estate theoretically subject to forfeiture
- **ACTUAL RISK**: ZERO forfeitures of state-licensed businesses post-Cole Memo (2013-2025)
- **Theoretical but not actual exposure**

### AGGREGATE FINANCIAL IMPACT
- **Total NPV Risk**: $142.52M (24.6% of $580M asking price)
- **Recommended Price**: $420M fixed + $35M earnout = $455M (21.6% discount)
- **Escrow**: $15M for 18 months
- **R&W Insurance**: $50M policy ($1.75M-$2.25M premium)

### KEY CROSS-DOMAIN CONNECTIONS

**FEDERAL → TAX**: Schedule I status triggers 280E penalty
**FEDERAL → BANKING**: Schedule I creates FinCEN SAR requirements
**TAX → VALUATION**: 280E = $59.07M NPV impact on purchase price
**EMPLOYMENT → VALUATION**: Union organizing = $65.07M NPV exposure
**FEDERAL → STATE**: State licenses require continued federal non-enforcement
**ENFORCEMENT → CLOSING CONDITIONS**: DOJ policy change = MAC/MAE
**280E → EARNOUT**: Rescheduling eliminates penalty, justifies earnout structure
**ASSET FORFEITURE → REAL ESTATE**: Owned property theoretically at risk
**BANKING → OPERATIONS**: Partner Community Bank fragility risk
