## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This report analyzes labor relations, union successorship, and employment compliance issues arising from Green Horizon Capital's $580 million acquisition of Pacific Cannabis Group (PCG). The transaction presents **material labor law risks** with potential financial exposure ranging from $5M (low case) to $38M (high case) over three years post-closing. The most significant risks are: (1) **UFCW organizing at 34 non-union dispensaries** (potential $18.1M annual cost increase), (2) **2026 CBA renegotiation costs** ($4.9M over 3 years), and (3) **WARN Act violations** if post-acquisition restructuring occurs without proper notice ($1M+ per facility closure).

**Key Finding:** Green Horizon Capital is a **successor employer** under the National Labor Relations Act with mandatory obligation to recognize UFCW Local 5 as exclusive bargaining representative for 420 unionized Bay Area employees. While Green Horizon is not automatically bound by the current collective bargaining agreement (which expires December 31, 2026), **voluntary CBA assumption is strongly recommended** to avoid unfair labor practice liability and maintain labor peace during integration.

### NLRA Successorship — Legal Obligation to Recognize Union

**Controlling Law:** *Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB*, 482 U.S. 27 (1987)

The Supreme Court's *Fall River* decision established a **five-factor substantial continuity test** to determine when an acquiring company becomes a "successor employer" with obligations to recognize and bargain with incumbent unions. All five factors are satisfied in this transaction:

1. **Business Operations Continuity:** Green Horizon acquires 100% of PCG stock; cannabis cultivation, manufacturing, and retail operations continue unchanged
2. **Workforce Continuity:** Substantially all 2,850 employees retained, including 100% of 420 UFCW Local 5 members
3. **Job Functions Continuity:** Same dispensary operations (budtenders, managers), cultivation, extraction work
4. **Facility Continuity:** All 8 unionized Bay Area dispensaries continue operations at same locations (Oakland, San Francisco, Berkeley, Emeryville, San Jose)
5. **Product/Service Continuity:** Same cannabis products (flower, concentrates, edibles) sold to same customer base

**CONCLUSION:** Green Horizon is a successor employer and **must recognize** UFCW Local 5 as the exclusive bargaining representative for the 420-person Bay Area bargaining unit. Failure to recognize the union constitutes an unfair labor practice under 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5), exposing Green Horizon to:
- NLRB bargaining order
- Back pay liability (potentially $5M+ for 24-month NLRB proceeding)
- Reputational harm (NLRB decisions publicly reported)
- Regulatory scrutiny from California cannabis licensing authorities

### CBA Assumption Decision — Burns Rights vs. Voluntary Assumption

**Controlling Law:** *NLRB v. Burns International Security Services*, 406 U.S. 272 (1972)

Under the *Burns* doctrine, a successor employer is **NOT automatically bound** by the predecessor's collective bargaining agreement. Green Horizon has two options:

**Option 1: Invoke Burns Rights (Decline to Assume CBA)**
- Green Horizon may set initial terms and conditions of employment before hiring employees
- After closing (when employees become Green Horizon employees), Green Horizon must recognize UFCW Local 5 and bargain in good faith
- Green Horizon could potentially reduce wages from $22/hr (union) to $19/hr (non-union market rate), reduce PTO, reduce 401(k) match
- **RISKS:**
  - **Unfair labor practice exposure:** If Green Horizon changes terms **after** closing, NLRB will find unlawful unilateral change (must maintain status quo until bargaining to impasse)
  - **Strike risk HIGH (75%+ probability):** UFCW Local 5 will almost certainly strike if wages/benefits substantially reduced
  - **Operational disruption:** 8 Bay Area dispensaries generate $336,000/day revenue; 14-day strike = $4.7M revenue loss
  - **Customer defection:** 10-15% permanent customer loss after strike (competitive Bay Area market)

**Option 2: Voluntarily Assume CBA (Recommended)**
- Green Horizon agrees to be bound by all CBA terms through expiration (December 31, 2026)
- CBA remains in effect for 18 months post-closing (Q1 2026 → 12/31/2026)
- Green Horizon incurs $5M annual union premium (420 employees × higher union wages/benefits)
- **BENEFITS:**
  - **Labor peace:** No immediate renegotiation, minimal strike risk during integration period
  - **Avoids unfair labor practice risk:** No unilateral changes, clear compliance with NLRA
  - **Builds constructive relationship** with UFCW Local 5 before 2026 negotiations
  - **Time to prepare:** 18 months to assess operations, prepare bargaining strategy

**RECOMMENDATION:** Green Horizon should **voluntarily assume the CBA** through December 31, 2026. Given CBA expires relatively soon after closing, voluntary assumption provides labor stability during critical integration period while preserving Green Horizon's ability to negotiate more favorable terms in 2026. The $5M annual union premium is a **known, budgeted cost** preferable to strike risk and unfair labor practice exposure.

**Purchase Agreement Provision:** Stock Purchase Agreement should include provision requiring Green Horizon to assume CBA (satisfies PCG's contractual obligation to UFCW Local 5 under CBA successorship clause).

### 2026 CBA Negotiations — Anticipated Costs and Strike Risk

**Negotiation Timeline:**
- CBA expires: December 31, 2026
- Notice required: November 1, 2026 (60 days under NLRA § 8(d))
- Negotiations begin: Mid-2026 (6-9 months before expiration)

**Projected UFCW Local 5 Demands (Based on Cannabis Industry Pattern Bargaining):**

Recent UFCW cannabis CBAs (2022-2024) show pattern of **4-5% annual wage increases**, significantly higher than general private sector (2.5-3%). Cannabis-specific factors driving higher increases:
- Inflation (2021-2024: 15% cumulative CPI)
- Tight labor market for experienced budtenders
- UFCW strike leverage (customer-facing retail vulnerable to strikes)

**Wage Increases:**
- Year 1 (2027): 5% across all classifications
- Year 2 (2028): 5%
- Year 3 (2029): 5.5%
- **Cumulative: 15.5% over 3 years**

**Current vs. Projected Wages:**
| Position | Current (2024-2026) | Year 3 (2029) | Increase |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| Budtender (entry) | $22.00/hr | $25.59/hr | 16.3% |
| Budtender (3+ years) | $28.00/hr | $32.57/hr | 16.3% |
| Shift Supervisor | $32.00/hr | $37.22/hr | 16.3% |
| Store Manager | $75,000/year | $87,236/year | 16.3% |

**Enhanced Benefits:**
- **Health insurance:** $850/month → $950/month ($100/month increase per employee)
- **PTO:** 15 days (year 1) → 18 days; 20 days (year 3+) → 25 days
- **401(k) match:** 5% → 6%
- **Job security:** Strengthened successorship language, anti-subcontracting clause

**Total Cost (420 Employees):**
| Component | 3-Year Total |
|-----------|--------------|
| Wage increases | $1.9M |
| Health insurance | $1.5M |
| PTO enhancements | $0.9M |
| 401(k) increase | $0.6M |
| **TOTAL** | **$4.9M** |

**As Percentage of Current Union Labor Cost:** 31.8% increase over 3 years ($15.4M current → $20.3M by 2029)

**Strike Risk Assessment:**

UFCW Local 5 has demonstrated willingness to strike:
- **Harborside Oakland (November 2019):** 14-day strike resulted in union victory; CBA ratified with 4% annual increases
- **Employer concessions:** UFCW achieved wage increases above market rate through strike pressure

**Strike Probability (2026-2027 Negotiations):**
- **No strike (65%):** Green Horizon accepts UFCW demands (4-5% annual increases consistent with pattern bargaining)
- **Brief strike 3-7 days (25%):** Impasse on single issue (e.g., wage percentage); short strike pressures settlement
- **Extended strike 14+ days (10%):** Fundamental disagreement (e.g., Green Horizon proposes wage freeze or subcontracting); prolonged strike

**Strike Impact (8 Bay Area Dispensaries):**
- Daily revenue loss: $336,000 (8 locations × $42,000/day average)
- 2-week strike: $4.7M revenue loss
- 4-week strike: $9.4M revenue loss
- Permanent customer defection: 10-15% (customers seek alternative dispensaries, may not return)
- Reputational harm: Cannabis industry values worker rights; strike generates negative press

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Early engagement:** Meet with UFCW Local 5 leadership 6-9 months before expiration; build constructive relationship
2. **Pattern following:** Accept UFCW's pattern bargaining demands (4-5% annual increases matched to recent cannabis CBAs)
3. **Interest-based bargaining:** Collaborative approach focused on mutual interests rather than positional bargaining
4. **Financial transparency:** Share company performance data; cannabis industry margin pressure (explain constraints)
5. **Strike contingency plan:** Prepare backup staffing, security measures, customer communication (but avoid provocative anti-union tactics)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Budget $4.9M for 2026-2029 CBA costs. Accept UFCW pattern bargaining demands (5% annual wage increases) to avoid strike. Brief strike (3-7 days) likely if negotiations drag past expiration; extended strike (14+ days) only if Green Horizon takes aggressive position (wage freeze, benefit cuts).

### UFCW Organizing at Non-Union Locations — $18.1M Annual Exposure

**Non-Union Dispensary Inventory (34 Locations, 1,530 Employees):**

| State | Dispensaries | Employees | Active UFCW Local |
|-------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| California (Los Angeles) | 6 | 270 | Local 770 |
| California (San Diego) | 4 | 180 | Local 135 |
| California (Sacramento) | 3 | 135 | Local 8-Golden State |
| California (Orange County) | 2 | 90 | Local 324 |
| California (other) | 3 | 135 | Various |
| Colorado (Denver metro) | 8 | 360 | Local 7 |
| Illinois (Chicago) | 2 | 90 | Local 881 |
| Massachusetts (Boston) | 2 | 90 | Local 1445 |
| Nevada (Las Vegas) | 4 | 180 | Local 711 |
| **TOTAL** | **34** | **1,530** | — |

**Organizing Probability Assessment:**

**Factors INCREASING Organizing Risk (50-75% of locations within 3 years):**
1. **Pattern bargaining leverage:** 8 Bay Area locations already unionized; UFCW will use PCG unionized wages as benchmark for organizing campaigns at non-union locations
2. **M&A organizing opportunity:** Acquisitions create employee uncertainty; UFCW typically intensifies organizing during ownership transitions
3. **UFCW presence in all markets:** PCG operates in 5 states; UFCW has active locals in all 5 (California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada)
4. **MSO target strategy:** UFCW prioritizes multi-state operators like PCG (42 dispensaries); organizing one location creates momentum for chain-wide organizing
5. **High NLRB election success rate:** UFCW wins 65-75% of cannabis industry elections (higher than overall private sector 50% win rate)

**Factors DECREASING Organizing Risk:**
1. **Geographic dispersion:** 34 locations spread across 5 states; UFCW must organize location-by-location (not single election for entire company)
2. **Proactive compensation:** If Green Horizon raises non-union wages to 90-95% of union rates, reduces economic incentive to unionize
3. **Positive employee relations:** Town halls, open-door policy, grievance procedures provide non-union alternative to union representation

**Financial Impact of Organizing:**

**Current Non-Union Compensation:** $65.9M annually (1,530 employees)
**Union Compensation (Projected):** $84.0M annually (wages + benefits at UFCW Local 5 rates)
**Annual Cost Increase:** **$18.1M** (27% labor cost increase at affected locations)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
| Scenario | Locations Organized | Annual Cost Increase | EBITDA Impact |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Low (25%) | 9 dispensaries | $4.5M | 11% reduction |
| Medium (50%) | 17 dispensaries | $9.1M | 22% reduction |
| High (75%) | 26 dispensaries | $13.6M | 32% reduction |
| Maximum (100%) | 34 dispensaries | $18.1M | 43% reduction |

**Transaction Valuation Impact (Maximum Scenario):**
- EBITDA reduction: $42M → $24M (43% decline)
- Enterprise value impact: $18.1M × 6x EBITDA multiple = **$109M reduction** in enterprise value
- As % of transaction value: 18.8% ($109M ÷ $580M)

**Union Avoidance Strategies (Lawful Under NLRA):**

Green Horizon may implement **lawful, proactive labor relations program** to reduce organizing probability:

**1. Competitive Compensation (Most Effective)**
- Benchmark non-union wages against UFCW Local 5 CBA rates
- Increase non-union budtender wages to $19.50-$20.50/hr (90-95% of union $22/hr)
- Match benefits: Increase health insurance contribution, PTO, 401(k) match at non-union locations
- **Cost:** $3M-$5M annually (cheaper than full unionization at $18.1M)
- **Impact:** Removes primary economic incentive to unionize

**2. Supervisory Training**
- Train all 34 dispensary managers on:
  - **Recognizing organizing activity** (union representatives distributing literature, employee organizing meetings)
  - **TIPS violations** (Threats, Interrogation, Promises, Surveillance — all unlawful under NLRA § 8(a)(1))
  - **Positive employee relations** (address complaints proactively, open-door policy, conflict resolution)
- **Cost:** $50K-$100K (one-time training program)

**3. Employee Engagement**
- Implement town halls (quarterly meetings with management)
- Employee feedback surveys (identify grievances before they become organizing issues)
- Non-union grievance procedure (complaint resolution without union representation)
- **Cost:** $100K-$200K annually

**4. Rapid Response Protocol**
- If NLRB petition filed:
  - Engage labor counsel immediately (within 24 hours)
  - Prepare lawful communication campaign (NLRB § 8(c) protected speech: employer may share facts about unionization, union dues costs, strike history)
  - Train management on NLRA restrictions (24-hour rule: no captive audience meetings within 24 hours of election)
- **Cost:** $150K-$300K per organizing campaign (legal fees, campaign materials)

**Prohibited Conduct (NLRA § 8(a)(1) Violations):**
- **Threats:** "If union comes in, we'll close this location" (results in NLRB bargaining order — union certified without election)
- **Interrogation:** "Are you planning to vote for the union?"
- **Promises:** "Vote no and we'll give you raises" (unlawful promise during organizing campaign)
- **Surveillance:** Manager spies on union organizing meeting

**RECOMMENDATION:** Implement proactive labor relations program immediately post-closing:
- **Invest $3M-$5M annually** in wage increases at non-union locations (90-95% of union rates)
- **Invest $250K** in supervisory training, employee engagement programs
- **Expected outcome:** Reduce organizing probability from 50-75% to 25-40%; save $9M-$13M annually vs. full unionization scenario

### Workplace Safety — OSHA Compliance and Extraction Hazards

**PCG Safety Performance (FY2024):**

| Facility Type | Employees | OSHA Recordables | TRIR | Industry Avg TRIR | Assessment |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|------|-------------------|------------|
| Cultivation | 800 | 8 | 2.0 | 5.2 (agriculture) | **Excellent** (62% below industry) |
| Manufacturing | 600 | 3 | 1.0 | 3.8 (food mfg) | **Excellent** (74% below industry) |
| Retail | 950 | 1 | 0.2 | 3.0 (retail trade) | **Excellent** (93% below industry) |
| **TOTAL** | **2,350** | **12** | **1.0** | **3.0-5.2** | **Significantly above average** |

**Conclusion:** PCG has **strong safety culture** with injury rates significantly below industry benchmarks. Low OSHA citation risk absent catastrophic incident.

**Serious Incident (June 2024 — Monterey Extraction Facility):**
- Extraction technician exposed to butane vapors during hydrocarbon extraction
- Equipment malfunction (pressure relief valve failure) released butane into closed-loop system
- Employee hospitalized overnight (respiratory distress); released without permanent injury
- **Corrective actions:** Enhanced preventive maintenance (monthly inspections), continuous butane monitoring (alarm at 10% LEL), employee retraining
- **OSHA investigation:** None (no employee complaint, incident not fatal/catastrophic)

**Cannabis Industry OSHA Hazards:**

**Extraction Facilities (Highest Risk):**
- **Flammable solvents:** Butane, propane (hydrocarbon extraction) — explosion/fire risk
- **Process Safety Management (PSM):** 29 CFR 1910.119 applies to facilities with 10,000+ lbs flammable liquids
- **Confined spaces:** Extraction vessels, closed-loop systems — asphyxiation risk
- **Typical citations:** $18,500 (serious violation — failure to conduct PSM hazard analysis)

**Cultivation Facilities:**
- **Pesticide exposure:** Respiratory protection, HazCom (Safety Data Sheets, training)
- **Ergonomic injuries:** Hand-trimming (8+ hours/day) — carpal tunnel, tendonitis
- **Typical citations:** $7,200 (serious violation — no respirator fit testing)

**Retail Dispensaries:**
- **Workplace violence:** Robberies (cash-intensive business), armed customers
- **California 8 CCR § 3342 (new 2024):** Workplace violence prevention plan required for retail establishments (hazard assessment, security measures, employee training, violent incident log)
- **PCG compliance:** Workplace violence prevention plan implemented at all 26 California dispensaries (July 2024)

**OSHA Enforcement — Cannabis Industry:**

Federal/state OSHA agencies **do enforce** safety standards at cannabis businesses despite federal illegality:
- OSHA position: Cannabis employers subject to OSHA despite Schedule I status
- Cal/OSHA issued cannabis-specific guidance (2019)
- Nevada OSHA actively enforces at cannabis facilities

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Review OSHA 300 Logs (5-year injury records) for all facilities; identify high-risk locations
- Verify June 2024 corrective actions implemented (butane monitoring system, enhanced maintenance)
- Ensure all extraction facilities comply with PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) if 10,000+ lbs flammable solvents
- Maintain workplace violence prevention plans at all California dispensaries (8 CCR § 3342 compliance)

### Drug Testing — Cannabis Employer Paradox

**Unique Legal Issue:** Cannabis employers face paradox:
- Employees produce/sell federally illegal substance (Schedule I)
- Employees may legally consume cannabis off-duty under state law
- Question: Can cannabis employer test employees for cannabis use?

**State Law Summary:**

| State | Off-Duty Cannabis Protection | PCG Policy Compliance |
|-------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **California** | **NO** (*Ross v. RagingWire*, 2008 — employers may terminate for off-duty cannabis) | **Compliant** |
| **Colorado** | **NO** (*Coats v. Dish Network*, 2015 — cannabis not "lawful" under federal law) | **Compliant** |
| **Illinois** | **LIMITED** (cannot discriminate against medical cannabis patients absent impairment) | **Compliant** |
| **Massachusetts** | **LIMITED** (similar to Illinois) | **Compliant** |
| **Nevada** | **YES** (NRS 678C.450 — cannot refuse hire/penalize for off-duty cannabis; exceptions: safety-sensitive positions) | **NON-COMPLIANT** |

**Nevada Compliance Issue:**

NRS 678C.450 (effective 2020):
> "It is unlawful for an employer to refuse to hire a prospective employee because the prospective employee submitted to a screening test and the results indicated the presence of marijuana."

**Exceptions:**
- Safety-sensitive positions (extraction technicians, forklift operators, delivery drivers)
- Federal contract positions

**PCG Current Policy:**
- No pre-employment cannabis testing (compliant)
- Post-accident cannabis testing (all positions) — **NON-COMPLIANT** if applied to non-safety-sensitive Nevada employees (budtenders, corporate staff)

**Risk:** Wrongful termination claims if PCG terminates non-safety-sensitive Nevada employees for positive post-accident cannabis test. Exposure: $100K-$500K (settlements, legal fees).

**RECOMMENDATION:** Revise Nevada drug testing policy:
- Define "safety-sensitive positions" (extraction technicians, forklift operators, delivery drivers)
- Limit post-accident cannabis testing to safety-sensitive positions only
- Non-safety-sensitive employees subject to reasonable suspicion testing only (observable impairment: bloodshot eyes, odor, poor coordination)

### California Wage and Hour Compliance

**Meal and Rest Breaks (California Labor Code §§ 512, 226.7):**

PCG operates 26 California dispensaries (950 employees). California requires:
- **Meal break:** 30 minutes (unpaid) before end of 5th hour
- **Rest breaks:** 10 minutes (paid) per 4-hour period
- **Premium pay:** 1 hour of pay for each day break not provided

**PCG Compliance (FY2024):**
- 48 meal/rest break violations (950 employees × 247 work days = 234,650 employee-days)
- **Violation rate: 0.02%** (excellent compliance)
- Premium pay totaling $6,720 paid

**PAGA Risk (Private Attorneys General Act):**
If violations systemic, employees may bring PAGA claim:
- Penalties: $100 per employee per pay period (initial violation); $200 (subsequent)
- **Maximum exposure:** $2.28M (950 employees × 24 pay periods × $100)
- **Actual risk: LOW** — 0.02% violation rate indicates isolated violations, not systemic

**Overtime (California Labor Code § 510):**

California requires **daily and weekly overtime** (stricter than federal FLSA):
- 8+ hours/day: 1.5× regular rate
- 12+ hours/day: 2× regular rate
- 40+ hours/week: 1.5× regular rate

**PCG Compliance:**
- FY2024 overtime expenses: $4.2M (950 non-exempt retail employees)
- No misclassification issues (all non-exempt employees properly paid overtime)

**Predictive Scheduling (San Francisco, Emeryville):**

PCG operates 2 San Francisco dispensaries, 1 Emeryville dispensary subject to local predictive scheduling laws:
- **Requirement:** 14-day advance schedule; penalty pay for schedule changes with <7 days' notice
- **PCG compliance:** Scheduling software implemented; FY2024: 12 violations ($300 total penalties)

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- Maintain current compliance program (automated timekeeping, meal break alerts)
- Conduct quarterly wage/hour audits (California locations)
- Verify exempt classifications (all exempt employees meet California $66,560 salary threshold and duties tests)

### WARN Act — Post-Acquisition Restructuring

**Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109):**

WARN requires **60-day advance written notice** for:
- **Plant closing:** 50+ employees at single site
- **Mass layoff:** 50+ employees (and 33%+ of workforce) at single site

**Penalties for Violations:**
- Back pay: Up to 60 days' wages for each affected employee
- Benefits: 60 days' benefit contributions
- Civil penalty: $500/day to local government (max $30,000)

**M&A Context — When WARN Applies:**

| Scenario | WARN Trigger |
|----------|--------------|
| Stock purchase, employees retained | **NO** |
| Post-acquisition layoffs (50+ employees within 90 days) | **YES** (90-day aggregation rule) |
| Facility closure (50+ employees) | **YES** |
| Consolidation (close acquired facility, move to existing facility) | **YES** (unless employees offered transfer and accept) |

**California WARN (Cal-WARN) — Stricter Than Federal:**

California Labor Code §§ 1400-1408:
- **Coverage:** 75+ employees (vs. federal 100+)
- **Layoff threshold:** 50+ employees (no 33% percentage requirement)
- **Relocation:** Covered (100+ mile facility move triggers Cal-WARN)

**PCG Transaction WARN Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: No Restructuring**
- Green Horizon retains all PCG facilities, employees
- **WARN trigger:** NONE

**Scenario 2: Cultivation Consolidation (Humboldt Facility Closure)**
- PCG Humboldt facility: 180 employees
- Green Horizon closes Humboldt, consolidates to existing Salinas facility (100 miles away)
- 120 employees decline transfer (employment loss)
- **WARN trigger: YES** (120 > 50)
- **Liability if no notice:** $1.2M (120 × $10,560 back pay + benefits)

**Scenario 3: Retail Optimization (6 Underperforming Dispensaries Closed)**
- 6 dispensaries (270 employees total) closed within 90 days
- **90-day aggregation rule:** Employment losses within 90 days aggregated for WARN purposes
- **Single site analysis:** Each dispensary below 50-employee threshold (45 employees)
- **Multiple sites:** If dispensaries in same metropolitan area (e.g., 2 LA dispensaries + other LA layoffs), may aggregate to single site
- **Conservative approach:** Provide 60-day notice if closing multiple locations within 90 days (avoids litigation risk)

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- If Green Horizon plans any post-acquisition restructuring (facility closures, layoffs), provide **60-day WARN notice** (satisfies both federal WARN and stricter Cal-WARN)
- Consult employment counsel before any layoffs affecting 50+ employees
- Document "separate and distinct actions" if multiple small layoffs within 90 days (avoid aggregation)

### Risk Summary — Quantified Exposure

**3-Year Post-Acquisition Labor Law Exposure:**

| Risk Category | Low Case | Medium Case | High Case |
|---------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| 2026 CBA Negotiations | $4.9M | $5.5M | $14.2M |
| UFCW Organizing (34 locations) | $4.5M/year | $9.1M/year | $18.1M/year |
| WARN Act Violations | $0 | $1.2M | $3.5M |
| OSHA Citations | $20K | $50K | $200K |
| Wage and Hour (PAGA) | $0 | $250K | $2.3M |
| Drug Testing Claims | $0 | $150K | $500K |
| **TOTAL 3-YEAR** | **$5M** | **$16M** | **$38M** |

**As % of Transaction Value ($580M):** 0.9% (low) to 6.6% (high)
**As % of Annual EBITDA ($42M):** 12% (low) to 90% (high) of one year's EBITDA

**Most Likely Scenario (Medium Case: $16M over 3 years):**
- 2026 CBA settlement after brief strike: $5.5M
- 50% of non-union locations organize: $9.1M/year × 3 years = $27.3M (present value ~$24M)
- One facility closure with WARN notice: $1.2M
- Isolated OSHA/wage-hour issues: $300K

### Critical Action Items

**Pre-Closing (High Priority):**
1. **CBA Assumption:** Negotiate provision in Stock Purchase Agreement requiring Green Horizon to assume CBA through 12/31/2026
2. **NLRB Petition Search:** Request any pending NLRB representation petitions at non-union locations
3. **OSHA 300 Log Review:** Obtain 5-year injury records for all facilities
4. **Nevada Drug Testing Audit:** Revise policy to comply with NRS 678C.450
5. **2026 CBA Cost Modeling:** Financial model for wage increase scenarios (baseline, UFCW demands, strike)

**Post-Closing (0-6 Months):**
6. **Meet UFCW Local 5:** Introductory meeting with union leadership; confirm CBA commitment
7. **Union Avoidance Program:** Increase non-union wages to 90-95% of union rates; supervisory training on TIPS violations
8. **California Wage/Hour Audit:** Engage counsel to audit meal/rest breaks, overtime, exempt classifications
9. **WARN Assessment:** If restructuring planned, calculate employees affected, determine notice requirements

**This comprehensive labor law analysis identifies material risks requiring immediate attention and strategic planning to protect Green Horizon's $580M investment in Pacific Cannabis Group.**

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. NLRA SUCCESSORSHIP DOCTRINE

#### 1. Legal Framework — Supreme Court Precedent

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 151-169, does not explicitly address successorship obligations in corporate acquisitions. The doctrine has been developed through Supreme Court case law establishing when an acquiring entity becomes a "successor employer" with obligations to recognize and bargain with incumbent unions.

##### *Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB*, 482 U.S. 27 (1987)

**Facts:**
- Fall River Dyeing purchased assets of Sterlingwale (textile dyeing/finishing operation)
- Sterlingwale employees represented by two unions; operations ceased
- Fall River hired 55 of 107 former Sterlingwale employees, resumed operations at same facility
- Union demanded recognition; Fall River refused, claiming no successorship obligation
- NLRB ordered Fall River to recognize union and bargain

**Supreme Court Holding:**
The Court established the **substantial continuity test** for determining successorship:

> "A successor is one who acquires a going concern and continues to operate it... The question is whether, viewing the transaction as a whole, there has been a substantial continuity in the identity of the business enterprise."

**Five-Factor Test for Substantial Continuity:**

| Factor | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| **1. Business operations continuity** | Same type of business in same geographic market |
| **2. Workforce continuity** | Majority of successor's workforce from predecessor |
| **3. Job functions continuity** | Employees perform same work under similar conditions |
| **4. Facility continuity** | Operations at same or similar location |
| **5. Product/service continuity** | Same products manufactured or services provided |

**Key Principle — Presumption of Majority Support:**
When successorship exists, the union retains its bargaining representative status without need for new election:

> "The bargaining representative should be given a reasonable time to bargain and to demonstrate majority support... A union should be given time to consult with employees, to investigate the successor, and to bargain."

**APPLICATION TO PCG ACQUISITION:**

| Factor | PCG Transaction Analysis | Conclusion |
|--------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Business operations** | Green Horizon acquires 100% stock of PCG; cannabis cultivation, manufacturing, retail continues unchanged | ✓ Continuity |
| **Workforce** | Substantially all 2,850 employees retained, including all 420 UFCW Local 5 members | ✓ Continuity (100% retention) |
| **Job functions** | Same dispensary operations (budtenders, managers); same cultivation/extraction work | ✓ Continuity |
| **Facilities** | All 8 unionized Bay Area dispensaries continue operations at same locations | ✓ Continuity |
| **Product/service** | Same cannabis products (flower, concentrates, edibles) sold to same customer base | ✓ Continuity |

**CONCLUSION:** Green Horizon Capital is a **successor employer** under *Fall River* with obligation to recognize UFCW Local 5 as bargaining representative for the 420 unionized employees.

##### *NLRB v. Burns International Security Services*, 406 U.S. 272 (1972)

**Facts:**
- Burns acquired contract to provide security services at Lockheed facility
- Predecessor (Wackenhut) had CBA with union; Burns hired 27 of 42 Wackenhut employees
- Burns refused to honor predecessor's CBA wage/benefit terms
- NLRB ordered Burns to bargain with union but found no obligation to assume CBA

**Supreme Court Holding — The "Burns Doctrine":**

> "Although a successor employer is ordinarily free to set initial terms on which it will hire the employees of a predecessor, there will be instances in which it is perfectly clear that the new employer plans to retain all of the employees in the unit and in which it will be appropriate to have him initially consult with the employees' bargaining representative before he fixes terms."

**Two Critical Rules:**

**Rule 1: Successor NOT automatically bound by predecessor's CBA**
- Successor has no obligation to assume collective bargaining agreement
- Exception: Successor **voluntarily** agrees to assume CBA
- Exception: "Perfectly clear successor" (explicitly assumes all obligations in acquisition agreement)

**Rule 2: Successor has "Burns rights" to set initial terms**
- Before hiring employees, successor may unilaterally set wages, benefits, working conditions
- **After** hiring majority workforce from predecessor, successor must recognize union and bargain
- Successor cannot make unilateral changes to terms/conditions after obligation to bargain attaches

**POLICY RATIONALE:**
The Court balanced competing interests:
- **Union interest:** Preservation of bargaining relationship, employee expectations
- **Successor interest:** Freedom to structure business operations without inheriting predecessor's contractual obligations

> "A potential employer may be willing to take over a moribund business only if he can make changes in corporate structure, composition of the labor force, work location, task assignment, and nature of supervision. Saddling such an employer with the terms and conditions of employment contained in the old collective bargaining contract may make these changes impossible and may discourage and inhibit the transfer of capital."

**APPLICATION TO PCG ACQUISITION:**

**Scenario 1: Green Horizon Does NOT Assume CBA (Invokes Burns Rights)**

Green Horizon would:
- **MUST** recognize UFCW Local 5 as bargaining representative
- **MUST** bargain in good faith over wages, hours, terms/conditions of employment
- **MAY** set initial terms of employment before closing (e.g., reduce wages from $22/hr to $19/hr, reduce PTO from 15 days to 12 days)
- **Risk:** UFCW Local 5 may file unfair labor practice charge if initial terms set after hiring (post-closing unilateral changes prohibited)
- **Risk:** Union may strike if terms substantially worsened

**Scenario 2: Green Horizon Voluntarily Assumes CBA (Waives Burns Rights)**

Green Horizon would:
- Be **bound by all CBA terms** through expiration (December 31, 2026)
- Gain **labor peace** (no immediate renegotiation, strike risk minimized)
- Incur **higher labor costs** ($5M annual union premium vs. non-union) through 2026
- Must negotiate successor CBA before expiration

**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**
Given CBA expires in 24 months post-closing (Q1 2026 → 12/31/2026), voluntary assumption may be advisable to:
- Avoid unfair labor practice risk (unilateral changes during transition)
- Maintain operational continuity at 8 Bay Area dispensaries ($42K/day revenue per store)
- Build constructive relationship with UFCW Local 5 before 2026 negotiations

##### *Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Local Joint Executive Board*, 417 U.S. 249 (1974)

**Facts:**
- Howard Johnson purchased motor lodge and restaurant from Grissom's
- Grissom's had CBA with union; Howard Johnson hired only 9 of 53 Grissom's employees
- Union demanded Howard Johnson honor CBA; company refused
- NLRB found no successorship (insufficient workforce continuity)

**Supreme Court Holding — When Successorship Does NOT Apply:**

> "If the new employer makes a conscious decision to maintain generally the same business and to hire a majority of his predecessor's employees, then the bargaining obligation of § 8(a)(5) is activated. This makes sense when one considers that the employer intends to take advantage of the trained work force of his predecessor."

**Key Distinction from Burns:**
- **Burns:** 27 of 42 employees retained (64%) → Successorship found
- **Howard Johnson:** 9 of 53 employees retained (17%) → No successorship

**Threshold Rule:**
Successorship requires hiring **majority** of predecessor's workforce in the bargaining unit. Minority retention insufficient to trigger recognition obligation.

**APPLICATION TO PCG ACQUISITION:**

Green Horizon retains **100% of unionized workforce** (420/420 UFCW Local 5 members). This far exceeds the majority threshold established in *Howard Johnson* and *Burns*.

**CONCLUSION:** *Howard Johnson* exception does NOT apply. Green Horizon is successor employer.

#### 2. NLRB Enforcement of Successorship Obligations

##### Unfair Labor Practices — Section 8(a)(5) Violations

**29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5):**
> "It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees..."

**Successor Employer Violations:**

| Violation | Description | NLRB Remedy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Refusal to recognize union** | Successor denies union's status despite substantial continuity | Bargaining order; back pay for period of unlawful refusal |
| **Unilateral changes after hiring** | Successor changes wages/benefits after acquiring majority predecessor workforce | Rescission of changes; status quo ante restoration; back pay for lost wages/benefits |
| **Bad faith bargaining** | Successor engages in surface bargaining without intent to reach agreement | Bargaining order; extension of CBA terms until good faith bargaining conducted |
| **Withdrawal of recognition** | Successor withdraws recognition claiming union lost majority support without objective evidence | Bargaining order; affirmative bargaining obligation |

**NLRB Process:**
1. Union files unfair labor practice charge (within 6 months of violation)
2. NLRB Regional Director investigates
3. If merit found, Regional Director issues complaint
4. Administrative Law Judge hearing
5. NLRB decision (3-member panel or 5-member Board)
6. Enforcement through federal court of appeals (if respondent refuses compliance)

**Typical Timeline:** 12-24 months from charge to final NLRB decision; additional 6-12 months for court enforcement

**RISK TO GREEN HORIZON:**
If Green Horizon refuses to recognize UFCW Local 5 or makes unilateral changes post-closing:
- Unfair labor practice liability
- Back pay exposure (up to $5M for 24-month proceeding affecting 420 employees)
- Reputational harm (NLRB decisions publicly reported)
- Regulatory scrutiny (state cannabis licensing authorities may consider labor violations)

#### 3. Successorship Clause in Current CBA

**PCG-UFCW Local 5 CBA Article 25 (Successorship):**

> "This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto, their successors, administrators, executives and assigns. In the event the Employer sells, transfers, or assigns its business, the Employer agrees to notify any successor, assign, or purchaser of the existence of this Agreement and to require such successor to assume this Agreement as a condition of such sale, transfer, or assignment."

**Legal Effect of Successorship Clause:**

**Traditional View (Pre-*Burns*):**
Successorship clauses in CBAs could bind successor employer through contract assignment principles.

**Post-*Burns* View:**
Supreme Court held successorship clause **cannot compel successor to assume CBA** against its will:

> "Petitioner was not a party to the agreement and did not voluntarily assume the obligation to arbitrate... We hold that [the successor] was not bound to arbitrate."

**HOWEVER:** Successorship clause creates **contractual obligation on seller** (PCG):
- PCG must **notify** Green Horizon of CBA existence (likely satisfied through due diligence)
- PCG must **require** Green Horizon to assume CBA as condition of sale
- If PCG fails to impose this condition, UFCW Local 5 may have breach of contract claim **against PCG** (not against Green Horizon)

**APPLICATION TO GREEN HORIZON:**

**If Purchase Agreement Silent on CBA Assumption:**
- Green Horizon **not bound** by CBA under *Burns*
- Green Horizon **must recognize** UFCW Local 5 and bargain under *Fall River*
- Green Horizon may invoke Burns rights to set initial terms

**If Purchase Agreement Includes CBA Assumption Provision:**
- Green Horizon **bound by CBA** through December 31, 2026 (voluntary assumption)
- No Burns rights (CBA terms govern)

**DUE DILIGENCE RECOMMENDATION:**
Review draft purchase agreement for:
- CBA assumption language
- Labor stability representations/warranties
- Indemnification for pre-closing labor liabilities

#### 4. Timing of Bargaining Obligation

**When Does Duty to Bargain Attach?**

*Fall River* established a "reasonable time" standard:

> "Once the successor has hired a majority of the predecessor's employees, the successor has a duty to recognize and bargain with the union... The union is entitled to a reasonable time after the succession to bargain."

**NLRB Interpretation:**
- Duty to bargain attaches when successor has hired majority of its **"substantial and representative complement"** of employees
- **Substantial complement:** Workforce sufficient to conduct normal business operations
- **Representative complement:** Workforce representative of ultimate composition (not merely skeletal startup crew)

**APPLICATION TO STOCK ACQUISITION:**

In **stock purchases** (Green Horizon acquires PCG stock):
- All employees automatically become employees of acquiring entity at closing
- Duty to bargain attaches **immediately at closing**
- No "reasonable time" delay (unlike asset purchase where successor gradually hires employees)

**CONCLUSION:** Green Horizon's bargaining obligation to UFCW Local 5 attaches on closing date (Q1 2026).

#### 5. Multi-Location Successorship

**Issue:** Does successorship apply separately to each dispensary, or to entire bargaining unit?

**NLRB Rule — Single Bargaining Unit:**
If predecessor had single multi-location bargaining unit (8 Bay Area dispensaries covered by one CBA), successor inherits obligation to entire unit.

**PCG Bargaining Unit:**
- 8 dispensaries: Oakland (3), San Francisco (2), Berkeley (1), Emeryville (1), San Jose (1)
- Single CBA covers all 420 employees
- UFCW Local 5 is certified representative for multi-location unit

**Green Horizon Obligation:**
- Recognize UFCW Local 5 for **all 8 locations** (cannot "cherry pick" which locations to recognize)
- Bargain over terms applicable to entire unit
- **Cannot:** Recognize union at some locations and refuse recognition at others within same bargaining unit

**Future Organizing at Non-Union Locations:**
- If UFCW Local 770 (Los Angeles) organizes PCG's LA dispensaries, separate bargaining unit
- Green Horizon would have obligation to bargain with **both** UFCW Local 5 (Bay Area) and UFCW Local 770 (Los Angeles)
- Each local negotiates separate CBA (though UFCW may coordinate pattern bargaining)

### B. UFCW CANNABIS ORGANIZING CAMPAIGNS AND UNION AVOIDANCE

#### 1. UFCW Organizing Strategy in Cannabis Industry

**United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Background:**
- 1.3 million members nationwide (retail, grocery, meatpacking, cannabis)
- Cannabis Organizing Department established 2010 (anticipating legalization wave)
- Active organizing in 23 states with legal cannabis programs
- Largest union representing cannabis workers (estimated 10,000+ members industry-wide)

**UFCW Cannabis Organizing Priorities:**
- **Multi-state operators (MSOs):** Target large employers like PCG with 40+ dispensaries
- **Dispensary-first strategy:** Retail locations easier to organize than cultivation (customer-facing, concentrated workforce)
- **Pattern bargaining:** Organize one location, leverage for chain-wide organizing
- **Social justice messaging:** Link cannabis legalization to worker rights, equity

**Typical Organizing Timeline:**
1. **Initial contact** (Weeks 1-4): Union representatives contact employees, distribute authorization cards
2. **Card check or petition** (Weeks 4-8):
   - **Card check:** If 50%+1 employees sign cards, employer may voluntarily recognize union (rare in cannabis)
   - **NLRB petition:** If 30%+ sign cards, union files RC petition with NLRB
3. **NLRB election** (Weeks 8-14): NLRB conducts secret ballot election; union needs simple majority (50%+1 of votes cast)
4. **Certification** (Week 15): If union wins, NLRB certifies union as exclusive bargaining representative
5. **First contract negotiations** (Months 4-18): Parties negotiate initial CBA

**Success Rates:**
- NLRB election win rate (cannabis industry): 65-75% (higher than overall private sector 50% rate)
- Factors: Young workforce, progressive political climate in legal cannabis states, employer unfamiliarity with labor relations

#### 2. UFCW Locals Active in PCG Markets

**California:**

| UFCW Local | Jurisdiction | Cannabis Employers Organized | PCG Exposure |
|------------|--------------|------------------------------|--------------|

**TOTAL NON-UNION EXPOSURE:** 34 dispensaries, 1,530 employees

#### 3. Organizing Indicators and Early Warning Signs

**Pre-Petition Activity (Employer May Observe):**
- Union representatives distributing literature outside dispensaries
- Employees meeting with union organizers (off-site, non-work hours)
- Increased employee complaints about wages, scheduling, working conditions
- Employee social media posts about unionization
- Anonymous letters/petitions to management about workplace issues

**NLRB Petition Filed (Public Information):**
- Union files RC (Representation Case) petition with NLRB Regional Office
- Petition identifies:
  - Employer name and address
  - Approximate number of employees in proposed bargaining unit
  - Union seeking to represent employees
  - Description of bargaining unit (e.g., "All retail employees at [dispensary address]")

**NLRB Regional Offices with Jurisdiction over PCG Locations:**
- **Region 20** (San Francisco): California locations
- **Region 27** (Denver): Colorado locations
- **Region 13** (Chicago): Illinois locations
- **Region 1** (Boston): Massachusetts locations
- **Region 28** (Phoenix): Nevada locations

**DUE DILIGENCE ACTION:**
Request from PCG:
- Any NLRB petitions filed at non-union locations (past 3 years)
- Any union organizing campaigns detected (internal reports, management memos)
- Employee relations issues at specific locations (high turnover, complaints, grievances)

#### 4. Financial Impact of Additional Unionization

**Assumptions:**
- 34 non-union dispensaries organize (UFCW wins elections at all locations)
- 1,530 employees affected
- Union wage/benefit premium: 18-25% above non-union comparables (based on current UFCW Local 5 CBA)

**Current Non-Union Compensation (PCG):**

| Position | Current Wage | Annual Hours | Annual Comp | Employees | Total Cost |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Budtender** | $18.50/hr | 2,080 | $38,480 | 1,020 | $39.2M |
| **Shift Supervisor** | $23.00/hr | 2,080 | $47,840 | 255 | $12.2M |

| **TOTAL** | - | - | - | **1,530** | **$65.9M** |

**Union Compensation (Projected based on UFCW Local 5 CBA):**

| Position | Union Wage | Annual Comp | Total Cost (1,530 EEs) | Increase |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------------|----------|
| **Budtender** | $22.00/hr (19% increase) | $45,760 | $46.7M | $7.5M |
| **Shift Supervisor** | $28.00/hr (22% increase) | $58,240 | $14.9M | $2.7M |
| **Store Manager** | $75,000 salary (15% increase) | $75,000 | $12.8M | $1.7M |
| **Support Staff** | $23.00/hr (18% increase) | $47,840 | $4.1M | $0.7M |
| **Subtotal Wages** | - | - | **$78.5M** | **$12.6M** |

**Enhanced Benefits (Union Premium):**

| Benefit | Non-Union Cost/EE | Union Cost/EE | Increase/EE | Total Increase (1,530 EEs) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Health Insurance** | $650/month ($7,800/yr) | $850/month ($10,200/yr) | $2,400/yr | $3.7M |
| **PTO** | 10 days ($750 value) | 15 days ($1,150 value) | $400/yr | $0.6M |
| **401(k) Match** | 3% ($1,200/yr avg) | 5% ($2,000/yr avg) | $800/yr | $1.2M |
| **Subtotal Benefits** | - | - | - | **$5.5M** |

**TOTAL ANNUAL COST INCREASE IF ALL 34 DISPENSARIES UNIONIZE:**
- **Wage increase:** $12.6M annually
- **Benefit increase:** $5.5M annually
- **TOTAL:** **$18.1M annually** (27% increase in labor costs for affected locations)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

| Scenario | Locations Organized | Employees Affected | Annual Cost Increase |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Low (25% organize)** | 9 dispensaries | 383 employees | $4.5M |
| **Medium (50% organize)** | 17 dispensaries | 765 employees | $9.1M |
| **High (75% organize)** | 26 dispensaries | 1,148 employees | $13.6M |
| **Maximum (100% organize)** | 34 dispensaries | 1,530 employees | $18.1M |

**Transaction Impact:**
- Post-closing EBITDA reduction: $4.5M - $18.1M (11% - 43% of current $42M EBITDA)
- Valuation impact (6x EBITDA multiple): $27M - $109M reduction in enterprise value
- Deal consideration: May warrant purchase price adjustment if organizing campaigns active

#### 5. Lawful Union Avoidance Strategies

**Permitted Employer Conduct Under NLRA:**

**Competitive Compensation and Benefits:**
- Match or exceed union wages at 90-95% (reduces economic incentive to unionize)
- Proactive wage increases (permissible if not timed to interfere with organizing campaign)
- Enhanced benefits (health insurance, PTO, retirement) at non-union locations
- **CAUTION:** Cannot announce new benefits during active organizing campaign (NLRB views as unlawful promise)

**Employee Engagement Programs:**
- Regular town halls, open-door policies, employee feedback surveys
- Supervisory training on positive employee relations
- Grievance procedures (non-union complaint resolution)
- Employee committees (advisory only; cannot become de facto union)

**Communication About Unionization:**
- Employer may share factual information about unionization process
- Topics permitted:
  - Union dues costs (2.5% of wages = $1,200/year average)
  - Strike history of UFCW (e.g., Harborside Oakland 2019 strike)
  - Collective bargaining does not guarantee specific outcomes
  - Employer's preference for direct relationship with employees

**NLRB Section 8(c) — Free Speech Protection:**
> "The expressing of any views, argument, or opinion... shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice... if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit."

**Prohibited Employer Conduct — "TIPS" Violations:**

| Violation | Examples | NLRB Remedy |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Threats** | "If union comes in, we'll close this location" | Bargaining order (union certified without election) |
| **Interrogation** | "Are you planning to vote for the union?" | Cease and desist order; employee reinstatement if discharged |
| **Promises** | "Vote no and we'll give you raises" | Bargaining order; back pay |
| **Surveillance** | Manager spies on union organizing meeting | Cease and desist; notice posting |

**Case Law — NLRB Cannabis Organizing Cases:**

While NLRB case law specific to cannabis is limited (industry relatively new), general organizing principles apply:

**Employer Campaign Restrictions:**
- **24-hour rule:** Employer cannot hold captive audience meetings within 24 hours of election
- **Laboratory conditions:** Employer conduct must not interfere with employees' free choice
- **Objectionable conduct:** Threats, promises, surveillance, interrogation invalidate election results

**Recent NLRB Developments (2023-2024):**
- NLRB General Counsel issued guidance strengthening enforcement of anti-union conduct
- Increased scrutiny of employer "union avoidance" consultants
- Faster election timelines (median 28 days from petition to election, down from 45+ days)

**RECOMMENDATION FOR GREEN HORIZON:**

**Proactive Labor Relations Strategy:**
1. **Compensation benchmarking:** Conduct market survey; ensure PCG non-union wages at 90%+ of UFCW Local 5 rates
2. **Supervisory training:** Train all dispensary managers on:
   - Recognizing organizing activity (without surveillance)
   - TIPS violations (what NOT to do)
   - Positive employee relations (addressing complaints, open-door policy)
3. **Employee relations audit:** Identify high-risk locations (high turnover, complaints, low morale)
4. **Rapid response protocol:** If organizing campaign detected:
   - Engage labor counsel immediately
   - Prepare lawful communication campaign
   - Train management on NLRA restrictions
5. **Consider neutrality agreement:** In exchange for UFCW cooperation in 2026 CBA negotiations (UFCW Local 5), Green Horizon could agree to card check neutrality at specific locations (controversial, but reduces election litigation risk)

### C. 2026 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS

#### 1. Bargaining Timeline and Legal Obligations

**Current CBA Expiration:** December 31, 2026

**NLRA Section 8(d) — Notice Requirements:**
> "Either party desiring to terminate or modify [a collective bargaining agreement] shall serve written notice upon the other party to the contract 60 days prior to the expiration date thereof..."

**Key Dates:**

| Date | Event | Legal Obligation |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **November 1, 2026** | Notice deadline | Either party must notify if seeking to modify/terminate CBA (60 days before expiration) |
| **Mid-2026** | Negotiations begin | Parties typically begin negotiating 6-9 months before expiration |
| **December 31, 2026** | CBA expires | Absent new agreement, status quo terms continue (employers cannot make unilateral changes) |
| **Post-expiration** | Continued bargaining | Duty to bargain continues until impasse or agreement reached |

**Good Faith Bargaining Requirement (NLRA § 8(d)):**
- Meet at reasonable times
- Confer in good faith over wages, hours, terms/conditions of employment
- Execute written agreement incorporating terms agreed upon
- **No obligation to agree** to proposals or make concessions

**Impasse:**
- Parties reach deadlock (no movement on core issues)
- After impasse, employer may implement last offer (must be reasonable, consistent with bargaining positions)
- Union may strike after impasse

#### 2. Anticipated UFCW Demands — Cannabis Industry Benchmarking

**UFCW Cannabis Contract Comparables:**

Based on publicly available UFCW cannabis CBAs (2022-2024):

**Wage Increases:**

| Employer | Location | UFCW Local | Contract Term | Wage Increases | Annual Average |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Harborside** | Oakland, CA | Local 5 | 2022-2025 | 3%, 3.5%, 4% (years 1-3) | 3.5% |
| **MedMen** | Los Angeles | Local 770 | 2021-2024 | 4%, 4%, 5% | 4.3% |
| **Curaleaf** | New Jersey | Local 360 | 2023-2026 | 5%, 5%, 5% | 5.0% |
| **Rise Dispensaries** | Illinois | Local 881 | 2023-2026 | 4.5%, 5%, 5.5% | 5.0% |

**Industry Trend:** Cannabis CBAs negotiated 2023-2024 average **4-5% annual wage increases** (higher than overall private sector 2.5-3%)

**Factors Driving Higher Increases:**
- Inflation (2021-2024: 15% cumulative CPI increase)
- Tight labor market for experienced budtenders (retail worker shortage)
- UFCW leverage (strike threat credible in customer-facing retail)

**Projected UFCW Local 5 Demands (2026 Negotiations):**

**Wages:**
- **Year 1 (2027):** 5% increase across all classifications
- **Year 2 (2028):** 5% increase
- **Year 3 (2029):** 5.5% increase
- **Total over 3 years:** 15.5% cumulative increase

**Current vs. Projected Union Wages (Bay Area — 420 UFCW Local 5 Members):**

| Position | Current (2024-2026 CBA) | Year 1 (2027) | Year 2 (2028) | Year 3 (2029) |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Budtender (entry)** | $22.00/hr | $23.10/hr | $24.26/hr | $25.59/hr |
| **Budtender (3+ years)** | $28.00/hr | $29.40/hr | $30.87/hr | $32.57/hr |
| **Shift Supervisor** | $32.00/hr | $33.60/hr | $35.28/hr | $37.22/hr |
| **Store Manager** | $75,000/yr | $78,750/yr | $82,688/yr | $87,236/yr |

**Annual Wage Cost (420 Employees):**

| Year | Total Wages | Increase vs. 2026 | Cumulative Increase |
|------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **2026 (current CBA)** | $11.8M | - | - |
| **2027** | $12.4M | $0.6M (5%) | $0.6M |
| **2028** | $13.0M | $0.6M (5%) | $1.2M |
| **2029** | $13.7M | $0.7M (5.5%) | $1.9M |

**Health Insurance:**

**Current CBA:** Employer pays $850/month per employee ($10,200/year)

**Union Demand:**
- Increase to $950/month ($11,400/year) to cover premium inflation
- Add fertility benefits, mental health coverage enhancements
- **Cost increase:** $100/month × 420 employees = $42,000/month = **$504,000 annually**

**Paid Time Off:**

**Current CBA:** 15 days PTO (year 1), 20 days (year 3+)

**Union Demand:**
- Increase to 18 days PTO (year 1), 25 days (year 3+)
- Add 5 days paid family leave (supplement to California CFRA)
- **Cost increase:** 3-5 additional PTO days × 420 employees × average daily wage ($176/day) = **$295,000 annually**

**Retirement:**

**Current CBA:** 5% 401(k) match

**Union Demand:**
- Increase to 6% match (1% increase)
- **Cost increase:** 1% × average salary ($43,000) × 420 employees = **$180,000 annually**

**Job Security Provisions:**

**Current CBA:** Just cause termination; 30-day notice for layoffs

**Union Demand:**
- Strengthen successorship language (require future acquirers to assume CBA)
- Anti-subcontracting clause (cannot subcontract bargaining unit work)
- "Red circle" wage protection (employees not reduced below current wage if job reclassified)

**Total Projected Cost Increase (2027-2029):**

| Component | Year 1 (2027) | Year 2 (2028) | Year 3 (2029) | 3-Year Total |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Wage increases** | $0.6M | $0.6M | $0.7M | $1.9M |
| **Health insurance** | $0.5M | $0.5M | $0.5M | $1.5M |
| **PTO enhancements** | $0.3M | $0.3M | $0.3M | $0.9M |
| **401(k) increase** | $0.2M | $0.2M | $0.2M | $0.6M |
| **TOTAL INCREASE** | **$1.6M** | **$1.6M** | **$1.7M** | **$4.9M** |

**As % of Current Union Labor Cost ($11.8M wages + $3.6M benefits = $15.4M):**
- Year 1: 10.4% increase
- Year 2: 10.4% increase
- Year 3: 11.0% increase
- **3-year cumulative: 31.8% increase** in total compensation cost for unionized workforce

#### 3. Strike Risk Assessment

**UFCW Strike History — Cannabis Sector:**

| Employer | Location | UFCW Local | Strike Date | Duration | Outcome |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Harborside** | Oakland | Local 5 | Nov 2019 | 14 days | Union victory; CBA ratified with 4% annual increases |
| **Emerald Fields** | Colorado | Local 7 | Jan 2021 | 3 days | Settlement; CBA ratified |
| **Alternative Herbal Health** | Los Angeles | Local 770 | Aug 2022 | 7 days | Union victory; first contract |

**Strike Impact Analysis:**

**Revenue Loss:**
- 8 Bay Area dispensaries generate average $42,000/day revenue per location
- Total daily revenue: $336,000 (8 locations × $42K)
- **2-week strike:** $4.7M revenue loss
- **4-week strike:** $9.4M revenue loss

**Customer Defection:**
- Customers seek alternative dispensaries during strike (competitive Bay Area market)
- Estimated permanent customer loss: 10-15% after prolonged strike

**Reputational Harm:**
- Cannabis industry values social justice, worker rights
- Strike generates negative press (local media, trade publications)
- May impact California licensing (labor peace factor in some municipalities)

**Strike Probability (2026-2027 Negotiations):**

| Scenario | Probability | Conditions |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **No strike** | 65% | Green Horizon accepts UFCW demands (4-5% annual increases), negotiations conclude before CBA expiration |
| **Brief strike (3-7 days)** | 25% | Parties reach impasse on key issue (e.g., wage increase percentage), short strike pressures settlement |
| **Extended strike (14+ days)** | 10% | Fundamental disagreement (e.g., Green Horizon proposes wage freeze, subcontracting), prolonged strike |

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Early engagement with UFCW Local 5 (6-9 months before expiration)
- Transparency about company financial performance (cannabis industry margin pressure)
- Pattern following (match recent UFCW cannabis CBAs: 4-5% annual increases)
- Interest-based bargaining (collaborative approach vs. positional bargaining)

| **Slips/trips/falls** | Spills, customer congestion | 1910.22 | Sprains, fractures |

#### 2. PCG Safety Record and OSHA Compliance Status

**FY2024 Injury/Illness Statistics (Per PCG Safety Data):**

| Facility Type | Employees | OSHA Recordables | DART Cases | TRIR | DART Rate |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|------------|------|-----------|
| **Cultivation** | 800 | 8 | 4 | 2.0 | 1.0 |
| **Manufacturing** | 600 | 3 | 2 | 1.0 | 0.7 |
| **Retail** | 950 | 1 | 0 | 0.2 | 0.0 |
| **TOTAL** | **2,350** | **12** | **6** | **1.0** | **0.5** |

**Definitions:**
- **OSHA Recordable:** Injury/illness requiring medical treatment beyond first aid
- **DART:** Days Away, Restricted, or Transferred (more serious subset of recordables)
- **TRIR:** Total Recordable Incident Rate (per 100 full-time equivalents)
- **DART Rate:** DART cases per 100 FTEs

**Industry Benchmarks (BLS Data — NAICS 1114, Food Manufacturing, Retail Trade):**

| Industry | TRIR (2023) | DART Rate (2023) |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Agriculture (cultivation proxy)** | 5.2 | 2.4 |
| **Food Manufacturing (extraction proxy)** | 3.8 | 1.9 |
| **Retail Trade (dispensaries)** | 3.0 | 1.2 |

**PCG Performance vs. Industry:**
- PCG TRIR (1.0) significantly **lower** than industry averages (3.0-5.2)
- PCG DART Rate (0.5) significantly **lower** than industry averages (1.2-2.4)
- **Conclusion:** PCG safety performance above average (fewer injuries than comparable industries)

**Serious Injury Incident (FY2024):**

**Extraction Technician Chemical Exposure (Monterey Facility — June 2024):**
- Employee exposed to butane vapors during hydrocarbon extraction process
- Equipment malfunction (pressure relief valve failure) released butane into closed-loop system
- Employee experienced dizziness, respiratory distress; hospitalized overnight
- OSHA recordable (1 day away from work)
- Root cause: Inadequate preventive maintenance on extraction equipment

**Corrective Actions Taken:**
- Enhanced preventive maintenance schedule (monthly vs. quarterly inspections)
- Added continuous butane monitoring system (alarm at 10% LEL)
- Retrained all extraction technicians on emergency response procedures

**OSHA Investigation:**
- No OSHA inspection triggered (employee did not file complaint, incident not fatal/catastrophic)
- PCG voluntarily reported incident to OSHA via 300 Log (annual filing requirement)

#### 3. OSHA Enforcement in Cannabis Industry

**Federal OSHA Jurisdictional Issue:**

**Cannabis is federally illegal (Schedule I controlled substance)**
- OSHA is federal agency (U.S. Department of Labor)
- **OSHA position:** Cannabis employers subject to OSHA standards despite federal illegality of product
- OSHA conducts inspections, issues citations at cannabis facilities in states where state OSHA programs inactive

**State OSHA Programs (State Plan States):**

23 states operate OSHA-approved state plans with jurisdiction over private employers. PCG states:

| State | OSHA Program | Cannabis Enforcement |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| **California** | Cal/OSHA (state plan) | Active enforcement; cannabis-specific guidance issued (2019) |
| **Colorado** | Federal OSHA (state plan covers public sector only) | Federal OSHA has jurisdiction; limited cannabis inspections |
| **Illinois** | Federal OSHA | Federal OSHA has jurisdiction |
| **Massachusetts** | Federal OSHA | Federal OSHA has jurisdiction |
| **Nevada** | Nevada OSHA (state plan) | Active enforcement; treats cannabis like any other employer |

**OSHA Cannabis Citations (Publicly Reported Cases 2020-2024):**

While comprehensive OSHA citation data for cannabis is not centrally published, reported cases include:

| Employer | State | Violation | Citation | Penalty | Year |
|----------|-------|-----------|----------|---------|------|
| **[Anonymous Extractor]** | California | 1910.119 (Process Safety Management) — Failed to conduct hazard analysis for butane extraction | Serious | $18,500 | 2021 |
| **[Cannabis Cultivator]** | Oregon | 1910.134 (Respiratory Protection) — No fit testing for employees using pesticide respirators | Serious | $7,200 | 2022 |
| **[Dispensary Chain]** | Nevada | 1910.22 (Walking/Working Surfaces) — Wet floors, inadequate signage | Other-Than-Serious | $2,500 | 2023 |

**Common Violations:**
- **Chemical exposure:** Lack of respiratory protection, inadequate ventilation
- **Process safety:** Extraction operations without hazard analysis
- **Ergonomic:** Repetitive motion injuries in trimming operations (General Duty Clause)

**Penalty Ranges:**
- **Other-Than-Serious:** $0 - $16,131 per violation
- **Serious:** $1,019 - $16,131 per violation
- **Willful/Repeat:** $10,190 - $161,323 per violation

**PCG Exposure:**
Based on 12 OSHA recordables, no prior citations:
- **Low risk** of significant OSHA penalties absent catastrophic incident
- **Proactive safety program** (below industry average injury rates) mitigates risk

#### 4. Cal/OSHA Cannabis-Specific Guidance

**Cal/OSHA Cannabis Guidelines (2019):**

California Division of Occupational Safety and Health issued guidance for cannabis industry employers:

**Key Requirements:**

**Injury and Illness Prevention Program (8 CCR § 3203):**
- Written safety program identifying workplace hazards
- Hazard correction procedures
- Safety training for all employees
- Recordkeeping (OSHA 300 Log, incident investigations)

**Hazard-Specific Standards:**

| Hazard | Cal/OSHA Standard | Cannabis Application |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Pesticide exposure** | 8 CCR § 5194 (HazCom) | Safety Data Sheets, training, PPE for applicators |
| **Confined spaces** | 8 CCR § 5157 | Permit system for extraction vessels, grow rooms |
| **Electrical safety** | 8 CCR § 2299, 2340.2 | Lockout/tagout for grow light maintenance |
| **Violence prevention** | 8 CCR § 3342 (workplace violence — retail) | Security measures, employee training for dispensaries |

**Workplace Violence Prevention (New 2024 Requirement):**

**8 CCR § 3342 (effective July 1, 2024):**
Applies to retail establishments (including dispensaries):
- Conduct workplace violence hazard assessment
- Implement violence prevention plan (security measures, escape routes, employee training)
- Maintain violent incident log
- Annual training for all employees

**PCG Compliance Status:**
- PCG has written IIPP (Injury and Illness Prevention Program)
- Hazard-specific programs in place (HazCom, confined space, electrical safety)
- Workplace violence prevention plan implemented at all 26 California dispensaries (July 2024)

**DUE DILIGENCE RECOMMENDATION:**
- Review PCG's IIPP and hazard-specific programs for adequacy
- Verify workplace violence prevention plan compliance (new 2024 requirement)
- Inspect OSHA 300 Logs for all facilities (past 5 years) to identify incident trends

### E. DRUG TESTING AND IMPAIRMENT — CANNABIS EMPLOYER PARADOX

#### 1. The Cannabis Employer Dilemma

**Unique Legal Challenge:**
Cannabis employers face a paradox:
- Employees produce/sell federally illegal substance (Schedule I controlled substance)
- Employees may legally consume cannabis off-duty under state law
- Employers must maintain workplace safety (prohibit on-duty impairment)
- **Question:** Can cannabis employer test employees for cannabis use?

#### 2. State Law Protection for Off-Duty Conduct

**Lawful Off-Duty Activities Statutes:**

| State | Statute | Cannabis Protection | Case Law |
|-------|---------|---------------------|----------|
| **California** | Lab. Code § 1102.5 (whistleblower), no general off-duty conduct statute | **NO** explicit protection for off-duty cannabis | *Ross v. RagingWire* (2008) — No protection under Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) |
| **Colorado** | C.R.S. § 24-34-402.5 (lawful off-duty activities) | **NO** protection; cannabis use not "lawful" | *Coats v. Dish Network* (2015) — Off-duty medical cannabis use not protected |
| **Illinois** | 410 ILCS 130/10 (Cannabis Regulation Act) | **LIMITED** protection — Cannot penalize registered medical cannabis patients unless federal law/contract requires | Employers may prohibit impairment; drug testing permitted |
| **Massachusetts** | M.G.L. c. 94G § 4 (Cannabis Control Act) | **LIMITED** protection — Cannot discriminate against medical cannabis users except safety-sensitive positions | Employers may prohibit impairment; drug testing permitted |
| **Nevada** | NRS 678C.450 | **YES** protection (strongest in US) — Cannot refuse to hire or penalize employee for off-duty cannabis use (exceptions: safety-sensitive positions, federal contract positions) | Effective 2020; employers cannot test for cannabis in pre-employment screening (except safety-sensitive) |

**Key California Case Law:**

##### *Ross v. RagingWire Telecommunications*, 42 Cal. 4th 920 (2008)

**Facts:**
- Ross employed by RagingWire; used medical cannabis (authorized under California Compassionate Use Act)
- RagingWire tested Ross; he tested positive for cannabis
- RagingWire terminated Ross for violating drug-free workplace policy
- Ross sued for wrongful termination, claiming discrimination against medical cannabis user

**Holding:**
California Supreme Court held **no protection** for off-duty cannabis use:

> "The Compassionate Use Act only provides protection from criminal prosecution for use of marijuana for medical purposes... It does not require employers to accommodate medical marijuana use."

> "Federal law, in the form of the Controlled Substances Act, preempts California law to the extent it purports to create a right to be free from employment discrimination for medical marijuana use."

**Implication for Cannabis Employers:**
- California employers (including cannabis employers) **may** terminate employees for off-duty cannabis use
- Even medical cannabis use with physician authorization not protected
- Employer drug testing policies enforceable against cannabis-using employees

##### *Coats v. Dish Network*, 350 P.3d 849 (Colo. 2015)

**Facts:**
- Coats quadriplegic; used medical cannabis (authorized under Colorado law)
- Dish Network tested Coats; he tested positive for cannabis
- Dish Network terminated Coats for violating drug-free workplace policy
- Coats sued under Colorado lawful off-duty activities statute (C.R.S. § 24-34-402.5)

**Holding:**
Colorado Supreme Court held **no protection** for off-duty cannabis use:

> "The term 'lawful' refers only to those activities that are lawful under both state and federal law... Because marijuana use remains illegal under federal law, it cannot be a 'lawful activity' under the statute."

**Implication:**
- Colorado "lawful off-duty activities" statute does not protect cannabis use (federally illegal)
- Employers may enforce drug-free workplace policies prohibiting cannabis use

**Contrast: Nevada's Explicit Protection**

Nevada enacted strongest pro-cannabis employee protection (effective 2020):

**NRS 678C.450:**
> "It is unlawful for an employer to refuse to hire a prospective employee because the prospective employee submitted to a screening test and the results indicated the presence of marijuana."

**Exceptions:**
- **Safety-sensitive positions:** Firefighters, EMTs, positions requiring driving/operating heavy machinery
- **Federal contract positions:** Positions requiring compliance with federal law (e.g., DOT-regulated positions)

**Implication:**
- Nevada cannabis employers **cannot** refuse to hire applicants who test positive for cannabis (pre-employment screening)
- **May** prohibit on-duty impairment; post-accident testing permitted

#### 3. Cannabis Impairment Testing Challenge

**THC Detection Problem:**

**Urine Testing (Most Common):**
- Detects **THC-COOH** (inactive metabolite) stored in fat cells
- Detectable 3-30 days after last use (chronic users: 30+ days)
- **Not probative of current impairment** (metabolite remains after psychoactive effects dissipate)

**Blood Testing:**
- Detects **active THC** (psychoactive compound)
- THC blood levels peak 3-10 minutes after inhalation; decline within 2-4 hours
- Correlation between blood THC level and impairment disputed (no consensus "legal limit" like alcohol 0.08%)

**Saliva Testing:**
- Detects active THC in oral fluid
- Detection window: 4-24 hours after use
- Better indicator of recent use, but impairment correlation still uncertain

**No "Breathalyzer" Equivalent:**
- Unlike alcohol (breath test correlates with blood alcohol content and impairment), no reliable roadside-style test for cannabis impairment
- Research ongoing (e.g., Hound Labs breathalyzer prototype); no FDA-approved device for workplace use

**Reasonable Suspicion Standards:**

Employers rely on **observable signs of impairment**:
- Bloodshot eyes
- Odor of cannabis
- Slurred speech
- Poor coordination
- Erratic behavior
- Inability to perform job tasks

**NLRB and Union Considerations:**
- Drug testing of unionized employees is **mandatory subject of bargaining** (NLRB rule)
- Employer cannot implement drug testing program without bargaining with union
- **PCG-UFCW Local 5 CBA** likely contains drug testing provisions (should be reviewed)

#### 4. PCG Drug Testing Policy Analysis

**Current Policy (Per Due Diligence Materials):**

**Pre-Employment Testing:**
- **No** testing for cannabis (all positions)
- **Tests for:** Opioids, cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamines, PCP
- Rationale: Cannabis legal in all PCG operating states; testing for cannabis would disqualify large applicant pool

**Safety-Sensitive Positions:**
- **Post-accident testing:** Required for accidents involving injury, property damage (e.g., forklift operator hits pallet rack, extraction equipment malfunction)
- Tests for: Cannabis, opioids, cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamines, alcohol
- **Reasonable suspicion testing:** Supervisor may require testing if observable signs of impairment

**On-Duty Conduct:**
- Policy prohibits on-duty use, possession, impairment (cannabis and all other controlled substances)
- Violation grounds for termination (just cause under UFCW CBA)

**Medical Cannabis Accommodation:**
- No affirmative accommodation required (per *Ross v. RagingWire*)
- Employees using medical cannabis off-duty subject to same testing as other employees

**Policy Compliance Assessment:**

| State | Policy Compliance | Risk |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| **California** | Compliant (*Ross v. RagingWire* permits testing) | **LOW** — Policy lawful |
| **Colorado** | Compliant (*Coats v. Dish Network* permits testing) | **LOW** — Policy lawful |
| **Illinois** | Compliant (policy prohibits impairment, not off-duty use; medical cannabis users not discriminated against) | **LOW** — Policy compliant with 410 ILCS 130/10 |
| **Massachusetts** | Compliant (similar to Illinois; medical cannabis users not penalized for off-duty use absent impairment) | **LOW** — Policy compliant with M.G.L. c. 94G § 4 |
| **Nevada** | **NON-COMPLIANT** if post-accident testing conducted after non-safety-sensitive employee tests positive | **MODERATE** — Nevada prohibits penalizing employees for positive cannabis test (NRS 678C.450) |

**Nevada Risk Mitigation:**
- Clarify "safety-sensitive" positions (extraction technicians, forklift operators, delivery drivers)
- Post-accident testing only for safety-sensitive positions (or federal contract positions)
- Non-safety-sensitive employees (budtenders, corporate staff) subject to reasonable suspicion testing only (observable impairment)

---

### F. WAGE AND HOUR COMPLIANCE — CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC

#### 1. California Meal and Rest Break Requirements

**California Labor Code §§ 512, 226.7:**

**Meal Breaks:**
- **5+ hours worked:** 30-minute unpaid meal break (must be provided before end of 5th hour)
- **10+ hours worked:** Second 30-minute meal break (before end of 10th hour)
- **Exceptions:** Employee may waive first meal break if shift 6 hours or less; may waive second meal break if shift 12 hours or less (and first meal break taken)

**Rest Breaks:**
- **4+ hours worked:** 10-minute paid rest break (one per 4-hour period or major fraction thereof)
- **6+ hours:** 2 rest breaks
- **10+ hours:** 3 rest breaks

**Premium Pay for Violations:**
- **1 hour of pay** at employee's regular rate for each day meal or rest break not provided
- Separate premium for each violation (meal break violation = 1 hour; rest break violation = 1 hour; both = 2 hours premium pay)

**Employer Obligations:**
- **Provide** opportunity for meal/rest breaks (cannot require employee to work through break)
- **Authorize and permit** breaks (implicit in allowing employee to leave workstation)
- **Relieve employee of all duties** during meal break (employee must be free to leave premises)

**"On-Duty" Meal Breaks (Limited Exception):**
- Permitted only if:
  - Nature of work prevents relief from all duties (e.g., sole employee on duty at remote location)
  - Employee voluntarily agrees in writing
  - Agreement revocable at any time
- Meal break counted as "hours worked" (paid)

#### 2. PCG Meal/Rest Break Compliance — Retail Dispensaries

**Dispensary Operations (950 California Retail Employees):**

**Typical Shifts:**
- Budtenders: 8-hour shifts (10:00 AM - 6:00 PM, 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM)
- Shift supervisors: 8-10 hour shifts
- Store managers: Exempt (salaried, not entitled to meal/rest breaks)

**Break Schedule (8-Hour Shift Example):**
- **10:00 AM:** Clock in
- **12:00 PM:** First 10-minute rest break
- **2:00 PM:** 30-minute meal break
- **4:00 PM:** Second 10-minute rest break
- **6:00 PM:** Clock out

**Compliance Challenges:**

| Challenge | Risk | Mitigation |
|-----------|------|------------|
| **Understaffing:** Dispensary busy, budtender cannot leave register | Meal break not provided; 1 hour premium pay owed | Ensure adequate staffing (minimum 2 budtenders per shift); stagger breaks |
| **Late meal break:** Budtender takes meal break at hour 5:30 (past end of 5th hour) | Meal break not timely; 1 hour premium pay owed | Timekeeping system alerts supervisor if meal break not started by hour 4:45 |
| **Interrupted meal break:** Customer emergency during budtender's meal break; budtender called back to floor | Meal break not duty-free; 1 hour premium pay owed | "Do not disturb" policy; designate backup for coverage |
| **Rest break not taken:** Budtender skips rest break voluntarily (wants to leave early) | Rest break not provided; 1 hour premium pay owed (even if voluntary) | Supervisor must ensure breaks taken; cannot allow employee to skip |

**PCG Timekeeping System:**
- Automated meal break tracking (employee clocks out/in for meal break)
- System alerts supervisor if meal break not started within 5 hours
- Manual attestation by employee (certifies breaks provided or premium pay paid)

**Audit Findings (Per Due Diligence):**
- **FY2024:** 48 meal/rest break violations (950 employees, 247 work days = 234,650 employee-days; 0.02% violation rate)
- Premium pay totaling $6,720 paid (48 violations × average $140 premium)
- **Conclusion:** Low violation rate; policy generally compliant

**PAGA Risk:**
If violations systemic (not isolated), employees may bring Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) claim:
- **PAGA penalties:** $100 per employee per pay period (initial violation); $200 per employee per pay period (subsequent violations)
- **Exposure calculation (hypothetical):** 950 employees × 24 pay periods (FY2024) = 22,800 employee-pay periods × $100 = $2.28M (maximum PAGA exposure if violations found to be systemic)
- **Actual risk:** Low based on 0.02% violation rate; isolated violations unlikely to support PAGA claim

#### 3. California Overtime Requirements

**California Lab. Code § 510 — Daily and Weekly Overtime:**

| Hours Worked | Overtime Rate |
|--------------|---------------|
| **8+ hours in a day** | 1.5× regular rate |
| **12+ hours in a day** | 2× regular rate |
| **40+ hours in a week** | 1.5× regular rate |
| **7th consecutive day of work** | 1.5× regular rate (first 8 hours); 2× regular rate (8+ hours) |

**Calculation Example (Budtender — $18.50/hr):**

**Day 1:** 10 hours worked
- Regular pay: 8 hours × $18.50 = $148.00
- Overtime pay: 2 hours × $27.75 (1.5×) = $55.50
- **Total:** $203.50

**Daily vs. Weekly Overtime:**
- California requires **both** daily and weekly overtime (unlike federal FLSA, which only requires weekly)
- Employer must calculate **daily** overtime first, then add **weekly** overtime (for hours not already paid at overtime rate)

**Exempt Employees (Not Entitled to Overtime):**

California employs stricter exemption tests than federal FLSA:

**Executive Exemption:**
- **Duties:** Manage enterprise or department; supervise 2+ FTE employees; authority to hire/fire (or recommendations given particular weight)
- **Salary:** $66,560/year minimum (2024; 2× California minimum wage for full-time employment)
- **Discretion:** Customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment

**PCG Exempt Employees:**
- Store managers ($75,000 salary): Exempt (manage dispensary, supervise 8-12 budtenders, hire/fire authority)
- Cultivation managers ($80,000 salary): Exempt
- Extraction managers ($85,000 salary): Exempt
- Corporate staff ($70,000+ salary): Exempt (administrative exemption)

**PCG Non-Exempt Employees:**
- Budtenders: Non-exempt (hourly, no supervisory duties)
- Shift supervisors: Non-exempt (supervise fewer than 2 FTE employees; California rule)
- Cultivation workers: Non-exempt (hourly, manual labor)
- Extraction technicians: Non-exempt (hourly, technical work but no independent judgment)

**Overtime Audit Findings (Per Due Diligence):**
- FY2024 overtime expenses: $4.2M (950 non-exempt retail employees; average 3 hours OT/week)
- No misclassification issues identified (all non-exempt employees properly paid overtime)
- **Conclusion:** Compliant

#### 4. Predictive Scheduling — California Local Ordinances

**Predictive Scheduling Laws (Select California Cities):**

| City | Ordinance | Requirements | Penalties |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **San Francisco** | Retail Workers Bill of Rights (SF Admin. Code Art. 33F) | 14-day advance schedule; $25-$75 premium for schedule changes | $50-$500 per violation |
| **Los Angeles** | Fair Work Week Ordinance (LAMC § 187.02) | 14-day advance schedule; 1-4 hours premium pay for schedule changes | $500-$1,000 per violation |
| **Emeryville** | Fair Workweek Ordinance (EMC § 5-37) | 14-day advance schedule; 1-4 hours premium pay for schedule changes | $50-$500 per violation |

**PCG Exposure:**
- **San Francisco (2 dispensaries):** Subject to SF Retail Workers Bill of Rights
- **Emeryville (1 dispensary):** Subject to Emeryville Fair Workweek Ordinance
- **Oakland (3 dispensaries):** No predictive scheduling law (statewide law proposed but not enacted)

**San Francisco Compliance Requirements:**

**Advance Scheduling:**
- Employer must post schedule 14 days in advance (2 weeks' notice)
- **Penalty:** "Predictability pay" if schedule changed with less than 7 days' notice:
  - Less than 24 hours' notice: $75 premium
  - 24 hours to 7 days' notice: $25 premium

**Right to Request Scheduling Changes:**
- Employees may request specific shifts, hours (employer must consider; no obligation to grant)

**Right to Rest (Clopening Penalty):**
- If employee works "clopening" shift (closing shift followed by opening shift with less than 11 hours' rest), employee entitled to 1.5× pay for opening shift (unless employee consents)

**PCG Compliance Status:**
- Scheduling software implemented (generates 14-day advance schedules)
- FY2024: 12 schedule change penalties paid ($300 total; 12 × $25 average)
- **Conclusion:** Generally compliant; minimal violations

**DUE DILIGENCE RECOMMENDATION:**
- Review scheduling practices at San Francisco, Emeryville dispensaries
- Verify timekeeping system tracks predictability pay owed
- Audit compliance with clopening rest requirements

### G. WARN ACT AND POST-ACQUISITION RESTRUCTURING

#### 1. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN)

**29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109:**

**WARN Triggers:**

| Event | Threshold | Notice Required |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Plant closing** | Permanent/temporary shutdown of single site affecting 50+ employees | 60 days' advance written notice |
| **Mass layoff** | (1) 50-499 employees laid off (AND 33%+ of workforce at site), OR (2) 500+ employees laid off | 60 days' advance written notice |

**Coverage:**
- Employers with 100+ employees (full-time or full-time + part-time working 4,000+ hours/week aggregate)
- Employees: All hourly, salaried workers (includes managers)
- Excludes: Independent contractors, business partners

**Notice Recipients:**
- Affected employees (individual written notice)
- Union representatives (if employees represented)
- State dislocated worker unit
- Local government (chief elected official)

**Exceptions (No 60-Day Notice Required):**

| Exception | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Faltering company** | Employer actively seeking capital/business to avoid closure; reasonable belief that giving notice would preclude obtaining capital |
| **Unforeseeable business circumstances** | Sudden, dramatic, unexpected events beyond employer control (e.g., major customer bankruptcy) |
| **Natural disaster** | Flood, earthquake, fire (disaster directly causes closure) |

**Penalties for WARN Violations:**

- **Back pay:** Up to 60 days' wages for each affected employee
- **Benefits:** 60 days of benefit contributions (health insurance, etc.)
- **Civil penalty:** $500/day to local government (max $30,000)
- **Attorney's fees:** If employees prevail in suit

**Calculation Example (100-Employee Facility Closure, No Notice):**
- Average wage: $22/hr × 8 hours/day × 60 days = $10,560/employee
- 100 employees × $10,560 = **$1,056,000 back pay liability**
- Benefits: 100 employees × $850/month × 2 months = **$170,000**
- Civil penalty: $500/day × 60 days = **$30,000**
- **TOTAL:** **$1,256,000**

#### 2. WARN Act in M&A Context

**General Rule:**
Acquisition does **not** trigger WARN if:
- Employees retained by successor (no employment loss)
- Operations continue at same site

**When WARN Applies in M&A:**

| Scenario | WARN Trigger | Notice Obligation |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Asset purchase + facility closure** | Seller closes facility; 50+ employees permanently separated | **Seller** must give 60-day notice before closing |
| **Post-acquisition layoffs** | Buyer acquires company, then lays off 50+ employees within 90 days | **Buyer** deemed successor employer; must give 60-day notice |
| **Consolidation of operations** | Buyer closes acquired facility, moves operations to buyer's existing facility | **Buyer** must give 60-day notice if 50+ employees not offered transfer or decline transfer |
| **Stock purchase + immediate layoffs** | Buyer acquires stock, immediately lays off 50+ employees | **Buyer** must give 60-day notice |

**90-Day Aggregation Rule (20 CFR § 639.5):**
If two or more employment losses occur within any 90-day period, they are **aggregated** for WARN purposes (even if each individually below WARN threshold).

**Example:**
- Buyer acquires PCG (Q1 2026)
- Day 30 post-closing: Buyer lays off 40 cultivation workers (Humboldt facility)
- Day 60 post-closing: Buyer lays off 30 manufacturing workers (Monterey facility)
- **Result:** 70 employees laid off within 90 days → WARN triggered (mass layoff threshold met)

**Exception:** Not aggregated if employer demonstrates employment losses result from separate and distinct actions (e.g., different business reasons, different facilities).

#### 3. PCG Transaction WARN Analysis

**Transaction Structure:**
- 100% stock acquisition
- Green Horizon acquires all PCG stock
- PCG becomes wholly owned subsidiary of Green Horizon

**Employee Retention Plan:**
- Substantially all 2,850 employees retained
- No immediate layoffs planned

**Post-Acquisition Integration (Potential Restructuring):**

**Scenario 1: No Facility Closures or Layoffs**
- Green Horizon retains all PCG facilities, employees
- **WARN trigger:** NONE
- **Notice required:** NONE

**Scenario 2: Cultivation Consolidation (Humboldt Facility Closure)**

**Facts:**
- Green Horizon operates cultivation facility in Salinas, CA (200 employees, 300,000 sq ft)
- PCG operates cultivation facility in Humboldt County, CA (180 employees, 200,000 sq ft)
- Green Horizon decides to close PCG Humboldt facility, consolidate cultivation to Salinas
- 180 Humboldt employees offered transfer to Salinas (100 miles away); 120 decline transfer

**WARN Analysis:**
- **Plant closing:** Humboldt facility permanently shut down
- **Employees affected:** 120 (declined transfer = employment loss)
- **Threshold met:** 120 > 50 (plant closing threshold)
- **WARN trigger:** YES
- **Notice required:** 60 days' advance written notice to 120 affected employees, union (if any), state, local government

**Liability if Notice Not Given:**
- 120 employees × average $48,000 salary ÷ 12 months × 2 months = **$960,000** back pay
- Benefits: 120 × $850/month × 2 = **$204,000**
- **TOTAL:** **$1,164,000** WARN liability

**Scenario 3: Retail Optimization (Underperforming Dispensaries Closed)**

**Facts:**
- Green Horizon analyzes PCG dispensary performance
- Identifies 6 underperforming dispensaries (2 in California, 2 in Colorado, 2 in Illinois)
- Each dispensary employs 45 budtenders/managers (total 270 employees)
- Green Horizon closes all 6 within 90-day period post-acquisition

**WARN Analysis:**

**Single-Site Analysis:**
- Each dispensary: 45 employees (below 50 plant closing threshold)
- **WARN trigger (single site):** NO

**90-Day Aggregation Analysis:**
- California (2 dispensaries closed): 90 employees within 90 days
- **At single employment site?** NO (different addresses, different cities)
- **WARN applicability:** Complicated — WARN defines "single site of employment" broadly; multiple retail locations in same geographic area may be treated as single site

**DOL Guidance (20 CFR § 639.3(i)):**
- Separate facilities in same metropolitan area may be single site if:
  - Operate as single business unit (centralized management, shared resources)
  - Located in proximity (employees could reasonably be expected to transfer)

**PCG Retail Locations:**
- 2 California dispensaries closed: Los Angeles (6 locations total in LA metro)
- If 2 LA dispensaries closed + other LA employees laid off within 90 days → may aggregate to 90 employees at "single site" (LA metro)
- **WARN threshold:** 90 employees > 50 AND > 33% of LA metro workforce → WARN triggered if criteria met

**Conservative Approach:**
- Provide 60-day WARN notice if closing multiple locations within 90 days (even if technically separate sites)
- Mitigates litigation risk (WARN lawsuits often filed by employees/unions claiming improper aggregation)

**Scenario 4: RIF (Reduction in Force) — No Facility Closures**

**Facts:**
- Green Horizon retains all PCG facilities
- Identifies 180 redundant corporate positions (finance, HR, IT duplicative functions)
- Lays off 180 corporate employees (San Francisco HQ) within 30-day period

**WARN Analysis:**
- **Mass layoff:** 180 employees at San Francisco HQ (single site)
- **Workforce percentage:** 180 ÷ 500 corporate employees = 36% (exceeds 33% threshold)
- **Threshold met:** 180 > 50 AND 36% > 33%
- **WARN trigger:** YES
- **Notice required:** 60 days' advance written notice

**Timing Issue:**
- If Green Horizon announces RIF immediately post-closing (Day 1), must provide 60-day notice
- Cannot effect layoffs until Day 61 post-closing
- **Strategic consideration:** Delay RIF announcement until integration planning complete (90+ days post-closing); provide notice; effect layoffs on Day 151+

#### 4. California WARN Act (Cal-WARN)

**California Labor Code §§ 1400-1408:**

California has **stricter WARN requirements** than federal WARN:

**Cal-WARN Thresholds (Lower than Federal):**

| Event | Cal-WARN Threshold | Federal WARN Threshold |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Plant closing** | 50+ employees within 30-day period | 50+ employees |
| **Mass layoff** | 50+ employees within 30 days (no percentage threshold) | 50-499 employees AND 33%+ of workforce |
| **Relocation** | 50+ employees; facility relocates 100+ miles | Not covered under federal WARN |

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Cal-WARN | Federal WARN |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Coverage** | 75+ employees | 100+ employees |
| **Layoff threshold** | 50+ (no percentage) | 50+ AND 33% (or 500+) |
| **Relocation** | Covered (100+ mile move) | Not covered |
| **Part-time employees** | Counted (20+ hours/week) | Counted (4,000 hours/week aggregate) |

**Penalties:**
- Back pay: Up to 60 days' wages + benefits
- Civil penalty: $500/day to employees (not local government); max **$30,000 per employee**

**Example (Cal-WARN Violation):**
- Employer lays off 60 employees (no notice)
- 60 employees × $10,560 back pay = **$634,000**
- 60 employees × $30,000 max civil penalty = **$1,800,000** (maximum exposure)
- Typical penalty: $500/day × 60 days = $30,000 per employee (maximum is rarely assessed)

**APPLICATION TO PCG:**

PCG operates 26 California dispensaries (950 employees). Cal-WARN applies if:
- Green Horizon closes California facility employing 50+ workers, OR
- Lays off 50+ California employees within 30 days (single site or multiple sites treated as single site)

**Example:**
- Green Horizon closes 2 Sacramento dispensaries (60 employees total) within 30 days
- **Cal-WARN trigger:** YES (60 > 50)
- **Notice required:** 60 days to employees, EDD (Employment Development Department), local workforce agency

**DUE DILIGENCE RECOMMENDATION:**
- Identify any planned facility closures, layoffs, relocations in California
- If restructuring contemplated, engage California employment counsel for Cal-WARN compliance
- Provide 60-day notice (satisfies both federal WARN and Cal-WARN)

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Green Horizon Capital is NLRA successor employer** under *Fall River Dyeing* five-factor test (100% stock acquisition, 100% employee retention, substantial continuity of operations). Green Horizon **must recognize** UFCW Local 5 as exclusive bargaining representative for 420 unionized Bay Area employees.

2. **Green Horizon NOT automatically bound by CBA** under *Burns International* doctrine. However, **voluntary CBA assumption recommended** to:
   - Avoid unfair labor practice risk (unilateral changes to wages/benefits post-closing)
   - Maintain labor peace through 2026 CBA expiration (18 months post-closing)
   - Build constructive relationship with UFCW Local 5 before 2026 negotiations

3. **2026 CBA negotiations will result in substantial cost increases.** Based on cannabis industry pattern bargaining, UFCW Local 5 expected to demand:
   - 15.5% cumulative wage increases over 3 years (5%, 5%, 5.5% annually)
   - Enhanced health insurance ($100/month increase per employee)
   - Additional PTO days (3-5 days)
   - Increased 401(k) match (5% → 6%)
   - **Total cost: $4.9M over 3 years** (31.8% increase in unionized workforce compensation)

4. **Strike risk moderate (25-35% probability).** UFCW Local 5 has history of strikes (Harborside Oakland 2019 — 14 days). Strike at 8 Bay Area dispensaries would result in:
   - $336,000/day revenue loss ($4.7M for 2-week strike)
   - Permanent customer defection (10-15%)
   - Reputational harm in social-justice-oriented cannabis industry

5. **UFCW organizing at 34 non-union dispensaries poses significant financial risk.** If UFCW organizes all non-union locations:
   - 1,530 employees affected
   - **$18.1M annual cost increase** (wages + benefits union premium)
   - 43% reduction in EBITDA ($42M → $24M)
   - $109M reduction in enterprise value (6x EBITDA multiple)

6. **Moderate organizing probability (50-75% of locations within 3 years).** UFCW actively organizing MSOs; PCG acquisition creates organizing opportunity. Factors increasing risk:
   - 8 Bay Area locations already unionized (pattern bargaining leverage)
   - UFCW Locals active in all PCG markets (CA, CO, IL, MA, NV)
   - NLRB election win rate 65-75% in cannabis industry

7. **Workplace safety compliance generally strong.** PCG TRIR (1.0) significantly below industry averages (3.0-5.2). June 2024 extraction incident properly remediated. Low risk of significant OSHA penalties absent catastrophic incident.

8. **Drug testing policy requires Nevada revision.** NRS 678C.450 prohibits employers from refusing to hire or penalizing employees for off-duty cannabis use (except safety-sensitive positions). PCG policy non-compliant if post-accident testing applied to non-safety-sensitive Nevada employees.

9. **California wage and hour compliance satisfactory.** Low meal/rest break violation rate (0.02%), proper overtime calculation, compliant exempt classifications. PAGA risk low based on current compliance.

10. **WARN Act compliance critical for post-acquisition restructuring.** If Green Horizon plans facility closures or layoffs (50+ employees), **60-day advance notice required**. California Cal-WARN has stricter thresholds (50+ employees, no percentage requirement). WARN violation exposure: $1M+ per facility closure.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing)

**1. Clarify CBA Assumption in Purchase Agreement**
- **Action:** Negotiate provision in Stock Purchase Agreement requiring Green Horizon to assume PCG-UFCW Local 5 CBA through expiration (December 31, 2026)

  - Clarify "safety-sensitive" definition in policy
- **Responsible Party:** Employment counsel (Nevada), HR leadership

**5. Model 2026 CBA Negotiation Costs**
- **Action:** Prepare financial model for 2026 CBA negotiations:
  - Baseline: Current CBA terms extended (status quo)
  - Scenario 1: UFCW demands accepted (5%, 5%, 5.5% wage increases; enhanced benefits)
  - Scenario 2: Strike scenario (2-4 week strike + settlement)
- **Rationale:** Budget for anticipated labor cost increases; inform valuation
- **Responsible Party:** Finance, HR leadership

#### Short-Term Actions (0-6 Months Post-Closing)

**6. Meet with UFCW Local 5 Leadership**
- **Action:** Schedule introductory meeting with UFCW Local 5 business agent, shop stewards
- **Agenda:**
  - Introduce Green Horizon management team
  - Confirm Green Horizon's commitment to honoring CBA
  - Discuss 2026 negotiation timeline, process
  - Address any pending grievances
- **Rationale:** Build constructive relationship; signal good faith
- **Responsible Party:** Green Horizon CHRO, labor counsel

**7. Implement Union Avoidance Strategy (Non-Union Locations)**
- **Action:** Proactive labor relations program for 34 non-union dispensaries:
  - **Compensation Benchmarking:** Conduct market survey; increase non-union wages to 90-95% of UFCW Local 5 rates
  - **Supervisory Training:** Train all dispensary managers on:
    - Recognizing organizing activity (without surveillance)
    - TIPS violations (what NOT to do)
    - Positive employee relations (addressing complaints proactively)
  - **Employee Engagement:** Implement town halls, feedback surveys, open-door policy
  - **Rapid Response Protocol:** If organizing campaign detected:
    - Engage labor counsel immediately
    - Prepare lawful communication campaign (8(c) protected speech)
    - Train management on NLRA restrictions
- **Rationale:** Reduce economic incentive to unionize; lawful alternative to union
- **Responsible Party:** HR leadership, labor counsel

**8. Conduct Wage and Hour Audit (California Locations)**
- **Action:** Engage employment counsel to audit California dispensaries for compliance:
  - Meal and rest break policies (timekeeping system review)
  - Overtime calculation (daily + weekly)
  - Exempt classification (salary + duties tests)
  - Predictive scheduling (San Francisco, Emeryville)
- **Rationale:** Identify and remediate violations before PAGA claim filed
- **Responsible Party:** Employment counsel (California), HR leadership

**9. Assess Restructuring Plans and WARN Act Obligations**
- **Action:** If Green Horizon contemplates post-acquisition restructuring:
  - Identify facilities for potential closure (underperforming dispensaries, redundant cultivation/manufacturing)
  - Calculate employees affected (by facility, aggregate within 90 days)
  - Determine WARN/Cal-WARN applicability
  - Prepare 60-day notice timeline
- **Rationale:** Avoid WARN violations ($1M+ per facility closure)
- **Responsible Party:** Integration team, employment counsel, HR leadership

#### Long-Term Actions (6-18 Months Post-Closing)

**10. Prepare for 2026 CBA Negotiations**
- **Action:** Begin preparation for UFCW Local 5 negotiations (mid-2026):
  - Assemble bargaining team (labor counsel, HR, finance)
  - Conduct internal costing analysis (cost of union demands)
  - Identify bargaining objectives (wage increases, benefit modifications, operational flexibility)
  - Research recent UFCW cannabis CBAs (pattern bargaining comparables)
  - Prepare strike contingency plan (replacement workers, security, customer communication)
- **Rationale:** Early preparation strengthens bargaining position
- **Responsible Party:** CHRO, labor counsel

**11. Monitor UFCW Organizing Activity**
- **Action:** Ongoing monitoring of non-union locations:
  - Track NLRB petition filings (query NLRB regional offices quarterly)
  - Monitor employee social media (union organizing discussions)
  - Survey employee satisfaction (identify high-risk locations)
  - Review turnover data (high turnover correlates with organizing vulnerability)
- **Rationale:** Early detection allows rapid, lawful response
- **Responsible Party:** HR leadership, labor relations team

**12. Enhance Safety Programs (Extraction Facilities)**
- **Action:** Implement enhanced safety measures at all extraction facilities:
  - Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance (29 CFR 1910.119) for hydrocarbon extraction
  - Continuous gas monitoring (butane, propane — alarms at 10% LEL)
  - Quarterly preventive maintenance inspections (extraction equipment)
  - Annual safety training (emergency response, confined space entry)
- **Rationale:** Prevent catastrophic incidents (explosions, fires); reduce OSHA citation risk
- **Responsible Party:** EHS leadership, operations management

### C. Outstanding Questions for PCG Management

1. **Has PCG received any NLRB representation petitions at non-union locations within past 3 years?** If yes, provide petition numbers, locations, outcomes.

2. **Has PCG detected any union organizing activity (UFCW representatives, employee organizing meetings, authorization card campaigns)?** If yes, provide details.

3. **What is PCG's position on voluntary CBA assumption?** Does PCG recommend Green Horizon assume CBA or invoke Burns rights?

4. **Has PCG had any communications with UFCW Local 5 regarding transaction?** Union may request successorship language in purchase agreement.

5. **Does PCG have pending OSHA inspections or citations at any facility?** If yes, provide citation numbers, alleged violations, penalties.

6. **Has PCG been subject to any wage and hour claims or PAGA actions (California)?** If yes, provide case details, settlement amounts, corrective actions.

7. **Does Green Horizon plan any post-acquisition facility closures, layoffs, or relocations?** If yes, provide details for WARN Act analysis.

8. **What is Green Horizon's risk tolerance for additional UFCW organizing?** Inform union avoidance strategy intensity (compensation increases, supervisory training investment).

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **NLRA Successorship Non-Compliance** | **HIGH** | Low (if CBA assumed) | $5M+ (ULP back pay, NLRB remedies) | Voluntarily assume CBA; recognize UFCW Local 5 immediately at closing |
| **2026 CBA Negotiations — Strike** | **MEDIUM** | 25-35% | $4.7M-$9.4M (2-4 week strike revenue loss) | Early engagement, pattern bargaining (4-5% annual increases), interest-based negotiations |
| **2026 CBA Cost Increases** | **MEDIUM** | High (95%+) | $4.9M over 3 years (31.8% cumulative increase) | Budget for 5% annual wage increases; model benefit cost inflation |
| **UFCW Organizing at Non-Union Locations** | **HIGH** | Medium (50-75%) | $9.1M-$18.1M annually (if 50-100% of 34 locations organize) | Proactive compensation (90%+ of union wages), supervisory training, employee engagement, rapid response protocol |
| **OSHA Citations — Extraction Hazards** | **MEDIUM** | Low | $18K-$161K per violation | Enhanced preventive maintenance, continuous gas monitoring, Process Safety Management (PSM) compliance |
| **Drug Testing Policy — Nevada Non-Compliance** | **MEDIUM** | Medium | $100K-$500K (wrongful termination claims) | Revise Nevada policy; limit post-accident testing to safety-sensitive positions |
| **Wage and Hour Violations — California PAGA** | **LOW** | Low | $2.28M (maximum PAGA exposure if violations systemic) | Maintain automated timekeeping, conduct quarterly meal/rest break audits, pay premiums promptly |
| **WARN Act Violations — Post-Acquisition Layoffs** | **HIGH** | Low (if no restructuring) | $1M-$2M+ per facility closure (60 days back pay + benefits) | Provide 60-day notice for any facility closure or mass layoff; comply with Cal-WARN stricter thresholds |
| **Predictive Scheduling Violations — SF/Emeryville** | **LOW** | Low | $300-$1,000 annually (isolated violations) | Maintain 14-day advance scheduling software; minimize schedule changes |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

**Labor Relations:**
- **CBA Assumption Decision:** Purchase Agreement should clarify whether Green Horizon assumes CBA or invokes Burns rights (voluntary assumption recommended to avoid unfair labor practice risk)
- **NLRB Petitions:** Request from PCG any NLRB representation petitions filed at non-union locations (past 3 years); indicates organizing activity

**Safety Compliance:**
- **OSHA 300 Logs:** Review 5-year injury/illness records for all facilities; identify facilities with above-average incident rates (cultivation, extraction)
- **June 2024 Extraction Incident:** Verify corrective actions implemented (butane monitoring system, enhanced maintenance); assess adequacy

**Wage and Hour:**

- **Predictive Scheduling Compliance:** Audit San Francisco, Emeryville dispensaries for clopening violations (11-hour rest requirement)

**Drug Testing:**
- **Nevada Policy Review:** Confirm PCG Nevada drug testing policy complies with NRS 678C.450 (no pre-employment cannabis testing, limited post-accident testing)
- **Union Bargaining:** Verify PCG-UFCW CBA contains drug testing provisions; any policy changes require bargaining with union
