**Prepared for**: American Water Infrastructure LLC Board of Directors
**Date**: January 4, 2026

## I. DEAL RECOMMENDATION & CRITICAL CONDITIONS

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Overall Risk Rating**: HIGH - Net exposure of $448.1M (18.7% of purchase price) before protections; $48M (2.0%) after mandatory protections.

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

The acquisition of Mountain States Water Company for $2.4 billion is economically viable subject to five mandatory conditions: (1) $350M-$450M escrow, (2) $200M-$300M purchase price reduction, (3) CPUC pre-approval of Scenario B lead service line cost allocation, (4) IRC Section 338(h)(10) seller eligibility verification, and (5) insurance declaratory relief filing within 30 days. The transaction presents significant but manageable environmental and regulatory risks concentrated in lead service line replacement ($128M Base Case, $675M Bear Case) and PFAS class action litigation ($178M expected value), offset by $148M-$198M tax benefit from stepped-up asset basis. With recommended combined protections totaling $650M (27.1% of purchase price), net buyer risk reduces from $448.1M (18.7%) to $48M (2.0%), within acceptable thresholds for regulated utility M&A. Immediate action required: verify seller Section 338(h)(10) eligibility within 30 days of LOI execution.

### Rationale

The MSWC acquisition offers strategic value through 485,000 customer connections serving 1.35 million people across Colorado's Front Range corridor, with $680M annual revenue and $195M EBITDA. The estimated $1.9B rate base and perpetual water rights portfolio (135,000 AF/year) provide stable regulated revenue streams. However, environmental compliance mandates (148,000 lead service lines, 8 PFAS-contaminated systems) and pending PFAS class action litigation create material near-term capital requirements and contingent liability exposure.

The probability-weighted aggregate exposure of $619M (25.8% of purchase price) falls within the 22-28% range observed in comparable utility M&A transactions with similar environmental/litigation profiles. See **Section IV.J** for detailed scenario analysis. The tax benefit from IRC Section 338(h)(10) election ($148M-$198M NPV) offsets approximately 31% of Base Case exposure, improving transaction economics materially. See **Section IV.I** for tax structure analysis.

The transaction's viability depends critically on CPUC approval conditions. Colorado PUC approval (C.R.S. Section 40-5-101) has 70-75% probability of approval with standard conditions (3-year rate freeze, $15M-$30M customer credits). The 45% foreign ownership (CPPIB 30%, Macquarie 15%) triggers CFIUS mandatory filing but remains below thresholds likely to generate deal-blocking national security concerns. See **Sections IV.A and IV.D** for regulatory analysis.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **Purchase Price Reduction of $200M-$300M** - Shifts regulatory uncertainty (lead line cost allocation, PFAS disallowance) permanently to seller. See **Section IV.J Section E.2** for details.

2. **Seller-Funded Escrow of $350M-$450M (18-Month Term)** - Three-tier milestone-based escrow covering CPUC approval ($150M-$200M), lead service line cost allocation ($100M-$150M), and PFAS litigation settlement ($100M). See **Section IV.J Section C.2** for escrow adequacy analysis.

3. **CPUC Scenario B Pre-Approval as Closing Condition** - Colorado PUC must confirm hybrid cost-sharing methodology for customer-side lead service lines prior to closing. If CPUC mandates Scenario A (100% utility payment with 60-70% disallowance), buyer has option to terminate or convert to asset purchase with $450M additional price reduction. See **Section IV.B Section B.1** for regulatory analysis.

4. **Section 338(h)(10) Seller Eligibility Verification within 30 Days** - Binary gating item determining $148M-$198M tax benefit availability. If seller structure ineligible, buyer must renegotiate price reduction of $100M-$150M to offset foregone benefit. See **Section IV.I Section B.2** for eligibility requirements.

5. **Insurance Declaratory Relief Filing within 30 Days of Signing** - File declaratory judgment against Zurich American Insurance Company to resolve pollution exclusion coverage for PFAS liability. Converts $65M uncertainty into defined legal posture before closing. See **Section IV.E Section B.2** for insurance coverage analysis.

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question (Abbreviated) | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Is CPUC approval required under C.R.S. Section 40-5-101? | **Yes** | MSWC holds 45 CPCNs serving 1.35M people; transfer of control requires CPUC approval with 70-75% probability of approval with conditions (3-year rate freeze, $22.5M customer credits). Timeline: 10-14 months. | IV.A |
| 2 | Does 45% foreign ownership trigger domestic control conditions? | **Probably Yes** | CPPIB (30%) + Macquarie (15%) ownership requires domestic control framework: Denver-based management, Board majority U.S. citizens, 50% dividend retention. CFIUS mandatory filing required under 31 C.F.R. Section 800.401. Exposure: $10.2M-$14.25M compliance costs. | IV.D |
| 3 | Is MSWC obligated to replace 148,000 lead service lines under EPA LCRR? | **Yes** | EPA LCRR mandates 100% replacement within 10 years (by 2034). Customer-side cost allocation creates $78M-$918M exposure depending on CPUC Scenario A vs. B determination. Base Case (Scenario B): $128M. | IV.B |
| 4 | Is PFAS treatment capital required under EPA MCL? | **Yes** | 8 systems with 5-22 ppt PFOA/PFOS exceed 4 ppt MCL. Capital requirement: $45M-$85M. Total 20-year NPV including O&M: $150M-$230M. Late investment risk if delayed beyond Colorado April 2029 deadline: $20M-$48M. | IV.B |
| 5 | Does 10% Colorado River curtailment constitute material adverse effect? | **Probably No** | Current 10% curtailment (4,500 AF) creates $5.4M annual supplemental water cost. Additional 10-20% cuts have 45-55% probability. 10-year NPV exposure: $29M-$81M. Manageable through supplemental water acquisition. | IV.C |
| 6 | Is MSWC exposed to $50M-$1.5B PFAS class action liability? | **Probably Yes** | 45,000 customers across 8 systems. Settlement probability 80% ($50M-$150M); trial probability 20% ($650M-$1.5B). Expected value: $178M. 3M settlement covers infrastructure only, not individual claims. | IV.C |
| 7 | Does Zurich policy cover PFAS liability? | **Uncertain** | Pollution exclusion creates 55-65% denial probability. If denied, Colorado bad faith statute (C.R.S. Section 10-3-1115) allows 2x policy limits ($100M) + fees. Net risk-adjusted Q6 exposure: $113M after insurance offset. | IV.E |
| 8 | Is MSWC at risk of capital disallowance in 2026 rate case? | **Probably Yes** | Infrastructure backlog ($380M) + PFAS late investment risk ($20M-$48M) create 60-70% probability of 10-15% disallowance. NPV exposure: $69.7M. Break rate 1.4-1.8x industry average supports prudence concerns. | IV.G |
| 9 | Has deferred maintenance been imprudent under C.R.S. Section 40-3-101? | **Probably Yes** | 1,200 miles cast iron mains (80-100 years old), 65-85 annual main breaks (15.5-20.2 per 100 miles vs. 11.1 industry average). CPUC likely to impose 10-15% disallowance on catch-up capital. | IV.G |
| 10 | Does stock purchase require Delaware stockholder approval? | **Yes** | DGCL Section 251 requires majority stockholder approval. Timeline: 50-70 days. Appraisal rights exposure under DGCL Section 262: $18M-$27M if 20-30% of shares petition. | IV.F |
| 11 | Is Section 338(h)(10) election eligible? | **Probably Yes (Contingent)** | Available only if seller is consolidated group member or S-corp. 70% eligibility probability based on PE ownership structures. Benefit: $148M-$198M NPV. Critical verification required Days 1-30. | IV.I |
| 12 | Is AWI exposed to WARN Act liability? | **Probably Yes (Avoidable)** | 1,200 employees exceed 100-employee threshold. Corporate HQ (140) + customer service (180) consolidations trigger 60-day notice if 50+ affected at single site. Exposure: $0 with compliance, $9.73M-$10.94M if violated. | IV.H |

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Environmental/Regulatory Capital Cluster (Q3, Q4, Q9)

These three exposures share correlation coefficient of 0.65 because all depend on Colorado PUC interpretation of "used and useful" and "prudent investment" standards under C.R.S. Section 40-3-101.

**Primary Finding**: Lead service line cost allocation (see **Section IV.B Section B.1**) creates $547M swing between Scenario B ($128M) and Scenario A ($675M).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **PFAS Treatment (Section IV.B Section B.2)**: If CPUC applies strict prudence standard to lead lines, same standard likely applied to PFAS treatment timing, increasing late investment disallowance from 40% to 60%.
- **Infrastructure Backlog (Section IV.G Section B.1)**: Strict prudence interpretation for lead lines increases infrastructure disallowance probability from 60% to 80%.
- **Tax Structure (Section IV.I)**: Environmental capital deployed post-closing becomes depreciable stepped-up basis, generating $15M-$20M additional annual tax savings.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $387.7M Base Case (Q3 $128M + Q4 $190M + Q9 $69.7M)

### B. PFAS Liability Chain (Q6, Q7)

PFAS class action (Q6) and insurance coverage (Q7) are highly correlated (coefficient 0.85) because bad faith recovery is contingent on litigation materializing AND coverage denial.

**Primary Finding**: PFAS class action expected value $178M (see **Section IV.C Section B.2**).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Insurance Coverage (Section IV.E Section B.1)**: Zurich pollution exclusion creates 55-65% denial probability. If coverage obtained, exposure reduces to policy limits ($50M).
- **Securities Disclosure (Section IV.F Section B.1)**: PFAS litigation status requires disclosure in stockholder proxy materials under Delaware fiduciary duty principles.
- **CPUC Approval (Section IV.A)**: Pending PFAS litigation may generate intervenor objections in CPUC proceeding, extending timeline 2-4 months.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $178M - $65M insurance offset = $113M net

### C. Transaction Approval Cluster (Q1, Q5, Q10)

CPUC approval (Q1), foreign ownership/CFIUS (Q5), and stockholder approval (Q10) are moderately correlated (coefficient 0.50).

**Primary Finding**: CPUC approval timeline 10-14 months with standard conditions (see **Section IV.A Section B.1**).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **CFIUS (Section IV.D)**: 45% foreign ownership triggers mandatory declaration. CFIUS clearance (75-90 days) must complete before CPUC final order.
- **Employment (Section IV.H Section B.3)**: CPUC domestic control conditions require retention of 30-50 key personnel for 2-3 years, constraining integration timing.
- **Tax (Section IV.I)**: CPUC tax normalization under IRC Section 168(i)(9) may reduce buyer cash benefit 20-40%, offsetting $30M-$80M of gross tax benefit.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $69.4M (Q1 $57M + Q5 $12.2M + Q10 $0.2M)

### D. Labor Risk Cascade (Q12, CPUC Retention)

Employment risks compound across WARN Act, union obligations, and CPUC retention requirements.

**Primary Finding**: CBA expiration June 30, 2026 creates strike vulnerability if closing occurs Q4 2026-Q2 2027 (see **Section IV.H Section B.2**).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **CPUC Approval (Section IV.A)**: Strike during CPUC proceeding may delay approval 3-6 months. Commission likely to require labor stability as approval condition.
- **Integration Timeline (Section IV.J Section D.2)**: CPUC retention requirements ($3M-$6M) constrain consolidation to Year 3+, deferring $10M-$20M synergy realization.
- **WARN Coordination**: 60-day WARN notice must be coordinated with CBA negotiations and CPUC retention period.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $10.3M WARN + $4.5M retention = $14.8M

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Escrow Amount | $450M (18.8%) | $400M (16.7%) | $300M (12.5%) | IV.J |
| Escrow Duration | 24 months | 18 months | 12 months | IV.J |
| Price Reduction | $300M (12.5%) | $250M (10.4%) | $150M (6.3%) | IV.J |
| Combined Protections | $750M (31.3%) | $650M (27.1%) | $450M (18.8%) | IV.J |
| Lead LSL Indemnity Cap | $790M (Scenario A delta) | $500M | $300M | IV.B |
| PFAS Indemnity Cap | $200M | $150M | $100M | IV.C |
| Section 338(h)(10) Price Adjustment | $75M | $50M-$75M | $50M | IV.I |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **Environmental Disclosure Severity**: Data room materials likely understate severity of lead line cost allocation risk. *Akorn v. Fresenius* precedent supports MAE claim based on systematic regulatory non-compliance disclosed in general rather than specific terms. See **Section IV.F Section B.2**.

2. **Tax Benefit Sharing**: Section 338(h)(10) creates $236M joint surplus (buyer $248M benefit minus seller $11M incremental tax). Industry standard: buyer retains 60-80% of surplus. See **Section IV.I Section B.3**.

3. **CPUC Precedent**: California Water/NY American transaction (2021) established 18% combined protections (12% price reduction + 6% escrow) as market standard for comparable environmental/regulatory risk profile. See **Section IV.J Section D.3**.

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| Expected Seller Argument | Our Counter |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| "$380M backlog is normal; break rates acceptable" | Break rate 1.4-1.8x industry average; 12 quarters RCRA violations demonstrate systematic underinvestment |
| "27% protections exceed market standard" | MSWC risk profile (lead lines 31% of system, PFAS 29% of PWS) exceeds peer benchmarks; protections proportionate |
| "Scenario A unlikely; CPUC will approve Scenario B" | Request CPUC pre-filing guidance; if Scenario A risk persists, indemnification required |
| "PFAS settlement will be <$75M per 3M participation" | 3M settlement excludes medical monitoring and punitive damages ($495M-$1.4B); individual claims remain exposed |

| CFIUS Clearance | March 2026 (est.) | 75-90 day review | **Yes** |
| CPUC Final Order | October 2026 (est.) | 10-14 month proceeding | **Yes** |
| Closing | Q4 2026 - Q2 2027 | All conditions satisfied | N/A |

### Critical Path Risks

- **CPUC Approval Delay**: If proceeding extends to 18+ months, outside date may require extension or terminate transaction. Risk: 15-20%.
- **CBA Strike**: If closing occurs post-June 30, 2026 without successor CBAs, unions may strike during integration. Risk: 15-25%. Impact: $5M-$15M.
- **Section 338(h)(10) Ineligibility**: If seller structure ineligible, $148M-$198M tax benefit forfeited. Risk: 30%. Mitigation: Days 1-30 verification.

## VIII. DECISION REQUIRED

```
DECISION REQUIRED: Proceed with acquisition of Mountain States Water Company
                   by American Water Infrastructure LLC Board
                   Deadline: Board Meeting [Date TBD]

OPTIONS:

Option A: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS
- Risk: $448.1M Base Case exposure (18.7% of price); $1.178B Bear Case (49.1%)
- Benefit: Strategic Colorado Front Range water utility; $680M revenue; $148M-$198M tax benefit
- Conditions: $650M combined protections; Scenario B pre-approval; Section 338(h)(10) verification
- Status: RECOMMENDED

Option B: PROCEED WITHOUT CONDITIONS (Not Recommended)
- Risk: Full $619M probability-weighted exposure without seller protection
- Benefit: Faster execution; potentially lower purchase price ($2.3B-$2.35B)
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (exposure exceeds acceptable risk threshold)

Option C: DO NOT PROCEED
- Risk: Foregone strategic opportunity; competitor may acquire MSWC
- Benefit: Avoids $448M-$1.178B exposure range
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (unless Seller rejects conditions OR Scenario A mandated)

RECOMMENDED: Option A - PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

Rationale: Net buyer risk of $48M (2.0% of adjusted purchase price) after
$650M combined protections falls within acceptable range for regulated utility
M&A. Tax benefit of $148M-$198M materially improves economics. Strategic value
of Colorado Front Range water infrastructure supports premium valuation.
