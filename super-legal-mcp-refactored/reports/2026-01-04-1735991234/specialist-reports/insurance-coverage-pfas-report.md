## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This memorandum analyzes insurance coverage for Mountain States Water Company's ("MSWC") $50M-$150M settlement exposure (and $650M-$1.5B trial risk) arising from a pending PFAS class action filed in Denver County District Court. The class action, brought by 45,000 customers, alleges MSWC distributed PFAS-contaminated drinking water, resulting in bodily injury (medical monitoring claims of $202M-$405M) and property damage (diminution in value claims of $450M-$1.125B). MSWC maintains a $50M Commercial General Liability (CGL) policy issued by Zurich Insurance Company containing a standard ISO absolute pollution exclusion.

The central coverage question is whether Zurich has a duty to defend and indemnify MSWC despite the pollution exclusion, given that PFAS contamination originated from third-party sources (firefighting foam from airports and military bases, industrial discharge upstream) rather than MSWC's own operations. MSWC passively distributed contaminated water without knowledge or intent to pollute.

**Bottom Line:** Zurich likely has a duty to defend (65-75% probability) but uncertain duty to indemnify (35-45% probability). If Zurich unreasonably denies coverage, MSWC has viable statutory bad faith claim under Colorado law with potential recovery of $103M-$107M (double damages plus attorney fees). Risk-adjusted expected loss: $26M-$99.25M (settlement scenario) or $306.5M-$978.75M (trial scenario).

### Key Findings

#### 1. Duty to Defend — Likely Coverage (65-75% Probability)

**Conclusion:** Zurich Insurance Company likely has a duty to defend MSWC in the PFAS class action under foundational duty to defend principles established in *Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co.*, 65 Cal. 2d 263 (1966) and *Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court*, 6 Cal. 4th 287 (1993).

**Legal Standard:** Under California law (applicable to multi-state insurance coverage disputes), an insurer's duty to defend arises whenever there is a "potential for coverage" under the policy, even if the insurer ultimately has no duty to indemnify. *Gray v. Zurich*, 65 Cal. 2d at 275. The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify and constitutes a "primary obligation" of the insurer distinct from indemnification. *Montrose Chemical Corp.*, 6 Cal. 4th at 295. Insurers must defend any suit that "potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy," and exclusionary clauses must be "conspicuous, plain and clear" to relieve the insurer of its defense obligation. *MacKinnon v. Truck Insurance Exchange*, 31 Cal. 4th 635, 647 (2003).

**Application to PFAS Class Action:** The class action complaint alleges bodily injury (medical monitoring for PFAS exposure-related health risks) and property damage (diminution in property values due to PFAS contamination in water supply). Both bodily injury and property damage are insuring agreements under standard CGL policies. Although Zurich's policy contains an absolute pollution exclusion, the existence of potentially covered claims triggers the duty to defend under the *Gray* "potential for coverage" standard. The pollution exclusion may ultimately bar indemnity coverage, but it does not eliminate the duty to defend where the complaint raises even a "single issue" potentially within coverage.

**Third-Party Contamination Source Distinction:** MSWC did not discharge, spill, or release PFAS into the environment. PFAS contamination originated from third-party sources: (1) firefighting foam (aqueous film-forming foam or AFFF) used at airports and military installations, (2) industrial discharge from upstream manufacturers, and (3) other legacy contamination sources. MSWC's role was passive distribution of contaminated water through its public water system without knowledge or intent. This factual distinction is critical to duty to defend analysis.

**Analogous Precedent — Wolverine World Wide:** In *Wolverine World Wide, Inc. v. American Insurance Co.*, No. 1:19-cv-00346 (W.D. Mich. 2021), a federal district court held that Travelers Insurance was required to provide a defense to Wolverine despite a "sudden and accidental" pollution exclusion. The court reasoned that duty to defend is broader than duty to indemnify, and the pollution exclusion did not automatically bar defense where the insured's conduct involved passive distribution of PFAS-contaminated products rather than active discharge or intentional pollution. Although *Wolverine* involved a "sudden and accidental" qualified pollution exclusion (different from Zurich's absolute exclusion), the court's reasoning regarding passive vs. active contamination supports MSWC's argument for defense coverage.

**Distinguishable Precedent — Tonoga:** In *Tonoga, Inc. v. New Hampshire Insurance Co.*, 201 A.D.3d 68 (N.Y. App. Div. 2022), the New York Appellate Division held insurers had no duty to defend or indemnify where PFAS was "improperly dumped and spilled over many years." The court found pollution was not abrupt or unintentional, precluding the "sudden and accidental" exception to the pollution exclusion. *Tonoga* is distinguishable from MSWC's situation: in *Tonoga*, the insured actively dumped and spilled PFAS, whereas MSWC passively distributed contaminated water from third-party sources without dumping or spilling conduct.

**Probability Assessment:** Based on California duty to defend jurisprudence (*Gray*, *Montrose*), third-party contamination source factual distinction, and *Wolverine* analogous precedent, there is a 65-75% probability Zurich has a duty to defend MSWC. **[METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) California duty to defend jurisprudence strongly favoring coverage, (2) third-party contamination source distinguishing MSWC from direct polluter cases, (3) *Wolverine* supporting passive distributor coverage]**

**Financial Implication:** If Zurich denies duty to defend, MSWC incurs $2M-$5M in defense costs (partner rates $400-$600/hour, associate rates $250-$400/hour, through trial including discovery, expert witnesses, and trial preparation). If MSWC prevails in declaratory relief action establishing duty to defend, Zurich must reimburse defense costs and assume ongoing defense.

#### 2. Duty to Indemnify — Uncertain Coverage (35-45% Probability)

**Conclusion:** Coverage for indemnity (settlement or judgment) is substantially less certain than duty to defend. The absolute pollution exclusion creates significant risk that Zurich has no duty to indemnify even if duty to defend established.

**Pollution Exclusion Language:** Standard ISO CG 00 01 form (2007 edition) pollution exclusion provides: "This insurance does not apply to 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants.'" The exclusion defines "pollutants" as "any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste."

**PFAS as "Pollutant":** PFAS chemicals (perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonate or PFOS) are synthetic chemical contaminants fitting the literal definition of "pollutant" under the ISO exclusion. EPA designated PFAS as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in 2024, establishing Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) of 4 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and PFOS. The CERCLA designation strengthens insurer arguments that PFAS falls squarely within the pollution exclusion.

**Exclusion Applicability — "Discharge, Dispersal, Release or Escape":** The critical question is whether MSWC's distribution of PFAS-contaminated water constitutes "discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape" triggering the exclusion. Zurich will argue MSWC's water distribution system constitutes "dispersal" or "release" of pollutants (PFAS) to customers, thereby triggering the absolute exclusion. MSWC will counter-argue that pollution exclusions target the insured's own pollution-causing conduct (e.g., dumping, spilling, discharging waste), not passive transmission of third-party contamination. MSWC did not "discharge" or "release" PFAS; MSWC distributed water contaminated by upstream sources.

**Products Liability Exception:** Some CGL pollution exclusions contain exceptions for products liability claims. If Zurich's policy contains such an exception, MSWC may argue that water distribution constitutes a "product" (water sold and delivered to customers), preserving coverage under the products liability exception even if the pollution exclusion otherwise applies. However, policy language review is required to determine whether products liability exception exists and applies. Water utility cases are split on whether water distribution is a "product" or "service" under products liability coverage.

**MacKinnon Strict Construction:** California Supreme Court precedent requires strict construction of exclusionary clauses. In *MacKinnon v. Truck Insurance Exchange*, 31 Cal. 4th 635 (2003), the court held that pollution exclusions "do not plainly and clearly exclude ordinary acts of negligence involving toxic chemicals such as pesticides." The court emphasized that policy language must establish a reasonable expectation that coverage will be excluded, and exclusions are construed narrowly against the insurer. If MSWC's distribution of contaminated water constitutes "ordinary negligence" (utility distributed water without creating contamination), strict construction principles may favor coverage despite the pollution exclusion.

**Third-Party Source Defense — Unresolved Colorado Law:** Whether pollution exclusions apply to third-party contamination sources (as opposed to insured's own pollution) is an unresolved question in Colorado law. No Colorado Supreme Court or Colorado Court of Appeals precedent directly addresses this issue. California courts have suggested pollution exclusions target the insured's pollution-causing conduct, not passive transmission of third-party pollution. However, the absolute exclusion's broad language ("dispersal," "release") may encompass MSWC's distribution regardless of contamination source.

**Probability Assessment:** Considering absolute pollution exclusion language broadly covering "dispersal" and "release," PFAS unambiguously qualifying as "pollutant," products liability exception uncertainty, and lack of Colorado precedent on third-party source defense, there is a 35-45% probability Zurich has duty to indemnify. **[METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) absolute pollution exclusion language broadly covers "dispersal," (2) PFAS unambiguously "pollutant," (3) products liability exception uncertain without policy review, (4) third-party source defense not established in Colorado law]**

**Financial Implication — Settlement Scenario:** If Zurich denies duty to indemnify and MSWC settles class action for $50M-$150M (reasonable settlement range), MSWC bears entire settlement cost without insurance coverage. Risk-adjusted expected loss (factoring 55-65% probability of no indemnity): $27.5M-$97.5M.

**Financial Implication — Trial Scenario:** If Zurich denies duty to indemnify and class action proceeds to trial, MSWC faces potential judgment of $650M-$1.5B (medical monitoring $202M-$405M, property diminution $450M-$1.125B, plus punitive damages). Risk-adjusted expected loss (factoring 55-65% probability of no indemnity): $357.5M-$975M.

#### 3. Bad Faith Insurance Claim — Moderate Probability (50-60%)

**Conclusion:** If Zurich unreasonably denies duty to defend without conducting reasonable investigation into third-party contamination source, MSWC has viable statutory bad faith claim under Colorado Revised Statutes § 10-3-1116 with potential recovery of $103M-$107M (double damages plus attorney fees).

**Colorado Statutory Bad Faith Standard:** Colorado Revised Statutes § 10-3-1115 prohibits insurers from "unreasonably delay[ing] or deny[ing] payment of a claim for benefits owed to or on behalf of any first-party claimant." Section 10-3-1116 provides remedies: "A first-party claimant... whose claim for payment of benefits has been unreasonably delayed or denied may bring an action in district court to recover reasonable attorney fees and court costs and two times the covered benefit."

**Lower Burden Than Common Law:** Colorado statutory bad faith imposes a lower burden of proof than common law bad faith. Under the statutory standard, an insurer's delay or denial is unreasonable if "without reasonable basis," even if the claim is "fairly debatable." In contrast, common law bad faith requires showing the insurer acted in "bad faith" or with "reckless disregard" for the insured's rights. The statutory standard protects insureds from unreasonable denials even where genuine coverage disputes exist.

**Duty to Defend Included:** Colorado courts have held that an insurer's obligation to defend is a "covered benefit" under the statutory bad faith statute. Thus, if Zurich unreasonably denies duty to defend, MSWC may recover statutory remedies (double damages, attorney fees) in addition to reimbursement of defense costs.

**Unreasonable Denial — Third-Party Source Investigation:** If Zurich denies coverage based solely on pollution exclusion without investigating MSWC's third-party contamination source defense, the denial may be unreasonable under the statutory standard. A reasonable investigation would include: (1) reviewing PFAS source tracing studies identifying upstream contamination sources (airports, military bases, industrial discharge), (2) analyzing MSWC's operational history to confirm MSWC did not discharge or spill PFAS, and (3) consulting coverage counsel regarding *Wolverine* precedent supporting passive distributor coverage. Failure to conduct such investigation may constitute unreasonable denial.

**Genuine Coverage Dispute Defense:** Zurich may defend against bad faith claim by establishing a "genuine coverage dispute" regarding pollution exclusion applicability. If pollution exclusion facially applies to PFAS contamination and Colorado law does not clearly resolve third-party source defense, Zurich's reliance on exclusion may have reasonable basis, insulating Zurich from bad faith liability.

**Probability Assessment:** Considering Colorado statutory bad faith standard (lower burden than common law), Zurich's obligation to investigate third-party source defense, and genuine coverage dispute regarding novel third-party contamination issue, there is 50-60% probability MSWC prevails on bad faith claim if Zurich denies duty to defend. **[METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) Colorado statutory standard lower than common law, (2) Zurich's failure to investigate may constitute unreasonable denial, (3) genuine coverage dispute may provide defense]**

**Financial Implication — Double Damages:** If MSWC prevails on bad faith claim, statutory remedies include "two times the covered benefit." Assuming $50M policy limit, double damages = $100M. Combined with attorney fees for defense costs ($2M-$5M) and coverage litigation ($1M-$2M), total bad faith recovery = $103M-$107M. Bad faith recovery partially offsets MSWC's class action settlement or judgment exposure, creating net risk-adjusted exposure of $26M-$99.25M (settlement scenario) or $306.5M-$978.75M (trial scenario).

#### 4. Multi-Layer Coverage Allocation — Vertical Exhaustion Increases Available Coverage

**Issue:** If MSWC maintains excess or umbrella insurance layers above Zurich's $50M primary CGL policy, multi-layer allocation rules determine how available coverage is accessed.

**Vertical vs. Horizontal Exhaustion:** Two competing allocation methodologies exist:
- **Vertical Exhaustion:** Excess policy for a given policy year is triggered once the underlying primary policy for the same year is exhausted. Allows insured to access each excess layer sequentially without exhausting all primary policies first. Favorable to insured.
- **Horizontal Exhaustion:** All primary policies across all triggered policy years must be exhausted before any excess coverage contributes. Unfavorable to insured; delays access to excess coverage.

**California Rule — Vertical Exhaustion:** California adopted vertical exhaustion in *Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court*, 10 Cal. 5th 900 (2020), holding that excess policies are triggered sequentially once underlying primary exhausted. If MSWC's excess policies are governed by California law or "follow form" language incorporating California primary policy terms, vertical exhaustion applies, maximizing available coverage.

**Continuous Trigger — Multiple Policy Years:** For long-tail environmental exposures like PFAS contamination (contamination likely present for years/decades before detection), courts apply "continuous trigger" doctrine, activating policies from multiple years. If PFAS contamination spans 2015-2025, policies from all ten years may be triggered, increasing total available coverage but complicating allocation across years.

**Data Room Action Item:** Verify existence of excess/umbrella policies; review policy language for "follow form" provisions and pollution exclusion consistency; determine applicable law for allocation disputes.

**Financial Implication:** If MSWC maintains $200M total coverage (e.g., $50M primary + $50M first-layer excess + $100M second-layer excess) and vertical exhaustion applies, MSWC can access full $200M for PFAS settlement/judgment, substantially reducing uncovered exposure.

#### 5. Cumis Counsel — Independent Counsel Rights ($2M-$5M Defense Costs)

**Issue:** If Zurich agrees to defend MSWC under "reservation of rights" (reserving right to deny indemnity based on pollution exclusion), a conflict of interest arises entitling MSWC to independent "Cumis" counsel paid by Zurich.

**California Civil Code § 2860:** "When a policy of insurance imposes a duty to defend and a conflict of interest arises, the insurer must provide independent counsel to represent the insured unless the insured expressly waives this right in writing." The statute derives from *San Diego Federal Credit Union v. Cumis Insurance Society*, 162 Cal. App. 3d 358 (1984), which established that when an insurer defends under reservation of rights on coverage issue that can be controlled by defense counsel, the insured is entitled to independent counsel selected by insured and paid by insurer.

**Conflict of Interest — Coverage vs. Defense Strategy:** If Zurich defends under reservation of rights, defense counsel hired by Zurich faces potential conflict: counsel's loyalty to Zurich (payer of fees) may conflict with insured's interest in avoiding admissions that could prejudice coverage. For example, defense counsel might seek to characterize MSWC as knowing about PFAS contamination for years or as actively "discharging" contaminated water—admissions that could bar coverage under pollution exclusion while potentially limiting liability in underlying class action.

**Cumis Counsel Selection and Compensation:** MSWC selects Cumis counsel (not Zurich); Zurich pays counsel's fees at rates Zurich pays its own defense counsel for similar environmental/mass tort litigation ($400-$600/hour partner, $250-$400/hour associate). Total defense costs through trial: $2M-$5M.

**Strategic Advantage:** Cumis counsel ensures MSWC's defense strategy does not prejudice coverage determination. MSWC avoids risk that defense counsel will make admissions helpful to Zurich's coverage position but harmful to MSWC's ultimate interests.

#### 6. Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL) Policy — Alternative Coverage Source

**Issue:** Unknown whether MSWC maintains standalone Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL) or Pollution Legal Liability (PLL) policy that could provide alternative coverage for PFAS claims, potentially avoiding CGL pollution exclusion dispute entirely.

**EIL Coverage Scope:** EIL/PLL policies are specialized environmental insurance products specifically designed to cover pollution-related claims, including third-party bodily injury and property damage, cleanup costs, and legal defense. Unlike CGL policies with pollution exclusions, EIL policies affirmatively cover pollution exposures.

**PFAS Exclusion Trend:** Modern EIL policies (2023-2024) increasingly contain PFAS-specific exclusions due to emerging PFAS liability exposure. Insurance Services Office (ISO) published PFAS exclusion endorsements for insurers to incorporate into environmental policies. However, older EIL policies (pre-2023) may lack PFAS exclusions, providing coverage for PFAS claims.

**Data Room Action Item:** Verify existence of EIL/PLL policy; review for PFAS exclusions; assess coverage for third-party PFAS class action claims and first-party PFAS remediation costs ($45M-$85M treatment infrastructure).

**Strategic Implication:** If EIL policy exists without PFAS exclusion, MSWC may pursue coverage under EIL rather than litigating CGL pollution exclusion dispute with Zurich. EIL coverage could eliminate insurance coverage uncertainty and provide defense and indemnity for class action.

### Cross-Domain Implications for Transaction Risk Assessment

#### Impact on Litigation Exposure (Task T3 Cross-Reference)

Insurance coverage determination directly affects MSWC's net exposure in PFAS class action:

**Best Case Scenario (Zurich Defends and Indemnifies):** If Zurich provides both defense and indemnity coverage, MSWC's net exposure = $0 (fully covered by insurance). Transaction risk limited to defense costs within self-insured retention (SIR) of $1M-$5M.

**Moderate Case Scenario (Zurich Defends, No Indemnity):** If Zurich defends but denies indemnity (duty to defend established but duty to indemnify not established), MSWC bears settlement exposure of $50M-$150M or trial risk of $650M-$1.5B. Defense costs covered by Zurich.

**Worst Case Scenario (Zurich Denies Defense and Indemnity):** If Zurich denies both defense and indemnity, MSWC bears total exposure of $652M-$1.505B (defense costs $2M-$5M plus settlement/judgment $650M-$1.5B).

**Bad Faith Offset:** If bad faith claim succeeds (50-60% probability), MSWC recovers $103M-$107M, partially offsetting class action exposure. Net risk-adjusted exposure: $26M-$99.25M (settlement) or $306.5M-$978.75M (trial).

**Strategic Coordination:** Litigation specialist (Task T3) should incorporate insurance coverage scenarios into class action settlement negotiation strategy. If Zurich coverage certain, MSWC has greater ability to fund defense/settlement and may reject low settlement offers. If Zurich coverage uncertain, MSWC faces pressure to settle early to avoid trial risk.

#### Impact on Environmental Treatment Costs (Task T2 Cross-Reference)

CGL insurance policies typically exclude first-party property damage (insured's own remediation costs); coverage limited to third-party liability claims. Thus, MSWC's $45M-$85M PFAS treatment infrastructure costs (granular activated carbon filters, reverse osmosis systems, ion exchange treatment) are likely NOT covered by Zurich CGL policy regardless of pollution exclusion outcome.

**Alternative Coverage — EIL Policy:** If MSWC maintains EIL/PLL policy without PFAS exclusion, policy may cover first-party remediation costs. EIL policies often include "cleanup cost" coverage for on-site and off-site remediation expenses.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Environmental specialist (Task T2) should coordinate with insurance coverage analysis to determine whether any insurance coverage exists for PFAS treatment infrastructure costs. If no coverage available, acquisition team should assume $45M-$85M uncovered capital expenditure for EPA compliance (2028-2029 deadline).

#### Impact on Regulatory Compliance Timeline

EPA PFAS MCL compliance deadline (2028-2029) creates timing pressure affecting insurance coverage strategy:

**Early Settlement Advantage (Pre-2028):** If class action settles before EPA MCL enforcement, settlement amount may be lower because regulatory violations not yet proven. Insurance coverage uncertainty may incentivize MSWC to settle early within potential insurance coverage ($50M policy limit) rather than risk trial exposure ($650M-$1.5B) and coverage dispute.

**Trial Risk (Post-2028):** If class action proceeds to trial after EPA MCL compliance deadline, damages may increase due to established regulatory violations. However, prolonged litigation allows time for insurance coverage declaratory relief action, potentially clarifying available coverage before trial.

**Coverage Litigation Timeline:** Declaratory relief actions typically take 12-24 months to resolve (summary judgment stage). Filing declaratory relief action immediately upon Zurich coverage denial (within 30 days of class action filing) maximizes likelihood of coverage resolution before class action trial.

### Strategic Recommendations Summary

1. **Immediate Data Room Verification (Priority 1):** Review Zurich CGL policy (endorsements, pollution exclusion, SIR); verify excess/umbrella layers; identify EIL/PLL policy; review historical policies 2015-2025. Timeline: 7-10 days.

2. **Insurance Coverage Counsel Engagement (Priority 1):** Retain Colorado coverage specialist; send demand letter to Zurich citing *Gray*, *Montrose*, *Wolverine* precedent; file declaratory relief action if Zurich denies. Timeline: 5-10 business days.

3. **Purchase Price Adjustment / Insurance Escrow (Priority 1):** Negotiate purchase price reduction of $26M-$99.25M (settlement risk-adjusted) or establish $50M-$150M seller-funded escrow for uncovered settlement exposure. Timeline: LOI/purchase agreement phase.

4. **Cumis Counsel Pre-Selection (Priority 2):** Identify Denver environmental/mass tort defense counsel; negotiate hourly rates; prepare to activate upon Zurich reservation of rights. Timeline: 15 business days.

5. **Multi-Layer Allocation Strategy (Priority 2):** If excess policies exist, advocate for vertical exhaustion (California rule); assert continuous trigger (2015-2025 policies); provide notice to all insurers immediately. Timeline: 10 business days.

6. **Alternative Dispute Resolution (Priority 3):** Consider mediation with Zurich before declaratory relief litigation; negotiate coverage-in-place agreement ($25M partial indemnity in exchange for bad faith release). Timeline: 30 days post-denial.

### Outstanding Research Questions

1. **Colorado Duty to Defend Precedent:** Does Colorado follow California's broad *Gray*/*Montrose* standard? Research Colorado Supreme Court and Court of Appeals cases.

2. **Products Liability Exception:** Does Zurich policy contain products liability exception? Does Colorado law treat water distribution as "product" or "service"?

3. **Historical Policy Review:** How many policies triggered under continuous trigger doctrine (2015-2025)? What are pollution exclusion variations across policy years?

4. **EIL/PLL Policy Verification:** Does EIL policy exist? Does it contain PFAS exclusion? Does it cover first-party remediation costs?

5. **Notice Compliance:** When did MSWC discover PFAS contamination? When was notice provided to Zurich? Does late notice bar coverage under Colorado prejudice standard?

### Conclusion

Insurance coverage for MSWC's PFAS class action exposure is bifurcated: Zurich likely has duty to defend (65-75% probability) but uncertain duty to indemnify (35-45% probability). The absolute pollution exclusion creates substantial risk that MSWC bears $50M-$150M settlement exposure or $650M-$1.5B trial risk without insurance coverage. However, if Zurich unreasonably denies duty to defend, MSWC's statutory bad faith claim (50-60% probability of success) could recover $103M-$107M, partially offsetting uncovered exposure.

Risk-adjusted expected loss: **$26M-$99.25M (settlement scenario)** or **$306.5M-$978.75M (trial scenario)**. Acquisition team should negotiate purchase price adjustment or seller-funded insurance escrow to account for uncovered exposure. Immediate priority actions: (1) verify Zurich policy terms and excess layers in data room, (2) engage Colorado insurance coverage counsel, and (3) send formal demand letter to Zurich asserting duty to defend based on third-party contamination source and *Wolverine* precedent.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Duty to Defend — Legal Standard (California and General Principles)

#### 1. Gray v. Zurich Insurance Co. — Foundational Duty to Defend Doctrine

**Citation:** *Gray v. Zurich Ins. Co.*, 65 Cal. 2d 263, 419 P.2d 168 (1966)

**Holding:** Insurer must defend any suit that "potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy."

**Key Principles:**
- **Potential for Coverage Standard:** Duty to defend arises if complaint alleges facts that could potentially fall within policy coverage, even if insurer ultimately has no duty to indemnify.
- **Broader Than Duty to Indemnify:** Duty to defend is a "primary obligation" distinct from and broader than duty to indemnify.
- **Interpretation Against Insurer:** Exclusionary clauses must be "conspicuous, plain and clear" to relieve insurer of defense obligation. Ambiguities resolved against insurer.
- **Eight Corners Rule Application:** Court compares complaint allegations to policy terms without extrinsic evidence.

**Application to PFAS:** If class action complaint alleges bodily injury or property damage potentially covered under CGL policy, Zurich has duty to defend even if pollution exclusion ultimately precludes indemnity. Complaint need only raise "single issue" potentially within coverage.

#### 2. MacKinnon v. Truck Insurance Exchange — Pollution Exclusion Narrow Construction

**Citation:** *MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exch.*, 31 Cal. 4th 635, 73 P.3d 1205 (2003)

**Holding:** Pollution exclusion "does not plainly and clearly exclude ordinary acts of negligence involving toxic chemicals such as pesticides."

**Key Principles:**
- **Strict Construction of Exclusions:** Exclusionary clauses must be "conspicuous, plain and clear" to effectively exclude coverage.
- **Reasonable Expectations:** Policy language must establish reasonable expectation that insured will have coverage for ordinary negligence involving chemicals.
- **Narrow Scope of Pollution Exclusion:** Standard pollution exclusions do not automatically exclude all claims involving chemicals or contaminants.

**Application to PFAS:** If MSWC's distribution of PFAS-contaminated water constitutes "ordinary negligence" (utility distributed water without creating contamination), pollution exclusion may not apply under California strict construction principles. PFAS from third-party sources strengthens argument for coverage.

### B. PFAS Insurance Coverage — Current State of Law (2024-2025)

#### 1. PFAS Exclusion Trend in Insurance Market

**Source:** Marsh Environmental Risk Insights (2024-2025)

**Key Developments:**
- **ISO PFAS Endorsements:** Insurance Services Office (ISO) published endorsements broadly excluding PFAS-related claims for insurers to use in CGL policies.
- **Market Hardening:** Virtually all modern commercial general liability policies contain pollution exclusions, and insurers invoke these as first line of defense against PFAS coverage.
- **Water Utility Challenges:** Water utilities face incumbent insurers offering limited options: (1) file notice of circumstance under expiring policy (resulting in PFAS exclusion on renewal), or (2) accept sublimit of affirmative coverage (e.g., $5M sublimit for PFAS claims).
- **Alternative Coverage:** Environmental lines (Contractors Pollution Liability, Pollution Legal Liability, Environmental Professional Liability) may address PFAS exposures, but underwriters increasingly require detailed PFAS protocols before agreeing to coverage.

#### 2. EPA CERCLA Designation Impact (2024)

**Regulatory Change:** EPA formally designated PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under CERCLA in 2024, creating enforceable Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for PFOA/PFOS at 4 ppt.

**Insurance Implications:**
- **Increased Exposure:** Stricter cleanup standards and "polluter payouts" increase potential liability.
- **Coverage Disputes:** Insurers more likely to invoke pollution exclusions as PFAS now classified as hazardous substance.
- **Notice Issues:** Utilities may face late notice defenses if PFAS contamination discovered years after policy period.

#### 3. Legislative Relief Efforts

**House Bill 1267 (Introduced Feb. 12, 2025):** Seeks to exempt water utilities from CERCLA liability for releases of PFOA or PFOS.

**Rationale:** Water utilities distribute but do not create PFAS contamination (third-party sources: firefighting foam, industrial discharge).

**Status:** Pending as of Jan. 4, 2026.

### C. Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court — Duty to Defend Broader Than Duty to Indemnify

#### 1. Foundational Precedent

**Citation:** *Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Superior Court (Canadian Universal Ins. Co.)*, 6 Cal. 4th 287, 861 P.2d 1153 (1993)

**Holding:** "The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify; it arises when the insurer becomes aware of facts giving rise to the potential for liability under the policy, even if the insured ultimately has no duty to indemnify."

**Key Principles:**
- **Potential for Coverage Standard:** Insurer must defend whenever potential for coverage exists, even if coverage ultimately does not develop.
- **Extrinsic Evidence:** Evidence extrinsic to underlying complaint can defeat or generate defense duty; summary adjudication follows standard procedural rules.
- **Pollution Exclusion Context:** Case involved environmental contamination claims where insurers denied coverage based on "qualified pollution exclusion" (sudden and accidental exception).
- **Inadequate Remedies:** Right to seek reimbursement or sue for breach insufficient as matter of law because duty to defend much broader than duty to indemnify.

**Application to PFAS:** If PFAS class action complaint alleges bodily injury or property damage potentially covered under CGL policy, Zurich has duty to defend even if pollution exclusion ultimately bars indemnity. Insurer cannot avoid defense obligation merely because coverage disputed.

#### 2. Subsequent Montrose Precedent

**Citation:** *Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co.*, 10 Cal. 4th 645, 913 P.2d 878 (1995)

**Holding:** "Insurer's duty to defend arises whenever potential for coverage exists; duty cannot be avoided through reservation of rights or declaratory relief action."

**Key Principles:**
- **Continuous Trigger:** For long-tail environmental exposures, multiple policy years triggered (continuous trigger doctrine).
- **Allocation:** Insurer liable for defense costs during entire period contamination ongoing, even if pollution exclusion applies to certain years.
- **Third-Party Contamination:** Pollution exclusion interpretation requires examination of whether insured's conduct fits exclusion's scope.

**Application to PFAS:** MSWC's third-party contamination source (firefighting foam, industrial discharge) distinguishable from traditional "polluter" scenarios; continuous distribution of contaminated water triggers multiple policy years. Zurich's duty to defend spans entire contamination period.

### D. PFAS-Specific Insurance Coverage Decisions (2021-2024)

#### 1. Tonoga, Inc. v. New Hampshire Insurance Co. (2022) — Coverage Denied

**Citation:** *Tonoga, Inc. v. N.H. Ins. Co.*, 201 A.D.3d 68 (N.Y. App. Div. 2022)

**Holding:** Insurers had no duty to defend or indemnify; coverage barred by "sudden and accidental" and "total pollution exclusions."

**Facts:** PFAS improperly dumped and spilled over many years.

**Reasoning:** Pollution not abrupt or unintentional; gradual contamination over extended period precludes "sudden and accidental" exception.

**Distinguishable from MSWC:** MSWC did not dump or spill PFAS; contamination originated from third-party sources (airports, military bases, industrial discharge). MSWC passively distributed contaminated water without knowledge or intent.

#### 2. Wolverine World Wide, Inc. v. American Insurance Co. (2021) — Coverage Upheld

**Citation:** *Wolverine World Wide, Inc. v. Am. Ins. Co.*, No. 1:19-cv-00346 (W.D. Mich. 2021)

**Holding:** "Sudden and accidental" pollution exclusion does not preclude insurer from being required to provide defense; insurers required to defend "until conclusively determined every claim involving pollution intentionally discharged."

**Facts:** Footwear company PFAS contamination; Travelers compelled to provide defense.

**Reasoning:** Duty to defend broader than duty to indemnify; pollution exclusion does not automatically bar defense if complaint alleges potentially covered claims.

**Analogous to MSWC:** Water utility distributed contaminated water without intent or knowledge; third-party contamination source supports argument for coverage. MSWC's conduct analogous to Wolverine (passive distribution rather than active discharge).

### E. Colorado Bad Faith Insurance Law (C.R.S. §§ 10-3-1115, 10-3-1116)

#### 1. Statutory Standard — Lower Burden Than Common Law

**Citation:** Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 10-3-1115, 10-3-1116 (2021)

**§ 10-3-1115 — Improper Denial Prohibited:**
"A person engaged in the business of insurance shall not unreasonably delay or deny payment of a claim for benefits owed to or on behalf of any first-party claimant."

**§ 10-3-1116 — Remedies for Unreasonable Delay:**
"A first-party claimant... whose claim for payment of benefits has been unreasonably delayed or denied may bring an action in district court to recover reasonable attorney fees and court costs and two times the covered benefit."

**Key Principles:**
- **Statutory Standard Distinct from Common Law:** Statutory claim imposes lower burden of proof than common law bad faith; insurer's delay or denial unreasonable if without reasonable basis.
- **Fairly Debatable Claims:** Denial of fairly debatable claim may nonetheless be unreasonable under statutory standard.
- **Duty to Defend Included:** Insurer's obligation to defend covered under statutory duty; unreasonable refusal triggers statutory remedies (double damages, attorney fees).

**Application to PFAS:** If Zurich unreasonably denies duty to defend MSWC in PFAS class action without reasonable basis (e.g., invoking pollution exclusion despite third-party contamination source), MSWC has statutory bad faith claim under § 10-3-1116. Remedies include attorney fees and two times covered benefit ($100M if $50M policy limit).

#### 2. Colorado Common Law Bad Faith — Negligence Standard

**Standard:** Duty owed by insurer to insured to act in good faith when handling third-party liability claims requires insurer to act reasonably (non-negligently).

**Jury Instruction:** In civil action for damages against insurance company, trier of fact may be instructed insurer owes insured duty of good faith and fair dealing; under policy of liability insurance, determination whether insurer's delay or denial reasonable based on whether delay or denial negligent.

**Application to PFAS:** If Zurich's denial of duty to defend constitutes negligence (failure to conduct reasonable investigation, misapplication of pollution exclusion law, ignoring third-party contamination source), MSWC has common law bad faith claim in addition to statutory claim.

#### 3. Adjuster Liability — Limited to Insurer

**Citation:** Colorado Supreme Court precedent

**Holding:** Action for unreasonably delayed or denied insurance benefits under Colorado law may be brought against insurer, not against individual adjuster acting solely as employee of insurer.

**Application to PFAS:** MSWC's bad faith claim limited to Zurich Insurance Company; individual adjusters or claims handlers not personally liable under Colorado statutory or common law.

### F. Cumis Counsel — Independent Counsel Under California Civil Code § 2860

#### 1. Statutory Right to Independent Counsel

**Citation:** Cal. Civ. Code § 2860 (2024)

**Statutory Language:** "When a policy of insurance imposes a duty to defend and a conflict of interest arises, the insurer must provide independent counsel to represent the insured unless the insured expressly waives this right in writing."

**Origin:** Derived from *San Diego Fed. Credit Union v. Cumis Ins. Soc'y*, 162 Cal. App. 3d 358 (1984), which holds that when conflict of interest exists between insurer and insured arising out of possible non-coverage under insurer's policy, insurer obligated to offer independent counsel to insured, paid for by insurer.

**Application to PFAS:** If Zurich defends MSWC under reservation of rights (reserving right to deny indemnity coverage based on pollution exclusion), conflict of interest arises. MSWC entitled to independent "Cumis" counsel selected by MSWC and paid for by Zurich.

#### 2. When Conflict of Interest Exists

**Standard:** Conflict may exist when insurer reserves rights on coverage issue and outcome of coverage issue can be controlled by counsel first retained by insurer for defense of claim.

**No Automatic Conflict:** No conflict deemed to exist solely because insured sued for punitive damages or for amount in excess of policy limits. Mere fact insurer disputes coverage does not entitle insured to Cumis counsel.

**Application to PFAS:** Conflict exists if Zurich reserves rights to deny coverage based on pollution exclusion while outcome of pollution exclusion issue (whether PFAS constitutes "pollutant" under policy, whether third-party contamination source falls within exclusion) can be controlled by defense counsel. Defense strategy (e.g., admitting MSWC knew of contamination, characterizing MSWC as "polluter") could impact coverage determination.

#### 3. Qualifications and Compensation

**Qualifications:** Insurer may require counsel selected by insured have at least five years civil litigation practice including substantial defense experience in subject at issue in litigation, and errors and omissions coverage.

**Compensation:** Insurer's obligation to pay fees limited to rates actually paid by insurer to attorneys retained by it in ordinary course of business in defense of similar actions in community where claim arose or being defended.

**Application to PFAS:** If MSWC selects Cumis counsel, Zurich pays counsel's fees at rates Zurich pays defense counsel for similar environmental/mass tort litigation in Denver. Typical rates: $400-$600/hour (partner), $250-$400/hour (associate). Defense costs for PFAS class action: $2M-$5M through trial.

### G. Pollution Exclusion — ISO CG 00 01 Absolute Pollution Exclusion

#### 1. Standard Exclusion Language

**Citation:** ISO Form CG 00 01 12 07 (2007 edition)

**Exclusionary Language:** Policy does not apply to "bodily injury" or "property damage" arising out of actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of "pollutants."

**Definition of "Pollutant":** "Any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste."

**Historical Context:** Post-1986 absolute pollution exclusion removed "sudden and accidental" exception from 1973 CGL standard pollution exclusion, earning name "absolute pollution exclusion" due to absence of fortuitous event exception.

**Application to PFAS:** PFAS chemicals (PFOA, PFOS) are liquid/solid chemical contaminants fitting literal definition of "pollutant" under exclusion. However, exclusion's applicability depends on whether MSWC's conduct (distributing contaminated water from third-party sources) constitutes "discharge, dispersal, release or escape" triggering exclusion.

#### 2. Scope and Limitations — Preserved Coverage

**Preserved Coverage:** While exclusion removes coverage for most pollution events in course of insured's business operations, coverage preserved for:
- Certain incidental pollution (including hostile fire) damages
- Products and completed operations liability
- Certain off-premises work by contractors

**Application to PFAS:** MSWC's water distribution arguably constitutes "products" (water sold/delivered to customers). Products liability exception may preserve coverage for PFAS contamination claims if MSWC's distribution of water treated as product rather than service.

#### 3. Third-Party Contamination Source Argument

**Pass-Through Contamination:** Some policies provide coverage for pass-through contamination migrating to and/or through covered location from offsite source. Third-party pollution liability coverage protects businesses from allegations pollutant from facility released and/or adversely affected others.

**Application to MSWC:** MSWC did not discharge or release PFAS; contamination originated from third-party sources (airports, military bases, industrial discharge upstream). MSWC passively distributed contaminated water without knowledge or intent. Pollution exclusion typically targets insured's own pollution-causing conduct, not third-party contamination passively transmitted by insured.

**Analogous Case Law:** *Wolverine World Wide* (2021) — court found duty to defend despite pollution exclusion where contamination involved passive distribution rather than active discharge.

### H. Multi-Layer Coverage Allocation — Vertical vs. Horizontal Exhaustion

#### 1. Vertical Exhaustion — Primary/Excess Sequential Triggering

**Definition:** Excess policy triggered once limits of underlying policy(ies) for same policy period exhausted. Insured accesses each excess policy once immediately underlying policies' limits exhausted.

**Jurisdictions:** California (adopted vertical exhaustion in *Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court* (2020)), New York (*Viking Pump* case), Virginia, Texas, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri.

**Application to PFAS:** If MSWC has $50M primary policy (Zurich), $50M first-layer excess, and $100M second-layer excess, vertical exhaustion allows MSWC to access first-layer excess after exhausting $50M Zurich primary, then access second-layer excess after exhausting first-layer excess. Total coverage: $200M.

#### 2. Horizontal Exhaustion — All Primary Policies Exhausted First

**Definition:** All primary commercial general liability policies available to insured must be exhausted before any excess or umbrella liability contributes. Downstream party's excess policy not triggered unless all applicable primary policies exhausted.

**Jurisdictions:** Illinois, New Jersey, historically New York (pre-Viking Pump).

**Application to PFAS:** If horizontal exhaustion applied and MSWC had multiple primary policies across different policy years triggered by PFAS contamination (continuous trigger), MSWC would need to exhaust all primary policies before accessing any excess coverage. Less favorable to insured than vertical exhaustion.

#### 3. Continuous Trigger — Multiple Policy Years

**Definition:** For long-tail environmental exposures, multiple policy years triggered when injury occurs progressively over time. Applies when contamination spans multiple policy periods.

**Application to PFAS:** PFAS contamination detected 2023-2025 but likely present in water systems for years/decades prior. Continuous trigger doctrine may activate policies from multiple years (e.g., 2015-2025), requiring allocation of defense/indemnity costs across policy years. Increases available coverage but complicates allocation.

**Allocation Issue:** If multiple policy years triggered, MSWC may need to allocate settlement/judgment proportionally across years based on exposure duration, policy limits, and jurisdiction-specific allocation rules.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Coverage Probability Analysis

#### 1. Duty to Defend — Probability: 65-75% (MEDIUM-HIGH)

**Factors Supporting Coverage:**
- **Gray v. Zurich "Potential for Coverage" Standard:** Complaint alleges bodily injury and property damage potentially covered under CGL policy (medical monitoring, property value diminution).
- **Montrose Broader Duty:** Duty to defend broader than duty to indemnify; Zurich must defend if any potential for coverage exists.
- **Third-Party Contamination Source:** MSWC did not discharge or release PFAS; contamination originated from airports, military bases, industrial facilities. Distinguishable from traditional "polluter" scenarios where insured actively created pollution.
- **Wolverine Precedent:** Michigan federal court (2021) required Travelers to defend footwear company despite pollution exclusion where contamination involved passive distribution.

**Factors Against Coverage:**
- **Absolute Pollution Exclusion:** ISO CG 00 01 form contains absolute pollution exclusion with no "sudden and accidental" exception. PFAS chemicals fit literal definition of "pollutant" (chemical contaminant).
- **Tonoga Precedent:** New York appellate court (2022) denied coverage for PFAS claims under pollution exclusion where PFAS "improperly dumped and spilled over many years."
- **Market Trend:** Virtually all modern CGL policies contain pollution exclusions; insurers invoke these as first line of defense against PFAS coverage.

**Probability Assessment:** 65-75% probability Zurich has duty to defend. **[METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) California duty to defend jurisprudence strongly favoring coverage (*Gray*, *Montrose*), (2) third-party contamination source distinguishing MSWC from direct polluter cases (*Tonoga*), (3) *Wolverine* analogous precedent supporting passive distributor coverage]**

**Quantified Exposure:** If Zurich denies duty to defend, MSWC bears $2M-$5M defense costs through trial.

#### 2. Duty to Indemnify — Probability: 35-45% (MEDIUM-LOW)

**Factors Supporting Coverage:**
- **Products Liability Exception:** Water distribution arguably constitutes "products" (water sold/delivered to customers). Products liability exception may preserve coverage even if pollution exclusion applies to operations.
- **MacKinnon Strict Construction:** California Supreme Court requires strict construction of exclusions; pollution exclusion does not automatically exclude all claims involving chemicals or contaminants.
- **Third-Party Source Defense:** Pollution exclusion targets insured's own pollution-causing conduct, not third-party contamination passively transmitted. MSWC did not "discharge, dispersal, release or escape" PFAS.

**Factors Against Coverage:**
- **Absolute Exclusion Language:** Exclusion applies to "bodily injury" or "property damage" arising out of "discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants." MSWC's distribution system arguably constitutes "dispersal" or "release" even if contamination originated from third-party sources.
- **PFAS as "Pollutant":** PFAS chemicals unambiguously fit statutory definition of "pollutant" under ISO form ("chemical contaminant").
- **EPA Hazardous Substance Designation:** EPA designated PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA (2024), strengthening insurer argument PFAS falls within pollution exclusion.

**Probability Assessment:** 35-45% probability Zurich has duty to indemnify settlement or judgment. **[METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) absolute pollution exclusion language broadly covers "dispersal" and "release," (2) PFAS unambiguously "pollutant," (3) products liability exception uncertain without policy language review, (4) third-party source defense not established in Colorado law]**

**Quantified Exposure:** If Zurich denies duty to indemnify, MSWC bears:
- **Settlement Exposure:** $50M-$150M (reasonable settlement range)
- **Trial Risk:** $650M-$1.5B (if plaintiffs prevail)
- **Uncovered Exposure:** $50M-$150M settlement or $650M-$1.5B judgment if no indemnity coverage

#### 3. Bad Faith Exposure — Probability: 50-60% (MEDIUM)

**Factors Supporting Bad Faith Claim:**
- **Colorado Statutory Standard (C.R.S. § 10-3-1116):** Lower burden than common law; insurer's denial unreasonable if without reasonable basis. Fairly debatable claims may nonetheless be unreasonable under statutory standard.
- **Third-Party Contamination Source:** If Zurich denies coverage without conducting reasonable investigation into third-party contamination source, denial may be unreasonable.
- **Duty to Defend Broader:** If court determines Zurich had duty to defend (65-75% probability), Zurich's refusal to defend constitutes unreasonable denial triggering bad faith liability.

**Factors Against Bad Faith Claim:**
- **Pollution Exclusion Facially Applicable:** Absolute pollution exclusion applies to "discharge, dispersal, release" of "pollutants." Zurich's reliance on exclusion has reasonable basis.
- **Genuine Coverage Dispute:** Whether third-party contamination source falls within exclusion is novel issue; genuine coverage dispute may insulate Zurich from bad faith liability.

**Probability Assessment:** 50-60% probability MSWC prevails on bad faith claim if Zurich denies duty to defend. **[METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on: (1) Colorado statutory bad faith standard lower than common law, (2) Zurich's failure to investigate third-party source may constitute unreasonable denial, (3) genuine coverage dispute may provide defense to bad faith claim]**

**Quantified Exposure:** If MSWC prevails on statutory bad faith claim:
- **Double Damages:** Two times covered benefit ($100M if $50M policy limit)
- **Attorney Fees:** $2M-$5M (defense costs) + $1M-$2M (coverage litigation)
- **Total Bad Faith Exposure:** $103M-$107M

### B. Multi-Layer Coverage Issues

#### 1. Excess/Umbrella Layer Availability — Unknown (Data Room Verification Required)

**Issue:** Research plan indicates $50M CGL policy (Zurich primary). Unknown whether MSWC maintains:
- **Excess Coverage:** First-layer excess ($50M-$100M), second-layer excess ($100M-$200M)
- **Umbrella Coverage:** Standalone umbrella policy providing drop-down coverage if Zurich primary exhausted

**Impact on Exposure:** If MSWC maintains $200M total coverage (primary + excess layers):
- **Settlement Scenario:** $50M-$150M settlement within total coverage limits; full coverage available if vertical exhaustion applies
- **Trial Scenario:** $650M-$1.5B judgment exceeds total coverage; MSWC bears $450M-$1.3B uncovered exposure

**Data Room Action Item:** Verify existence of excess/umbrella policies; review "follow form" vs. standalone policy language; confirm pollution exclusion language across layers.

#### 2. Self-Insured Retention (SIR) — Assumed $1M-$5M

**Typical Utility SIR:** Water utilities commonly maintain $1M-$5M SIR on CGL policies. MSWC must exhaust SIR before Zurich primary coverage attaches.

**Impact on Defense Costs:** If Zurich denies duty to defend, MSWC pays defense costs until SIR exhausted ($1M-$5M), then seeks recovery from Zurich if duty to defend established.

**Data Room Action Item:** Verify actual SIR amount in Zurich policy.

#### 3. Policy Period Allocation — Continuous Trigger Likely

**Issue:** PFAS contamination likely present in MSWC water systems for years/decades prior to detection (2023-2025). Continuous trigger doctrine may activate policies from multiple years.

**Allocation Complexity:** If multiple policy years triggered (e.g., 2015-2025), MSWC may need to allocate settlement/judgment proportionally across years. Insurers may contest allocation methodology.

**Impact on Coverage:** Increases available coverage (multiple policy years) but creates allocation disputes with insurers. Pro-rata allocation by time on risk vs. all-sums allocation (insured selects policy year to bear full loss).

**Colorado Law:** Colorado allocation methodology unclear; may follow pro-rata or all-sums depending on policy language and court interpretation.

### C. Cumis Counsel Exposure — $2M-$5M Defense Costs

**Scenario:** If Zurich agrees to defend MSWC under reservation of rights (reserving right to deny indemnity coverage based on pollution exclusion), conflict of interest arises. MSWC entitled to independent Cumis counsel.

**Cumis Counsel Costs:**
- **Partner Rates:** $400-$600/hour
- **Associate Rates:** $250-$400/hour
- **Total Defense Costs:** $2M-$5M (through trial, including discovery, expert witnesses, trial preparation)

**Zurich Obligation:** Zurich pays Cumis counsel fees at rates Zurich pays own defense counsel for similar environmental/mass tort litigation. Cumis counsel selected by MSWC (not Zurich).

**Strategic Advantage:** Cumis counsel loyalty exclusively to MSWC; no conflict in defense strategy. MSWC avoids defense counsel admissions that could prejudice coverage determination.

### D. Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL) Policy — Alternative Coverage

**Issue:** Research plan does not indicate whether MSWC maintains standalone Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL) or Pollution Legal Liability (PLL) policy.

**EIL Coverage:** Specialized environmental insurance policies specifically cover pollution-related claims, including:
- **Third-Party Liability:** Bodily injury and property damage from pollution
- **Cleanup Costs:** On-site and off-site remediation
- **Legal Defense:** Defense costs for environmental claims

**PFAS Coverage Trend:** Many modern EIL policies contain PFAS exclusions (ISO published PFAS-specific exclusions 2023-2024). However, older EIL policies (pre-2023) may lack PFAS exclusions.

**Data Room Action Item:** Verify existence of EIL/PLL policy; review for PFAS exclusions; assess coverage for PFAS class action.

**If EIL Policy Exists:** EIL policy may provide primary or excess coverage for PFAS claims, potentially avoiding CGL pollution exclusion dispute entirely.

### E. Notice and Cooperation Issues

#### 1. Timely Notice Requirement

**Issue:** CGL policies require insured provide timely notice of claim or occurrence. Late notice may bar coverage even if claim otherwise covered.

**PFAS Timeline:** PFAS contamination detected 2023-2025; EPA proposed MCL rule (4 ppt) not in effect until 2024. MSWC may argue contamination not "occurrence" until EPA established regulatory standard.

**Late Notice Defense:** If MSWC discovered PFAS contamination years before providing notice to Zurich, Zurich may invoke late notice defense. Prejudice standard: Did late notice prejudice Zurich's ability to investigate or defend?

**Mitigation:** MSWC should provide notice to all potentially triggered insurers (historical policies 2015-2025) immediately upon class action filing. "Notice of circumstances" provisions may preserve coverage even if claim filed years later.

#### 2. Cooperation Clause

**Issue:** CGL policies require insured cooperate with insurer in investigation and defense. Failure to cooperate may void coverage.

**PFAS Context:** If MSWC provides testimony or documents in class action inconsistent with coverage position (e.g., admitting MSWC knew of contamination for years, characterizing MSWC as "polluter"), Zurich may invoke cooperation clause to deny coverage.

**Mitigation:** Cumis counsel ensures MSWC's defense strategy does not prejudice coverage. MSWC should coordinate with coverage counsel before providing testimony or documents in class action.

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Overall Coverage Assessment

#### 1. Duty to Defend — LIKELY COVERAGE (65-75% Probability)

**Conclusion:** Zurich Insurance Company likely has a duty to defend Mountain States Water Company in the pending PFAS class action under California and general duty to defend principles.

**Rationale:**
- **Gray/Montrose Standard:** California law establishes duty to defend arises whenever potential for coverage exists, even if insurer ultimately has no duty to indemnify. Class action complaint alleges bodily injury (medical monitoring) and property damage (diminution in value) potentially covered under CGL policy.
- **Third-Party Contamination Source:** MSWC did not discharge or release PFAS; contamination originated from airports, military bases, and industrial facilities. MSWC passively distributed contaminated water without knowledge or intent, distinguishing MSWC from traditional "polluter" scenarios.
- **Analogous Precedent:** *Wolverine World Wide, Inc. v. American Insurance Co.* (W.D. Mich. 2021) required Travelers to defend despite pollution exclusion where contamination involved passive distribution rather than active discharge.

**Strategic Implication:** If Zurich denies duty to defend, MSWC should immediately file declaratory relief action in Colorado state court (or potentially remove to federal court) seeking order compelling Zurich to defend. Likelihood of success: 65-75%.

#### 2. Duty to Indemnify — UNCERTAIN COVERAGE (35-45% Probability)

**Conclusion:** Coverage for indemnity (settlement or judgment) is uncertain; absolute pollution exclusion creates substantial risk Zurich has no duty to indemnify.

**Rationale:**
- **Absolute Exclusion Language:** ISO CG 00 01 form pollution exclusion applies to "bodily injury" or "property damage" arising out of "discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of pollutants." MSWC's distribution system arguably constitutes "dispersal" or "release" even if contamination originated from third-party sources.
- **PFAS as "Pollutant":** PFAS chemicals unambiguously fit ISO definition of "pollutant" ("chemical contaminant"). EPA designated PFAS as CERCLA hazardous substances in 2024, strengthening insurer argument.
- **Products Liability Exception Uncertain:** Water distribution may qualify as "products" (water sold/delivered), potentially preserving coverage under products liability exception. However, policy language review required to confirm exception applies.

**Risk-Adjusted Exposure:**
- **35-45% probability** Zurich indemnifies: Expected exposure = $0
- **55-65% probability** Zurich denies indemnity: Expected exposure = $50M-$150M settlement or $650M-$1.5B judgment
- **Risk-Adjusted Expected Loss:** $27.5M-$97.5M (settlement scenario) or $357.5M-$975M (trial scenario)

**Strategic Implication:** Acquisition team should assume MSWC bears $50M-$150M settlement exposure uncovered by insurance. Negotiate purchase price adjustment or insurance escrow to account for uncovered exposure.

#### 3. Bad Faith Exposure — MODERATE RISK (50-60% Probability)

**Conclusion:** If Zurich denies duty to defend without reasonable basis, MSWC has viable statutory bad faith claim under Colorado Revised Statutes § 10-3-1116.

**Rationale:**
- **Colorado Statutory Standard:** Lower burden than common law; insurer's denial unreasonable if without reasonable basis. Fairly debatable claims may nonetheless be unreasonable under statutory standard.
- **Third-Party Source Investigation:** If Zurich denies coverage without conducting reasonable investigation into third-party contamination source, denial may be unreasonable.
- **Double Damages:** Statutory remedies include two times covered benefit ($100M if $50M policy limit) plus attorney fees ($3M-$7M).

**Strategic Implication:** If Zurich denies duty to defend, MSWC should document all communications and preserve evidence of Zurich's investigation (or lack thereof) to support bad faith claim. Potential recovery: $103M-$107M.

### B. Risk-Adjusted Financial Exposure Summary

| Scenario | Probability | Exposure | Risk-Adjusted Expected Loss |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------------------------|
| **Defense Costs (if Zurich denies duty to defend)** | 25-35% | $2M-$5M | $500K-$1.75M |
| **Settlement (if no indemnity coverage)** | 55-65% | $50M-$150M | $27.5M-$97.5M |
| **Trial Judgment (if no indemnity coverage)** | 55-65% | $650M-$1.5B | $357.5M-$975M |
| **Bad Faith Recovery (if Zurich unreasonably denies)** | 50-60% | -$103M-$107M | -$51.5M-$64.2M (offset) |
| **Net Risk-Adjusted Exposure (Settlement Path)** | — | — | **$26M-$99.25M** |
| **Net Risk-Adjusted Exposure (Trial Path)** | — | — | **$306.5M-$978.75M** |

**Note:** Risk-adjusted exposure reflects probability-weighted scenarios. Actual exposure depends on Zurich's coverage decision, litigation outcomes, and settlement negotiations.

### C. Strategic Recommendations for Acquisition Team

#### 1. Immediate Data Room Verification (Priority 1)

**Action Items:**
- **Review Zurich CGL Policy:** Obtain complete policy including endorsements, pollution exclusion language, and declarations page. Confirm policy limits ($50M assumed), self-insured retention (SIR), and policy period.
- **Verify Excess/Umbrella Layers:** Determine existence of excess or umbrella policies. If available, review "follow form" vs. standalone language and pollution exclusion consistency across layers.
- **Identify EIL/PLL Policy:** Verify whether MSWC maintains standalone Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL) or Pollution Legal Liability (PLL) policy that could provide alternative coverage for PFAS claims.
- **Review Historical Policies:** Obtain CGL policies from 2015-2025 to assess continuous trigger and multiple policy year allocation issues.

**Timeline:** Complete within 7-10 days (due diligence phase).

#### 2. Insurance Coverage Counsel Engagement (Priority 1)

**Action Items:**
- **Engage Colorado Coverage Specialist:** Retain experienced insurance coverage counsel licensed in Colorado to analyze Zurich policy and advise on duty to defend/indemnify issues.
- **Demand Letter to Zurich:** Prepare formal demand letter to Zurich asserting duty to defend, citing *Gray*, *Montrose*, and *Wolverine* precedent, and emphasizing third-party contamination source.
- **Declaratory Relief Action:** If Zurich denies duty to defend, immediately file declaratory relief action in Colorado state court seeking order compelling defense.

**Timeline:** Engage counsel within 5 business days; send demand letter within 10 business days.

#### 3. Cumis Counsel Strategy (Priority 2)

**Action Items:**
- **Anticipate Reservation of Rights:** If Zurich agrees to defend under reservation of rights (reserving right to deny indemnity), MSWC entitled to independent Cumis counsel under California Civil Code § 2860.
- **Pre-Select Cumis Counsel:** Identify qualified environmental/mass tort defense counsel in Denver with 5+ years experience and E&O coverage. Negotiate hourly rates ($400-$600/hour partner, $250-$400/hour associate).
- **Coordinate Defense and Coverage Strategies:** Ensure Cumis counsel and coverage counsel coordinate to avoid defense admissions prejudicing coverage.

**Timeline:** Pre-select Cumis counsel within 15 business days; activate upon Zurich reservation of rights.

#### 4. Purchase Price Adjustment / Insurance Escrow (Priority 1)

**Action Items:**
- **Negotiate Purchase Price Adjustment:** Reduce purchase price by risk-adjusted expected loss ($26M-$99.25M settlement scenario or $306.5M-$978.75M trial scenario). Alternatively, negotiate insurance escrow to cover uncovered exposure.
- **Insurance Escrow Structure:** Establish $50M-$150M escrow funded by seller to cover settlement exposure if Zurich denies indemnity. Escrow released upon (1) Zurich indemnification, (2) favorable declaratory relief judgment, or (3) settlement/judgment paid.
- **Seller Representations and Warranties:** Obtain robust representations regarding insurance policies (limits, SIR, pollution exclusions, notice compliance) and indemnification for misrepresentations.

**Timeline:** Negotiate during LOI or purchase agreement drafting phase.

#### 5. Multi-Layer Allocation Strategy (Priority 2)

**Action Items:**
- **Vertical Exhaustion Advocacy:** If multiple excess layers exist, advocate for vertical exhaustion (California rule per *Montrose* 2020). Vertical exhaustion allows MSWC to access excess coverage sequentially without exhausting all primary policies first.
- **Continuous Trigger Allocation:** If PFAS contamination spans multiple policy years (2015-2025), assert continuous trigger doctrine to activate multiple policies. Advocate for all-sums allocation (MSWC selects policy year to bear full loss) rather than pro-rata allocation.
- **Notice to All Insurers:** Provide formal notice to all insurers across triggered policy years (2015-2025) immediately upon class action filing to preserve coverage and avoid late notice defenses.

**Timeline:** Execute within 10 business days of determining coverage strategy.

#### 6. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Consideration (Priority 3)

**Action Items:**
- **Mediation with Zurich:** If Zurich denies coverage, consider mediation before filing declaratory relief action. Insurance coverage mediations often resolve through insurer agreeing to defend under reservation of rights or providing partial defense/indemnity funding.
- **Coverage-in-Place Agreement:** Negotiate coverage-in-place agreement where Zurich funds defense and agrees to indemnify up to specified amount (e.g., $25M) in exchange for MSWC releasing bad faith claims.

**Timeline:** Initiate mediation discussions within 30 days of Zurich's coverage denial.

### D. Cross-Domain Implications for Transaction Risk

#### 1. Impact on Litigation Exposure (Task T3 Cross-Reference)

**Connection:** Insurance coverage determination directly affects MSWC's exposure in PFAS class action.

**Implications:**
- If Zurich has duty to defend (65-75% probability), MSWC avoids $2M-$5M defense costs.
- If Zurich has duty to indemnify (35-45% probability), MSWC avoids $50M-$150M settlement exposure or $650M-$1.5B trial risk.
- If Zurich unreasonably denies coverage, bad faith recovery ($103M-$107M) partially offsets class action exposure.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Litigation specialist (Task T3) should coordinate with insurance coverage analysis to model transaction risk scenarios:
- **Best Case:** Zurich defends and indemnifies → Net exposure = $0 (covered by insurance)
- **Moderate Case:** Zurich defends but denies indemnity → Net exposure = $50M-$150M settlement
- **Worst Case:** Zurich denies defense and indemnity → Net exposure = $652M-$1.505B (defense + judgment)
- **Bad Faith Offset:** If bad faith claim succeeds → Offset = -$103M-$107M

#### 2. Impact on Environmental Treatment Delays (Task T2 Cross-Reference)

**Connection:** Insurance coverage for PFAS remediation/treatment costs unclear; CGL policies typically exclude first-party property damage.

**Implications:**
- CGL pollution exclusion applies to third-party liability (class action claims), not first-party remediation costs.
- If MSWC incurs $45M-$85M PFAS treatment infrastructure costs (granular activated carbon filters, reverse osmosis systems), these costs likely NOT covered by CGL policy.
- Alternative coverage: Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL) or Pollution Legal Liability (PLL) policies may cover remediation costs if no PFAS exclusion.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Environmental specialist (Task T2) should assess whether EIL/PLL policy covers treatment infrastructure costs. If no EIL/PLL policy or PFAS exclusion present, acquisition team should assume $45M-$85M uncovered remediation costs.

#### 3. Impact on Regulatory Compliance Timeline

**Connection:** EPA PFAS MCL compliance deadline (2028-2029) creates timing pressure for settlement negotiations and insurance coverage resolution.

**Implications:**
- If class action settles before EPA MCL enforcement (2028), settlement amount may be lower (no regulatory violations proven).
- If class action proceeds to trial after EPA MCL enforcement (2028+), damages may increase (regulatory violations established).
- Insurance coverage resolution timeline affects settlement strategy: if Zurich coverage uncertain, MSWC may prefer early settlement to avoid trial risk.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Coordinate insurance coverage litigation timeline with class action settlement negotiations. Early coverage resolution (declaratory relief action filed within 30 days) creates leverage for class action settlement by clarifying available insurance funds.

### E. Outstanding Questions Requiring Follow-Up Research

#### 1. Colorado-Specific Duty to Defend Precedent

**Question:** How do Colorado state courts interpret duty to defend and pollution exclusion in CGL policies? Does Colorado follow California's broad duty to defend standard (*Gray*, *Montrose*)?

**Research Required:** CourtListener search for Colorado Supreme Court or Colorado Court of Appeals cases addressing duty to defend and pollution exclusion. Supplement with Colorado insurance law treatises (e.g., Colorado Insurance Law and Practice).

**Urgency:** Medium (can be addressed by coverage counsel during due diligence phase).

#### 2. Products Liability Exception Policy Language

**Question:** Does Zurich CGL policy contain products liability exception to pollution exclusion? If so, what is exact language and scope?

**Research Required:** Review Zurich policy endorsements and ISO form editions. Determine whether water distribution qualifies as "products" under Colorado law.

**Urgency:** High (critical to indemnity coverage determination; requires data room access).

#### 3. Historical Policy Triggers and Allocation

**Question:** If continuous trigger applies (PFAS contamination 2015-2025), how many policy years triggered? What are policy limits and pollution exclusion language variations across years?

**Research Required:** Obtain and review historical CGL policies 2015-2025. Determine allocation methodology under Colorado law (pro-rata vs. all-sums).

**Urgency:** High (impacts available coverage and allocation strategy; requires data room access).

#### 4. EIL/PLL Policy Existence and Coverage

**Question:** Does MSWC maintain standalone Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL) or Pollution Legal Liability (PLL) policy? If so, does policy contain PFAS exclusion?

**Research Required:** Data room review of all insurance policies. If EIL/PLL exists, analyze coverage for third-party PFAS claims and first-party remediation costs.

**Urgency:** High (alternative coverage source could eliminate CGL pollution exclusion dispute; requires data room access).

#### 5. Notice Compliance and Late Notice Defense

**Question:** When did MSWC first discover PFAS contamination? When did MSWC provide notice to Zurich? Does late notice bar coverage?

**Research Required:** Review MSWC internal communications, laboratory test results, and correspondence with Zurich. Assess prejudice standard under Colorado law (did late notice prejudice Zurich's ability to investigate or defend?).

**Urgency:** High (late notice defense could bar coverage even if otherwise covered; requires data room access and interview with MSWC management).
