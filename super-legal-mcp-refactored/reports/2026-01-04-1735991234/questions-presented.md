---

## V. INSURANCE COVERAGE (Deal-Blocking Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH)

## MEMORANDUM BRIEF ANSWER STRUCTURE

Each Question Presented will receive a dedicated Brief Answer in Section III of the final memorandum, following this format:

**Brief Answer Template:**
> **Q[#]. [Restate question in abbreviated form]**
>
> **Answer:** [Probably Yes / Probably No / Yes / No], subject to [key contingencies].
>
> **Reasoning (3-5 sentences):** [Governing law] + [Application to facts] + [Probability assessment with methodology] + [Quantified exposure] + [Recommendation]
>
> **See Section IV.[X] for detailed analysis.**

**Example Brief Answer (Q1):**
> **Q1. CPUC Approval Required?**
>
> **Answer:** Yes, CPUC approval is required under C.R.S. § 40-5-101 for this change of control transaction.
>
> **Reasoning:** Colorado law mandates PUC approval for any transfer of a certificate of public convenience and necessity. MSWC holds 45 CPCNs covering essential water services for 1.35 million people across 850 square miles, triggering the statutory approval requirement. Based on CPUC precedents in comparable IOU acquisitions (8 transactions 2015-2024), approval probability is 90-95% with conditions: likely 2-3 year rate freeze and $12-24 million customer credits. Foreign ownership (45% CPPIB/Macquarie) will require robust domestic control commitments (Board composition, management, dividends). Timeline: 6-12 months from application to final order.
>
> **See Section IV.A for detailed analysis of CPUC jurisdiction, approval standards, precedent conditions, and foreign ownership scrutiny.**
