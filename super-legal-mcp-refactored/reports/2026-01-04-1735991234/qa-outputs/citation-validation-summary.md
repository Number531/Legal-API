## QUALITY ISSUES FLAGGED FOR SECTIONS IV.A-C

### No Critical Issues
All three sections pass quality thresholds. Recommended for immediate filing in final memorandum.

### Minor Observations (Not Requiring Remediation)
1. **Signal omission (6 instances):** Some citations to supporting authority lack *See* signal but directly support proposition - acceptable per Bluebook Table 1
2. **Parenthetical density (61 instances):** Some parentheticals omitted where relevance is clear from context - acceptable per Bluebook 1.5
3. **URL verification (3 instances):** Some government URLs verified via website access (not cached databases) - acceptable if URLs functional and authority accessible

### Deduction Summary:
- Critical issues: 0
- Minor issues: 70 instances across 224 citations
- **Net deduction: ~6% from perfect compliance (estimated)**
- **Final grade: 94% (A equivalent)**

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ORCHESTRATOR

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
1. **Continue extraction of Sections IV.D through IV.J** using same methodology as Sections IV.A-C
2. **Extract footnotes from Executive Summary** if citations present
3. **Validate verification tags** for all remaining sections using standardized checklist
4. **Flag any unverifiable citations** with: (a) no verification tag, (b) placeholder URLs like "[url]", (c) incomplete source information

### QUALITY CONTROL CHECKPOINTS
1. All VERIFIED tags must specify: database name, URL, filing reference, or document identifier
2. All INFERRED tags must identify the analogous precedent or framework being applied
3. All ASSUMED tags must explain the industry practice or standard
4. All UNVERIFIABLE citations must be listed with recommended action (research, mark as assumed, or remove)

### ESTIMATED TIMELINE FOR COMPLETION
- Current status: 224/749 footnotes validated (30% complete)
- Remaining: 525 footnotes requiring extraction from 7 sections
- Estimated completion time: 2-3 hours additional extraction and validation
- Blocker: None identified - proceeding with standard extraction methodology

### PASS/FAIL DETERMINATION
**Current Status: CONDITIONAL PASS**

For Sections IV.A, IV.B, IV.C:
- Verification rate: 100% (224/224 tagged) ✅
- Bluebook compliance: 94% ✅
- Unverifiable count: 0 ✅
- **Recommendation: PASS - sections ready for consolidation**

For Sections IV.D-J:
- Status: PENDING
- Recommendation: Complete extraction before final status determination

## CROSS-REFERENCE VALIDATION NOTES

Sections IV.A-C contain 12 internal cross-references using "supra" and "infra" citations. All require updating to global footnote numbers once extraction complete for all sections.

**Example Cross-Reference (Requires Renumbering):**
- Section IV.A, footnote 19: "See supra note 15 (Connecticut Water rate freeze)" → Will become "See supra note X" once global numbering assigned
- Section IV.B, footnote 45: References Section IV.A findings on LSL cost allocation

**Action Item:** Post-extraction, conduct systematic audit of all cross-references to ensure they reference correct global footnote numbers.

---

## NEXT PHASE: GLOBAL RENUMBERING

Once all 749+ footnotes extracted from sections IV.A-J and executive summary:

1. Create master footnote list with global numbering (1-749+)
2. Update all in-text footnote markers to global numbers
3. Update all "supra" and "infra" cross-references to global numbers
4. Verify no gaps in numbering
5. Final QA check for consistency

**Estimated impact:** 2-3% of citations will require reference number updates; content will remain unchanged.
