| **Total Threshold** | 86 |
| **Overall Score** | 1.69 |
| **Overall Rating** | **COMPLETE** |
| **Reports Below Threshold** | 1 (T5: Insurance, 0.88 score = ADEQUATE) |

**Assessment:** T5 (Insurance Coverage) scored ADEQUATE (88% of threshold) due to limited quantitative facts available from insurance policy analysis. This is acceptable given the nature of insurance coverage disputes (qualitative legal interpretation rather than quantitative). No sparse data flags required.

## CONFLICT DETECTION RESULTS

### STATUS: **NO MATERIAL CONFLICTS DETECTED**

**Conflicts Detected:** 0 critical, 0 major, 2 minor

### Minor Conflicts (Non-Material)

#### Minor Conflict 1: CPUC Approval Timeline Range

**Severity:** MINOR

| Source | Value Stated | Location |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| research-plan.md | 6-12 months | Line 40 |
| state-puc-rate-cases-report.md | 10-14 months | Referenced in research-review (line 513) |
| tax-structure-optimization-report.md | Q4 2026 - Q2 2027 expected closing | Line 64 |

**Analysis:** Initial research plan estimated 6-12 months based on general PUC precedent. Detailed regulatory research (T1) refined to 10-14 months based on Colorado-specific CPUC precedent for water utility M&A. This is a refinement, not a conflict.

**Resolution:** Use **10-14 months** as canonical value (more specific Colorado research). Both support Q4 2026 - Q2 2027 closing window.

**Canonical Value:** 10-14 months (from CPUC filing to final order)

---

#### Minor Conflict 2: Main Break Rate Comparison Baseline

**Severity:** MINOR

| Source | Value Stated | Location |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| commercial-contracts-infrastructure-report.md | "3-4x industry average" | Line 318 |
| commercial-contracts-infrastructure-report.md | "1.4x to 1.8x worse than average" | Line 88 |
| commercial-contracts-infrastructure-report.md | 15.5-20.2 vs. 11.1 industry average | Line 467 |

**Analysis:** Line 318 appears to be an error (editorial hyperbole). Calculation: 15.5-20.2 ÷ 11.1 = 1.4x-1.8x (confirmed on line 88 and 467). Cast iron-specific comparison shows 37.5-50 break rate vs. 28.6 industry average = 1.3x-1.8x.

**Resolution:** Use **1.4x to 1.8x** as canonical multiplier for all-materials comparison. Line 318 "3-4x" is incorrect and should be disregarded.

**Canonical Value:** MSWC main break rate is 1.4x to 1.8x worse than 2023 industry average (15.5-20.2 vs. 11.1 per 100 miles)

### Conflict Resolution Summary

| Auto-Resolved | Manual Review Required |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 2 | 0 |

**Resolution Log:**

1. **CPUC Timeline:** Resolved by using more specific Colorado research (T1) over general assumption (research-plan.md)
2. **Main Break Rate:** Resolved by mathematical verification; 1.4x-1.8x is correct based on 15.5-20.2 ÷ 11.1

## CROSS-VALIDATION NOTES

### High-Confidence Facts (Multiple Sources Agree)

1. **Purchase Price $2.4B:** Verified across T9 (tax), T10 (financial), T7 (commercial), research-plan.md
2. **Lead Service Lines 148,000:** Verified across T2 (environmental), T10 (financial), research-plan.md, T7 (commercial)
3. **Infrastructure Backlog $380M:** Verified across T7 (commercial), T10 (financial), research-plan.md
4. **Foreign Ownership 45%:** Verified across T4 (CFIUS), research-plan.md, multiple references
5. **Main Break Rate 15.5-20.2:** Mathematically derived from 65-85 breaks ÷ 4,200 miles in T7

### Medium-Confidence Facts (Single Primary Source)

1. **CapEx/D&A Ratio 3.02x-3.12x:** T7 only (industry benchmark, not MSWC-specific)
2. **Purchased Water Volume 3,500 AF:** T7 only (2024 specific data point)
3. **Employee Breakdown by Function:** T7 only (operations 350, maintenance 280, etc.)

### Facts Requiring Data Room Verification

1. **MSWC Historical CapEx/D&A Ratio:** Not publicly available; T7 flags for data room review
2. **Wholesale Customer Contract Language:** T7 estimates 70-80% require consent; actual contracts needed
3. **Insurance Policy Pollution Exclusion Language:** T5 analyzes typical language; actual Zurich policy needed
4. **§ 338(h)(10) Seller Eligibility:** T9 flags as CRITICAL data room verification (C-corp consolidated group status)

## METHODOLOGY NOTES

### NPV Calculations
- **Default Discount Rate:** 8% WACC (applied consistently across T1, T2, T3, T7, T10)
- **Tax NPV Discount Rate:** 7.5% (T9 specific calculation)
- **Perpetual NPV Formula:** Annual Cash Flow ÷ Discount Rate
- **Multi-Year DCF:** Σ (CF_t ÷ (1+r)^t) for defined timeframes

### Probability Weighting
- **Base Case:** 60-70% probability (most likely regulatory/operational scenario)
- **Bear Case:** 20-30% probability (adverse regulatory outcomes, litigation losses)
- **Bull Case:** 10-15% probability (favorable regulatory outcomes, litigation dismissals)

### Expected Value (EV)
- **Contingent Liabilities:** Probability × Magnitude
- **Example:** PFAS Class Action = (80% × $150M settlement) + (20% × $900M trial midpoint) = $178M EV

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL DEFINITIONS

| Confidence | Meaning | Data Quality |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| **HIGH** | Fact directly cited from primary source (statute, 10-K, court filing) OR verified across multiple specialist reports | Multiple sources agree OR single authoritative source |
| **MEDIUM** | Fact from analyst report, industry benchmark, or secondary source OR single specialist report with reasonable basis | Single credible source OR industry standard |
| **LOW** | Fact inferred, estimated, or requires verification in data room | Requires verification |

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SECTION WRITERS

### MANDATORY
1. **Use ONLY values from this fact-registry.md** for all quantified facts (dates, dollar amounts, percentages)
2. **Do NOT cite original specialist reports** for quantified facts - cite this registry instead
3. **Cross-reference "Source Report"** column to read detailed legal analysis supporting the quantified fact
4. **Check "Confidence" column** - if LOW, note limitation and recommend data room verification
5. **For assumptions:** Review "Assumption Status" section - use VALIDATED assumptions; avoid INVALIDATED assumptions

### EXAMPLE CITATION
**Correct:** "MSWC's infrastructure backlog totals $380 million (fact-registry.md), including $240 million for cast iron main replacement. See commercial-contracts-infrastructure-report.md at IV.B.3 for detailed prudency analysis."

**Incorrect:** "MSWC's infrastructure backlog totals $380 million (commercial-contracts-infrastructure-report.md line 305)."
