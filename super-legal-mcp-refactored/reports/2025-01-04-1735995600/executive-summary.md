# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Acquisition of Mountain States Water Company by American Water Infrastructure LLC
**Prepared for**: American Water Infrastructure LLC Board of Directors and Investment Committee
**Date**: January 4, 2026
**Deal Value**: $2.4 Billion

---

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Overall Risk Rating**: HIGH

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

American Water Infrastructure LLC should proceed with the acquisition of Mountain States Water Company subject to three mandatory conditions. The P50 aggregate exposure of $2.658 billion (110.8% of purchase price) signals deal economics requiring substantial escrow protection ($400M-$600M) or purchase price adjustment ($400M-$500M). Immediate action is required within 48 hours to file MDL 2873 Phase 2 manufacturer claims by January 1, 2026, or forfeit $50M-$115M in PFAS recovery rights permanently.

### Rationale

This transaction presents the acquisition of a strategically positioned Colorado water utility serving 1.35 million people across 45 municipalities, with $680M annual revenue and $3.8B in gross assets. The investment thesis is sound: regulated utility cash flows, essential service monopoly, and infrastructure assets with long useful lives. However, material regulatory and environmental risks require structural protection.

The dominant risk driver is the $1.675 billion lead service line replacement mandate (100% certain under EPA's Lead and Copper Rule Improvements), combined with 40-60% CPUC rate case disallowance risk for customer-side costs ($558M at risk). PFAS contamination in 8 of 28 systems creates parallel exposure: $65M treatment capital, $80M class action settlement probability-weighted, offset by $60M manufacturer recovery (if claims filed by January 1, 2026 deadline).

Two deal-blocking regulatory conditions require closing provisions: (1) USBR Grand Valley Project contract transfer approval (40% denial/delay risk affecting 33% of water supply), and (2) CPUC change-of-control approval (12-18 months, 85-90% approval probability). AWI's 45% foreign ownership (CPPIB 30% + Macquarie 15%) triggers CFIUS jurisdiction requiring voluntary filing ($2M-$5M cost) to eliminate tail risk.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **USBR Contract Approval** - Deal-blocking condition for 45,000 AF/year (33% of supply). Structure as closing condition with 24-month outside date. See **Section IV.H** for detailed analysis.

2. **CPUC Change-of-Control Approval** - Mandatory regulatory approval with 85-90% probability. Requires 5-year executive retention agreements ($14.5M). See **Section IV.J** for detailed analysis.

3. **MDL 2873 Phase 2 Filing** - **48-HOUR CRITICAL DEADLINE (January 1, 2026)**. Failure to file forfeits $50M-$115M manufacturer recovery permanently. See **Section IV.D** for detailed analysis.

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question (Abbreviated) | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Under EPA Lead and Copper Rule, must MSWC replace 148,000 lead service lines by 2037? | **Yes** | EPA mandate 100% certain; 40 C.F.R. Section 141.84(a) requires 10-year compliance | IV.A |
| 2 | Under Colorado PUC law, will CPUC approve customer-side LSL cost recovery ($558M)? | **Probably No** | *Colorado Interstate Gas v. CPUC* bars customer-property recovery absent legislation; 50-70% disallowance risk | IV.B |
| 3 | Under SDWA, must MSWC install PFAS treatment for 8 systems by 2031? | **Yes** | EPA's 4 ppt MCL final rule (Apr 2024) is binding; $65M capital required | IV.C |
| 4 | Under MDL 2873 settlements, can MSWC recover $50M-$115M from manufacturers? | **Probably Yes** | Phase 2 claims eligible IF filed by January 1, 2026; 75% recovery probability | IV.D |
| 5 | Under Colorado prior appropriation, will MSWC prevail in curtailment litigation? | **Probably No** | 75-85% loss probability; State Engineer deference doctrine controls | IV.G |
| 6 | Under 43 CFR Section 429.2(b), will USBR approve contract assignment? | **Uncertain** | 60% approval / 40% denial-delay risk; foreign ownership scrutiny applies | IV.H |
| 7 | Under CFIUS, is filing mandatory for this transaction? | **Uncertain** | Voluntary filing strongly recommended; mandatory if MSWC serves military installations (verification required) | IV.I |
| 8 | Under CPUC precedent, will change-of-control approval be granted? | **Probably Yes** | 85-90% approval probability; 5-year executive retention required as condition | IV.J |

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Environmental Compliance Cascade

The EPA's Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (40 C.F.R. Section 141.84) create an interconnected cascade across multiple deal domains affecting 148,000 lead service lines serving MSWC's 485,000 customer connections.

**Primary Finding**: $1.675B replacement program required by 2037 (see **Section IV.A**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Rate Case Recovery (Section IV.B)**: Customer-side LSL costs ($558M) face 50-70% disallowance risk under *Colorado Interstate Gas v. CPUC* property boundary doctrine. Absent Colorado General Assembly legislation (comparable to Illinois HB 3739), CPUC lacks jurisdiction to charge ratepayers for customer-owned infrastructure improvements.
- **Securities/Financial (Section IV.J)**: Item 303 MD&A disclosure required for $558M customer-side recovery uncertainty. If disallowed, MSWC must write off 23% of shareholder equity.
- **Timeline Coordination**: 10-year EPA compliance deadline (2037) intersects with CPUC rate case timeline (Q4 2026 decision) - rate case outcome determines whether shareholder or ratepayer bears $558M exposure.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $1.675B gross; $558M contingent disallowance = $600M-$700M risk-adjusted

### B. Regulatory Approval Dependencies

Federal and state regulatory approval timelines create critical path dependencies affecting transaction closing.

**Primary Finding**: Three regulatory approvals required with non-overlapping review periods

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **USBR Approval (Section IV.H)**: 270-365 day timeline; 40% denial/delay risk; affects 33% of water supply (45,000 AF/year). Denial is deal-blocking.
- **CPUC Approval (Section IV.J)**: 12-18 month timeline (450 days max); 85-90% approval probability; requires 5-year executive retention agreements ($14.5M).
- **CFIUS Review (Section IV.I)**: 45-105 days if voluntary filing; AWI's 45% foreign ownership (CPPIB 30% Canadian Crown + Macquarie 15%) triggers jurisdiction over TID U.S. business.

**Timeline Recommendation**: 24-month outside date (vs. standard 12-18 months) to accommodate USBR + CPUC sequential approvals.

### C. PFAS Exposure Integration

PFAS contamination in 8 of 28 systems creates parallel litigation, regulatory, and treatment capital exposures.

**Primary Finding**: $145M gross PFAS exposure (treatment + litigation), partially offset by $60M manufacturer recovery

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Environmental Treatment (Section IV.C)**: $65M capital for GAC treatment; 100% certain EPA mandate by 2031
- **Litigation Settlement (Section IV.D)**: $80M expected settlement (80% probability); *Smith v. Terumo BCT* eliminates medical monitoring claims, reducing trial risk
- **Manufacturer Recovery (Section IV.D)**: $50M-$115M MDL 2873 recovery **IF claims filed by January 1, 2026**; net retention $20M after CPUC customer credit
- **Insurance Coverage (Section IV.E)**: 70-85% denial probability; pollution exclusion applies; $0 expected offset

**CRITICAL DEADLINE**: MDL 2873 Phase 2 claims must be filed by **January 1, 2026 (48 hours)**. Failure forfeits $50M-$115M recovery permanently.

### D. Water Supply Security Risk

Colorado River curtailment and USBR contract uncertainty create compounding water supply risks.

**Primary Finding**: 10% curtailment (4,500 AF/year) permanent loss plus 40% USBR denial risk

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Water Rights Litigation (Section IV.G)**: 75-85% loss probability in *MSWC v. CRWCD*; trial Q3 2026; $38M-$54M NPV supplemental water costs if curtailment sustained
- **Agricultural Leases (Section IV.H)**: $115M-$184M NPV over 20 years; 60-70% price escalation probability post-acquisition due to AWI's perceived financial capacity
- **Reuse Expansion Opportunity (Section IV.H)**: South Metro Wastewater 5,000-10,000 AF/year expansion could replace volatile agricultural leases, saving $23M-$40M NPV

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section Reference |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Purchase Price | $2.0B | $2.2B | $2.4B | Financial Analysis |
| Escrow Amount | $600M (25%) | $400M (17%) | $300M (12.5%) | Section II |
| Rate Case Escrow | $350M | $300M | $250M | Section IV.B |
| PFAS Escrow | $175M | $150M | $100M | Section IV.D |
| Environmental Indemnity Survival | 7 years | 5 years | 3 years | Sections IV.A-C |
| Environmental Indemnity Cap | $750M | $500M | $300M | Sections IV.A-C |
| Outside Date | 30 months | 24 months | 18 months | Section IV.J |
| Executive Retention Period | 7 years | 5 years | 3 years | Section IV.K |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **MDL 2873 Recovery Timing**: If buyer ensures filing by January 1, 2026, $50M-$115M offset available. Seller benefits from reducing net exposure.

2. **Legislative Risk Allocation**: Colorado HB 24-1174 (customer-side LSL recovery) may be reintroduced in 2025 session. If enacted, $558M disallowance risk eliminated. Escrow release can be tied to legislative outcome.

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| # | Expected Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence Basis |
|---|--------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | "Lead LSL costs will be 95%+ recovered in rates" | HIGH | CPUC lacks statutory authority for customer-side recovery per *Colorado Interstate Gas*; 50-70% disallowance risk validated by regulatory precedent | Section IV.B |
| 2 | "PFAS settlement will be <$50M" | MEDIUM | *Smith v. Terumo* reduces exposure but Hoosick Falls comparable suggests $100M baseline; 80% settlement probability documented | Section IV.D |
| 3 | "USBR approval is routine" | MEDIUM | 40% denial/delay risk documented; AWI's foreign ownership triggers enhanced scrutiny; 270-365 day timeline | Section IV.H |
| 4 | "20% escrow is above market" | HIGH | Precedent transactions show 15-20% escrow for combined lead/PFAS/rate case exposure (American Water/Confluence 20%, Aqua America/Peoples 15%) | Section IV.B |

## VI. TIMELINE & CRITICAL PATH

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Risk Level | Section Reference |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| **MDL 2873 Phase 2 Filing** | **January 1, 2026** | None | **CRITICAL** | Section IV.D |
| CFIUS Voluntary Filing | At signing | Military installation verification | MEDIUM | Section IV.I |
| USBR Application Submission | 6 months pre-close | Contract review complete | HIGH | Section IV.H |
| CPUC Application Filing | At signing | Executive retention agreements | MEDIUM | Section IV.J |
| HSR Clearance | 30 days post-filing | Standard review | LOW | Standard |
| CFIUS Clearance | 45-105 days | No mitigation required | MEDIUM | Section IV.I |
| USBR Approval | 270-365 days | NEPA determination | HIGH | Section IV.H |
| CPUC Approval | 12-18 months | Rate freeze commitment | MEDIUM | Section IV.J |
| Water Rights Trial | Q3 2026 | Litigation schedule | MEDIUM | Section IV.G |
| PFAS Settlement | Q2-Q3 2026 | Motion to dismiss ruling | HIGH | Section IV.D |
| Closing | Q2-Q3 2027 | All approvals obtained | | |

### Critical Path Risks

- **USBR Delay**: If USBR requires full EIS (vs. EA), approval extends to 365+ days, potentially exceeding 24-month outside date
- **CPUC Rate Freeze**: If CPUC imposes 3-year rate freeze, AWI cannot recover lead/PFAS costs until 2030, creating $150M cash flow gap

## VIII. DECISION REQUIRED

```
DECISION REQUIRED: MDL 2873 Phase 2 Filing Authorization by Deal Sponsor TODAY (December 31, 2025).

OPTIONS:

Option A: Authorize MSWC to file Phase 2 manufacturer claims immediately
- Risk: Administrative burden; CPUC may require 75-100% customer credit on recovery
- Benefit: Preserves $50M-$115M gross recovery opportunity; net retention $0-$29M
- Status: RECOMMENDED

Option B: Decline to file / wait for further analysis
- Risk: Deadline is January 1, 2026 (48 hours); no extensions available; $50M-$115M forfeited permanently
- Benefit: Avoids administrative burden of claims process
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED

Option C: Make filing contingent on deal signing
- Risk: Deal may not sign before January 1, 2026 deadline; opportunity lost
- Benefit: None - delay eliminates recovery regardless of signing
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED

RECOMMENDED: Option A
Rationale: Even if CPUC requires 100% customer credit (worst case), filing preserves optionality. Failure to file eliminates $50M-$115M recovery permanently with no alternative remedy. Filing cost is $0; administrative burden is modest compared to exposure.
