## IV.K. EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR MATTERS

### A. Legal Framework

American Water Infrastructure LLC's ("AWI") acquisition of Mountain States Water Company ("MSWC") triggers a complex web of federal and Colorado employment law obligations that will materially impact post-closing workforce integration, impose mandatory executive retention requirements as a condition of regulatory approval, and create potential successor liability exposure. This section analyzes the controlling legal authorities governing workforce transitions in regulated utility acquisitions and quantifies the expected $27.36M aggregate employment-related costs over five years (representing 1.14% of the $2.4 billion purchase price).

#### 1. Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act

The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN Act"), codified at 29 U.S.C. §§ 2101-2109, requires covered employers to provide **60 days' advance written notice** before "mass layoffs" or "plant closings."¹ A "mass layoff" is defined as an employment loss at a single site of employment affecting either (1) 500 or more employees, or (2) 50-499 employees if they represent at least 33% of the active workforce.² An employer is "covered" if it employs 100 or more full-time employees.³

**Critical Aggregation Rule:** The WARN Act requires aggregating employment losses occurring within any **90-day period** unless the employer demonstrates "separate and distinct actions and causes."⁴ This anti-avoidance provision prevents employers from staging layoffs in multiple small tranches to evade the 50-employee threshold. Courts have consistently held that employment actions occurring within 90 days must be aggregated absent clear evidence of independent business justifications.⁵

**Notice Recipients:** Employers must provide written notice to (1) affected employees (or their union representatives), (2) the State Dislocated Worker Unit (in Colorado, the Department of Labor and Employment), and (3) the chief elected official of the unit of local government where the employment site is located.⁶

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:** Employers who fail to provide adequate WARN notice are liable for (1) back pay for each affected employee for each day of violation (up to 60 days), (2) the value of benefits that would have been provided during the violation period, and (3) civil penalties up to $500 per day for failure to notify local government officials.⁷

#### 2. National Labor Relations Act Successor Employer Doctrine

Under the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA"), Section 8(a)(5) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to "refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employees."⁸ When an acquiring company purchases a business with a unionized workforce, **successor employer doctrine** determines whether the acquirer inherits the predecessor's collective bargaining obligations.

**Burns International Doctrine:** In *NLRB v. Burns International Security Services, Inc.*, the Supreme Court held that a successor employer may initially set terms and conditions of employment without bargaining with the incumbent union, provided the successor does not make it "perfectly clear" that it will retain all employees under existing terms.⁹ However, once the successor hires a "substantial and representative complement of employees," a majority of whom are drawn from the predecessor's workforce, the duty to bargain arises.¹⁰

**"Perfectly Clear" Exception:** The National Labor Relations Board has found successorship obligations to attach immediately—without an opportunity to set initial terms—where the purchaser makes it "perfectly clear" at the time of the transaction that it plans to retain substantially all of the predecessor's employees without changing their terms and conditions of employment.¹¹ For stock purchase transactions where the acquiring entity continues operating the business in substantially unchanged form with the same workforce, immediate bargaining obligations are highly probable.¹²

**Application to Water Utility Transactions:** Regulated public utilities present unique successorship challenges because operational continuity and workforce retention are often **mandated by regulatory conditions**. State-certified water treatment operators, specialized maintenance personnel, and engineers with institutional knowledge of complex water systems cannot readily be replaced without significant service disruption. Where regulatory requirements effectively mandate workforce continuity, the "perfectly clear" exception is likely to apply, triggering immediate bargaining obligations.¹³

#### 3. Colorado Wage Payment Law

Colorado's Wage Claim Act imposes strict final paycheck timing requirements that exceed federal standards and create significant liability exposure for employers who delay final wage payments. Under **C.R.S. § 8-4-109**:

- If the employer **terminates the employee**, final wages and **accrued vacation** are due **immediately** upon termination.¹⁴
- If the employee **quits or resigns**, final wages are due on the next regular payday.¹⁵

**"Earned and Determinable" Vacation:** Colorado law treats accrued vacation as "wages" that must be paid at termination.¹⁶ Employers may not forfeit accrued vacation as a penalty for failure to provide notice, except where the employment agreement explicitly provides that vacation is forfeited if the employee (1) fails to give two weeks' notice, or (2) is terminated for cause.¹⁷

**Statutory Penalties:** Colorado law provides for treble damages for willful nonpayment of wages. If an employee sends written demand for unpaid wages and the employer fails to pay within 14 days, the employer is liable for:
- **Negligent non-payment:** 2 times unpaid wages or $1,000 (whichever is greater)
- **Willful non-payment:** 3 times unpaid wages or $3,000 (whichever is greater)¹⁸

The Colorado Supreme Court has strictly construed the immediate payment requirement against employers, rejecting arguments that "immediate" means "within 24 hours" or "the next business day."¹⁹ Compliance requires same-day payment, necessitating advance payroll preparation for terminated employees.

#### 4. Colorado Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation Law

Colorado has one of the most restrictive non-compete enforcement regimes in the nation. Following the enactment of **HB 22-1317** (effective August 7, 2022), Colorado eliminated the historic exception for "executive and management personnel."²⁰ Under current law codified at **C.R.S. § 8-2-113**, a covenant not to compete is enforceable **only if**:

1. The employee earns annualized cash compensation equal to or exceeding the threshold for "highly compensated workers" (**$127,091 for 2025**);²¹
2. The covenant is **for the protection of trade secrets**; and
3. The covenant is **no broader than reasonably necessary** to protect the employer's legitimate interest in trade secrets.²²

**Non-Solicitation Agreements:** Non-solicitation covenants (prohibiting solicitation of employees or customers) are subject to a lower threshold: the employee must earn at least **60% of the highly compensated worker threshold** (**$76,255 for 2025**).²³ Colorado courts have held that non-solicitation agreements are more likely to be enforceable than non-competes because they impose less restrictive limitations on employee mobility.²⁴

**Trade Secrets in Water Utility Context:** The critical limitation for water utility executives is the requirement that covenants protect **trade secrets specifically**. Operational procedures, water treatment processes (publicly regulated by EPA SDWA and Colorado CDPHE), customer lists (matters of public record within certificated service territories), and water rights portfolios (public records maintained by the State Engineer) are unlikely to qualify as trade secrets under Colorado law.²⁵ Proprietary software, cybersecurity protocols, vendor pricing agreements, and strategic acquisition targets may qualify, but the scope of any non-compete must be narrowly tailored to those specific trade secrets.²⁶

#### 5. Colorado Public Utilities Commission Approval Conditions

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC") applies a **public interest standard** to change-of-control transactions affecting investor-owned water utilities under **C.R.S. § 40-5-101**.²⁷ The CPUC considers multiple factors including rates, service quality, financial stability, environmental compliance, and—critically for employment matters—**local management presence and continuity**.²⁸

In prior utility change-of-control proceedings, the CPUC has imposed conditions requiring retention of senior management for specified periods to ensure (1) accountability to local stakeholders, (2) continuity of operational expertise during ownership transitions, and (3) demonstrated commitment to Colorado communities and capital investment programs.²⁹ For transactions involving large capital improvement programs such as MSWC's $1.4-$1.95 billion lead service line replacement program and $50-$80 million PFAS treatment installations, the CPUC is likely to condition approval on binding multi-year executive retention agreements as a demonstration of acquirer commitment to project completion.³⁰

### B. Application to Transaction (CREAC Structure Required)

#### B.1 Workforce Composition and Union Representation Status

**Conclusion:** MSWC employs 1,200 full-time employees across operations, maintenance, customer service, engineering, corporate, and regulatory compliance functions. MSWC is **likely non-union** (80% probability), but this status requires immediate verification through data room review of NLRB filings and collective bargaining agreements. If MSWC is unionized, AWI will become a "perfectly clear" successor employer with immediate duty-to-bargain obligations under NLRA § 8(a)(5), requiring AWI to honor existing collective bargaining agreement terms until expiration and bargain in good faith over renewal.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM [BASIS: Industry unionization statistics + absence of collective bargaining agreement references in transaction materials]

**Rule:** The National Labor Relations Act imposes a duty on employers to bargain collectively with employee representatives chosen under Section 9(a).³¹ When a company acquires a business with unionized employees, successor employer doctrine determines whether the acquirer inherits bargaining obligations. Under *NLRB v. Burns International Security Services*, a successor may initially set employment terms without bargaining unless it is "perfectly clear" the successor will retain the predecessor's workforce under existing conditions.³² The duty to bargain arises when the successor employs a "substantial and representative complement" of employees, a majority from the predecessor's workforce.³³

**Explanation:** The utilities sector has an 18.7% unionization rate (2024), significantly above the 5.9% private sector average.³⁴ Water treatment plant operators, maintenance workers, and distribution personnel are commonly represented by the Utility Workers Union of America ("UWUA"), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ("IBEW"), and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ("AFSCME").³⁵ However, **privately-owned investor-owned utilities** like MSWC have substantially lower unionization rates than municipal utilities such as Denver Water or Aurora Water.³⁶ In December 2025, Denver Water employees became eligible to unionize under new collective bargaining rules, with AFSCME and Teamsters actively organizing,³⁷ but this development affects municipal utilities, not private entities like MSWC.

Courts applying the "perfectly clear" test examine whether the acquirer has committed to retain the predecessor's workforce without substantive changes. In regulated utility contexts where operational continuity is mandated by state commission approval conditions, courts have found immediate successorship obligations because workforce retention is effectively guaranteed by regulatory requirements.³⁸ Where the acquirer publicly announces retention of substantially all employees or is subject to regulatory conditions mandating workforce continuity, the acquirer foregoes the *Burns* initial-terms exception and must immediately bargain with the incumbent union.³⁹

**Application:** MSWC's 1,200-employee workforce comprises 29.2% operations (350 employees), 23.3% maintenance (280 employees), 15.0% customer service (180 employees), 12.5% engineering (150 employees), 11.7% corporate (140 employees), and 8.3% regulatory compliance (100 employees).⁴⁰ The transaction materials contain no references to collective bargaining agreements, union authorization cards, NLRB representation filings, or grievance procedures, suggesting MSWC operates as a non-union employer. Given MSWC's status as an investor-owned utility and the absence of CBA references, **there is an 80% probability MSWC is currently non-union**.

However, if MSWC is unionized, AWI will be deemed a "perfectly clear" successor employer because: (1) AWI acquires 100% of MSWC's stock, continuing operations in substantially unchanged form with all 28 public water systems and 485,000 service connections; (2) regulatory requirements mandate workforce continuity—certified water treatment operators (Colorado CDPHE certification), specialized maintenance staff for 4,200 miles of distribution infrastructure, and engineers for $1.4-$1.95 billion capital programs cannot be readily replaced; and (3) the CPUC will condition approval on retention of CEO, COO, CFO, and Chief Engineer for five years, signaling commitment to workforce stability.⁴¹ Under these circumstances, AWI would have immediate duty-to-bargain obligations and must honor all existing CBA terms including wages, benefits, work rules, seniority provisions, and grievance procedures until contract expiration.⁴²

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** Contingent (applies only if MSWC is unionized)
- **Methodology:** Expected Value = Probability × Magnitude
- **Calculation:** 20% probability MSWC is unionized × $250,000-$1,000,000 organizing/compliance costs = **$50,000-$200,000 expected value**
- **Result:** $125,000 expected value (midpoint)
- **Probability Assessment:** 20% probability MSWC is unionized [METHODOLOGY: 18.7% utilities sector unionization rate, adjusted downward for investor-owned vs. municipal utilities]

**Counter-Analysis:** MSWC may argue that even if a union currently represents certain bargaining units, AWI does not inherit duty-to-bargain obligations because post-closing workforce reductions will eliminate a majority of union-represented positions, preventing formation of a "substantial and representative complement" from the predecessor's workforce. This argument is unlikely to succeed because AWI plans to retain 1,050-1,090 of 1,200 employees (87.5-90.8%), with reductions concentrated in non-union corporate functions rather than operations/maintenance positions more likely to be unionized.⁴³ The 90-day WARN Act aggregation rule will require advance notice of all planned reductions, making the composition of the post-reduction workforce clear at the outset and supporting immediate successorship liability.⁴⁴

#### B.2 Executive Retention: CPUC-Mandated Five-Year Program ($13.2M-$15.8M)

**Conclusion:** Colorado PUC approval of the acquisition will require binding five-year retention agreements for MSWC's CEO, COO, CFO, and Chief Engineer as a demonstration of local Colorado management commitment and operational continuity during the $1.4-$1.95 billion lead service line replacement and $50-$80 million PFAS treatment programs. This **non-negotiable CPUC condition** creates $13.2-$15.8 million in mandatory retention costs over five years (expected value $14.5 million, 100% probability). Failure to execute binding retention agreements before CPUC application filing constitutes **deal-blocking risk**. Double-trigger change-of-control severance provisions in existing executive employment agreements create additional $3.75-$5.65 million exposure if any retained executive is terminated without cause or resigns for "good reason" during the five-year period.

**Confidence:** HIGH [BASIS: Colorado PUC public interest standard + precedent utility M&A transactions requiring local management retention + MSWC's $1.4B-$1.95B capital program requiring experienced leadership continuity]

**Rule:** Colorado PUC jurisdiction over investor-owned utility transfers derives from C.R.S. § 40-5-101, which requires Commission approval for any transaction resulting in change of control.⁴⁵ The CPUC applies a multi-factor public interest standard examining (1) rates and service quality, (2) financial stability and access to capital, (3) environmental compliance and infrastructure investment, (4) local presence and management continuity, and (5) operational expertise.⁴⁶ The Commission has broad discretion to impose conditions necessary to protect ratepayer interests and ensure utility service quality during ownership transitions.⁴⁷

In change-of-control proceedings involving significant infrastructure investment obligations, state utility commissions consistently impose management retention conditions. The rationale is that large capital programs—particularly complex environmental compliance projects such as lead service line replacement and PFAS treatment—require continuity of experienced leadership who understand the utility's system-specific challenges, relationships with regulators and municipalities, and project management capabilities.⁴⁸ Retention conditions typically range from three to five years and require binding agreements rather than mere representations about intent.⁴⁹

**Explanation:** State utility commissions view management continuity as essential to protecting ratepayer interests during ownership transitions. In utility M&A transactions, commissions have required retention of senior executives to ensure (1) accountability to local stakeholders rather than remote parent company management, (2) preservation of institutional knowledge regarding system-specific operational challenges, (3) demonstrated commitment to capital investment program completion, and (4) continuity of relationships with state regulators, municipalities, and community groups.⁵⁰

The requirement for **local Colorado management** reflects regulatory preference for decision-makers physically present in the service territory with direct accountability to state regulators and municipal partners. For a utility serving 1.35 million people across 45 Colorado municipalities with pending $1.4-$1.95 billion LSL program and $50-$80 million PFAS treatment obligations, the CPUC will require retention of CEO, COO, CFO, and Chief Engineer as a demonstration that AWI is committed to Colorado operations rather than treating MSWC as a passive asset in a broader portfolio.⁵¹

**Application:** MSWC's executive team comprises four senior officers whose retention is critical to CPUC approval: (1) Chief Executive Officer (base salary $500,000 annually), responsible for overall strategic direction, regulatory relationships, and capital program oversight; (2) Chief Operating Officer (base salary $400,000 annually), responsible for 28 public water systems operations, 1.35 million customer service, and workforce management; (3) Chief Financial Officer (base salary $400,000 annually), responsible for rate case filings, capital budgeting for $1.4-$1.95B LSL program, and financial reporting to CPUC; and (4) Chief Engineer (base salary $350,000 annually), responsible for technical design and project management of $1.4-$1.95B LSL replacement and $50-$80M PFAS treatment installations.⁵²

**Five-Year Retention Program Quantification:**

| Executive | Base Salary (Annual) | 5-Year Base | Retention Bonus (One-Time, 100% of Base) | Annual Performance Bonuses (40% Target × 5 Years) | **5-Year Total** |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| CEO | $500,000 | $2,500,000 | $500,000 | $1,000,000 | **$4,000,000** |
| COO | $400,000 | $2,000,000 | $400,000 | $800,000 | **$3,200,000** |
| CFO | $400,000 | $2,000,000 | $400,000 | $800,000 | **$3,200,000** |
| Chief Engineer | $350,000 | $1,750,000 | $350,000 | $700,000 | **$2,800,000** |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,650,000** | **$8,250,000** | **$1,650,000** | **$3,300,000** | **$13,200,000** |

Plus benefits (health insurance, retirement contributions at 15-20% of base): +$2.475M-$3.3M = **$15.5M-$16.5M total with benefits**.⁵³

**Methodology Disclosure:** Executive compensation benchmarked to American Water Works Company Inc. proxy statements showing CEO base salary $500,000-$750,000, other named executive officers $300,000-$500,000.⁵⁴ Retention bonuses at 100% of base salary (high end of 50%-100% utilities industry standard) reflecting extraordinary five-year commitment term.⁵⁵ Annual performance bonuses at 40% of base (midpoint of 30%-50% utilities sector standard).⁵⁶

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** One-Time/Perpetual Hybrid (one-time retention bonuses + recurring annual compensation over 5 years)
- **Methodology:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) with staggered payments
- **Calculation:**
  - Year 0 (Closing): Retention bonuses $1,650,000
  - Years 1-5: Base salaries $1,650,000/year + performance bonuses $660,000/year = $2,310,000/year
  - DCF at 8% WACC: $1,650,000 + Σ($2,310,000 ÷ (1.08)^t for t=1 to 5) = **$10.87M NPV**
  - Undiscounted total: **$13.2M-$15.8M**
- **Result:** $14.5M expected value (100% probability—CPUC condition)
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 8% WACC (utility sector standard per financial impact analysis)

**Change-of-Control Severance Exposure:** Executive employment agreements typically include "double-trigger" provisions that activate severance if (1) a change of control occurs AND (2) the executive is terminated without cause or resigns for "good reason" (material reduction in compensation/responsibilities, relocation >50 miles).⁵⁷ Utilities industry standard severance for C-suite executives is **2x base salary + 2x target annual bonus**.⁵⁸

**Severance Quantification by Executive:**
- CEO: 2 × $500,000 + 2 × $200,000 = **$1,400,000**
- COO: 2 × $400,000 + 2 × $160,000 = **$1,120,000**
- CFO: 2 × $400,000 + 2 × $160,000 = **$1,120,000**
- Chief Engineer: 2 × $350,000 + 2 × $140,000 = **$980,000**
- **Total Severance Exposure:** **$4,620,000** (if all four executives trigger severance)

**Probability Assessment:** 20-30% probability that at least one executive triggers severance during five-year retention period due to (1) AWI management philosophy conflicts, (2) integration decisions reducing executive autonomy, or (3) executive voluntary resignation for opportunities elsewhere. Expected value: 25% × $4,620,000 ÷ 4 executives × 1 executive = **$288,750** (assuming one executive departure over five years).

**Counter-Analysis:** AWI may argue that retention agreements should be structured as "single-trigger" (severance payable upon change of control regardless of subsequent employment status) to simplify CPUC compliance and eliminate double-trigger contingency. However, single-trigger agreements are less favorable to employers because they guarantee payout even if executives remain employed, effectively converting retention bonuses into transaction bonuses. Double-trigger structures incentivize executives to remain for the full five-year period and only provide severance if AWI terminates them or constructively terminates them through materially adverse changes. The CPUC's concern is continuity of leadership, which double-trigger agreements better serve by creating financial incentive to remain employed rather than simply to complete the transaction.⁵⁹
