## CROSS-REFERENCE VALIDATION

### Internal References Analysis

| Reference Type | Count | Valid | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

| "See infra note [Y]" (forward) | 12 | 12 | ALL VALID |
| "Compare X with Y" | 8 | 8 | ALL VALID |

**Cross-reference integrity:** 100% (zero broken references)

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FINAL ASSEMBLY

### Priority 1: Critical (Required for Final Publication)

1. **Update 34 inter-section cross-references** for global renumbering
   - Time estimate: 2 hours
   - Example: "supra note 5" in Section IV.H → "supra note 438" (offset +433)
   - Tool: Find-and-replace with global numbering map

### Priority 2: High (Quality Enhancement)

2. **Add 28 missing pincites** to meet 100% Bluebook compliance
   - Time estimate: 1 hour (referencing consolidated-footnotes.md)
   - Examples: *Pub. Serv. Co. of Colo.* citations lacking specific pages
   - Impact: Improves precision without changing substance

3. **Verify 6 ASSUMED citations** for potential primary source upgrade
   - Time estimate: 1 hour (CPUC docket research, regulatory guidance review)
   - Examples: Colorado PUC General Order 165 references
   - Impact: Could elevate 6 citations from [ASSUMED] to [VERIFIED]

### Priority 3: Medium (Cleanup)

4. **Review 8 INFERRED citations** for added explanation
   - Time estimate: 30 minutes
   - Examples: California PUC precedent applied to Colorado context
   - Impact: Clarify reasoning for non-binding authority usage

### Priority 4: Low (Optional)

5. **Standardize database record citation formats**
   - 1 SEC EDGAR citation lacks accession number format
   - Impact: Marginal (functional reference already clear)

---
