## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

American Water Infrastructure LLC's $2.4B acquisition of Mountain States Water Company (MSWC) presents **material commercial contract assignment risks** requiring immediate pre-closing action. This report analyzes MSWC's four primary water supply contracts: (1) agricultural water leases ($3M-$12M annually), (2) wholesale water agreements ($7M annually), (3) USBR Grand Valley Diversion Project participation (45,000 AF/year, 33% of MSWC's total supply), and (4) South Metro Wastewater Authority reuse water purchase (5,000 AF/year, $4M-$7.5M annually). Total commercial contract exposure ranges from **$15.24M to $31.29M annually**, with 20-year NPV of **$115M-$230M** for supplemental water purchases if Colorado River curtailment continues. AWI faces **two critical risks**: (1) **USBR assignment approval required** for Grand Valley participation (federal regulations 43 CFR § 429.2(b)), denial would be deal-blocking; (2) **agricultural lease volatility**, with 1-year leases subject to non-renewal or price escalation post-acquisition.

### Key Findings Digest

#### 1. Purchased Water Agreements (Agricultural Leases) — **HIGH RISK**

**Current State (2024)**:
- MSWC purchased **3,500 AF** from agricultural water rights holders to offset 10% Colorado River curtailment (4,500 AF/year loss)
- **Pricing**: $850-$1,200/AF (market-driven, drought-volatile)
- **Total cost**: $3M-$4.2M (2024 actual)
- **Lease structure**: 1-year terms, April-October irrigation season, annual re-negotiation

**Market Context**:
Colorado's agricultural-to-municipal water lease market experienced significant volatility in 2024:
- C-BT Project water: $52,000/AF (permanent sale, February 2024 auction)¹
- Aurora permanent purchases: $10,240/AF (April 2024, Otero County)²
- Annual irrigation leases: $200/AF (Northern Colorado baseline)³
- **MSWC's pricing ($850-$1,200/AF)** reflects temporary transfer premium above irrigation leases but below permanent acquisitions

**Assignment Risk**: **LOW** (1-year leases have no formal assignment provisions; stock purchase preserves MSWC as contracting entity)

**Change-of-Control Risk**: **HIGH** (60-70% probability of price escalation or non-renewal)
- AWI acquisition signals financial capacity → lessors may demand $1,500-$2,000/AF (75-100% price increase)
- Agricultural commodity price increases → farmers irrigate crops rather than lease water
- Competing municipalities (Denver Water, Aurora, Colorado Springs) bid up prices
- **No long-term commitment**: 1-year leases provide zero supply security beyond current season

**Future Exposure (if Colorado River curtailment continues)**:
- **Low scenario**: 5,000 AF/year × $850/AF = **$4.25M annually**
- **Base scenario**: 7,500 AF/year × $1,000/AF = **$7.5M annually**
- **High scenario**: 10,000 AF/year × $1,200/AF = **$12M annually**
- **20-year NPV**: $115M (base) to $230M (worst case), discounted at 6% WACC

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Pre-closing: Negotiate **multi-year lease extensions** (3-5 years) with 80% of current lessors (2,800 AF target)
- Offer **price premiums** ($1,000/AF guaranteed) or **early payment** to incentivize commitments
- Diversify supply via **reuse water expansion** (5,000-10,000 AF/year) to reduce agricultural lease dependence

**Cost Recovery**: MSWC has CPUC-approved **Purchased Water Adjustment (PWA) clause** allowing automatic pass-through of costs above baseline $2M annually via quarterly customer surcharge ($0.85-$1.80/month per customer).⁴ This mitigates financial risk to MSWC but increases regulatory risk (CPUC may deny pass-through if deemed imprudent).

#### 2. Wholesale Water Contracts — **MEDIUM RISK**

**Current State**:
- MSWC serves **2,800 master-metered wholesale connections** to small municipalities and water districts
- **Annual revenue**: $7M (approximately 1% of MSWC's $680M total revenue)
- **Estimated customers**: 10-15 wholesale customers (top 10 likely account for ~80% of revenue)
- **Pricing structure**: Volumetric rates ($4-$6/1,000 gallons estimated) plus fixed monthly charges

**Legal Framework**:
- Colorado wholesale water contracts governed by C.R.S. § 37-45-131 ("Sale of water by contract")⁵
- Typical anti-assignment provision: "Neither party may assign any rights or delegate duties without prior written approval"⁶
- Contracts often define parties to include "successors or assigns"⁷

**Assignment Risk**: **LOW**
- **Stock purchase** (AWI's structure): MSWC Delaware corporation continues as contracting entity → **no formal assignment occurs**
- Contrast with asset purchase: would trigger assignment requiring customer consent⁸

**Change-of-Control Risk**: **MEDIUM** (30-40% probability of customer notification/consent requirements)
- Wholesale contracts likely contain **change-of-control clauses** requiring notification or consent if MSWC ownership changes
- Stock purchase typically does not trigger simple anti-assignment provisions, but **"change of control = deemed assignment"** language may require customer consent⁹
- Customers may raise concerns about rate increases, service quality, foreign ownership (45% CPPIB/Macquarie)

**Rate Increase Pass-Through Risk**:
Post-acquisition, wholesale customers will experience automatic rate increases tied to MSWC's retail rate cases:
- **LSL replacement**: $1.4B-$1.95B program → 8-12% annual rate increases over 10 years → wholesale volumetric rates increase 20-30% ($4-$6/1,000 gal to $4.80-$7.20/1,000 gal)
- **PFAS treatment**: $50M-$80M capital → 1-2% annual rate increases over 3 years
- **Acquisition debt service**: If AWI finances $2.4B with debt, CPUC may allow interest expense recovery → 2-4% annual rate increases

**Customer Response**: If rates increase >20% over 5 years, wholesale customers with long termination notice periods (3-5 years) may trigger termination clauses to develop alternative supplies.

**Estimated Revenue at Risk**: 20% customer loss = $1.4M annually (0.2% of total revenue, **minimal financial impact** but **negative optics** for CPUC approval if customers publicly oppose acquisition)

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- **Data room review**: Identify top 10 customers (80% of $7M revenue), review assignment/change-of-control provisions
- **Proactive outreach**: Pre-closing communication with customers → commit to service continuity, address rate concerns, obtain written waivers of consent requirements
- **CPUC approval**: Colorado PUC approval process may **automatically address** assignment concerns if CPUC orders MSWC to continue serving wholesale customers under existing contracts (regulatory override of contract termination rights)

#### 3. USBR Grand Valley Diversion Project Participation — **HIGH RISK** (Potentially Deal-Blocking)

**Current State**:
- MSWC's **45,000 AF/year Colorado River allocation** via USBR Grand Valley Diversion Project (33% of MSWC's total 135,000 AF/year supply portfolio)
- **2023 Upper Basin 10% cut**: Reduced to 40,500 AF/year (loss of 4,500 AF/year)
- **Annual costs**: $1.24M-$3.19M (GVWUA capital assessments $1.1M-$3M + USBR O&M $140K-$190K)¹⁰

**Project Structure**:
- USBR constructed Grand Valley Diversion Dam (1913-1916) under Reclamation Act of 1902¹¹
- 1949: USBR transferred operations to **Grand Valley Water Users Association (GVWUA)**, Colorado nonprofit organized 1905¹²
- GVWUA operates 55-mile Government Highline Canal, 150 miles of laterals, serves 23,000+ irrigable acres¹³
- MSWC participates via use authorization/contract (exact structure requires data room verification)

**Federal Assignment Requirements — 43 CFR Part 429**:

> **§ 429.2(b)**: "Use authorizations may not be transferred or assigned to others **without prior written approval of Reclamation**, unless specifically provided for in the use authorization..."¹⁴

> **§ 429.17**: Use authorizations for easements/rights-of-way exceeding 25 years require approval from **water user organizations** under contract obligation for repayment (i.e., **GVWUA may have veto rights** if MSWC's participation is structured as long-term easement).¹⁵

**Assignment Risk**: **HIGH** (federal approval required)
- Even if stock purchase does not constitute formal "assignment," USBR may interpret MSWC's change of control as triggering approval requirements
- **USBR approval process** (60-120 days): Application submission → GVWUA consultation → USBR review under 43 CFR §§ 429.14-15 (criteria: interference with project operations, financial capacity, beneficial use, environmental/public interest concerns)¹⁶
- If GVWUA objects or environmental groups challenge AWI's **foreign ownership (45%)**, timeline extends to 6-12 months

**Risk if USBR Denies Assignment — DEAL-BLOCKING**:
- If USBR denies assignment and deems MSWC's participation non-transferable, AWI cannot acquire 45,000 AF/year Colorado River allocation (33% of supply)
- This would render MSWC's water supply **inadequate for serving 485,000 connections**, likely causing AWI to abandon acquisition
- **Mitigation**: USBR denial is **unlikely** (10-20% probability) — federal policy favors municipal water supply over agricultural use, AWI's financial capacity exceeds MSWC's
- However, **foreign ownership** may trigger USBR scrutiny requiring **domestic control protections** (coordinate with CFIUS process)

**Curtailment Allocation Risk**:
- **MSWC v. Colorado River Water Conservation District** (filed March 2024, trial Q3 2026)¹⁷: MSWC challenges 10% pro rata curtailment, argues prior appropriation doctrine should protect senior rights
- **Litigation probability**: 70-80% MSWC loses (courts defer to state engineer emergency powers)
- **If MSWC loses**: Permanent 4,500 AF/year loss requires supplemental purchases (agricultural leases or reuse expansion)

**Mitigation Strategy — CRITICAL**:
- **Pre-closing engagement (6 months before closing)**: Submit assignment request to USBR Western Colorado Area Office
  - Transaction description, AWI financial qualifications, continued beneficial use demonstration
  - Environmental compliance (NEPA review if required)
  - Coordinate with CFIUS process (avoid conflicting domestic control conditions)
- **GVWUA coordination**: Meet with GVWUA board, obtain written support letter, commit to continued participation and capital assessment obligations
- **Closing condition**: Make AWI's closing contingent on USBR approval (or obtain legal opinion that stock purchase does not require approval under 43 CFR Part 429)

#### 4. South Metro Wastewater Authority Reuse Water Agreement — **MEDIUM RISK** with Strategic Expansion Opportunity

**Current State**:
- MSWC purchases **5,000 AF/year** treated effluent from South Metro for non-potable reuse (parks, golf courses, industrial cooling, irrigation)
- **Estimated pricing**: $800-$1,500/AF (mid-range between agricultural leases $850-$1,200/AF and indirect potable reuse $12,000-$13,000/AF)¹⁸
- **Annual cost**: $4M-$7.5M (mid-point $5.75M)
- **Treatment standard**: Secondary + UV disinfection (meets Colorado Regulation 84: E. coli <126/100 mL, turbidity <5 NTU)¹⁹

**Drought-Proof Supply Advantage**:
Wastewater effluent is a **climate-resilient supply** — flows consistent year-round regardless of precipitation (unlike Colorado River subject to curtailment). Colorado has 27+ jurisdictions using deliberate non-potable reuse since 1960s.²⁰

**Assignment Risk**: **MEDIUM** (contract likely requires consent)
- Reuse water purchase agreements typically contain assignment/change-of-control provisions requiring South Metro notification or consent
- Stock purchase may not trigger assignment, but notification likely required

**Strategic Expansion Opportunity — CRITICAL FOR WATER SUPPLY SECURITY**:
If Colorado River curtailments continue (Lake Powell <25% triggers additional 10-20% Upper Basin cuts), MSWC will require **5,000-10,000 AF/year** supplemental supply.²¹ Reuse water expansion offers **drought-proof alternative** to volatile agricultural leases:

- **5,000 AF/year expansion** × $1,500/AF = **$7.5M annually** (total reuse: 10,000 AF/year)
- **10,000 AF/year expansion** × $1,500/AF = **$15M annually** (total reuse: 15,000 AF/year)

**Strategic advantages over agricultural leases**:
- **Reliability**: Drought-proof (wastewater flows constant), no farmer termination risk
- **Local control**: No USBR approval, no Colorado River Compact allocation disputes
- **Price stability**: Long-term contracts (10-20 years) with CPI-indexed pricing (avoid spot-market volatility)

**Contract Review Priorities**:
1. **Expansion rights**: Does MSWC have **right of first refusal (ROFR)** for additional capacity if South Metro expands WWTP? If no ROFR, competing utilities (Aurora, Denver Water) could secure expansion capacity.
2. **Assignment provisions**: Identify change-of-control consent requirements
3. **Pricing adjustment**: CPI-indexed (predictable) or renegotiated (volatile)?

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- **Pre-closing engagement**: Meet with South Metro to notify of acquisition, commit to continued 5,000 AF/year purchase, **negotiate expansion rights** for additional 5,000-10,000 AF/year
- **Alternative reuse sources**: Denver Metro Wastewater Reclamation District (200+ MGD capacity), Littleton/Englewood WWTP (5,000 AF/year potential)
- **Long-term goal**: Expand reuse water to **10,000-15,000 AF/year** (replace 50% of agricultural lease dependence with drought-proof supply)

### Risk Assessment Summary

| Contract Type | Annual Value | Assignment Risk | Change-of-Control Risk | Deal-Blocking? | Recommended Action |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Agricultural Leases** | $3M-$12M | LOW | HIGH (60-70%) | No | Multi-year lease renegotiation (Target: 80% of 3,500 AF under 3-5 year terms) |
| **Wholesale Contracts** | $7M | LOW | MEDIUM (30-40%) | No | Proactive customer outreach, CPUC approval addresses concerns |
| **USBR Participation** | $1.24M-$3.19M annually; 45,000 AF/year (33% of supply) | HIGH (USBR approval required) | HIGH | **YES** (if USBR denies) | Submit USBR assignment request 6 months pre-closing, GVWUA coordination |
| **South Metro Reuse** | $4M-$7.5M | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | No | Pre-closing negotiation for expansion rights (5,000-10,000 AF/year) |

### Quantified Exposure

**Total Annual Commercial Contract Exposure** (post-acquisition):

| Scenario | Agricultural Leases | Wholesale | USBR | Reuse | Total Annual |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|------|-------|--------------|
| **Best Case** | $3M | $7M | $1.24M | $4M | **$15.24M** |
| **Base Case** | $7.5M | $7M | $2.19M | $5.75M | **$22.44M** |
| **Worst Case** | $15M | $5.6M | $3.19M | $7.5M | **$31.29M** |

**20-Year NPV**: $115M (base case) to $230M (worst case) if Colorado River curtailment continues through 2040 (discounted at 6% WACC).

**Cost Recovery**: Most costs passed through to customers via CPUC-approved Purchased Water Adjustment clause, reducing MSWC's direct financial exposure but increasing **regulatory risk** (CPUC scrutiny of prudent supply management).

### Cross-Domain Impacts for Memorandum Synthesis

| Finding | Target Domain | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Agricultural lease volatility ($3M-$12M annually)** | Water Rights Litigation (T6) | If MSWC wins Colorado River litigation, does curtailment revert to 45,000 AF/year, eliminating agricultural lease needs? | HIGH |
| **USBR assignment approval (43 CFR § 429.2(b))** | CFIUS/National Security (T11) | Does USBR consider foreign ownership (45%) in assignment approval? Coordinate CFIUS and USBR domestic control frameworks. | HIGH |
| **Wholesale customer rate concerns** | State PUC Regulatory (T2) | Will CPUC impose rate freeze condition addressing wholesale complaints? Impact on LSL/PFAS cost recovery. | MEDIUM |
| **South Metro reuse expansion (5,000-10,000 AF/year)** | Water Rights (T5) | Does reuse expansion eliminate agricultural lease needs? Comparative cost analysis. | MEDIUM |
| **Purchased water pass-through ($3M-$12M annually)** | Financial Impact (T12) | Model purchased water scenarios in 20-year NPV analysis. Impact on customer rates and CPUC approval. | HIGH |

### Critical Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing, Timeline: 30-90 days)

1. **Data Room Contract Review** (30 days): Obtain all water supply contracts, identify assignment/change-of-control clauses, MFN provisions, expansion rights
2. **USBR Assignment Application** (6 months pre-closing): Submit to USBR Western Colorado Area Office, coordinate with GVWUA, obtain support letter
3. **Agricultural Lessor Negotiation** (60-90 days): Contact all lessors, negotiate multi-year extensions (3-5 years), lock in pricing, target 80% of 3,500 AF under long-term contracts
4. **Wholesale Customer Outreach** (90 days): Identify top 10 customers, communicate acquisition, commit to service continuity, obtain waivers
5. **South Metro Reuse Expansion** (60 days): Meet with South Metro, negotiate expansion rights (ROFR for 5,000-10,000 AF/year), lock in CPI-indexed pricing

### Recommendations

**Short-Term (Year 1 post-closing)**:
- Diversify agricultural lease portfolio to 5,000-7,500 AF, stagger lease terms geographically
- Execute South Metro expansion (5,000 AF/year additional)
- Monitor CPUC rate case for purchased water cost recovery (2026 filing)

**Long-Term (Years 2-5)**:
- Evaluate permanent water right acquisitions ($10,000-$15,000/AF, comparable to Aurora 2024 purchases)
- Expand reuse water to 10,000-15,000 AF/year (replace 50% of agricultural lease dependence)
- Evaluate direct potable reuse (DPR) projects (Colorado adopted DPR regulations 2023)²² to achieve 100% supply security

---

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. MSWC's Water Supply Portfolio Context

Mountain States Water Company (MSWC) serves 485,000 water connections across 45 Colorado municipalities with a total supply portfolio of 135,000 acre-feet per year (AF/year):

- **Colorado River allocation**: 45,000 AF/year via USBR Grand Valley Diversion Project (priority dates 1955-1978, mid-priority)
- **South Platte River**: 28,000 AF/year (priority dates 1948-1965, senior rights)
- **Groundwater**: 22,000 AF/year (Denver Basin non-tributary)
- **Transmountain diversions**: 18,000 AF/year (priority 1936, very senior)
- **Reuse water**: 5,000 AF/year (treated effluent from South Metro Wastewater Authority)

### B. 2024 Supplemental Water Purchases (Agricultural Leases)

Due to 10% Colorado River curtailment under the 2023 Upper Basin agreement, MSWC lost 4,500 AF/year of its Colorado River allocation. To compensate, MSWC purchased 3,500 AF from agricultural water rights holders in 2024:

- **Volume**: 3,500 AF
- **Pricing**: $850-$1,200 per AF (market-driven, drought-dependent)
- **Total cost**: $3M-$4.2M (2024 actual)
- **Lease structure**: 1-year leases, April-October irrigation season, annual re-negotiation
- **Future needs**: 5,000-10,000 AF/year if additional Colorado River curtailments occur (estimated cost $4.25M-$12M annually)

### C. Colorado Agricultural Water Lease Market (2024-2025)

The Colorado agricultural-to-municipal water lease market experienced significant price volatility in 2024:

- **C-BT Project water**: $52,000 per AF (February 2024 auction for 90 shares)¹
- **Aurora permanent purchases**: $10,240 per AF (April 2024, Otero County, 7,500 AF/year)²
- **Annual lease rates**: $200 per AF typical for Northern Colorado irrigation leases³
- **MSWC's lease pricing**: $850-$1,200 per AF (mid-range, reflecting temporary transfer premium over irrigation leases but below permanent purchase prices)

The disparity between MSWC's lease pricing ($850-$1,200/AF) and C-BT auction prices ($52,000/AF) reflects the difference between **temporary annual leases** (MSWC's model) and **permanent water right sales** (C-BT auction model). For permanent acquisitions, Aurora paid $10,240/AF, while annual irrigation leases average $200/AF. MSWC's pricing falls between these extremes, consistent with multi-year renewable leases offering more certainty than spot-market annual irrigation leases but less than permanent transfers.

### D. Transaction Structure: AWI Acquisition of MSWC

American Water Infrastructure LLC (AWI) is acquiring MSWC for $2.4B via stock purchase (Delaware corporation). The acquisition raises critical assignment questions for MSWC's commercial contracts:

1. **Purchased water agreements**: Do agricultural lessors consent to assignment to AWI, or can they terminate upon change of control?
2. **Wholesale water contracts**: Do municipal/district customers consent to assignment, or require notice/approval?
3. **USBR participation agreement**: Does federal law require USBR approval for assignment of Grand Valley Diversion Project participation?
4. **Reuse water agreement**: Does South Metro Wastewater Authority consent to assignment to AWI?

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Purchased Water Agreements (Agricultural Leases)

#### 1. Legal Framework for Agricultural Water Leases in Colorado

**a. Colorado Water Rights as Property**

Colorado water rights are usufructuary property rights governed by prior appropriation doctrine.⁴ Water rights holders may lease, loan, or exchange legally stored water without losing the underlying water right or permanently selling it.⁵ The Colorado General Assembly affirmed that water law "does not impair, limit, or otherwise affect the rights of persons or entities to enter into agreements, contracts, or memoranda of understanding with other persons or entities relating to the appropriation, movement, or use of water."⁶

**b. Temporary Transfers and Change of Use**

Temporary water transfers from agricultural to municipal use require water court approval to ensure no injury to other appropriators.⁷ However, **short-term leases** (typically 1-3 years) for irrigation season water are commonly structured as **annual contracts** that do not change the decreed use, avoiding water court proceedings. These "dry-year option" agreements allow municipalities to purchase agricultural water during drought years when farmers voluntarily fallow land.⁸

**c. Assignment Provisions Under UCC Article 2**

Colorado water supply contracts for the sale of water may be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Article 2 if water is sold as "goods."⁹ Under C.R.S. § 4-2-210:

- A prohibition on assignment of "the contract" bars only **delegation of performance**, not assignment of rights to receive payment.¹⁰
- An assignment of "the contract" includes both assignment of rights and delegation of duties unless circumstances indicate otherwise.¹¹
- **Anti-assignment clauses** are common in water supply contracts and are generally enforceable to prevent assignment without counterparty consent.¹²

#### 2. MSWC's Purchased Water Agreements: Structure and Terms

**Based on user-provided facts**, MSWC's 2024 purchased water agreements have the following structure:

| Contract Element | MSWC's Terms (2024) | Typical Industry Structure |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Volume** | 3,500 AF | Varies by municipal need, 1,000-10,000 AF |
| **Price per AF** | $850-$1,200 | $200-$2,000 depending on market, drought severity |
| **Duration** | 1-year leases | 1-3 years typical (short-term to avoid water court) |
| **Season** | April-October | Irrigation season (municipal storage for winter use) |
| **Renewal** | Annual re-negotiation | Either automatic renewal or re-negotiate |
| **Price escalation** | Negotiated annually (volatile) | Fixed, CPI-indexed, or renegotiated |
| **Termination** | Lessor can terminate if needs water for crops; MSWC can terminate if adequate supply | Mutual termination rights typical |
| **Delivery point** | Specified in each agreement | Typically at diversion structure or agreed exchange point |
| **Water quality** | Raw agricultural water (MSWC treats) | Agricultural return flows, variable quality |
| **Payment timing** | [Data room required] | Typically upfront or quarterly |

**Risk Assessment: Purchased Water Security Post-Acquisition**

🔴 **HIGH RISK**: Agricultural water leases are **short-term (1-year)** with **annual re-negotiation**. Farmers have strong incentives to terminate or renegotiate upon change of control:

1. **Negotiating leverage**: AWI acquisition signals MSWC's financial capacity, potentially leading lessors to demand higher prices ($1,500-$2,000/AF vs. current $850-$1,200/AF).
2. **Farmer crop prices**: If agricultural commodity prices increase in 2026-2027, farmers may choose to **irrigate crops rather than lease water to MSWC**, terminating agreements.
3. **Drought continuation**: If drought persists, competing municipalities (Denver Water, Aurora, Colorado Springs) will bid for the same agricultural water pool, driving prices above $1,500/AF.
4. **No long-term commitment**: 1-year leases provide **no security** beyond current irrigation season. MSWC faces annual risk of non-renewal.

**Assignment Analysis**:

- **Stock purchase** (AWI acquiring MSWC shares): Agricultural water lease **assignment issue is minimal** because the contracting entity (MSWC) remains unchanged. However, lessors may have **change-of-control consent provisions** allowing termination if MSWC ownership changes.
- **Change-of-control clauses**: If agricultural leases contain "change of control = deemed assignment" language, lessors could terminate agreements upon AWI's acquisition closing.
- **Recommendation**: AWI should conduct **contract-by-contract review** of all agricultural water lease assignments and change-of-control provisions. If >50% of leases are terminable upon change of control, MSWC faces **immediate supply shortfall** post-closing requiring emergency supplemental purchases at higher spot prices ($1,500-$2,000/AF).

#### 3. Future Supplemental Water Needs: 5,000-10,000 AF/Year

If Colorado River curtailments continue (Lake Powell <25% capacity triggers additional 10-20% Upper Basin cuts), MSWC will require **5,000-10,000 AF/year** in supplemental purchases:

- **Low scenario**: 5,000 AF/year × $850/AF = **$4.25M annually**
- **Base scenario**: 7,500 AF/year × $1,000/AF = **$7.5M annually**
- **High scenario**: 10,000 AF/year × $1,200/AF = **$12M annually**

MSWC has CPUC-approved **Purchased Water Adjustment (PWA) clause** allowing automatic pass-through of purchased water costs above baseline $2M annually to customers via quarterly surcharge.¹³ This mitigates financial risk to MSWC but increases customer rates by $0.85-$1.80 per month per customer (depending on volume purchased).¹⁴

**20-Year NPV of Supplemental Water Purchases**:

Assuming megadrought continues through 2040 (scientific projections¹⁵):

- Base case: 7,500 AF/year × $1,000/AF × 20 years = $150M nominal
- Discounted at 6% WACC: **NPV = $115M**
- High case: 10,000 AF/year × $1,200/AF × 20 years = $240M nominal
- Discounted at 6% WACC: **NPV = $184M**

These costs are **passed through to customers** via PWA clause, reducing MSWC's direct financial exposure but potentially impacting rate competitiveness and regulatory approval for rate increases.

### B. Wholesale Water Contracts

#### 1. Legal Framework for Wholesale Water Supply Agreements

**a. Authority for Wholesale Water Contracts**

Colorado water districts and municipalities are authorized to enter into contracts for wholesale water supply under C.R.S. § 37-45-131 ("Sale of water by contract").¹⁶ Water conservancy districts' contracts may be for municipal and industrial use by the recipient.¹⁷ These wholesale arrangements allow smaller municipalities and special districts to purchase treated water from larger utilities (like MSWC) rather than construct duplicate treatment infrastructure.

**b. Assignment and Succession Provisions**

Colorado wholesale water contracts typically include **strict assignment provisions** requiring mutual consent for any transfer of rights or duties:

> "Neither party may assign any rights or delegate duties under this Agreement without prior written approval of the other party and compliance with applicable provisions. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of these provisions is void and ineffectual."¹⁸

However, contracts often define parties to include "successors or assigns," suggesting that **successor entities** (such as AWI acquiring MSWC via stock purchase) may automatically succeed to contract rights where the **same legal entity continues** post-transaction.¹⁹

**Stock Purchase vs. Asset Purchase**:

- **Stock purchase** (AWI's structure): MSWC Delaware corporation continues as contracting entity. **No assignment occurs** because contracts remain with same legal entity. However, wholesale customers may have **change-of-control consent provisions** allowing termination if MSWC's ownership changes.²⁰
- **Asset purchase**: Would constitute assignment requiring customer consent under typical anti-assignment clauses.²¹

#### 2. MSWC's Wholesale Water Contracts: Structure and Revenue

MSWC serves **2,800 master-metered wholesale connections** to small municipalities and water districts, generating **$7M annually** (approximately 1% of MSWC's $680M total revenue).²²

**Typical Wholesale Contract Terms** (industry standard, subject to data room verification for MSWC's actual contracts):

| Contract Element | Typical Structure | MSWC's Likely Terms |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Customers** | Small municipalities, special districts | 10-15 wholesale customers (estimated based on 2,800 master-metered connections) |
| **Volume** | Varies by customer size | Top 10 customers likely account for 80% of $7M revenue |
| **Pricing structure** | Volumetric ($/1,000 gallons) or flat annual fee | Likely volumetric + fixed monthly charge (see below) |
| **Volumetric rate** | $3-$8 per 1,000 gallons (wholesale discount to retail $5-$12/1,000 gal) | Estimated $4-$6/1,000 gal based on $7M annual revenue |
| **Rate adjustment** | Annual CPI increase or tied to supplier's retail rate case | Tied to MSWC's CPUC-approved retail rates (automatic pass-through) |
| **Contract term** | 10-40 years (long-term infrastructure reliance) | 20-30 years typical for Colorado wholesale water |
| **Renewal** | Automatic renewal unless terminated with notice | Likely automatic renewal with 1-5 years' notice |
| **Termination notice** | 1-5 years (allows customer to develop alternative supply) | 2-3 years typical for Colorado |
| **Exclusivity** | Supplier may have exclusive service territory rights | MSWC likely has CPUC-certificated exclusive service areas |
| **Assignment** | Requires customer consent | Stock purchase may not trigger assignment, but change-of-control clause may require notification or consent |

**Rate Structure Analysis**:

Colorado water utilities typically charge **volumetric rates** (variable cost per gallon) plus **fixed monthly charges** (recover fixed infrastructure costs).²³ If MSWC's wholesale contracts generate $7M annually from 2,800 connections:

- **Average revenue per connection**: $7M ÷ 2,800 = **$2,500 per connection annually**
- **Volumetric component**: If wholesale customers use 500,000 gallons/month average (small municipality/district), annual usage = 6M gallons. At $4/1,000 gallons = $24,000/year per large customer.
- **Conclusion**: $7M revenue suggests **mix of large customers** (small municipalities using millions of gallons monthly) and **small customers** (special districts, HOAs using <100,000 gallons monthly).

#### 3. Assignment and Change-of-Control Analysis for AWI Acquisition

**🟡 MEDIUM RISK**: Wholesale water contracts likely do **not require assignment** (stock purchase preserves MSWC as contracting entity), but **change-of-control consent provisions** may require customer notification or approval.

**Contract Review Priorities**:

1. **Identify change-of-control provisions**: Do any wholesale contracts define "change of control" as requiring customer consent? Common triggers:
   - Change in majority ownership (>50% of MSWC stock)
   - Change in ultimate parent entity (AWI becomes new parent)
   - Change in "control" (broadly defined to include indirect control)

2. **Notification requirements**: Even without consent rights, contracts may require **advance written notice** (30-90 days) of ownership change. Failure to provide notice could constitute breach.

3. **Rate protection clauses**: Do wholesale customers have **most-favored-nation (MFN) clauses** ensuring they receive rates no less favorable than other wholesale customers? AWI's operational changes could trigger MFN disputes if rates increase post-acquisition.

4. **Exclusivity and alternative supply**: Can wholesale customers **develop alternative supplies** (wells, interconnections with other utilities) if dissatisfied with MSWC post-acquisition? Long contract terms (20-30 years) typically lock customers into MSWC supply, but termination-for-cause provisions may allow exit if service deteriorates.

**Recommendation**:

- **Data room review**: Obtain and review **all 2,800 wholesale customer contracts** (focus on top 10 customers representing ~80% of $7M revenue) to identify:
  - Assignment and change-of-control provisions
  - Termination notice periods
  - Rate adjustment mechanisms (CPI vs. tied to MSWC retail rates)
  - Exclusivity and alternative supply rights
- **Customer outreach**: AWI should proactively communicate with top 10 wholesale customers **pre-closing** to address concerns, commit to service continuity, and obtain written waivers of any change-of-control consent requirements (if applicable).
- **CPUC approval condition**: Colorado PUC approval of AWI's acquisition may **automatically address** wholesale contract assignment concerns if CPUC orders MSWC to continue serving wholesale customers under existing contracts (regulatory override of contract termination rights).

#### 4. Rate Increase Pass-Through and Customer Relations Risk

Wholesale customers purchasing MSWC's treated water will experience **automatic rate increases** if MSWC's retail rates increase post-acquisition. Colorado utilities typically pass through rate increases to wholesale customers via **automatic adjustment clauses** tied to CPUC-approved retail rate cases.²⁴

**AWI Post-Acquisition Rate Pressure Scenarios**:

1. **Lead service line replacement**: MSWC's $1.4B-$1.95B LSL program will require rate increases of 8-12% annually over 10 years (if CPUC approves full cost recovery). Wholesale customers will see corresponding volumetric rate increases from $4-$6/1,000 gal to $4.80-$7.20/1,000 gal (+20-30% over 10 years).

2. **PFAS treatment capital**: $50M-$80M PFAS treatment costs (8 systems) will add 1-2% annual rate increases over 3 years (2026-2029 compliance deadline).

3. **Debt service on acquisition**: If AWI finances the $2.4B purchase price with debt, CPUC may allow MSWC to recover interest expense in rates, adding 2-4% annual rate increases.

**Wholesale Customer Response**:

- **Termination risk**: If MSWC's rates increase >20% over 5 years post-acquisition, wholesale customers with long termination notice periods (3-5 years) may **trigger termination clauses** to develop alternative supplies before rate increases become prohibitive.
- **Regulatory complaints**: Wholesale customers could intervene in MSWC's CPUC rate cases to challenge AWI's cost recovery requests, arguing that acquisition-related costs (debt service, executive compensation) should not be passed through to wholesale customers.

**Estimated Revenue at Risk**: If 20% of wholesale customers ($1.4M of $7M revenue) terminate contracts over 5 years due to rate increases, MSWC loses $1.4M annually (0.2% of total revenue, **minimal financial impact** but potential **negative optics** for CPUC approval if customers publicly oppose acquisition).

### C. USBR Grand Valley Diversion Project Participation Agreement

#### 1. Legal Framework for Federal Reclamation Project Participation

**a. Bureau of Reclamation Project Structure**

The Grand Valley Diversion Project (Grand Valley Project, GVP) was constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) beginning in 1913-1916 under the Reclamation Act of 1902 and subsequent project-specific authorizing legislation.²⁵ In 1949, USBR transferred operation of the dam and canal system to the **Grand Valley Water Users Association (GVWUA)**, a Colorado nonprofit corporation organized in 1905.²⁶

**Project facilities** include:
- Grand Valley Diversion Dam (Roller Dam) on Colorado River in De Beque Canyon
- Government Highline Canal (55 miles)
- 150 miles of project laterals
- Grand Valley Hydroelectric Power Plant (operated under Lease of Power Privilege with USBR)

**Participants**: GVWUA serves over 23,000 irrigable acres and coordinates with Orchard Mesa Irrigation District (OMID), Mesa County Irrigation District (MCID), and Palisade Irrigation District (PID).²⁷ **MSWC's participation** in the Grand Valley Project entitles MSWC to divert **45,000 AF/year** from the Colorado River via the project's diversion infrastructure.

**b. Assignment and Transfer Requirements Under Federal Law**

**43 CFR Part 429** (Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and Waterbodies) governs assignment of use authorizations:

> **§ 429.2(b)**: "Use authorizations may not be transferred or assigned to others **without prior written approval of Reclamation**, unless specifically provided for in the use authorization..."²⁸

> **§ 429.28(d)**: Use authorizations must include "the conditions under which the use authorization may be renewed, terminated, amended, **assigned or transferred**..."²⁹

**Additional requirement for long-term contracts**:

> **§ 429.17**: Use authorizations for easements/rights-of-way for periods exceeding 25 years are subject to approval from **water user organizations** under contract obligation for repayment (i.e., GVWUA may have veto rights over MSWC's assignment to AWI if MSWC's participation is structured as a long-term easement).³⁰

**c. Stock Purchase vs. Asset Purchase Implications**

- **Stock purchase** (AWI's structure): MSWC Delaware corporation continues as the contracting party with USBR. **No formal assignment occurs**, but USBR regulations may require **notification** of ownership change and potential **USBR approval** if participation agreement contains change-of-control provisions.
- **Asset purchase**: Would constitute assignment requiring USBR approval (and potentially GVWUA approval if long-term easement >25 years).

#### 2. MSWC's Grand Valley Participation: Financial Obligations

**a. Capital Assessments**

GVWUA assessments are based on **irrigable acres** or "Class 1 Acres" as determined by USBR.³¹ GVWUA collects:

1. **Capital Reserve Fee**: Funds long-term infrastructure improvements and deferred maintenance.³²
2. **Annual capital assessments**: GVWUA and OMID are responsible for operations, maintenance, and replacement (OMR) of all GVP infrastructure.³³

**MSWC's share** (estimated based on 45,000 AF/year allocation):

- If Grand Valley Project total capacity is ~150,000-200,000 AF/year (serving 23,000+ irrigable acres), MSWC's 45,000 AF = **22-30% of project capacity**.
- **Annual capital assessments**: If GVWUA's total annual capital budget is $5M-$10M, MSWC's share = **$1.1M-$3M annually**.
- **Data room verification required**: Actual MSWC payment amounts to GVWUA for 2023-2024.

**b. Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Costs**

USBR's **Grand Valley Unit** (salinity control facilities) has annual O&M costs of **$635,000** (removes 115,700 tons of salt per year).³⁴ These costs are allocated among participants. If MSWC's share is proportional to its allocation (22-30%), MSWC pays **$140K-$190K annually** for USBR's O&M.

**Total estimated annual costs**:
- Capital assessments (GVWUA): $1.1M-$3M
- O&M (USBR salinity control): $140K-$190K
- **Total: $1.24M-$3.19M annually**

These costs are **recoverable in MSWC's CPUC rates** as purchased/raw water supply costs (similar to purchased water adjustment clause for agricultural leases).

#### 3. Curtailment Allocation Under 2023 Upper Basin Agreement

**MSWC's Colorado River allocation**: 45,000 AF/year (historical)
**2023 Upper Basin 10% cut**: MSWC reduced to **40,500 AF/year** (loss of 4,500 AF/year)

**Key question**: How are curtailment losses allocated among Grand Valley Project participants?

**Two allocation methods**:

1. **Pro rata allocation** (10% cut applied equally to all participants): MSWC loses 10% of 45,000 = 4,500 AF/year.
2. **Priority-based allocation** (junior rights curtailed first): If MSWC's priority dates (1955-1978) are junior to agricultural users' priorities (1900s-1940s), MSWC could face **disproportionate curtailment** (e.g., 15-20% cut if protecting senior agricultural rights).

**Litigation risk**: MSWC v. Colorado River Water Conservation District (filed March 2024)³⁵ challenges the 10% pro rata curtailment methodology, arguing that **prior appropriation doctrine** should govern (senior rights protected, junior rights curtailed). If MSWC's litigation succeeds (20-30% probability), curtailment may be reallocated to junior agricultural users within Grand Valley Project, **restoring MSWC's 45,000 AF/year allocation**.

**If litigation fails** (70-80% probability), MSWC's **permanent loss of 4,500 AF/year** requires supplemental purchases (3,500 AF purchased in 2024, future needs 5,000-10,000 AF/year if additional 10-20% Upper Basin cuts occur).

#### 4. Assignment Analysis: AWI Acquisition of MSWC's Participation Rights

**🔴 HIGH RISK — USBR Approval Required**

**Federal regulations (43 CFR § 429.2(b))** require **USBR prior written approval** for assignment or transfer of use authorizations. Even if AWI's stock purchase does not constitute formal "assignment," USBR may interpret MSWC's change of control as triggering approval requirements.

**USBR approval process** (estimated timeline):

1. **Application submission**: AWI/MSWC submit assignment request to USBR Western Colorado Area Office, including:
   - Description of transaction (stock purchase, change of control)
   - Financial qualifications of AWI (demonstrate ability to pay GVWUA assessments and USBR O&M costs)
   - Operational capacity (demonstrate ability to beneficially use 45,000 AF/year for municipal water supply)
   - Environmental compliance (NEPA review if USBR deems change in use or intensity)

2. **GVWUA consultation**: If MSWC's participation is structured as long-term easement >25 years, USBR must obtain **GVWUA approval** per 43 CFR § 429.17.³⁶ GVWUA may require AWI to:
   - Commit to continued participation in Grand Valley Project
   - Pay capital assessments on same terms as MSWC historically
   - Agree to GVWUA governance (voting rights, board representation if MSWC has any)

3. **USBR decision**: USBR reviews under criteria at 43 CFR § 429.14-15:³⁷
   - Does assignment interfere with project operations?
   - Does AWI have financial capacity to meet obligations?
   - Is continued beneficial use of water demonstrated?
   - Does change of control raise environmental or public interest concerns (foreign ownership 45%)?

4. **Timeline**: 60-120 days for USBR administrative review (no formal hearing unless contested). If GVWUA objects or environmental groups challenge AWI's foreign ownership, timeline extends to 6-12 months.

**Recommendation**:

- **Pre-closing engagement**: AWI should submit assignment request to USBR **6 months before anticipated closing** to allow USBR review concurrent with CPUC approval process.
- **GVWUA coordination**: Meet with GVWUA board to address concerns, commit to continued participation, and obtain written support letter for USBR submission.
- **Federal regulatory coordination**: If CFIUS review is required (see T11), coordinate USBR and CFIUS processes to avoid conflicting conditions (e.g., CFIUS may require domestic control protections, USBR may require GVWUA approval).
- **Closing condition**: Make AWI's closing contingent on USBR approval (or obtain legal opinion that stock purchase does not require USBR approval under 43 CFR Part 429).

**Risk if USBR denies assignment**:

- **Deal-blocking**: If USBR denies assignment and deems MSWC's participation non-transferable, AWI cannot acquire MSWC's 45,000 AF/year Colorado River allocation (33% of MSWC's total 135,000 AF/year supply portfolio). This would render MSWC's water supply inadequate for serving 485,000 connections, likely causing AWI to abandon acquisition.
- **Mitigation**: USBR denial is **unlikely** (federal policy favors municipal water supply over agricultural use, AWI's financial capacity exceeds MSWC's). However, **foreign ownership (45% CPPIB/Macquarie)** may trigger USBR scrutiny requiring domestic control protections (see CFIUS analysis at T11).

### D. South Metro Wastewater Authority Reuse Water Purchase Agreement

#### 1. Legal Framework for Wastewater Reuse in Colorado

**a. Colorado Regulation 84 (5 CCR 1002-84)**

Colorado permits non-potable water reuse under **Regulation 84**, which defines reclaimed water as "domestic wastewater that has received secondary treatment by a domestic treatment works and such additional treatment as to enable the wastewater to meet the standards for approved uses."³⁸

**Approved non-potable uses** include:³⁹
- Landscape irrigation (residential, commercial, golf courses, parks)
- Agricultural irrigation
- Industrial processes (cooling towers, manufacturing)
- Toilet/urinal flushing (commercial buildings)
- Fire protection systems
- Construction dust control

**Treatment standards**:⁴⁰
- **E. coli**: 0 detected in ≥75% of samples, not exceeding 126/100 mL monthly
- **Turbidity**: ≤5 NTU in no more than 5% of monthly samples
- **Signage required**: Public notification that reclaimed water is not potable

**b. Drought-Proof Supply Advantage**

Wastewater effluent is a **drought-proof supply** because wastewater flows are consistent year-round regardless of precipitation (unlike surface water subject to Colorado River curtailment or South Platte low flows). Municipalities increasingly value reuse water as **climate-resilient supply** to offset surface water curtailment risks.⁴¹

#### 2. MSWC's South Metro Reuse Water Agreement: Structure

MSWC purchases **5,000 AF/year** treated effluent from South Metro Wastewater Authority for non-potable reuse (parks, golf courses, industrial cooling, landscape irrigation).⁴²

**Estimated contract terms** (industry standard, subject to data room verification):

| Contract Element | Typical Structure | MSWC's Likely Terms |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Volume** | 5,000 AF/year | Fixed annual volume with optional additional purchases |
| **Pricing** | $500-$2,000/AF (lower than potable water but higher than agricultural leases) | Estimated $800-$1,500/AF based on treatment level |
| **Total annual cost** | $4M-$7.5M (5,000 AF × $800-$1,500/AF) | Recoverable in MSWC rates as purchased water |
| **Treatment standard** | Secondary (BOD <30 mg/L, TSS <30 mg/L) or tertiary (additional filtration/disinfection) | Secondary + UV disinfection by South Metro, MSWC provides distribution |
| **Delivery point** | South Metro WWTP discharge, MSWC's reuse distribution system intake | Likely interconnection pipeline |
| **Water quality guarantees** | South Metro warrants compliance with Regulation 84 standards | MSWC responsible for additional treatment if needed for Regulation 84 compliance |
| **Reliability** | South Metro obligated to deliver year-round (drought-proof) | Force majeure exceptions (WWTP outage, pipeline failure) |
| **Contract term** | 10-20 years (long-term infrastructure investment for reuse distribution) | Estimated 15-20 years |
| **Renewal** | Automatic renewal or renegotiate pricing | Likely automatic renewal with CPI price adjustment |
| **Termination** | 2-5 years' notice | 3 years typical |
| **Expansion rights** | Right of first refusal for additional capacity if South Metro expands WWTP | Critical for MSWC's supplemental supply needs (see below) |
| **Assignment** | Requires South Metro consent | Stock purchase may not trigger assignment, but change-of-control notification likely required |

**Pricing analysis**:

Reuse water pricing in Colorado ranges from **$500/AF** (basic secondary effluent for agricultural irrigation) to **$12,000-$13,000/AF** (advanced treatment for indirect potable reuse).⁴³ MSWC's non-potable reuse (parks, golf courses, industrial) likely costs **$800-$1,500/AF** (mid-range: secondary + UV disinfection).

- **5,000 AF/year × $800/AF** = **$4M annually** (low estimate)
- **5,000 AF/year × $1,500/AF** = **$7.5M annually** (high estimate)
- **Mid-point estimate**: **$5.75M annually**

This cost is **recoverable in MSWC's CPUC rates** as purchased water supply, similar to agricultural lease pass-through via Purchased Water Adjustment clause.

#### 3. Expansion Rights: Critical for Offsetting Colorado River Curtailment

If Colorado River curtailments continue (additional 10-20% Upper Basin cuts if Lake Powell <25% capacity), MSWC will require **5,000-10,000 AF/year** in supplemental supply beyond current agricultural leases (3,500 AF/year 2024).⁴⁴

**South Metro reuse expansion potential**:

- **Current MSWC purchase**: 5,000 AF/year
- **Potential expansion**: If South Metro expands WWTP capacity or MSWC can contract for additional effluent from other WWTPs (e.g., Denver Metro Wastewater, Littleton/Englewood), MSWC could acquire **5,000-10,000 AF/year** additional reuse water.
- **Pricing for expansion**: Likely **$1,000-$2,000/AF** (higher than current contract due to new infrastructure investment for expansion, comparable to agricultural lease prices $850-$1,200/AF but with drought-proof reliability advantage).

**Expansion cost scenarios**:

- **5,000 AF/year expansion** × $1,500/AF = **$7.5M annually** (total reuse purchases: 10,000 AF/year, $12.5M-$15M annually)
- **10,000 AF/year expansion** × $1,500/AF = **$15M annually** (total reuse purchases: 15,000 AF/year, $20M-$22.5M annually)

**Strategic advantage**: Reuse water expansion is **drought-proof** (unlike agricultural leases subject to farmer termination if crop prices increase or irrigation needed). Reuse water is also **locally controlled** (no USBR approval, no Colorado River Compact allocation disputes), making it **more secure** than surface water supplies.

**Contract review priorities**:

1. **Expansion rights**: Does MSWC's South Metro contract include **right of first refusal** (ROFR) for additional capacity if South Metro expands WWTP? If no ROFR, MSWC may lose expansion opportunity to competing utilities (Aurora, Denver Water, Colorado Springs).
2. **Assignment provisions**: Does South Metro contract require consent for assignment or change of control? If yes, AWI must obtain South Metro's written consent pre-closing.
3. **Pricing adjustment**: How is reuse water pricing adjusted over contract term? CPI-indexed? Renegotiated every 5 years? If CPI-indexed, predictable costs. If renegotiated, risk of significant price increases (similar to agricultural lease volatility).

#### 4. Assignment Analysis for AWI Acquisition

**🟡 MEDIUM RISK**: South Metro contract likely requires notification of change of control, potentially consent.

**Recommendation**:

- **Data room review**: Obtain and review South Metro Wastewater Authority reuse water purchase agreement to identify assignment/change-of-control provisions.
- **South Metro engagement**: AWI should proactively contact South Metro **pre-closing** to:
  - Notify of pending acquisition
  - Commit to continued purchase of 5,000 AF/year on existing terms
  - **Negotiate expansion rights** for additional 5,000-10,000 AF/year to offset Colorado River curtailment
  - Obtain written waiver of any assignment/change-of-control consent requirements
- **Alternative reuse supplies**: If South Metro cannot expand, AWI should evaluate **alternative reuse water sources**:
  - Denver Metro Wastewater Reclamation District (capacity: 200+ MGD, serves Denver metro)
  - Littleton/Englewood WWTP (South Platte basin)
  - Direct non-potable reuse systems (toilet flushing in commercial buildings, reducing potable demand)

**Risk if South Metro terminates**:

- **Loss of 5,000 AF/year drought-proof supply**: MSWC would need to replace with agricultural leases (less reliable, subject to farmer termination) or additional Colorado River supply (subject to curtailment). Estimated replacement cost: **$4.25M-$6M annually** (5,000 AF × $850-$1,200/AF agricultural lease pricing).
- **Mitigation**: South Metro termination is **unlikely** (wastewater authorities benefit from selling effluent, generates revenue for WWTP operations, environmental benefit of reuse vs. discharge to rivers). However, South Metro could renegotiate pricing upward (e.g., $1,500-$2,000/AF) if it perceives MSWC is "locked in" post-acquisition.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Contract Assignment and Change-of-Control Risk Matrix

| Contract Type | Annual Value | Assignment Risk | Change-of-Control Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Risk Level |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Purchased Water (Agricultural Leases)** | $3M-$12M | LOW (1-year leases, no formal assignment) | HIGH (lessors may demand higher prices or terminate post-acquisition) | Pre-closing negotiation with lessors, diversify supply sources, expand reuse water | 🔴 HIGH |
| **Wholesale Water Contracts** | $7M | LOW (stock purchase, no assignment) | MEDIUM (change-of-control notification likely required, potential customer concerns) | Proactive customer outreach, CPUC approval addresses concerns, service quality commitments | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| **USBR Grand Valley Participation** | $1.24M-$3.19M annually (O&M/capital); 45,000 AF/year water supply (33% of MSWC total) | HIGH (43 CFR § 429.2(b) requires USBR approval) | HIGH (USBR may require notification, GVWUA approval if >25-year easement) | Submit USBR assignment request 6 months pre-closing, GVWUA coordination, CFIUS coordination | 🔴 HIGH |
| **South Metro Reuse Water** | $4M-$7.5M | MEDIUM (contract likely requires consent) | MEDIUM (notification likely required) | Pre-closing engagement with South Metro, negotiate expansion rights (5,000-10,000 AF/year), obtain waiver | 🟡 MEDIUM |

### B. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Agricultural lease non-renewal** | High | Probable (60-70%) | $1.5M-$8M annually (price increases + volume loss) | Diversify suppliers, lock in multi-year leases pre-closing, expand reuse water to 10,000-15,000 AF/year |
| **USBR assignment denial** | Critical (Deal-blocking) | Unlikely (10-20%) | Loss of 45,000 AF/year (33% of supply) | Early USBR engagement, demonstrate financial capacity, domestic control protections |
| **Wholesale customer terminations** | Low | Possible (20-30%) | $1.4M annually (20% customer loss) | Service quality commitments, rate freeze guarantees, CPUC approval addresses concerns |
| **South Metro pricing renegotiation** | Medium | Possible (30-40%) | $2.5M-$5M annually (price increase to $1,500-$2,000/AF) | Lock in CPI-indexed pricing pre-closing, negotiate expansion rights as bargaining chip |
| **GVWUA increased assessments** | Medium | Probable (60-70%) | $500K-$1M annually (deferred maintenance) | Recoverable in CPUC rates, AWI should budget for capital improvements |

### C. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Agricultural lease change-of-control clauses**: Data room review required to identify how many of MSWC's agricultural water lease agreements (2024: 3,500 AF) contain "change of control = deemed assignment" or termination rights upon ownership change. If >50% of leases are terminable, MSWC faces immediate 1,750+ AF supply shortfall post-closing.

2. **USBR participation agreement language**: Actual Grand Valley Project participation agreement must be reviewed to determine:
   - Is MSWC's participation structured as "use authorization," "contract right," or "easement"?
   - If easement >25 years, 43 CFR § 429.17 requires GVWUA approval (adds 60-120 days to approval timeline).
   - Does agreement contain express change-of-control consent provision?

3. **Wholesale customer most-favored-nation clauses**: If wholesale contracts contain MFN provisions, any preferential rates AWI offers to new customers post-acquisition could trigger MFN obligations, increasing costs to serve existing wholesale customers.

4. **South Metro expansion rights**: If MSWC's South Metro contract lacks right of first refusal (ROFR) for additional capacity, competing utilities (Aurora, Denver Water) could secure expansion capacity, foreclosing MSWC's drought-proof supply augmentation strategy.

### D. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Total Annual Commercial Contract Exposure** (post-acquisition):

| Scenario | Agricultural Leases | Wholesale Contracts | USBR Participation | South Metro Reuse | Total Annual Exposure |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Best Case** | $3M (baseline, no price increase) | $7M (no terminations) | $1.24M (current O&M) | $4M (baseline pricing) | **$15.24M** |
| **Base Case** | $7.5M (7,500 AF at $1,000/AF) | $7M (no terminations) | $2.19M (increased capital assessments) | $5.75M (mid-point pricing) | **$22.44M** |
| **Worst Case** | $12M (10,000 AF at $1,200/AF) + $3M spot purchases if 50% lease terminations | $5.6M (20% customer loss) | $3.19M (high capital assessments) | $7.5M (price renegotiation to $1,500/AF) | **$31.29M** |

**20-Year NPV of Supplemental Water Purchases** (if Colorado River curtailment continues):

- Base case: $7.5M annually × 20 years = $150M nominal, **NPV = $115M** (6% discount rate)
- Worst case: $15M annually × 20 years = $300M nominal, **NPV = $230M** (6% discount rate)

These costs are **largely passed through to customers** via CPUC-approved Purchased Water Adjustment clause, reducing MSWC's direct financial exposure but increasing regulatory risk (CPUC may deny full pass-through if deemed imprudent).

### E. Cross-Domain Impacts

**For Memorandum Synthesis — Cross-Domain Flags:**

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Purchased Water Agreements (Agricultural Leases)**: MSWC's agricultural water lease portfolio ($3M-$12M annually) faces **HIGH RISK** of price volatility and non-renewal post-acquisition. Short-term (1-year) leases provide no supply security. AWI should proactively negotiate multi-year leases pre-closing and diversify supply via reuse water expansion.

2. **Wholesale Water Contracts**: MSWC's wholesale customer contracts ($7M annually, 2,800 connections) present **MEDIUM RISK**. Stock purchase structure avoids formal assignment, but change-of-control notification likely required. Proactive customer outreach and CPUC approval process will address concerns.

3. **USBR Grand Valley Diversion Project**: MSWC's 45,000 AF/year Colorado River allocation (33% of total supply) via USBR participation presents **HIGH RISK** due to federal assignment approval requirements (43 CFR § 429.2(b)). USBR denial would be **deal-blocking**. AWI must submit assignment request 6 months pre-closing and coordinate with GVWUA.

4. **South Metro Reuse Water Agreement**: MSWC's 5,000 AF/year reuse water purchase ($4M-$7.5M annually) presents **MEDIUM RISK**. Contract likely requires change-of-control notification/consent. **Critical strategic opportunity**: Negotiate expansion rights for additional 5,000-10,000 AF/year to offset Colorado River curtailment with drought-proof supply.

5. **Total Annual Exposure**: Commercial contract costs range from **$15.24M (best case)** to **$31.29M (worst case)**, with base case **$22.44M annually**. Most costs are passed through to customers via Purchased Water Adjustment clause, mitigating financial risk to MSWC but increasing regulatory risk (CPUC rate case scrutiny).

6. **20-Year NPV**: Supplemental water purchases (agricultural leases + reuse expansion) total **$115M-$230M NPV** over 20 years if Colorado River curtailment continues. This cost is material relative to $2.4B purchase price (5-10% of transaction value).

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing)

**1. Data Room Contract Review** (Priority: CRITICAL, Timeline: 30 days)

- Obtain and review **all commercial water supply contracts**:
  - Agricultural water lease agreements (2024: 3,500 AF from multiple lessors)
  - Wholesale water customer contracts (2,800 connections, focus on top 10 customers representing ~80% of $7M revenue)
  - USBR Grand Valley Diversion Project participation agreement
  - South Metro Wastewater Authority reuse water purchase agreement

- **Key provisions to identify**:
  - Assignment and change-of-control clauses
  - Termination rights and notice periods
  - Renewal mechanisms (automatic vs. renegotiated)
  - Price escalation provisions (CPI-indexed vs. renegotiated)
  - Most-favored-nation (MFN) clauses
  - Expansion rights (South Metro reuse water)
  - Force majeure and termination-for-cause provisions

**2. USBR Assignment Application** (Priority: HIGH, Timeline: Submit 6 months pre-closing)

- Prepare and submit **assignment request to USBR Western Colorado Area Office**:
  - Transaction description (stock purchase, AWI financial qualifications)
  - Demonstrate continued beneficial use of 45,000 AF/year for municipal supply
  - Environmental compliance (NEPA review if required)
  - Coordinate with CFIUS process if foreign ownership triggers national security review

- **Coordinate with GVWUA**:
  - Meet with GVWUA board to address concerns
  - Commit to continued participation in Grand Valley Project
  - Obtain written support letter for USBR submission
  - Negotiate capital assessment obligations (budget $1.1M-$3M annually)

**3. Agricultural Lessor Negotiation** (Priority: HIGH, Timeline: 60-90 days pre-closing)

- Identify all agricultural water lessors (2024: 3,500 AF)
- Proactively contact lessors to:
  - Notify of pending AWI acquisition
  - Negotiate **multi-year lease extensions** (3-5 years) to provide supply security
  - Lock in pricing ($850-$1,200/AF) or CPI-indexed escalation (avoid spot-market volatility)
  - Offer **early payment** or **price premium** (e.g., $1,000/AF guaranteed) to incentivize long-term commitments
- **Target**: Secure 80% of current leases (2,800 AF) under multi-year contracts pre-closing

**4. Wholesale Customer Outreach** (Priority: MEDIUM, Timeline: 90 days pre-closing)

- Identify top 10 wholesale customers (representing ~80% of $7M revenue)
- Proactive communication:
  - Notify of pending acquisition
  - Commit to service continuity and quality
  - Address rate increase concerns (link to CPUC approval process, emphasize regulatory oversight)
  - Obtain written waivers of change-of-control consent requirements (if applicable)
- **Coordinate with CPUC approval process**: Wholesale customer support letters strengthen public interest case

**5. South Metro Reuse Water Expansion** (Priority: HIGH, Timeline: 60 days pre-closing)

- Meet with South Metro Wastewater Authority to:
  - Notify of pending acquisition
  - Commit to continued purchase of 5,000 AF/year
  - **Negotiate expansion rights**: Right of first refusal (ROFR) for additional 5,000-10,000 AF/year capacity
  - Lock in pricing ($800-$1,500/AF CPI-indexed) or negotiate expansion pricing ($1,000-$2,000/AF)
  - Obtain written waiver of change-of-control consent requirements
- **Alternative reuse sources**: If South Metro cannot expand, evaluate Denver Metro Wastewater, Littleton/Englewood WWTPs

#### Short-Term Actions (Post-Closing, Year 1)

**6. Diversify Agricultural Water Supply** (Timeline: 12 months post-closing)

- Expand agricultural lease portfolio from 3,500 AF (2024) to **5,000-7,500 AF**
- Diversify lessors geographically (multiple water districts, basins) to reduce concentration risk
- Negotiate **staggered lease terms** (avoid all leases expiring same year)
- Establish **emergency supply agreements** with Denver Water, Aurora, Colorado Springs (mutual aid for drought emergencies)

**7. Expand Reuse Water to 10,000-15,000 AF/Year** (Timeline: 2-3 years)

- Execute South Metro expansion (target 5,000 AF/year additional capacity)
- Contract with additional WWTPs (Denver Metro, Littleton/Englewood) for 5,000 AF/year
- Invest in **reuse distribution infrastructure** ($20M-$40M capital) to deliver reuse water to parks, golf courses, industrial customers
- **Long-term goal**: Replace 50% of agricultural lease dependence with drought-proof reuse water

**8. Monitor CPUC Rate Case for Purchased Water Cost Recovery** (Timeline: Ongoing)

- File 2026 rate case including purchased water cost forecasts ($7.5M-$12M annually)
- Demonstrate **prudent water supply management**: diversification, long-term contracts, reuse expansion
- Address CPUC scrutiny of pass-through costs (Purchased Water Adjustment clause baseline may be increased from $2M to $5M to reduce customer surcharge volatility)

#### Long-Term Considerations (Year 2-5)

**9. Permanent Water Rights Acquisition** (Timeline: 3-5 years)

- Evaluate **permanent water right purchases** from agricultural users willing to sell (vs. lease)
- Target pricing: $10,000-$15,000/AF (comparable to Aurora's 2024 purchases)
- Funding: MSWC rate base investment, CPUC approval required, 20-30 year debt financing
- **Strategic benefit**: Permanent rights eliminate annual lease renewal risk, provide long-term supply security

**10. Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) Evaluation** (Timeline: 5-10 years)

- Monitor Colorado DPR regulation development (Colorado adopted DPR rules 2023⁴⁵)
- Evaluate **indirect potable reuse (IPR)** or **direct potable reuse (DPR)** projects to augment supply
- Pricing: $12,000-$13,000/AF (2018 dollars⁴⁶), but eliminates dependence on Colorado River/agricultural leases
- **Long-term goal**: Achieve 100% supply security via combination of senior water rights (South Platte, transmountain), reuse water (15,000-20,000 AF/year), and DPR (if economically viable)

### C. Outstanding Questions for Data Room Review

1. **Agricultural leases**: How many lessors? Names, addresses, lease expiration dates, change-of-control provisions?
2. **Wholesale contracts**: Top 10 customer identities, contract terms, assignment/change-of-control provisions, MFN clauses?
3. **USBR participation**: Is MSWC's participation structured as "use authorization," "contract right," or "easement" under 43 CFR Part 429?
4. **South Metro reuse**: Does contract include right of first refusal (ROFR) for expansion capacity? Pricing adjustment mechanism (CPI vs. renegotiated)?
5. **GVWUA assessments**: Actual annual capital assessments and O&M costs paid by MSWC (2023-2024)?
6. **Historical purchased water costs**: MSWC's actual purchased water expenditures 2020-2024 (trend analysis for CPUC rate case forecasting)?
