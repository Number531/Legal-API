## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. Overview and Key Findings

This memorandum analyzes MSWC's 135,000 acre-feet per year water rights portfolio under Colorado's prior appropriation doctrine and assesses risks from Colorado River curtailment. **Primary finding: MSWC's Colorado River rights (45,000 AF/year, 33% of total supply) are subject to a 10% emergency curtailment (4,500 AF/year loss) that is likely permanent, with 40-50% probability of additional 10-20% curtailments by 2030 if Lake Powell falls below 25% capacity.**

MSWC's water rights portfolio consists of five distinct sources with varying security levels:

1. **Denver Basin Groundwater (22,000 AF/year, 16%)**: Most secure — not subject to prior appropriation system, allocated based on overlying land ownership, no curtailment risk
2. **Reuse Water (5,000 AF/year, 4%)**: Very secure — drought-proof wastewater supply from South Metro Wastewater Authority
3. **Transmountain Diversions (18,000 AF/year, 13%)**: Secure — very senior 1936 priority via Moffat Tunnel from Fraser River and Williams Fork
4. **South Platte River (28,000 AF/year, 21%)**: Moderately secure — senior 1948-1965 priorities, MSWC-owned diversion infrastructure
5. **Colorado River (45,000 AF/year, 33%)**: At risk — mid-priority 1955-1978 rights via USBR Grand Valley Project, subject to 10% emergency curtailment

### B. Colorado Prior Appropriation Doctrine — Legal Framework

Colorado adopted the prior appropriation doctrine in its 1876 Constitution, codified in Article XVI, Section 6: "Priority of appropriation shall give the better right as between those using the water for the same purpose." The system operates on "first in time, first in right" principles, where senior water rights holders receive full allocation before junior rights during shortage.

**Key Statutory Provisions:**

- **C.R.S. § 37-92-103** defines "Appropriation" as application of water to beneficial use, "Beneficial use" as reasonable use without waste, and "Water right" as priority-based right to use water
- **C.R.S. § 37-92-502** grants State Engineer authority to order discontinuance of diversions to prevent material injury to senior rights and satisfy interstate Compact obligations
- **Material injury standard**: Discontinuance ordered only if junior diversion causes or will cause material injury to senior rights; "futile call" doctrine authorizes lifting curtailment if discontinuance won't make water available to seniors at time and place of need
- **Abandonment**: 10-year continuous non-use creates rebuttable presumption of abandonment; State Engineer conducts decennial abandonment reviews presenting lists to water court

**Judicial Deference to State Engineer:**

Colorado courts afford substantial deference to State Engineer determinations. *Empire Lodge Homeowners' Ass'n v. Moyer*, 39 P.3d 1139 (Colo. 2001), held: "Colorado's prior appropriation system centers on three fundamental principles: water courts adjudicate water rights and their priorities, and the State Engineer administers waters in accordance with judicial decrees." Courts review legal questions de novo but defer to State Engineer's factual and technical judgments regarding hydrology, material injury, and futile call analysis.

### C. Colorado River Compact Crisis — Structural Over-Allocation

The 1922 Colorado River Compact allocated 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) annually to Upper Basin states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico) and 7.5 MAF to Lower Basin states (Arizona, California, Nevada), plus 1.5 MAF to Mexico under 1944 treaty — totaling 16.5 MAF/year. **However, the Colorado River produces only approximately 13 MAF/year on average in recent decades, creating a structural deficit of 3.5 MAF/year (21% over-allocated).**

The Compact was negotiated during an unusually wet period in the early 1920s when flows averaged 16.8 MAF/year. Climate change has reduced flows by 10% between 2000-2021, and projections indicate further 20% decline by 2050. Scientists project megadrought continuing through the 2030s.

**Lake Powell Crisis (2022-2025):**

- Lake Powell at 30% capacity as of August 2025 (7.7 million acre-feet storage)
- Elevation 3,554 feet — only 64 feet above minimum power pool (3,490 feet)
- If Lake Powell falls below 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate hydropower (normally 1,320 MW, 5 billion kWh annually)
- "Deadpool" elevation (approximately 50 feet lower) would trap water behind dam, preventing deliveries to Lower Basin and violating Compact obligations
- Under dry conditions forecasts, Lake Powell could reach minimum power pool by December 2026 and deadpool by summer 2027 without additional cuts

**2023 Emergency Measures:**

- **Lower Basin**: 3 MAF conservation through 2026 (Arizona 21% cut, Nevada 8% cut, California voluntary)
- **Upper Basin**: 10% across-the-board reduction for all users regardless of priority, implemented to prevent Lake Powell deadpool
- MSWC's impact: 45,000 AF/year reduced to 40,500 AF/year = **4,500 AF/year loss (10%)**

### D. MSWC's Colorado River Rights — Vulnerability Analysis

**Priority Dates: 1955-1978 (Mid-Priority, Not Senior)**

MSWC's 45,000 AF/year Colorado River rights have priority dates from 1955 to 1978. These are mid-priority rights — NOT senior rights from early appropriation period (1800s-1930s) when most transmountain diversions and Western Slope agricultural rights were decreed, but also NOT junior rights from recent municipal growth (1990s-2020s).

Under traditional prior appropriation administration, MSWC's 1955-1978 rights would be curtailed only after more junior post-1978 rights are shut off. However, the 2023 emergency curtailment suspended traditional priority, imposing pro rata 10% reduction on all users.

**USBR Grand Valley Project Participation:**

MSWC diverts Colorado River water via the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Grand Valley Diversion Project. The Grand Valley Diversion Dam (built 1913-1916) diverts into Government Highline Canal serving 42,000 acres in Grand Valley. MSWC participates in this federal project but does not own diversion infrastructure. This participation structure means MSWC's curtailment risk is governed by:
1. Colorado state law priority system (normally)
2. USBR project allocation during federal shortage declarations
3. State Engineer emergency powers during Compact compliance crises

**Abandonment Risk: Low**

MSWC has used these rights continuously for municipal supply since the 1950s-1970s. The 10-year non-use presumption does not apply to actively used municipal rights with continuous beneficial use.

### E. Litigation Analysis — MSWC v. Colorado River Water Conservation District

**Case Status (Per Research Plan):**
- Filed: March 2024, Colorado Water Court Division 5 (Glenwood Springs)
- Trial: Scheduled Q3 2026 (July-September 2026)
- Issue: Challenge to 10% pro rata curtailment as violating prior appropriation doctrine

**NOTE**: Actual case filings were not located in public databases. Analysis based on research plan scenario and analogous Colorado water law principles.

**MSWC's Legal Theory:**

MSWC argues Colorado Constitution Article XVI, Section 6 and C.R.S. § 37-92-103 mandate "first in time, first in right" administration. MSWC's 1955-1978 priorities are senior to many users with 1990s-2020s dates. Under strict priority administration, the 10% curtailment should fall entirely on junior rights holders rather than being distributed pro rata to all users including mid-priority and senior users like MSWC.

**State Engineer's Defense (Anticipated):**

1. **Emergency Powers (C.R.S. § 37-92-502)**: State Engineer has authority to order discontinuance of diversions to satisfy Compact obligations and prevent material injury. Lake Powell deadpool crisis threatening entire Compact framework justifies emergency measures.

2. **Compact Obligations Trump Intrastate Priority**: 1922 Colorado River Compact requires Upper Basin deliver 75 MAF per 10 years to Lower Basin at Lee Ferry. 1948 Upper Basin Compact Article IV authorizes Upper Colorado River Commission to "determine the extent of curtailment" when necessary for Compact compliance. Federal Compact obligations may justify temporary suspension of intrastate priority during emergencies.

3. **Equitable Burden Distribution**: Pro rata curtailment distributes burden equitably among all users rather than devastating junior rights holders by shutting them off entirely. Complete curtailment of all post-1978 junior rights would disproportionately impact recent municipal growth areas (Colorado Springs, Fort Collins suburbs, northern Front Range), causing economic and public health crises.

4. **"Temporary" Emergency Measure**: Curtailment characterized as temporary pending negotiation of post-2026 operating guidelines. Not a permanent abandonment of prior appropriation but emergency response to unprecedented Lake Powell crisis.

**Likelihood of Success: 20-30% for MSWC (70-80% Probability MSWC Loses)**

MSWC faces steep odds for the following reasons:

**1. Strong Judicial Deference to State Engineer**

*Empire Lodge v. Moyer*, 39 P.3d 1139 (Colo. 2001), and *State v. Southwestern Colorado Water Conservation District*, 671 P.2d 1294 (Colo. 1983), establish that Colorado courts afford substantial deference to State Engineer's factual determinations and technical judgments. Water courts will not substitute their judgment for the engineer's during emergency conditions absent clear legal error or abuse of discretion.

**2. Compact Obligations May Trump State Priority**

*Arizona v. California*, 373 U.S. 546 (1963), held that "where Congress has so exercised its constitutional power over waters, courts have no power to substitute their own notions of an 'equitable apportionment' for the apportionment chosen by Congress." While this case addressed Lower Basin apportionment, the principle suggests federal Compact obligations could justify temporary suspension of state priority systems during emergencies threatening Compact compliance.

**3. Unprecedented Crisis Justifies Unprecedented Measures**

Lake Powell at 30% capacity, 64 feet above minimum power pool, facing potential deadpool by 2027 — this represents existential threat to Colorado River Compact framework. Colorado courts have never addressed whether prior appropriation doctrine prohibits temporary emergency curtailments during interstate Compact crises. Courts likely to find emergency exception justified.

**4. "Temporary" Characterization**

State Engineer can argue 10% curtailment is temporary measure pending post-2026 guidelines negotiations (ongoing as of December 2025, but stalled). Characterizing curtailment as temporary rather than permanent abandonment of prior appropriation increases deference likelihood.

**Potential Outcomes:**

- **Most Likely (70-80%)**: Water court upholds State Engineer emergency curtailment authority. MSWC's 10% curtailment becomes permanent unless Colorado River flows recover (unlikely per climate projections) or new Compact agreement negotiated.

- **Alternative (20-30%)**: Court requires partial return to priority system, reducing MSWC's curtailment to 5-7% and imposing greater burden on post-1990s junior rights. Complete elimination of MSWC's curtailment unlikely given Compact obligations.

### F. Supplemental Water Purchases — Economic Impact

**2024 Actual Purchases:**

MSWC purchased 3,500 AF supplemental water in 2024 via agricultural water rights leases at $850-$1,200 per AF, total cost $2.975 million-$4.2 million. Federal System Conservation Pilot Program paid agricultural users approximately $500 per AF in 2024, but MSWC's negotiated leases at higher market rates suggest competitive demand exceeding federal program capacity.

**Future Requirements (Assuming 10% Curtailment Permanent):**

- **Base Case**: 5,000 AF/year at $1,000 per AF = $5 million annually
  - 15-year NPV (2026-2040 at 6% WACC): **$48.5 million**

- **High Case** (if additional 10-20% cuts imposed): 10,000 AF/year at $1,200 per AF = $12 million annually
  - 15-year NPV (2026-2040 at 6% WACC): **$116.6 million**

**Purchased Water Adjustment (PWA) Clause Rate Recovery:**

Research plan indicates MSWC has CPUC-approved PWA clause allowing automatic pass-through of purchased water costs above $2 million baseline. (NOTE: Specific PWA approval not located in CPUC records; verification required from MSWC tariff filings.)

If PWA clause exists as described:
- 2024: $3 million-$4.2 million cost, less $2 million baseline = $1 million-$2.2 million passed through to customers = $0.85-$1.80 per customer per month
- Future (5,000 AF scenario): $5 million cost, less $2 million baseline = $3 million passed through = approximately $2.60 per customer per month
- Future (10,000 AF scenario): $12 million cost, less $2 million baseline = $10 million passed through = approximately $8.60 per customer per month

This mechanism mitigates MSWC financial exposure by passing curtailment costs to customers, but creates rate competitiveness and regulatory approval risks.

### G. Additional Curtailment Risk — 10-20% Beyond Current 10%

**Lake Powell Trajectory:**

Lake Powell currently at 30% capacity, requiring only 5% further decline to reach 25% capacity. Research indicates that Lake Powell below 25% would trigger additional 10-20% Upper Basin curtailments to prevent deadpool.

**Probability Assessment: 40-50% by 2030**

- Megadrought projected through 2030s per climate science
- 2025 water year is 6th driest on record since 1964
- Colorado River flow reductions projected 20% by 2050
- Post-2026 operating guidelines negotiations stalled as of December 2025

If additional 10-20% curtailments imposed:
- MSWC's total curtailment: 20-30% of original 45,000 AF/year = 9,000-13,500 AF/year loss
- Remaining Colorado River supply: 31,500-36,000 AF/year (down from 45,000 AF)
- Supplemental water needs: 9,000-13,500 AF/year at $850-$1,200 per AF = $7.65 million-$16.2 million annually
- 15-year NPV: $74.3 million-$157.4 million

**Confidence Definitions:**
- **HIGH**: Verified from authoritative sources (statutes, court opinions, USBR data)
- **MEDIUM**: Based on research plan scenario descriptions, supported by analogous precedent and policy analysis
- **LOW**: Based on research plan scenario descriptions, not independently verified from public records

### J. Recommendations for Transaction Structuring

**1. Water Rights Due Diligence (Pre-Closing):**

- Obtain certified water court decrees for all 135,000 AF/year, confirm priority dates, decreed amounts, conditional vs. absolute status
- Review USBR Grand Valley Project participation agreement: curtailment allocation provisions, assignment requirements for AWI change of control
- Verify CPUC PWA clause: obtain tariff filings, rate case orders confirming baseline and automatic pass-through
- Obtain MSWC v. Conservation District case files: complaint, State Engineer answer, expert reports, litigation budget

**2. Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanisms:**

- Reduce purchase price if water rights litigation decided adversely pre-closing
- Reduce purchase price if additional Colorado River curtailments (beyond 10%) imposed between signing and closing
- Reduce purchase price if Lake Powell falls below 3,490 feet (minimum power pool) before closing

**3. Escrow Structure:**

- **$10 million-$25 million escrow** covering:
  - Litigation costs through trial and appeal: $3 million-$7 million
  - First 2-3 years supplemental water purchases: $10 million-$18 million
  - Release conditions: (i) favorable litigation outcome, (ii) CPUC rate case approval including supplemental water costs, or (iii) 24 months post-closing

**4. Seller Representations:**

- All water rights decreed absolute (not conditional awaiting completion of appropriation)
- No abandonment proceedings pending or threatened
- No material non-use exceeding 7 years for any decree
- Continuous beneficial use for all municipal supply rights

**5. Post-Closing Risk Mitigation:**

- Negotiate multi-year (3-5 year) agricultural water leases to lock in prices below $1,000 per AF
- Participate in federal System Conservation Pilot Program ($500 per AF)
- Expand South Metro Wastewater Authority reuse water from 5,000 AF to 10,000-15,000 AF/year
- Develop additional Denver Basin groundwater wells (22,000 AF current, explore expansion)
- Accelerate conservation programs targeting 3-5% demand reduction (4,050-6,750 AF/year savings)

### K. Summary of Quantified Exposures

| Exposure Category | Base Case | High Case | Likelihood |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Supplemental Water (15-year NPV)** | $48.5 million (5,000 AF/year at $1,000/AF) | $116.6 million (10,000 AF/year at $1,200/AF) | Base: 70-80% / High: 40-50% |
| **Litigation Costs** | $3 million (trial) | $7 million (trial + appeal) | 100% (already incurred/committed) |
| **Annual Customer Rate Impact (PWA pass-through)** | $2.60/customer/month ($3M above baseline) | $8.60/customer/month ($10M above baseline) | Base: 70-80% / High: 40-50% |
| **Purchase Price Adjustment Risk** | $5 million-$15 million if litigation decided adversely pre-closing | N/A | 70-80% (MSWC loses) × 50% (trial concludes before Q3 2026 closing) = 35-40% |

**Total Expected Value (Probability-Weighted):**
- Supplemental water NPV: $48.5M × 75% + $116.6M × 45% = $88.9 million
- Litigation costs: $5 million average × 100% = $5 million
- Purchase price adjustment: $10 million average × 40% = $4 million
- **Total: $97.9 million expected exposure from water rights risks**

This analysis demonstrates that MSWC's water rights portfolio, while diversified across five sources, faces material risk from Colorado River curtailment that is likely permanent and could worsen if Lake Powell continues declining. The litigation challenging the curtailment has low probability of success (20-30%), and supplemental water purchases will create $48.5 million-$116.6 million in additional costs over 15 years, largely passed through to customers but creating rate competitiveness and regulatory approval risks that AWI must manage post-acquisition.

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

[To be populated during research]

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Colorado Prior Appropriation Doctrine — Constitutional and Statutory Framework

#### 1. Constitutional Foundation

Colorado became the first state to officially adopt the prior appropriation doctrine in its Constitution in 1876.¹ This system of "first in time, first in right" is mandated by Colorado's Constitution for water of the "natural stream" and is called the prior appropriation doctrine.²

The prior appropriation doctrine fundamentally differs from riparian rights systems common in eastern states. Under prior appropriation, water rights are not tied to land ownership adjacent to a stream but rather to the priority date of appropriation and beneficial use.³

#### 2. Statutory Framework — C.R.S. § 37-92-102 and § 37-92-103

**Legislative Declaration and Basic Tenets**

C.R.S. § 37-92-102 sets forth Colorado's legislative declaration regarding the basic tenets of Colorado water law.⁴ The statute recognizes that water is a precious natural resource and that the general welfare requires that water resources be devoted to beneficial use in reasonable amounts through appropriation.

**Key Definitions Under C.R.S. § 37-92-103**

The statute provides critical definitions that govern the prior appropriation system:

**"Appropriation"** — C.R.S. § 37-92-103(3)(a) defines "Appropriation" as "the application of a specified portion of the waters of the state to a beneficial use pursuant to the procedures prescribed by law."⁵

**"Beneficial Use"** — C.R.S. § 37-92-103(4) defines "Beneficial use" as "the use of that amount of water that is reasonable and appropriate under reasonably efficient practices to accomplish without waste the purpose for which the appropriation is lawfully made."⁶ Beneficial use includes:
- Impoundment of water for firefighting or storage
- Recreational, fishery, or wildlife purposes
- Diversion by governmental entities for recreational in-channel diversion
- Appropriation by the state of minimum flows on natural streams and lakes to preserve the natural environment⁷

**"Water Right"** — C.R.S. § 37-92-103(12) defines "Water right" as "a right to use in accordance with its priority a certain portion of the waters of the state by reason of the appropriation of the same."⁸

#### 3. The Priority System — "First in Time, First in Right"

The cornerstone principle of Colorado water law is commonly expressed as "first in time, first in right."⁹ This means:

- The first person to appropriate water and apply that water to beneficial use has the first right to use that water within a particular stream system.¹⁰
- After receiving a court decree verifying their priority status, the appropriator becomes the senior water right holder on the stream.¹¹
- That senior water right must be satisfied before any other (junior) water rights can be fulfilled.¹²
- The prior appropriation system allocates the physical supply of water in a stream among the owners of water rights based on the priority date of their water right, with older "senior" water rights entitled to receive water prior to "junior" water rights that were appropriated later.¹³

#### 4. The 1969 Water Right Determination and Administration Act

Today, the 1969 Water Right Determination and Administration Act contains the primary legal provisions governing the prior appropriation system, along with certain provisions of the 1965 Ground Water Management Act.¹⁴ This comprehensive statutory framework established the water court system and administrative procedures for water rights determination and administration.

#### 5. State Engineer Administration — C.R.S. § 37-92-502

**Powers and Duties**

C.R.S. § 37-92-502 grants the state engineer and division engineers broad authority to administer water rights and enforce priority.¹⁵ The statute provides:

**Discontinuance of Diversions**: Each division engineer shall order the total or partial discontinuance of any diversion to the extent that:
- The water being diverted is not necessary for application to beneficial use, or
- The water being diverted is required by persons entitled to use water under water rights having senior priorities¹⁶

**Material Injury Standard**: No discontinuance shall be ordered unless the diversion is causing or will cause material injury to water rights having senior priorities.¹⁷ The materiality of injury depends on all factors which will determine in each case the amount of water such discontinuance will make available to senior priorities at the time and place of their need.¹⁸

**Futile Call Doctrine**: If a discontinuance has been ordered but nevertheless does not cause water to become available to senior priorities at the time and place of their need, then such discontinuance order shall be rescinded.¹⁹ This "futile call" doctrine recognizes that curtailing junior rights serves no purpose if the water cannot physically reach senior users.

**Notice and Enforcement**: The posting of a written order in plain sight at the place of diversion constitutes sufficient notice of the division engineer's order.²⁰ The state engineer and division engineers have authority to order installation of measuring devices and reporting requirements.²¹

#### 6. Abandonment of Water Rights — 10-Year Presumption

**Statutory Framework**

Colorado law provides for abandonment of water rights through non-use. Abandonment is defined as "the termination of an absolute water right in whole or in part as a result of the intent of the owner to permanently discontinue the use of the water under that water right."²²

**10-Year Non-Use Presumption**

Failure for a period of ten years or more to apply to a beneficial use the water available under a water right when needed creates a rebuttable presumption of abandonment.²³ However:
- This presumption may be waived by the division engineer or state engineer if special circumstances negate an intent to abandon²⁴
- Non-use does not necessarily constitute abandonment²⁵
- Actual intent to abandon must be proven²⁶

**Decennial Abandonment Process**

Every 10 years, the Division Engineer is required to present to the water court a list of water rights that have been determined to meet the criteria of abandonment.²⁷ This "decennial abandonment process" involves:
- Division Engineers reviewing records of water diversions
- Conducting site visits
- Completing fact-based research²⁸
- Presenting final revised abandonment lists to water court in consultation with the State Engineer²⁹

The revised abandonment lists, when concluded by judgment and decree of the water court, are conclusive as to the water rights determined to have been abandoned.³⁰

---

### B. Non-Tributary Groundwater — Exception to Prior Appropriation

#### 1. Denver Basin Aquifers

Non-tributary groundwater, including the Denver Basin aquifers, operates under fundamentally different principles than surface water rights subject to prior appropriation.³¹

**Definition of Non-Tributary Groundwater**

"Nontributary groundwater" is defined as "that groundwater, located outside the boundaries of any designated groundwater basins in existence on January 1, 1985, the withdrawal of which will not, within one hundred years of continuous withdrawal, deplete the flow of a natural stream at an annual rate greater than one-tenth of one percent of the annual rate of withdrawal."³²

#### 2. Planned Depletion Rather Than Priority

Non-tributary groundwater "does not apply the doctrine of prior appropriation, but rather a policy of planned depletion, and allocates supplies according to overlying land ownership."³³ Wells that pump nontributary groundwater are not administered under the prior appropriation system but are still regulated by the Division of Water Resources.³⁴

This type of groundwater is allocated according to overlying land ownership based on an assumed 100-year aquifer life, as opposed to the priority system.³⁵

#### 3. Allocation Based on Overlying Land Ownership

Because these waters are hydrologically distinct from surface streams and accompanying alluvial aquifers, they are allocated on the basis of overlying land ownership, instead of prior appropriation, with the Office of the State Engineer overseeing permitting and administration.³⁶

Senate Bill 213 limited withdrawals on the basis of an aquifer life of one hundred years, which is administered by limiting average annual withdrawals to one percent of the volume of water that is determined to be available underlying the land.³⁷

**MSWC's Denver Basin Rights: 22,000 AF/Year**

MSWC's 22,000 AF/year of Denver Basin non-tributary groundwater is not subject to the prior appropriation system and thus is not vulnerable to curtailment during drought based on priority dates. These rights are owned by virtue of overlying land ownership and are allocated based on planned depletion over 100 years.

### C. Colorado River Compact (1922) — Over-Allocation Crisis

#### 1. The 1922 Colorado River Compact Structure

The Colorado River Compact of 1922 divides the river basin into two areas: the Upper Basin (Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming) and the Lower Basin (Nevada, Arizona, and California).³⁸ The compact guarantees each basin the right to beneficially use 7.5 million acre-feet (MAF) of water a year from the Colorado River system in perpetuity.³⁹

Additionally, the 1944 treaty with Mexico allocates 1.5 million AF/year to Mexico.⁴⁰ Thus, total allocations under the "Law of the River" equal 16.5 million AF/year (7.5 MAF Upper Basin + 7.5 MAF Lower Basin + 1.5 MAF Mexico).⁴¹

#### 2. The Over-Appropriation Problem

**Overly Optimistic Flow Assumptions**

The terms of the compact were largely the product of development aspirations and political dealmaking, and they relied on optimistic estimations of the amount of water the river could supply that were not supported by existing surveys or science.⁴² The compact was negotiated during an unusually wet period in the early 20th century, when Colorado River flows averaged approximately 16.8 million AF/year.⁴³

**Actual River Flows**

As warming in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) continues, average natural Colorado River flows could drop as low as 9-11 MAF, less than the 17.5 MAF allocated in the 1922 compact and the roughly 13.3 MAF of total water used in the CRB.⁴⁴ More recent studies indicate climate change will likely decrease the river's flow by 20 percent by 2050, and rising temperatures reduced the river's flow by around 10% between 2000 and 2021.⁴⁵

**The Structural Deficit**

The Colorado River produces approximately 13 million AF/year on average in recent decades, but total allocations equal 16.5 million AF/year — creating a structural deficit of 3.5 million AF/year.⁴⁶ This over-allocation means the river cannot physically satisfy all allocated rights even in average water years, and the deficit worsens significantly during drought.

#### 3. Lake Powell and Lake Mead Storage Crisis (2022-2025)

**Critical Reservoir Levels**

Heading into the 2022-2023 water year, the condition of the Colorado River looked dire, with Lake Powell and Lake Mead having both plummeted to below 25 percent of capacity.⁴⁷ By August 2025, Lake Powell had dropped to just 30% capacity with storage at 7,706,910 acre-feet, the lowest value observed on that date in the last 30 years.⁴⁸

**Minimum Power Pool and Deadpool Elevations**

The minimum power pool — the minimum elevation needed to keep Glen Canyon Dam's hydropower turbines operational — is 3,490 feet.⁴⁹ As of mid-2025, Lake Powell's elevation was 3,554 feet above sea level, just 64 feet above the dam's penstocks used to generate hydroelectric power.⁵⁰ Under dry conditions forecasts, Lake Powell could fall below 3,490 feet by December 2026.⁵¹

"Deadpool" is a lower elevation where water behind Glen Canyon Dam would be trapped, limiting deliveries and preventing hydropower generation — a level that could be reached by summer 2027 without significant cuts.⁵² If Lake Powell's water levels drop by an additional 50 feet from current levels, deadpool conditions would occur.⁵³

**Hydropower Impacts**

When Lake Powell is full, Glen Canyon Dam can generate up to 1,320 megawatts of electricity, roughly five billion kilowatt-hours of power annually.⁵⁴ However, with Lake Powell currently at 30% capacity, hydropower production has been cut down significantly.⁵⁵

#### 4. 2023 Emergency Conservation Measures

**Lower Basin Agreement (May 2023)**

In May 2023, the Department of the Interior and basin states announced a consensus-based proposal in which the three Lower Basin states (Arizona, California, Nevada) would conserve a total of 3 million acre-feet (MAF) prior to 2026, with 2.3 MAF of these reductions compensated by the federal government using appropriated funds.⁵⁶

A Bureau of Reclamation commissioner testified that Colorado River Basin states would need to reduce consumption by 2-4 million acre-feet in 2023 to protect hydropower generation at Lake Mead and Lake Powell.⁵⁷

**2023 Shortage Conditions**

The projected elevation of 1,047.61 feet at Lake Mead reflected a Level 2a Shortage Condition for 2023, with required shortage reductions as follows:⁵⁸
- Arizona: 592,000 acre-feet (approximately 21% of the state's annual apportionment)
- Nevada: 25,000 acre-feet (8% of the state's annual apportionment)
- Mexico: 104,000 acre-feet (approximately 7% of the country's annual allotment)

**Upper Basin Measures**

In May 2022, drought operations to protect Lake Powell were implemented under the Upper Basin Drought Response Operations Agreement, and Glen Canyon Dam releases were reduced under the 2007 Interim Guidelines, which together provided approximately 1 million acre-feet of additional water to help protect water levels at Lake Powell.⁵⁹

### D. MSWC's Water Rights Portfolio — Security Analysis

#### 1. Total Portfolio: 135,000 Acre-Feet per Year

According to the research plan, MSWC holds water rights totaling 135,000 AF/year from five distinct sources:
- Colorado River: 45,000 AF/year
- South Platte River: 28,000 AF/year
- Groundwater (Denver Basin): 22,000 AF/year
- Transmountain Diversions: 18,000 AF/year
- Reuse Water: 5,000 AF/year (treated wastewater, non-potable uses)

#### 2. Colorado River Rights: 45,000 AF/Year (Mid-Priority, Subject to Curtailment)

**Priority Dates: 1955-1978 (Mid-Priority Range)**

MSWC's Colorado River rights have priority dates ranging from 1955 to 1978.⁶⁰ These are mid-priority rights — not senior rights from the early appropriation period (1800s-1930s), but also not junior rights from recent decades (1990s-2020s).

Under traditional prior appropriation principles, these rights would be curtailed only after more junior rights (post-1978) are shut off during shortage. However, the 2023 emergency curtailment measures suspended traditional priority administration in favor of pro rata reductions.

**Grand Valley Diversion Project Participation**

MSWC's Colorado River water is diverted via the Grand Valley Diversion Project, a U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) project.⁶¹ The Grand Valley Diversion Dam was built between 1913 and 1916 and diverts water into the Government Highline Canal for irrigation of 33,368 acres and supplemental irrigation to 8,600 acres in western Colorado's Grand Valley.⁶²

MSWC participates in this USBR project but does not own the diversion infrastructure itself.⁶³ As a project participant, MSWC holds decreed appropriative rights to 45,000 AF/year with the specified 1955-1978 priority dates.

**2023 Upper Basin Agreement: 10% Curtailment**

Based on the research plan, MSWC experienced a 10% across-the-board reduction under the 2023 Upper Basin agreement, reducing Colorado River supplies from 45,000 AF/year to 40,500 AF/year — a loss of 4,500 AF/year.⁶⁴

This pro rata curtailment does not follow traditional prior appropriation principles, as it applies equally to all users regardless of priority date. The emergency measure was implemented to prevent Lake Powell from reaching deadpool elevation.⁶⁵

#### 3. South Platte River Rights: 28,000 AF/Year (Senior Priority)

**Priority Dates: 1948-1965 (Senior Rights)**

MSWC's South Platte River rights have priority dates from 1948 to 1965, making them senior rights.⁶⁶ The South Platte River Compact of 1925 settled disputes between Colorado and Nebraska and determined the amount of water that must flow from Colorado to Nebraska.⁶⁷

Between April 1 and October 15 of each year, Colorado shall not permit diversions from the Lower Section of the river to supply Colorado appropriations having adjudicated dates of priority subsequent to June 14, 1897.⁶⁸ MSWC's 1948-1965 rights are well within this protected range.

**Direct Diversions, MSWC-Owned Infrastructure**

Unlike the Colorado River rights (USBR project participation), MSWC owns the diversion structures and canals for its South Platte River rights.⁶⁹ This provides greater operational control and security.

**Abandonment Risk: Low**

MSWC has been using these rights continuously since the 1940s-1960s for municipal water supply. The 10-year non-use presumption of abandonment does not apply to actively used municipal water rights.⁷⁰

#### 4. Denver Basin Groundwater: 22,000 AF/Year (Not Subject to Priority System)

**Non-Tributary Status**

MSWC's 22,000 AF/year of Denver Basin non-tributary groundwater is not subject to the prior appropriation system.⁷¹ Non-tributary groundwater "does not apply the doctrine of prior appropriation, but rather a policy of planned depletion, and allocates supplies according to overlying land ownership."⁷²

**Allocation Based on Overlying Land Ownership**

These rights are allocated based on an assumed 100-year aquifer life, limiting average annual withdrawals to one percent of the volume of water determined to be available underlying the land.⁷³

**Security: High (No Curtailment Risk)**

Because Denver Basin groundwater is not subject to prior appropriation, it cannot be curtailed based on priority during drought. These 22,000 AF/year represent MSWC's most secure water supply.

#### 5. Transmountain Diversions: 18,000 AF/Year (Very Senior Priority)

**Priority Date: 1936 (Fraser River and Williams Fork)**

MSWC's transmountain diversion rights have a 1936 priority date, making them very senior rights.⁷⁴ In 1936, the Denver Water Board began diverting Western Slope water from the Williams Fork and Fraser Rivers through the Moffat water tunnel.⁷⁵ The first western slope water flowed east on June 10, 1936.⁷⁶

**Moffat Tunnel System**

The pilot bore of the Moffat Tunnel was leased to the City of Denver for use as a water tunnel to divert water east from the Colorado River Basin under the Continental Divide, enlarged to a diameter of 10.5 feet giving it a carrying capacity of 1,280 cubic feet per second, and water diversion began in 1936.⁷⁷

The Vasquez Tunnel conveys water from the Williams Fork collection system to the Moffat Tunnel, thence to South Boulder Creek.⁷⁸

**Security: High (Senior 1936 Rights)**

With a 1936 priority date, these rights are among the most senior transmountain diversions in Colorado. They would be curtailed only if even more senior rights (pre-1936) require the water and can make a successful priority call.

**Potential Compact Curtailment Risk**

However, transmountain diversions have been identified as a potential target for curtailment in the event of a Colorado River Compact call.⁷⁹ West Slope water users have argued that "to avoid 'impairment' of West Slope rights, the State must first curtail transmountain diversion projects" before curtailing in-basin uses.⁸⁰

#### 6. Reuse Water: 5,000 AF/Year (Non-Potable, Drought-Proof)

MSWC purchases 5,000 AF/year of treated wastewater from South Metro Wastewater Authority for non-potable uses (parks, golf courses, industrial cooling, irrigation).⁸¹

**Security: Very High (Wastewater is Drought-Proof)**

Wastewater flows are drought-proof — they do not depend on snowpack or precipitation but rather on municipal wastewater generation, which remains steady year-round.⁸² This makes reuse water one of MSWC's most reliable supplies.

---

### E. Judicial Review of State Engineer Curtailment Orders

#### 1. Water Court Jurisdiction

Colorado water courts have jurisdiction to review appeals from state engineer or division engineer actions, such as enforcement orders and approvals of temporary changes of water rights and substitute water supply plans.⁸³ Water courts also have jurisdiction to review cases where the state engineer and division engineer have refused to enforce reductions or implement shutdowns of undecreed water uses or decreed junior water rights after a "call" was placed by a senior water right.⁸⁴

**Appeal Directly to Colorado Supreme Court**

Appeal of any water court decision goes directly to the Colorado Supreme Court.⁸⁵ This expedited appellate pathway reflects the importance of water rights adjudication in Colorado.

#### 2. Standard of Review

**De Novo Review of Legal Questions**

Courts review questions of law de novo, with the primary duty being "to give effect to the intent of the General Assembly, looking first to the statute's plain language."⁸⁶

**Deference to State Engineer Factual Determinations**

While courts review legal questions de novo, they afford deference to the State Engineer's factual determinations and technical judgments regarding hydrology, material injury, and futile call analysis.⁸⁷

#### 3. Key Precedents Upholding State Engineer Authority

**Empire Lodge Homeowners' Association v. Moyer, 39 P.3d 1139 (Colo. 2001) [VERIFIED]**

This case articulates the foundational structure of Colorado water administration:

"Colorado's prior appropriation system centers on three fundamental principles: water courts adjudicate water rights and their priorities, and the State Engineer administers waters in accordance with judicial decrees."⁸⁸

The court in *Empire Lodge* also affirmed the futile call doctrine: "The futile call doctrine authorizes the State or Division Engineer to lift a curtailment order if discontinuance of diversion won't make water available to senior priorities."⁸⁹

**CourtListener ID**: Case available at [Empire Lodge Homeowners' Ass'n v. Moyer, 39 P.3d 1139 (CourtListener)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2581341/empire-lodge-homeownersassn-v-moyer/)

**State v. Southwestern Colorado Water Conservation District, 671 P.2d 1294 (Colo. 1983) [VERIFIED]**

This case addresses judicial review procedures for State Engineer decisions. Some objectors argued that the State Engineer's procedures were too informal for judicial review, but the court held that "inadequate administrative procedures don't justify ignoring the prescribed review procedure and authorizing water court review instead."⁹⁰

This precedent establishes that parties challenging State Engineer curtailment orders must follow the statutory review procedures through water court, even if they believe administrative procedures were insufficient.

**CourtListener ID**: Case available at [State v. Southwestern Colorado Water Conservation Dist., 671 P.2d 1294 (CourtListener)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2605198/state-etc-v-sw-colo-water-conservation/)

**Southeastern Colorado Water Conservation District v. Shelton Farms, Inc., 529 P.2d 1321, 187 Colo. 181 (1974) [VERIFIED]**

This case involved a request to augment water rights with salvaged water during times when pumping is curtailed by the State Engineer.⁹¹ The case demonstrates the State Engineer's broad authority to issue curtailment orders and the limited circumstances under which courts will overturn those orders.

#### 4. Constitutional Authority — Article XVI, Section 6

The Colorado Constitution provides the foundation for prior appropriation in Article XVI, Section 6:

"The right to divert the unappropriated waters of any natural stream to beneficial uses shall never be denied. Priority of appropriation shall give the better right as between those using the water for the same purpose; but when the waters of any natural stream are not sufficient for the service of all those desiring the use of the same, those using the water for domestic purposes shall have the preference over those claiming for any other purpose, and those using the water for agricultural purposes shall have preference over those using the same for manufacturing purposes."⁹²

All waters of the natural stream are subject to allocation by the doctrine of prior appropriation under Article XVI, Sections 5 and 6, of the Colorado Constitution.⁹³

**Beneficial Use Requirement**

In order to establish a water right, an entity must divert the water and apply it to beneficial use.⁹⁴ Colorado law requires that water be put to a recognized beneficial use to maintain a valid right.⁹⁵

---

### F. MSWC v. Colorado River Water Conservation District — Litigation Analysis (T6)

#### 1. Litigation Context and Background

**NOTE ON DATA LIMITATION**: The research plan indicates that MSWC filed litigation against the Colorado River Water Conservation District in March 2024 challenging the 10% curtailment allocation methodology, with trial scheduled for Q3 2026. However, actual court filings from this case were not available in public databases during this research. The following analysis is based on the factual scenario provided in the research plan and analogous legal principles from Colorado water law.

**Procedural Posture**

According to the research plan, MSWC v. Colorado River Water Conservation District was filed in March 2024 in Colorado Water Court Division 5.⁹⁶ Division 5 Water Court, located in Glenwood Springs, has jurisdiction over cases within the Colorado River Basin.⁹⁷

Trial is scheduled for Q3 2026 (approximately July-September 2026).⁹⁸

#### 2. MSWC's Legal Position

**Challenge to 10% Pro Rata Curtailment Methodology**

MSWC's position challenges the 10% across-the-board curtailment allocation methodology on grounds that it violates Colorado's prior appropriation doctrine.⁹⁹ MSWC argues:

1. **Priority System Should Apply**: Colorado's constitutional and statutory framework requires "first in time, first in right" administration — senior rights should receive full allocation before junior rights are curtailed.¹⁰⁰

2. **MSWC's Rights Are Mid-Priority (1955-1978)**: MSWC's Colorado River rights, with priority dates from 1955-1978, are senior to many other users with 1990s-2020s priority dates.¹⁰¹

3. **Selective Curtailment Required**: Under traditional prior appropriation principles, the 10% cut should fall entirely on junior rights holders (post-1978 priorities) rather than being distributed pro rata to all users regardless of priority.¹⁰²

#### 3. State Engineer's Defense

**Emergency Curtailment Authority**

The State Engineer's defense position (as anticipated based on Colorado water law principles) likely includes:

1. **Emergency Powers Under C.R.S. § 37-92-502**: The State Engineer has broad authority to "order the total or partial discontinuance of any diversion" to prevent material injury to senior rights and to satisfy Compact obligations.¹⁰³

2. **Colorado River Compact Obligations**: The 1922 Colorado River Compact requires the Upper Basin to deliver 75 million acre-feet per 10-year period to the Lower Basin at Lee Ferry.¹⁰⁴ The 1948 Upper Basin Compact, Article IV, authorizes the Upper Colorado River Commission (UCRC) to determine "the extent of curtailment" when necessary to maintain flows at Lee Ferry.¹⁰⁵

3. **Lake Powell Deadpool Prevention**: The pro rata curtailment was implemented as an emergency measure to prevent Lake Powell from reaching deadpool elevation (3,490 feet minimum power pool), which would prevent water delivery to the Lower Basin and violate Compact obligations.¹⁰⁶

4. **Equitable Distribution of Burden**: A pro rata reduction distributes the burden equitably among all users rather than devastating junior rights holders by shutting them off entirely, which would disproportionately impact recent municipal growth areas.¹⁰⁷

#### 4. Likelihood of Success Analysis

**Courts Typically Defer to State Engineer Emergency Powers: 70-80% Probability MSWC Loses**

Based on precedent analysis, MSWC faces a 70-80% probability of losing this litigation for the following reasons:

**A. Strong Precedent for State Engineer Deference**

Colorado courts afford substantial deference to the State Engineer's factual determinations and technical judgments regarding hydrology, material injury, and emergency administration.¹⁰⁸ As established in *Empire Lodge Homeowners' Ass'n v. Moyer*, "the State Engineer administers waters in accordance with judicial decrees" and has broad discretion in administration.¹⁰⁹

**B. Compact Obligations Trump Intrastate Priority**

The research plan notes that "neither the 1922 Compact nor the 1948 Compact affect water right administration within the states," meaning that Colorado retains authority over intrastate administration.¹¹⁰ However, when Compact delivery obligations are at stake, courts have recognized that interstate obligations may justify emergency measures that temporarily suspend traditional priority administration.¹¹¹

The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in *Arizona v. California*, 373 U.S. 546 (1963), established that "where Congress has so exercised its constitutional power over waters, courts have no power to substitute their own notions of an 'equitable apportionment' for the apportionment chosen by Congress."¹¹² This principle suggests that federal Compact obligations could justify deviation from state priority systems during emergencies.

**C. Emergency Exception to Priority System**

While Colorado's prior appropriation doctrine is constitutionally mandated under Article XVI, Section 6, the doctrine has never been interpreted to prevent temporary emergency curtailments during unprecedented crisis conditions.¹¹³ The Lake Powell deadpool scenario represents a crisis threatening the entire Compact framework, potentially justifying extraordinary measures.

**D. Duration is "Temporary" Pending Long-Term Solutions**

The State Engineer can argue that the 10% pro rata curtailment is a temporary emergency measure pending negotiation of long-term post-2026 guidelines for Colorado River management.¹¹⁴ Negotiations for new operating guidelines are ongoing as of 2024-2025.¹¹⁵

#### 5. Potential Outcomes

**Most Likely Outcome (70-80% Probability): Court Upholds State Engineer's Emergency Curtailment**

The water court likely upholds the State Engineer's authority to implement emergency pro rata curtailment during the Lake Powell crisis, deferring to the engineer's technical judgment and recognizing Compact obligations.

In this scenario:
- MSWC's 10% curtailment (4,500 AF/year loss) becomes permanent unless and until Colorado River flows recover or new Compact guidelines are negotiated
- MSWC must continue purchasing supplemental water (estimated 3,500-5,000 AF/year in 2024 at $850-$1,200 per AF = $3 million-$6 million annually)¹¹⁶
- Purchased water costs are passed through to customers via CPUC-approved rate mechanisms

**Alternative Outcome (20-30% Probability): Court Requires Partial Return to Priority System**

If MSWC succeeds (20-30% probability), the court might order a modified approach that:
- Restores some degree of priority-based administration
- Reduces MSWC's curtailment from 10% to a lower percentage (e.g., 5-7%)
- Imposes greater curtailment burdens on junior rights holders with post-1990s priority dates

However, even in this scenario, complete elimination of MSWC's curtailment is unlikely given ongoing Compact obligations and Lake Powell conditions.

#### 6. Supplemental Water Purchases — Economic Impact

**2024 Actual Purchases**

MSWC purchased 3,500 AF of supplemental water in 2024 through agricultural water rights leases.¹¹⁷ Based on conservation program data, agricultural water users in Colorado received approximately $500 per acre-foot in 2024 through the System Conservation Pilot Program, though individual lease negotiations may result in higher prices.¹¹⁸

However, the research plan indicates MSWC paid $850-$1,200 per acre-foot, suggesting MSWC negotiated direct leases outside the federal conservation program at market rates.¹¹⁹

**Total 2024 Cost**: 3,500 AF × $850-$1,200 per AF = $2.975 million to $4.2 million

**Future Supplemental Water Needs (2025-2040)**

If the 10% curtailment becomes permanent (70-80% probability based on litigation analysis), MSWC will need to purchase 4,500-5,000 AF/year annually to replace the lost Colorado River supply.¹²⁰

If additional curtailments occur (10-20% additional cuts if Lake Powell falls below 25% capacity), MSWC's supplemental water needs could increase to 9,000-14,500 AF/year.¹²¹

**Cost Projection (Base Case: 5,000 AF/year at $1,000 per AF average)**
- Annual cost: $5 million
- 15-year NPV (through 2040 at 6% WACC): $48.5 million

**Cost Projection (High Case: 10,000 AF/year at $1,200 per AF if additional cuts occur)**
- Annual cost: $12 million
- 15-year NPV (through 2040 at 6% WACC): $116.6 million

#### 7. Purchased Water Adjustment Clause — Rate Recovery Mechanism

**CPUC Rate Mechanism (Limited Evidence)**

The research plan indicates MSWC has a CPUC-approved "Purchased Water Adjustment" (PWA) clause — an automatic rate adjustment for purchased water costs above a baseline of $2 million annually.¹²² Based on research of Colorado PUC regulatory frameworks, while specific PWA provisions were not located, Colorado PUC regulations require utilities purchasing water to "install such instruments or meters as may be necessary to furnish the Commission with full information related to the purchases, including purchase dates, sources, volumes, and unit costs."¹²³

If MSWC does have an approved PWA clause (as stated in research plan), this would function similarly to purchased gas adjustment clauses used by natural gas utilities — allowing automatic rate surcharges for purchased water costs without requiring a full rate case.¹²⁴

**2024 Impact**

With 2024 purchased water costs of $3 million-$4.2 million and a $2 million baseline:
- Pass-through amount: $1 million-$2.2 million
- Spread over 485,000 service connections
- Per-customer monthly surcharge: $0.85-$1.80

**Future Impact (Assuming 10% Curtailment Permanent)**

With future annual costs of $5 million (5,000 AF at $1,000 per AF):
- Pass-through amount: $3 million above $2 million baseline
- Per-customer monthly surcharge: approximately $2.60

This represents a modest increase for customers but avoids MSWC bearing the full cost of curtailment.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **10% Colorado River curtailment becomes permanent** | HIGH | Probable (70-80%) | Litigation challenge (20-30% success); supplemental water purchases; PWA pass-through to customers; develop alternative supplies |
| **Additional 10-20% curtailments if Lake Powell <25%** | CRITICAL | Possible (40-50% by 2030) | Monitor Lake Powell projections; increase supplemental water purchasing capacity; accelerate conservation programs; system interconnections |
| **Litigation unsuccessful (MSWC loses v. Conservation District)** | HIGH | Probable (70-80%) | Purchase price adjustment at closing if trial concludes pre-closing; escrow $10M-$25M for litigation costs and first 2-3 years supplemental water |
| **Supplemental water costs increase above $1,200 per AF** | MEDIUM | Possible (30-40%) | Long-term lease agreements with agricultural users; participate in federal conservation programs; develop groundwater substitutes |
| **Transmountain diversions targeted for Compact curtailment** | MEDIUM | Possible (30-40%) | Monitor West Slope litigation; participate in stakeholder negotiations; defend 1936 senior priority; diversify portfolio away from transmountain |
| **Abandonment claims against unused portions of water rights** | LOW | Unlikely (10-20%) | Maintain continuous beneficial use; document all diversions; respond to decennial abandonment lists; water court defense if challenged |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Actual decree language for MSWC's 45,000 AF/year Colorado River rights**: Research plan describes 1955-1978 priority dates, but actual decree verification from Colorado Division of Water Resources is required to confirm priority dates, decreed amounts, points of diversion, and any conditional vs. absolute status.

2. **USBR Grand Valley Project participation agreement terms**: MSWC's rights are held through USBR project participation, not direct ownership of diversion works. Confirm whether USBR participation agreements include curtailment allocation provisions that may differ from MSWC's assumptions.

3. **Purchased Water Adjustment clause approval status**: While research plan states MSWC has CPUC-approved PWA clause with $2 million baseline, this should be verified in CPUC tariff filings and rate case orders to confirm automatic pass-through mechanism and baseline amount.

4. **MSWC v. Colorado River Water Conservation District actual case filings**: Division 5 Water Court docket search did not locate this specific case. Confirm case number, verify complaint allegations, review State Engineer's response brief, and obtain expert reports filed by both sides regarding priority system vs. emergency curtailment.

5. **South Metro Wastewater Authority reuse water agreement expansion capacity**: MSWC currently purchases 5,000 AF/year reuse water. If Colorado River curtailments continue, determine whether South Metro WWTP has capacity to increase reuse water deliveries to 10,000-15,000 AF/year as drought-proof substitute supply.

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Quantified Annual Costs (Base Case: 10% Curtailment Permanent)**

- Supplemental water purchases: $5 million annually (5,000 AF at $1,000 per AF)
- Passed through to customers via PWA: $3 million (above $2 million baseline)
- MSWC absorbs: $2 million baseline (in existing rates)

**15-Year NPV (2026-2040 at 6% WACC)**: $48.5 million

**Quantified Annual Costs (High Case: 20-30% Total Curtailment if Lake Powell <25%)**

- Supplemental water purchases: $12 million annually (10,000 AF at $1,200 per AF)
- Passed through to customers via PWA: $10 million (above $2 million baseline)
- MSWC absorbs: $2 million baseline (in existing rates)

**15-Year NPV (2026-2040 at 6% WACC)**: $116.6 million

**Litigation Costs**

- MSWC v. Colorado River Water Conservation District through trial Q3 2026: $2 million-$5 million in legal fees and expert witness costs
- If appealed to Colorado Supreme Court: additional $1 million-$2 million

**Total Litigation NPV**: $3 million-$7 million

**Transaction Impact**

If litigation is decided adversely to MSWC before closing (trial Q3 2026, closing expected Q2-Q3 2026 per research plan), AWI may seek:
- Purchase price reduction: $5 million-$15 million to reflect permanent supplemental water cost burden
- Escrow: $10 million-$25 million to cover 2-3 years of supplemental water purchases pending rate recovery

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **MSWC's 135,000 AF/year water rights portfolio is diversified across five sources with varying levels of security**:
   - Most Secure: Denver Basin groundwater (22,000 AF/year) — not subject to prior appropriation, no curtailment risk
   - Very Secure: Reuse water (5,000 AF/year) — drought-proof wastewater supply
   - Secure: Transmountain diversions (18,000 AF/year) — very senior 1936 priority
   - Moderately Secure: South Platte River (28,000 AF/year) — senior 1948-1965 priorities
   - **At Risk: Colorado River (45,000 AF/year) — mid-priority 1955-1978 rights subject to 10% emergency curtailment**

2. **The 10% Colorado River curtailment (4,500 AF/year loss) is likely permanent** based on:
   - Lake Powell at 30% capacity (3,554 feet elevation, only 64 feet above minimum power pool)
   - Colorado River structural deficit: 16.5 MAF allocated vs. 13 MAF actual flows = 3.5 MAF over-allocated
   - Megadrought projected through 2030s per climate science
   - 70-80% probability MSWC loses litigation challenging curtailment due to judicial deference to State Engineer emergency powers and Compact obligations

3. **Additional 10-20% curtailments are possible (40-50% probability by 2030)** if Lake Powell falls below 25% capacity, increasing MSWC's total curtailment to 8,500-12,500 AF/year below original 45,000 AF allocation.

4. **Colorado's prior appropriation doctrine provides strong legal framework for water rights security**, codified in Colorado Constitution Article XVI, Section 6 and C.R.S. § 37-92-103, but emergency curtailments during unprecedented Compact crises may temporarily suspend traditional priority administration.

5. **MSWC v. Colorado River Water Conservation District litigation (filed March 2024, trial Q3 2026) faces 70-80% probability of loss** based on:
   - Strong precedent for State Engineer deference (*Empire Lodge*, *Southwestern Colorado Water Conservation District*)
   - Compact obligations trump intrastate priority during emergencies
   - Pro rata curtailment characterized as "temporary" pending post-2026 guidelines
   - Courts unlikely to substitute their judgment for State Engineer's technical determinations

6. **Supplemental water purchases will cost $5 million-$12 million annually** depending on curtailment severity, with 15-year NPV of $48.5 million (base case) to $116.6 million (high case if additional cuts occur).

7. **Rate recovery via Purchased Water Adjustment clause** (if confirmed to exist) mitigates financial impact on MSWC by passing through supplemental water costs above $2 million baseline to customers at approximately $2.60-$5.50 per customer per month.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing)**

   a. **Verify Water Rights Decrees**: Obtain certified copies of all water court decrees for MSWC's 135,000 AF/year portfolio from Colorado Division of Water Resources, confirming:
      - Priority dates for all appropriations
      - Decreed amounts and points of diversion
      - Conditional vs. absolute status
      - Any adjudicated change of use or transfer provisions

   b. **Confirm USBR Participation Agreement Terms**: Review Grand Valley Project participation agreement to determine:
      - Whether USBR agreement includes curtailment allocation provisions different from state law
      - Assignment requirements for change of control to AWI
      - Capital contribution and O&M cost obligations
      - Curtailment dispute resolution mechanisms

   c. **Verify PWA Clause with CPUC**: Obtain CPUC tariff filings and rate case orders confirming:
      - Existence and terms of Purchased Water Adjustment clause
      - $2 million baseline amount and calculation methodology
      - Automatic pass-through mechanism and quarterly surcharge adjustment procedures
      - Annual true-up and reconciliation provisions

   d. **Obtain MSWC v. Conservation District Litigation Files**: Contact MSWC counsel to obtain:
      - Complaint and State Engineer's answer
      - Discovery responses and expert reports
      - Motion practice and water court rulings to date
      - Current litigation budget and fee projections through trial and appeal
      - Settlement negotiation history (if any)

2. **Transaction Structuring Recommendations**

   a. **Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanism**: Include provision for purchase price reduction if:
      - Water rights litigation decided adversely pre-closing
      - Additional Colorado River curtailments imposed between signing and closing
      - Lake Powell falls below minimum power pool (3,490 feet) before closing

   b. **Escrow for Water Rights Risks**: Establish escrow account of $10 million-$25 million to cover:
      - Litigation costs through trial and appeal ($3 million-$7 million)
      - First 2-3 years of supplemental water purchases ($10 million-$18 million)
      - Release conditions: (i) favorable litigation outcome, (ii) CPUC rate case approval including supplemental water costs, or (iii) 24 months post-closing

   c. **Seller Representation Regarding Water Rights**: Require representation that:
      - All water rights are decreed absolute (not conditional)
      - No abandonment proceedings pending or threatened
      - No material non-use exceeding 7 years for any decree
      - Continuous beneficial use for all municipal supply rights

3. **Post-Closing Risk Mitigation**

   a. **Diversify Supplemental Water Sources**:
      - Negotiate multi-year (3-5 year) agricultural lease agreements to lock in prices below $1,000 per AF
      - Participate in federal System Conservation Pilot Program to access $500 per AF pricing
      - Explore South Metro Wastewater Authority reuse water expansion to 10,000-15,000 AF/year
      - Develop additional Denver Basin groundwater wells if overlying land available

   b. **Enhance Demand Management**:
      - Accelerate conservation programs to reduce total demand by 3-5% (4,050-6,750 AF/year savings)
      - Implement tiered rate structures to incentivize efficient use
      - Expand reuse water distribution for non-potable outdoor irrigation

   c. **Monitor Colorado River Negotiations**:
      - Participate actively in post-2026 guidelines stakeholder process
      - Coordinate with other Upper Basin municipal water providers facing curtailment
      - Engage Colorado River Water Conservation District in settlement discussions
      - Track Lake Powell elevations monthly and model additional curtailment scenarios

   d. **System Interconnections**:
      - Evaluate physical interconnections with adjacent water systems for emergency supply sharing
      - Negotiate wheeling agreements to move water through other systems' infrastructure
      - Develop redundant supply pathways to reduce dependence on any single source

### C. Outstanding Questions

1. **Is the 10% curtailment permanent or will it be lifted when Lake Powell recovers?**
   - Answer: Likely permanent unless Colorado River flows return to historical averages (unlikely per climate projections) or new Compact agreement negotiated post-2026

2. **Can MSWC successfully challenge the 10% curtailment as violating prior appropriation?**
   - Answer: 20-30% success probability; courts typically defer to State Engineer emergency powers and recognize Compact obligations trump intrastate priority during crisis

3. **What is the probability of additional 10-20% cuts beyond the current 10%?**
   - Answer: 40-50% probability by 2030 if Lake Powell falls below 25% capacity (currently 30%); requires only 5% further decline

4. **How secure are MSWC's transmountain diversion rights (1936 priority) from Compact curtailment?**
   - Answer: Relatively secure under traditional priority, but West Slope users may argue transmountain diversions should be curtailed before in-basin uses in Compact call scenario; 30-40% risk

5. **Can supplemental water purchases adequately replace curtailed Colorado River supplies?**
   - Answer: Yes, MSWC successfully purchased 3,500 AF in 2024; agricultural supply available at $850-$1,200 per AF, but prices volatile and long-term availability uncertain as other users compete for limited supplemental supplies
