## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Liberty Life Insurance Company (LLIC), a Nebraska-domiciled life insurer with $18.2 billion in assets and $1.85 billion in surplus, currently operates at a 188% Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio—**12 percentage points below the 200% Company Action Level threshold** established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and Nebraska law. This RBC deficiency triggers mandatory regulatory intervention, creates material obstacles to acquisition approval, and imposes substantial ongoing compliance burdens that will persist until LLIC achieves the 250% "safe harbor" level where regulatory scrutiny normalizes. This memorandum analyzes (1) the NAIC/Nebraska RBC regulatory framework and intervention requirements, (2) optimal capital injection structures to restore RBC compliance, (3) Form A acquisition approval requirements and timeline, (4) ongoing regulatory supervision obligations, and (5) multi-state coordination complexities.

### Key Findings Summary

**1. RBC Regulatory Framework - Company Action Level Triggered (188% Ratio)**

LLIC's 188% RBC ratio falls within the Company Action Level threshold (150-200%), which is the first of four escalating intervention levels established by NAIC Model Act #312 and Nebraska Revised Statutes §§ 44-6001 to 44-6026. At this level, Nebraska's Director of Insurance requires LLIC to submit a comprehensive RBC Plan within 45 days identifying the root causes of capital inadequacy and proposing specific corrective measures. The four-tier intervention ladder operates as follows:

- **Company Action Level (150-200% RBC):** Insurer submits RBC Plan; Director reviews for adequacy
- **Regulatory Action Level (100-150% RBC):** Director issues mandatory Corrective Order specifying required actions
- **Authorized Control Level (70-100% RBC):** Director may seize control to protect policyholders
- **Mandatory Control Level (<70% RBC):** Director must place insurer in rehabilitation or liquidation

While LLIC avoids the most severe intervention levels, the Company Action Level designation creates substantial practical consequences: (a) heightened regulatory scrutiny of all strategic decisions, (b) zero practical dividend capacity until RBC exceeds 210%, (c) increased likelihood of Form A acquisition disapproval under Nebraska's financial stability grounds (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2127(1)(c)), and (d) reputational concerns if RBC status becomes publicly known to policyholders, agents, or rating agencies.

**Critical Contextual Finding:** Nebraska law imposes strict confidentiality on RBC data (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-6016), preventing public disclosure of specific Company Action Level enforcement actions from 2019-2024. This confidentiality regime means LLIC's regulatory status remains non-public unless voluntarily disclosed or discoverable through Form A public hearing process.

**2. Capital Requirement Quantification - $150M Minimum, $610M for Safe Harbor**

Based on LLIC's $1.85 billion surplus and 188% current RBC ratio, the Required RBC calculation yields **$984.04 million** in risk-based capital requirements. [METHODOLOGY: Current TAC ($1.85B) ÷ Current RBC Ratio (1.88) = Required RBC]. To achieve various regulatory thresholds:

| Target RBC Ratio | Target TAC | Required Capital Injection | Regulatory Significance |
|------------------|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **200% (Minimum Compliance)** | $1,968.08M | **$118.08M** | Eliminates Company Action Level designation; remains subject to heightened scrutiny |
| **215% (Stated Goal)** | $2,115.69M | **$265.69M** | Provides modest cushion above Company Action Level; likely insufficient for rating agency confidence |
| **250% (Safe Harbor)** | $2,460.10M | **$610.10M** | Eliminates regulatory intervention; normalizes dividend capacity; supports rating agency affirmation |

The stated **$150 million capital injection** requirement (from transaction background) would achieve approximately **203% RBC ratio**, placing LLIC marginally above the Company Action Level but well short of the 250% safe harbor. This creates strategic risk: normal market volatility (±10-15 percentage points) could re-trigger Company Action Level within 12-24 months if LLIC experiences adverse investment performance or insurance losses.

**Reconciliation Note:** The $150M figure suggests transaction parties prioritized minimum compliance over optimal regulatory positioning, likely due to acquirer capital constraints or belief that operational improvements can organically increase RBC over time.

**3. Capital Injection Structure Analysis - Surplus Notes Strongly Preferred**

Three primary capital injection mechanisms were evaluated across six criteria (RBC credit, tax efficiency, regulatory approval complexity, timing, payment flexibility, and cost of capital):

**OPTION A - SURPLUS NOTES (RECOMMENDED):**

Surplus notes, authorized under Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-220 and 44-221, provide the optimal structure because they deliver:

- **100% Tier 1 RBC Capital Credit:** Under statutory accounting principles (SAP), surplus notes are treated as "issued surplus/equity/capital" because they are subordinated to all policyholder and creditor claims. This means every dollar of surplus notes increases Total Adjusted Capital dollar-for-dollar, directly improving the RBC numerator.

- **Tax Deductibility of Interest Payments:** Despite equity treatment for regulatory purposes, surplus notes may receive debt characterization for federal income tax purposes under 26 U.S.C. § 163 if they possess "sufficiently debt-like character" (fixed maturity, fixed interest rate, lender-like repayment expectations). This dual treatment creates a "double benefit": regulatory equity credit + tax deductibility of interest.

  **Tax Benefit Quantification:** $150M surplus notes at 6% interest = $9M annual interest expense × 21% corporate tax rate = **$1.89M annual tax savings**. Over 30 years at 6% discount rate, NPV of tax benefit = approximately **$26 million**.

- **Regulatory Approval Required:** Nebraska Director of Insurance must approve issuance (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-220) and all subsequent principal/interest payments (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-221). Payment approval requires surplus to exceed 2× the repayment amount, effectively preventing distributions that would jeopardize capital adequacy.

- **Repayment Restrictions:** The 2× surplus test and mandatory Director approval create payment inflexibility, but this is acceptable for capital restoration purposes where near-term distributions are not expected.

**Precedent:** Major life insurers (MetLife, Prudential, others) have successfully used surplus notes for capital management, with maturities extending 30-60 years to match long-duration liabilities. AM Best provides 90-95% capital credit (vs. 100% regulatory RBC credit), reflecting rating agency conservatism.

**OPTION B - SUBORDINATED DEBT (NOT RECOMMENDED):**

Traditional subordinated debt issued directly by LLIC (not holding company) provides:

- **0% RBC Capital Credit:** Subordinated debt creates a liability that offsets the asset increase from proceeds, resulting in zero net surplus impact. The RBC numerator remains unchanged, making subordinated debt **completely ineffective** for addressing LLIC's RBC deficiency.

- **Tax Deductibility:** Interest payments are deductible under 26 U.S.C. § 163, providing tax benefit similar to surplus notes (~$1.73M annually on $150M at 5.5% interest).

- **No Regulatory Approval Required:** Issuance and payments do not require Director approval, providing payment flexibility unavailable with surplus notes.

**Critical Deficiency:** Because subordinated debt produces zero RBC ratio improvement, it cannot address LLIC's Company Action Level status. This option is **categorically ineffective** for the transaction's core objective.

**OPTION C - DIRECT EQUITY CONTRIBUTION (ALTERNATIVE):**

Direct capital contribution from parent/acquirer provides:

- **100% Tier 1 RBC Capital Credit:** Equity contributions increase surplus dollar-for-dollar, providing full RBC numerator benefit identical to surplus notes.

- **No Tax Deductibility:** Capital contributions are non-deductible for federal income tax purposes, resulting in zero tax benefit (vs. $1.89M annually for surplus notes). Over 30 years, this represents approximately **$26 million present value disadvantage** compared to surplus notes.

- **No Regulatory Approval Required:** Equity contributions from existing shareholders generally do not require specific Director approval (though may trigger Form D reporting under Insurance Holding Company System Act for material transactions exceeding 10% of surplus).

- **Permanent Capital:** Unlike surplus notes (which can theoretically be repaid subject to 2× surplus test), equity contributions are permanent, eliminating future distribution optionality.

**Comparative Analysis - $150M Capital Injection:**

| Metric | Surplus Notes | Subordinated Debt | Direct Equity |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **New RBC Ratio** | 203% ✓ | 188% ✗ (no change) | 203% ✓ |
| **After-Tax Annual Cost** | $7.11M | $6.52M | $18M-$22.5M (equity return) |
| **Regulatory Approval Timeline** | 30-60 days | None | None |
| **Tax Benefit NPV (30 years)** | ~$26M | ~$24M | $0 |
| **Payment Flexibility** | Low (2× surplus test + approval) | High | N/A (permanent) |
| **Overall Assessment** | **OPTIMAL** ✓ | INEFFECTIVE ✗ | Tax-Inefficient ~ |

**RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE:** **$150M surplus notes** provides the optimal balance of RBC effectiveness and tax efficiency. Alternative: Hybrid structure of $140M surplus notes + $10M direct equity to provide immediate liquidity while preserving tax benefits.

**4. Form A Acquisition Approval - 60-90 Day Timeline with Moderate Disapproval Risk**

Any acquisition resulting in "control" of LLIC (defined as 10%+ voting securities under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2121) requires filing Form A with the Nebraska Director of Insurance and obtaining approval before closing (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2126). The approval process involves:

**Form A Filing Requirements (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2126(4)):**

The statement must include comprehensive disclosures spanning 12 categories, with particular emphasis on:

- **Acquirer Financial Strength:** **Audited financial statements for preceding five fiscal years** demonstrating capacity to support LLIC's capital needs
- **Capital Injection Commitment:** Detailed source of funds, timeline, and irrevocable commitment mechanism
- **Business Plans:** Any plans for extraordinary dividends, asset sales, mergers, or material structural changes (critical for policyholder protection)
- **Enterprise Risk Assessment:** Commitment to provide ongoing information for regulatory evaluation of holding company system risks

**Director's Seven Grounds for Disapproval (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2127(1)):**

The Director **must approve** unless findings establish one or more statutory grounds for disapproval:

1. **Licensing Requirements:** Post-acquisition insurer cannot satisfy licensing requirements
2. **Competition:** Transaction substantially lessens competition or creates monopoly
3. **Financial Condition (CRITICAL FOR LLIC):** **"The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its policyholders"**
4. **Business Plans:** Plans are unfair/unreasonable to policyholders
5. **Competence/Integrity:** Acquirer lacks competence, experience, or integrity
6. **Hazardous to Public:** Acquisition hazardous or prejudicial to insurance-buying public
7. **Material Misstatements:** Form A contains material false statements or omissions

**LLIC-Specific Risk - Ground #3 (Financial Condition Jeopardizing Stability):**

LLIC's 188% RBC status creates presumptive concern under Ground #3 because:
- Target company is undercapitalized (below 200% Company Action Level)
- Acquirer must affirmatively demonstrate capacity to inject required capital **and** provide ongoing support
- Director will scrutinize whether acquirer's own financial condition might jeopardize LLIC (e.g., if acquirer is highly leveraged or lacks insurance industry experience)

Regulatory interpretation: "The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders" serves as basis for evaluating "whether the buyer might directly or indirectly harm the financial well-being of the insurer." [Precedent: NAIC Model Act #440 commentary]

**Approval Probability Assessment:**

| Scenario | Approval Probability | Timeline | Basis |
|----------|---------------------|----------|-------|
| **Strong acquirer + $150M committed at closing + detailed RBC Plan** | **85-90%** | 60-90 days | Directly addresses Ground #3; Nebraska precedent (Midwest Holding 2023) supports approval when capital adequacy demonstrated |
| **Moderate acquirer strength + $150M capital but phased over 12-24 months** | **60-75%** | 90-120 days | Director may impose conditions (e.g., capital injection escrow, quarterly reporting, dividend prohibition) |
| **Weak acquirer financials OR unclear capital injection plan** | **25-40%** | Likely disapproval | High risk of disapproval under Ground #3 or #5 (competence/integrity) |

[METHODOLOGY: Probability ranges derived from (1) statutory disapproval grounds analysis, (2) Nebraska's 2023 approval of Midwest Holding acquisition by financially strong Antarctica Capital, (3) RBC capital adequacy framework prioritization of policyholder protection]

**Public Hearing and Timeline:**

- **Day 0:** Complete Form A filing submitted + $1,000 filing fee
- **Day 0-10:** Director reviews for completeness
- **Day 10-30:** Public notice period (minimum 20 days before hearing)
- **Day 30:** Public hearing held (required for disapproval; optional for approval)
- **Day 27-30:** Discovery period concludes (3 days before hearing)
- **Day 30-60:** Director issues written determination
- **Day 60:** Approval effective (if granted)
- **Day 60-120:** Closing window (typically 60 days from approval, extendable)

**Total Timeline: 60-90 days from filing to approval; 120-180 days from initiation to closing**

**Recent Nebraska Precedent - Midwest Holding Inc. (December 2023):**

Nebraska DOI approved Antarctica Capital's acquisition of Midwest Holding Inc. (parent of American Life & Security Corp., a Nebraska-domiciled life insurer) for ~$100 million all-cash transaction. Key approval factors:
- Antarctica Capital demonstrated strong financial condition
- Management continuity preserved (Midwest continued operations under existing leadership)
- No material changes to insurance subsidiary operations proposed
- Transaction closed December 20, 2023, approximately 60-90 days post-approval

This precedent suggests Nebraska DOI will approve acquisitions of troubled insurers **if** acquirer demonstrates capacity to restore financial stability.

**5. Ongoing Regulatory Supervision - Material and Persistent Burden**

LLIC's sub-200% RBC status triggers cascading regulatory obligations that persist until the 250% safe harbor is achieved:

**RBC Plan Submission and Quarterly Monitoring:**

Company Action Level requires submission of comprehensive RBC Plan including:
- 3-5 year financial projections (balance sheets, income statements)
- Root cause analysis of RBC deficiency
- Specific corrective measures with implementation timelines
- Quarterly progress reports comparing actual vs. projected RBC trajectory

Director reviews for adequacy and may reject plan as insufficient, requiring revisions or escalating to Regulatory Action Level intervention.

**Dividend Restrictions - Zero Practical Capacity:**

Nebraska's extraordinary dividend statute (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2134) defines "extraordinary" as exceeding the greater of:
- 10% of policyholder surplus (for LLIC: $185 million threshold), OR
- Net gain from operations for preceding 12 months

While the statutory threshold is $185M, **LLIC's sub-200% RBC status creates complete practical dividend prohibition** because:
- Any material dividend would further reduce RBC ratio below 200%
- Director has discretionary authority to disapprove any dividend (ordinary or extraordinary) that jeopardizes surplus adequacy (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-221 referencing § 44-2136 standards)
- Rating agencies and regulators expect zero distributions until RBC stabilizes at 225%+

**Estimated Dividend Capacity by RBC Level:**
- **Current (188% RBC):** $0 (Director disapproval certain)
- **Post-$150M injection (203% RBC):** $50M-$75M annually (limited to amounts not reducing RBC below 210%)
- **Safe harbor (250%+ RBC):** Normalized capacity subject only to 10% statutory test (~$200M annually)

**Investment Portfolio Restrictions:**

While Nebraska statutes do not explicitly impose additional investment restrictions based solely on RBC level, regulators apply heightened scrutiny to:

- **Below-Investment-Grade Bonds (NAIC 5-6 ratings):** Informal Director guidance likely requires reduction from current levels to <10% of assets. NAIC's 2024 expansion of RBC C-1 factors to 20 designations (from 6) imposes more punitive capital charges on sub-investment-grade bonds, mechanically increasing Required RBC and pressuring the ratio.

  **Quantified Impact:** If LLIC holds $1.8B in NAIC 5-6 bonds (10% of $18B assets) and Director requires reduction to <$900M (5% of assets), forced liquidation in distressed market could realize $100M-$200M in losses, further impairing surplus.

- **Affiliate Transactions:** All material affiliate transactions require Form D filing under Insurance Holding Company System Act. Sub-200% RBC increases likelihood of Director disapproval for asset transfers benefiting parent at expense of LLIC's capital position.

- **Derivative Hedging Strategies:** New hedging strategies may require pre-approval, limiting LLIC's ability to manage interest rate risk (C3 RBC component).

**Enhanced Reporting and Examination:**

- **Quarterly Financial Statements:** Beyond annual statutory reporting, sub-200% RBC insurers typically file quarterly unaudited statements
- **Accelerated Examination Cycle:** Every 2-3 years (vs. statutory 5-year minimum for healthy insurers)
- **Examination Costs:** $250K-$500K per examination

**NAIC Financial Analysis Working Group Referral Risk:**

If LLIC's condition deteriorates or exhibits unusual trends, Nebraska DOI may refer to NAIC Financial Analysis (E) Working Group, triggering:
- Multi-state coordinated oversight
- Potential examinations by non-domiciliary state regulators
- Increased regulatory burden and costs

**6. Multi-State Coordination - Lead State Doctrine with Independent State Authority**

**Nebraska as Lead State:**

Nebraska serves as domiciliary regulator and "lead state" under NAIC group supervision framework, responsible for:
- Coordinating with all states where LLIC is licensed (assumed 25+ jurisdictions)
- Serving as central point of contact for gathering/distributing regulatory information
- Facilitating multi-jurisdictional examinations
- Determining depth of holding company analysis and enterprise risk assessment

**"Windows and Walls" Regulatory Approach:**

- **Windows:** Non-domiciliary state regulators have visibility into LLIC's financial condition via Nebraska's lead state reporting
- **Walls:** Non-domiciliary states generally defer to Nebraska for capital adequacy determinations but retain independent authority to impose licensing conditions

**Non-Domiciliary State Actions:**

While NAIC accreditation standards emphasize lead state deference, individual states may independently:
- Require separate RBC Plans if in-state business materially deteriorates
- Condition license renewal on capital injection completion
- Suspend new business writings pending RBC restoration (particularly concerning for states representing >10% of LLIC's premium base)
- Require reinsurance or parental guarantees as licensing condition

**Multi-State Licensing Risk Assessment:**

| State Action | Trigger | Probability (LLIC) | Financial Impact |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Require separate RBC Plan | RBC <200% | 40-60% | Increased regulatory compliance costs ($500K-$1M) |
| Condition license on capital injection | Acquisition + RBC deficiency | 70-85% | Delays revenue recognition until capital injected |
| Suspend new business writings | RBC <175% (if deteriorates) | 15-25% | $50M-$150M annual revenue loss if major states act |
| Require reinsurance/guaranty | RBC <150% (Regulatory Action Level) | <10% (assumes capital injection occurs) | Potentially unavailable or prohibitively expensive |

[METHODOLOGY: Probability ranges based on (1) multi-state coordination precedent, (2) economic significance of LLIC to state insurance markets, (3) historical patterns of state deference to lead state determinations when capital injection credibly committed]

**Strategic Mitigation:** Proactive notification to top 10 premium-generating states with detailed capital injection commitment can reduce probability of restrictive licensing conditions.

**7. Guaranty Fund Assessment Exposure - $10M Annual Maximum, $100M+ Cumulative**

**Nebraska Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-2701 to 44-2719):**

If LLIC or other Nebraska-domiciled insurers become insolvent, Nebraska's guaranty association provides policyholder protection subject to statutory coverage limits:

**Coverage Limits Per Policyholder (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2703):**
- Life insurance death benefits: $300,000
- Life insurance cash surrender value: $100,000
- Annuity present value: $250,000
- Health benefit plans: $500,000
- **Aggregate per individual (life + annuity):** $300,000
- **Aggregate per individual (health + life/annuity):** $500,000

**Member Insurer Assessment Authority (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2708):**

To fund guaranty association obligations, solvent member insurers (including LLIC) are subject to:
- **Class A Assessments:** Administrative costs and general expenses (allocated pro rata or non-pro rata)
- **Class B Assessments:** Impaired/insolvent insurer obligations (allocated based on member's Nebraska premium market share)
- **Maximum Annual Assessment:** **2% of member insurer's average annual premiums received in Nebraska**

**LLIC Assessment Exposure Quantification:**

**Scenario: Other Insurers' Insolvencies (LLIC Remains Solvent):**

Assumptions:
- LLIC's Nebraska direct premiums: $500M annually (hypothetical)
- Maximum annual assessment: 2% × $500M = **$10 million per year**
- If guaranty obligations exceed single-year 2% cap, assessments spread over multiple years
- **10-year cumulative exposure:** Up to **$100 million**

**Scenario: LLIC Insolvency (Hypothetical):**

If LLIC were placed in receivership:
- LLIC policyholders nationwide (~50,000 estimated) would file claims with guaranty associations in all 30 states where LLIC is licensed
- Each state's guaranty association would assess its member insurers (not including LLIC, as insolvent insurers are excluded)
- Total industry assessment could reach $5B-$10B (limited by per-policy coverage caps)
- Multi-state coordination through NOLHGA (National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations)

**RBC Death Spiral Risk:**

Guaranty fund assessments create material risk for sub-200% RBC insurers:
- Assessments reduce surplus, mechanically lowering RBC ratio
- If multiple insurers fail simultaneously (systemic event), assessments on surviving insurers could trigger cascading failures
- LLIC's 188% RBC provides only 88 percentage points of cushion above Regulatory Action Level (100%); a $870M surplus reduction from assessments would push LLIC into Regulatory Action Level

**Critical Success Factors for Acquisition:**

Based on comprehensive regulatory analysis, LLIC acquisition will succeed **only if**:

1. ✓ Acquirer demonstrates financial capacity to inject **minimum $150M at closing** with credible pathway to $610M over 24-36 months for 250% safe harbor
2. ✓ Form A includes **irrevocable capital commitment** (escrow, letter of credit, or parent guarantee) eliminating Director's Ground #3 concerns
3. ✓ RBC Plan shows **conservative projections with 25%+ cushion** above Company Action Level to absorb volatility
4. ✓ Acquirer accepts **zero dividend capacity for 36 months**, relying on capital appreciation rather than distributions
5. ✓ Proactive **multi-state coordination** with top 10 premium states prevents fragmented licensing restrictions
6. ✓ Rating agency strategy achieves **rating affirmation or controlled downgrade** (maximum one notch)
7. ✓ **Management continuity** preserved to maintain regulatory relationships and institutional RBC knowledge

**Deal-Killer Scenarios:**

The acquisition should **not proceed** if:
- ✗ Acquirer can only commit $150M with no pathway to 250% (perpetual regulatory intervention)
- ✗ Acquirer requires material dividends within 24 months for IRR targets (incompatible with RBC restoration)
- ✗ Nebraska Director expresses concerns about acquirer's financial condition during pre-filing conference
- ✗ Multiple major states (CA, TX, FL, NY) indicate new business suspension pending multi-year observation

### Risk Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Overall Transaction Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

LLIC's 188% RBC status creates material regulatory obstacles, extended approval timeline (120-180 days), significant ongoing compliance burden ($584M probability-weighted over 3 years after-tax), and zero dividend capacity for 36+ months. However, transaction remains viable if acquirer demonstrates strong financial capacity, commits irrevocable capital injection, and accepts patient return horizon.

### High-Severity Findings: 3

1. **RBC Company Action Level Status (188%)** - Triggers mandatory regulatory intervention, Form A disapproval risk, rating agency concerns
2. **Zero Dividend Capacity for 36 Months** - Eliminates near-term cash returns; acquirer must rely solely on capital appreciation
3. **$584M Regulatory Burden (Probability-Weighted)** - Material compliance, capital injection, and operational restriction costs over 3-year period

### Medium-Severity Findings: 7

4. **Form A Approval Timeline (120-180 days)** - Extended regulatory approval process delays transaction close
5. **Multi-State Licensing Restrictions (40-60% probability)** - Risk of new business suspensions in non-domiciliary states
6. **Investment Portfolio Restrictions** - Potential forced liquidation of NAIC 5-6 bonds with $100M-$200M realized losses
7. **Rating Agency Downgrade Risk (70-85% probability)** - Likely A.M. Best/S&P downgrade absent immediate capital injection
8. **Guaranty Fund Assessment Exposure ($10M annual)** - Unexpected assessments reduce surplus and pressure RBC ratio
9. **Enhanced Examination Costs ($500K-$1M per cycle)** - Accelerated 2-3 year examination frequency
10. **Enterprise Risk Disclosure Requirements** - Any post-acquisition activity affecting RBC requires Form B/C/D reporting

### Total Estimated Regulatory Exposure (3-Year Period)

| Exposure Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Probability-Weighted Expected | After-Tax (21%) |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Capital Injection Required** | $150M | $610M | $300M | $237M |
| **Regulatory Compliance Costs** | $2M | $5M | $3.5M | $2.8M |
| **Forced Asset Sales - Realized Losses** | $0 | $200M | $40M | $32M |
| **Lost Revenue - Business Restrictions** | $0 | $300M | $90M | $71M |
| **Investment Restrictions - Opportunity Cost** | $25M | $75M | $50M | $40M |
| **Rating Downgrade - Business Impact** | $100M | $500M | $250M | $198M |
| **Guaranty Fund Assessments** | $0 | $30M | $6M | $4.7M |
| **Enhanced Examinations** | $0.5M | $1.5M | $1M | $0.8M |
| **TOTAL REGULATORY BURDEN** | **$277.5M** | **$1,721.5M** | **$740.5M** | **$584M** |

**Transaction Implication:** If LLIC acquisition price is $2.0B, regulatory and compliance burdens represent **29% of purchase price** on after-tax, probability-weighted basis.

## II. SCOPE OF RESEARCH

### A. Research Questions Addressed
1. **RBC Regulatory Framework**: What are the specific statutory thresholds, intervention powers, and enforcement precedents under Nebraska's RBC statute for a life insurer at 188% RBC?
2. **Capital Injection Optimization**: Which capital structure (surplus notes, subordinated debt, or direct equity) provides optimal RBC treatment, tax efficiency, and regulatory approval certainty?
3. **Form A Acquisition Approval**: What are the Nebraska-specific requirements, timelines, and approval risks for acquiring a sub-200% RBC insurer?
4. **Ongoing Regulatory Supervision**: What enhanced reporting, dividend restrictions, and investment limitations apply to LLIC post-acquisition?
5. **Multi-State Coordination**: How does Nebraska's lead state role affect regulatory coordination and guaranty fund exposure?

### B. Databases and Sources Consulted
- Federal Register (NAIC model act adoptions and state variations)
- Nebraska Revised Statutes (Chapter 44 - Insurance Code)
- NAIC Risk-Based Capital Model Acts and Formulas
- State Department of Insurance enforcement records (2019-2024)

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. NAIC Risk-Based Capital Framework and Nebraska Implementation

#### 1. Statutory Framework - NAIC Model Act #312

The NAIC Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Model Act for Insurers (Model Act #312) was initially adopted in 1993 with the latest revision in 2012.¹ All 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted this model act, establishing a uniform framework for identifying undercapitalized insurers.² Nebraska adopted the RBC framework through the **Insurers and Health Organizations Risk-Based Capital Act**, codified at **Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-6001 to 44-6026**.³

**Key Policy Objective (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-6002):**
"An excess of capital over the amount produced by the risk-based capital requirements is desirable in the business of insurance... insurers and health organizations should seek to maintain capital above the risk-based capital levels required by the act."⁴

This statutory language establishes that RBC requirements represent a regulatory minimum, not an optimal capital level.

#### 2. The Four-Tier RBC Action Level Ladder

The RBC framework establishes four escalating intervention levels based on the ratio of Total Adjusted Capital (TAC) to Authorized Control Level RBC:⁵

| Action Level | RBC Ratio Range | Regulatory Intervention Required |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Company Action Level (CAL)** | 150% - 200% | Insurer must submit RBC Plan to commissioner; commissioner reviews for adequacy⁶ |
| **Regulatory Action Level (RACL)** | 100% - 150% | Insurer must submit RBC Plan or Revised RBC Plan within 45 days; commissioner issues Corrective Order specifying mandatory actions⁷ |
| **Authorized Control Level (ACL)** | 70% - 100% | Commissioner authorized to take any actions necessary to protect policyholders and creditors⁸ |
| **Mandatory Control Level (MCL)** | Below 70% | Commissioner must place insurer under regulatory control (rehabilitation or liquidation)⁹ |

**LLIC's Current Position:**
Liberty Life Insurance Company at 188% RBC falls within the **Company Action Level** threshold (150-200%), triggering the requirement to submit an RBC Plan but not yet subjecting LLIC to mandatory corrective orders.

#### 3. Nebraska-Specific RBC Statutory Provisions

**Annual Reporting Requirement (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-6015):**
"Every domestic insurer or domestic health organization shall annually, on or prior to March 1, prepare and submit to the director a risk-based capital report of its risk-based capital levels as of the end of the calendar year just ended."¹⁰

**RBC Formula Components for Life Insurers (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-6004):**
The life insurance RBC formula accounts for:
- **C0 Risk:** Asset risk - affiliates
- **C1 Risk:** Asset risk - investments (bonds, stocks, mortgages, real estate)
- **C2 Risk:** Insurance risk (mortality and morbidity experience)
- **C3 Risk:** Interest rate risk (asset/liability mismatch)
- **C4 Risk:** Business risk (operational and management risks)¹¹

**RBC Calculation Formula:**
RBC after Covariance = C0 + C4a + √[(C1o + C3a)² + (C1cs + C3c)² + (C2)² + (C3b)² + (C4b)²]¹²

The formula uses a square-root covariance adjustment recognizing that different risk categories are not perfectly correlated.

#### 4. Company Action Level Triggering Event - LLIC at 188%

Under NAIC Model Act terminology, a "Company Action Level Event" occurs when an insurer's TAC falls between 150% and 200% of Authorized Control Level RBC.¹³ This triggers the following requirements:

**RBC Plan Submission (Model Act Section 3):**
- Insurer must prepare and submit an RBC Plan to the commissioner
- Plan must identify conditions contributing to the company's financial difficulties
- Plan must contain proposals to correct the conditions
- Submission deadline: typically 45 days after Company Action Level Event¹⁴

**Commissioner Review Authority:**
The commissioner will notify the company whether the RBC Plan is satisfactory. If unsatisfactory, the commissioner may specify required modifications or escalate regulatory intervention.¹⁵

**CRITICAL FINDING - No Public Precedent Available:**
Nebraska law imposes broad confidentiality restrictions on RBC data publication under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-6016.¹⁶ This statutory confidentiality provision prevents disclosure of specific RBC enforcement actions, making it impossible to identify Nebraska DOI precedent for Company Action Level interventions during 2019-2024 through public records. [METHODOLOGY: Public records search of Nebraska DOI Company Actions database yielded no RBC-specific enforcement actions due to confidentiality restrictions]¹⁷

#### 5. The 250% "Safe Harbor" Threshold

While the statutory Company Action Level is triggered at 200%, industry practice and regulatory expectations establish 250% as an informal "no regulatory contact" threshold:

**Regulatory Significance:**
"NAIC only takes regulatory action when the ratio becomes less than 250%... The minimum RBC was multiplied by 250% to place the company at the point where regulators would initiate no contact at all, due to the undesirable nature of interventions on the part of the regulators."¹⁸

**Major Life Insurer Comparables (2024 Disclosures):**
- **MetLife Combined RBC Ratio:** >360% at December 31, 2024 (prior year >380%)¹⁹
- Industry best practice: Maintain RBC ratios 300%+ to provide cushion for market volatility

**LLIC Gap Analysis:**
- Current RBC: 188%
- Target "Safe Harbor": 250%
- Gap: 62 percentage points of Required RBC
- Minimum Target for Regulatory Relief: 200%
- Gap to Minimum: 12 percentage points of Required RBC

### B. Capital Injection Structure Analysis - Optimal RBC Treatment

#### 1. Capital Requirement Quantification

**Baseline Calculation Methodology:**

Given LLIC's financial profile:
- Total Surplus: $1.85 billion
- Current RBC Ratio: 188%
- Current TAC = 1.88 × Required RBC
- Required RBC = $1.85B ÷ 1.88 = $984.04 million [METHODOLOGY: TAC / RBC Ratio]²⁰

**Capital Injection Required to Reach 200% (Minimum Compliance):**
- Target TAC at 200% = 2.00 × $984.04M = $1,968.08M
- Current TAC = $1.85B
- **Required Capital Injection = $118.08 million** [VERIFIED calculation]

**Capital Injection Required to Reach 250% (Safe Harbor):**
- Target TAC at 250% = 2.50 × $984.04M = $2,460.10M
- Current TAC = $1.85B
- **Required Capital Injection = $610.10 million** [VERIFIED calculation]

**Reconciliation with Stated $150M Requirement:**
The stated $150M capital injection requirement suggests target of approximately 215% RBC ratio, which would place LLIC above the Company Action Level (200%) but still subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny below the 250% safe harbor threshold.

#### 2. Option A - Surplus Notes (RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE)

**Regulatory Treatment under Nebraska Law:**

**Issuance Authority:** Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-220 permits domestic insurance companies to issue surplus notes "if application has been made to the Department of Insurance and approval in writing is obtained from the Director of Insurance for the issuance of such surplus notes in a stated maximum amount."²¹

**Permissible Purposes (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-220):**
- Providing additional surplus funds ✓
- Making good any deficiency ✓
- Providing minimum surplus required by Chapter 44 ✓²²

**Repayment Requirements (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-221):**
"The principal of and interest on such notes may be paid from time to time, either in full or in part, from available surplus funds of the company only when the amount of the surplus of the company over all liabilities is double that of the amount of principal and interest then being paid."²³

**Critical Statutory Constraint:** LLIC cannot repay principal or interest unless surplus exceeds 2× the repayment amount, effectively subordinating surplus notes to all policyholder and creditor claims.

**Prior Approval Requirement:** "The company shall first receive the prior approval of the Director of Insurance for any such payments."²⁴ Director applies standards from § 44-2136 concerning adequacy of surplus.

**RBC Capital Treatment:**

Under statutory accounting principles (SAP), surplus notes receive equity treatment:
"Under statutory accounting principles (SAP), issued surplus notes are treated as issued surplus/equity/capital. State insurance regulators treat surplus notes as statutory capital because they are unsecured and are at the bottom level of insurers' capital structure, subordinated to policyholders, claimant and beneficiary claims, and to all other classes of creditors."²⁵

**RBC Capital Credit:** 100% Tier 1 capital treatment for regulatory RBC purposes [VERIFIED - SAP treatment as issued surplus]²⁶

**Tax Treatment (26 U.S.C. § 163):**

Despite equity treatment for regulatory purposes, surplus notes may receive debt treatment for tax purposes if they possess "sufficiently debt-like character under case law and IRS guidance":²⁷

**Debt Characterization Factors:**
- Fixed maturity date (even if 30-60 years)
- Fixed interest rate obligation
- Noteholder expects repayment from business cash flows (lender perspective vs. equity entrepreneurial risk)
- Maturity tailored to expected liability profile²⁸

**Tax Benefit:** If characterized as debt, interest payments deductible under 26 U.S.C. § 163(a) ("There shall be allowed as a deduction all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness").²⁹

**Estimated Tax Efficiency:**
- $150M surplus notes at 6% interest = $9M annual interest
- Tax deduction value at 21% corporate rate = $1.89M annual tax savings
- NPV of tax benefit over 30 years (assuming 6% discount rate): ~$137M³⁰

**AM Best Rating Agency Treatment:**

AM Best's capital adequacy methodology provides 90% capital credit for third-party surplus notes and 95% credit for affiliate-held notes.³¹ This treatment is less favorable than regulatory RBC (100% credit) but still substantial.

**Regulatory Approval Timeline:**

- Application submission to Nebraska DOI
- Review period: 30-60 days [METHODOLOGY: Standard insurance department approval timelines]
- Director has discretionary authority to approve/deny and set maximum amount

**Precedent for Large Life Insurer Surplus Note Issuances (2019-2024):**
[Specific precedent data not available in public records - confidential regulatory filings]

**OPTION A - SURPLUS NOTES SCORECARD:**

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **RBC Capital Credit** | 100% Tier 1 | ★★★★★ |
| **Tax Efficiency** | Interest potentially deductible | ★★★★★ |
| **Regulatory Approval Risk** | Moderate - discretionary approval | ★★★☆☆ |
| **Timing** | 30-60 days for approval | ★★★★☆ |
| **Flexibility** | Repayment requires 2× surplus test + approval | ★★☆☆☆ |
| **Cost of Capital** | Higher yield due to subordination | ★★★☆☆ |

**OVERALL RECOMMENDATION: OPTIMAL STRUCTURE FOR RBC PURPOSES** ✓

#### 3. Option B - Subordinated Debt

**Regulatory Treatment:**

Traditional subordinated debt issued by the insurance company (not holding company) receives limited regulatory capital credit under NAIC principles.

**NAIC Capital Treatment:**
"From a regulatory capital perspective, senior debt securities do not generally receive any equity credit for regulatory or rating agency capital purposes."³² This applies to subordinated debt issued directly by insurance operating companies.

**Key Distinction from Surplus Notes:**
- Subordinated debt = Fixed claim; no regulatory approval required for payments
- Surplus notes = Equity treatment; regulatory approval required for all payments

**RBC Capital Credit:** 0% for traditional subordinated debt OR limited Tier 2 credit subject to restrictions [VERIFIED - no equity credit under SAP]³³

**NAIC does not employ explicit Tier 2 capital framework:** "Under SAP (or GAAP) there is no distinction in quality of capital (i.e., tiering) for assets that meet the definition of admitted assets such as surplus notes."³⁴

**Tax Treatment:**

Subordinated debt receives debt treatment for tax purposes, allowing interest deduction under 26 U.S.C. § 163.

**Estimated Tax Efficiency:**
- $150M subordinated debt at 5.5% interest = $8.25M annual interest
- Tax deduction value at 21% corporate rate = $1.73M annual tax savings
- NPV of tax benefit over 30 years: ~$125M

**RBC Impact Analysis:**

**Scenario:** LLIC issues $150M subordinated debt
- Cash proceeds: $150M (increases assets)
- Liability: $150M (subordinated debt)
- **Net impact on surplus: $0** (assets offset liabilities)
- **RBC numerator increase: $0**
- **RBC ratio improvement: 0%** ⚠️

**CRITICAL DEFICIENCY:** Subordinated debt does not improve RBC ratio because it creates offsetting liability without increasing surplus.

**OPTION B - SUBORDINATED DEBT SCORECARD:**

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **RBC Capital Credit** | 0% - No surplus benefit | ★☆☆☆☆ |
| **Tax Efficiency** | Interest deductible | ★★★★★ |
| **Regulatory Approval Risk** | Low - no special approval needed | ★★★★★ |
| **Timing** | Faster issuance (15-30 days) | ★★★★★ |
| **Flexibility** | Payment flexibility (no regulatory approval) | ★★★★★ |
| **Cost of Capital** | Lower yield than surplus notes | ★★★★☆ |

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT: INEFFECTIVE FOR RBC PURPOSES** ✗

#### 4. Option C - Direct Equity Contribution

**Regulatory Treatment:**

Direct equity contribution from parent company or new investor increases statutory surplus dollar-for-dollar.

**RBC Capital Credit:** 100% Tier 1 capital treatment [VERIFIED - increases surplus directly]³⁵

**Tax Treatment for Contributor:**

- Equity contributions are **not deductible** for federal income tax purposes
- No interest deduction available
- Capital contribution increases tax basis in LLIC stock

**Tax Efficiency:** $0 annual tax benefit (vs. $1.89M for surplus notes)

**RBC Impact Analysis:**

**Scenario:** Parent contributes $150M equity
- Cash proceeds: $150M (increases assets)
- Surplus increase: $150M
- **RBC numerator increase: $150M**
- **New TAC: $2.0B**
- **New RBC ratio: 203%** ✓ (exceeds 200% Company Action Level threshold)

**Regulatory Approval:**

No specific Nebraska DOI approval required for capital contributions from existing shareholders, though may trigger Form D reporting under Insurance Holding Company System Act if material.³⁶

**OPTION C - DIRECT EQUITY SCORECARD:**

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **RBC Capital Credit** | 100% Tier 1 | ★★★★★ |
| **Tax Efficiency** | Non-deductible | ★☆☆☆☆ |
| **Regulatory Approval Risk** | Minimal | ★★★★★ |
| **Timing** | Immediate (1-5 days) | ★★★★★ |
| **Flexibility** | Permanent capital | ★★★☆☆ |
| **Cost of Capital** | Equity return expectations (12-15%) | ★★☆☆☆ |

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT: EFFECTIVE BUT TAX-INEFFICIENT** ~

#### 5. Comparative Financial Analysis - $150M Capital Injection

| Metric | **Surplus Notes** | Subordinated Debt | Direct Equity |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **RBC Numerator Increase** | +$150M | $0 | +$150M |
| **New RBC Ratio** | 203% ✓ | 188% ✗ | 203% ✓ |
| **Tax Deduction (Annual)** | $9M × 21% = $1.89M | $8.25M × 21% = $1.73M | $0 |
| **After-Tax Cost (Annual)** | $7.11M | $6.52M | $18M-$22.5M (equity return) |
| **Regulatory Approval Required** | Yes (30-60 days) | No | No |
| **Payment Flexibility** | Low (requires approval + 2× surplus test) | High | N/A (permanent) |
| **Rating Agency Treatment (AM Best)** | 90% capital credit | 0% | 100% |
| **Recommended for LLIC** | ✓ **YES** | ✗ NO | ~ ALTERNATIVE |

#### 6. Recommended Optimal Structure: $150M Surplus Notes + $10M Direct Equity

**Rationale:**
- $150M surplus notes provides tax-efficient RBC capital with 100% regulatory credit
- $10M direct equity contribution provides immediate liquidity and demonstrates commitment
- Combined structure reaches 204% RBC ratio, comfortably above 200% Company Action Level
- Preserves optionality for future capital raises

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Prepare and file surplus note application with Nebraska DOI (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-220)
2. Provide detailed financial projections showing ability to service interest (2× surplus test compliance)
3. Simultaneously execute $10M equity contribution (no approval required)
4. Obtain Director approval for $150M surplus notes (30-60 day timeline)
5. Close surplus note issuance
6. File updated RBC report demonstrating 204%+ ratio

### C. Form A Acquisition Approval Requirements and Timeline

#### 1. Statutory Filing Requirements (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2126)

**Triggering Transaction:**
"No person shall make a tender offer for or request or invite the tenders of, or enter into any agreement to exchange securities for or acquire, in the open market or otherwise, any voting security of a domestic insurer if, after the consummation thereof, such person would, directly or indirectly, or by conversion or by exercise of any right to acquire, have control of such insurer."³⁷

**"Control" Definition (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2121):**
The rebuttable presumption of control arises from direct or indirect ownership, control, or holding with power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer.³⁸

**Form A Filing Requirement:**
Acquirer must file a statement with the Nebraska Director of Insurance and send copy to target insurer containing comprehensive disclosures.³⁹

**Filing Fee:** $1,000⁴⁰

#### 2. Required Statement Contents (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2126(4))

The Form A must include detailed disclosures across multiple categories:⁴¹

| Category | Required Information |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Applicant Identity** | Names, addresses, occupations; criminal history (excluding minor traffic violations); business descriptions for entities |
| **Financial Sources** | Origin and amount of consideration; pledge details; lender identity (with confidentiality option for ordinary business loans) |
| **Financial Documentation** | **Audited earnings and financial condition for preceding five fiscal years** |
| **Business Plans** | Plans for liquidation, asset sales, mergers, extraordinary dividends, or material structural changes |
| **Securities Details** | Number of shares, offer terms, fairness methodology |
| **Existing Holdings** | Current beneficial ownership percentages |
| **Contractual Arrangements** | Puts, calls, guarantees, profit-sharing arrangements |
| **Purchase History** | Securities acquisitions during preceding twelve months |
| **Solicitation Materials** | Copies of tender offers and related documentation |
| **Broker Agreements** | Terms and compensation for solicitation services |
| **Annual Reporting Commitment** | Agreement to provide required reports per § 44-2132 |
| **Enterprise Risk Acknowledgment** | Commitment to provide information for risk evaluation |

**CRITICAL FOR LLIC ACQUISITION:**
The requirement for **audited financial statements for preceding five fiscal years** means the acquirer must demonstrate financial capacity to support LLIC's capital needs.

#### 3. Director's Approval Standards (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2127)

The Director shall approve the acquisition **unless** findings establish one or more of the following grounds for disapproval:⁴²

**Seven Statutory Grounds for Disapproval:**

1. **Licensing Requirements:** "After the change of control, the domestic insurer would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed"

2. **Competition:** "The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be to substantially lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein"

3. **Financial Condition (CRITICAL FOR LLIC):** **"The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer or prejudice the interest of its policyholders"**

4. **Business Plans:** "Any plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest"

5. **Competence and Integrity:** "The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control"

6. **Enterprise Risk:** "The acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public"

7. **Disclosure Deficiencies:** Statement materially false or omits material information⁴³

**RBC Capital Inadequacy as Disapproval Ground:**

Ground #3 (financial condition jeopardizing stability) directly addresses LLIC's 188% RBC situation. The Director will evaluate whether:
- Acquirer has sufficient capital to inject $150M+ immediately
- Acquirer's own financial condition is strong enough to support ongoing capital needs
- Business plan credibly addresses RBC restoration

**Regulatory Interpretation:**
"The financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders" is a basis for disapproval. Regulators evaluate "whether the buyer might directly or indirectly harm the financial well-being of the insurer."⁴⁴

**Enterprise Risk Standard (Added 2011):**
"Enterprise risk means any activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole, **including anything that would cause the insurer's Risk-Based Capital to fall into company action level**."⁴⁵ [Emphasis added]

#### 4. Public Hearing Requirements (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2127)

**Mandatory Hearing Timeline:**
"The director shall hold a public hearing on such statement within thirty days after receipt of the statement."⁴⁶

**Notice Requirements:**
- Minimum 20 days' notice before hearing
- Notice published in newspaper of general circulation in county of insurer's principal place of business
- Notice mailed to insurer and applicant⁴⁷

**Discovery Deadline:**

#### 5. Recent Nebraska Form A Precedent (2020-2024)

**Midwest Holding Inc. Acquisition by Antarctica Capital (December 2023):**⁵¹

- **Target:** Midwest Holding Inc. (Nebraska-domiciled holding company owning American Life & Security Corp., a Nebraska domestic life insurer)
- **Acquirer:** Antarctica Capital (asset management firm)
- **Transaction Value:** ~$100 million all-cash ($27.00/share)
- **Approval Date:** December 2023
- **Closing Date:** December 20, 2023
- **Approval Timeline:** Approximately 60-90 days from announcement to approval [METHODOLOGY: Announced May 2023, approved December 2023]

**Post-Approval Conditions:**
- Midwest continued operations under existing management
- Maintained Lincoln, Nebraska headquarters
- No immediate structural changes announced

**Key Approval Factor:** Antarctica Capital demonstrated financial capacity to support ongoing operations and capital requirements of the insurance subsidiary.

**Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska Mutual Holding Company Formation (2018):**⁵²
- Nebraska DOI approved BCBSNE's reorganization to form mutual insurance holding company structure
- Precedent for complex holding company restructurings requiring Form A-level approval

#### 6. Risk Assessment - LLIC Acquisition Approval Probability

**Factors Favoring Approval:**

✓ **Capital Injection Commitment:** If acquirer credibly commits to $150M+ capital injection immediately upon closing
✓ **Strong Acquirer Financials:** Audited financials demonstrate ability to support ongoing operations
✓ **Experienced Management:** Insurance industry experience and proven track record
✓ **No Anti-Competitive Effects:** LLIC acquisition unlikely to substantially lessen competition
✓ **Policyholder Protection:** Clear plan for RBC restoration protects policyholder interests

**Factors Creating Approval Risk:**

⚠️ **Current RBC Deficiency:** 188% RBC triggers heightened scrutiny under Ground #3 (financial stability)
⚠️ **Company Action Level Status:** LLIC must file RBC Plan, creating regulatory coordination complexity
⚠️ **Timing Pressure:** Simultaneous Form A approval + RBC Plan submission may extend timeline
⚠️ **Acquirer Leverage:** If acquirer uses significant debt to finance acquisition, may raise concerns about financial stability
⚠️ **Business Plan Clarity:** Vague or aggressive restructuring plans may trigger Ground #4 concerns

**Probability Assessment:**

| Scenario | Approval Probability | Basis |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| **Strong acquirer + $150M committed capital injection + detailed RBC restoration plan** | 85-90% | Directly addresses Ground #3 concerns; precedent supports approval when capital adequacy demonstrated |
| **Moderate acquirer strength + $150M capital but unclear ongoing support** | 60-75% | Director may impose conditions or require additional commitments |
| **Weak acquirer financials or unclear capital injection plan** | 25-40% | High risk of disapproval under Ground #3 or conditional approval with onerous requirements |

[METHODOLOGY: Probability ranges based on (1) statutory disapproval grounds analysis, (2) Nebraska precedent showing approval for financially sound acquirers, (3) RBC capital adequacy framework requirements]

#### 7. Recommended Form A Strategy for LLIC Acquisition

**Pre-Filing Preparation (30 days):**
1. Assemble five years of audited financial statements for acquirer
2. Prepare detailed capital injection commitment letter ($150M minimum)
3. Develop comprehensive RBC restoration plan showing path to 250%+ within 24 months
4. Engage Nebraska-licensed insurance counsel for Form A preparation
5. Schedule pre-filing conference call with Nebraska DOI to discuss approval timeline

**Filing and Hearing Phase (60-90 days):**
6. Submit complete Form A with all exhibits and $1,000 filing fee
7. Simultaneously submit RBC Plan for LLIC (required due to 188% status)
8. Respond to any Director information requests within 5 business days
9. Prepare for public hearing with testimony from acquirer CFO and insurance operations leadership
10. Address any public comments from policyholders or competitors

**Post-Approval Implementation (30 days):**
11. Close acquisition within 60 days of Director approval (standard condition)
12. Execute $150M capital injection within 5 business days of closing
13. File updated RBC report showing >200% ratio
14. Implement ongoing RBC monitoring and reporting protocols

**Total Expected Timeline: 120-180 days from initiation to closing**

### D. Ongoing Regulatory Supervision Post-Acquisition

#### 1. RBC Plan Submission Requirements (Company Action Level - 188%)

**Statutory Obligation (Triggered at 188% RBC):**

Because LLIC's RBC ratio of 188% falls within the Company Action Level (150-200%), LLIC is required to prepare and submit a comprehensive RBC Plan to the Nebraska Director of Insurance.⁵³

**RBC Plan Contents (NAIC Model Act #312 § 3):**

The plan must include:
- **Financial Projections:** Pro forma balance sheets and income statements for 3-5 years
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Identification of conditions contributing to RBC deficiency
- **Corrective Measures:** Specific proposals to eliminate the RBC deficiency
- **Capital Injection Timeline:** Schedule for capital contributions and expected RBC ratio improvements
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Plans to reduce C1 (asset), C2 (insurance), C3 (interest rate), and C4 (business) risks
- **Management Actions:** Expense reduction initiatives, underwriting improvements, reinsurance strategies⁵⁴

**Submission Deadline:** Typically 45 days after Company Action Level Event

**Director Review and Approval:**
The Director reviews the RBC Plan for adequacy and may:
- Accept the plan as satisfactory
- Request modifications or additional detail
- Escalate to Regulatory Action Level intervention if plan deemed insufficient⁵⁵

**Plan Update Requirements:**
LLIC must submit quarterly progress reports demonstrating:
- Actual RBC ratio vs. projected trajectory
- Capital injection execution status
- Variance explanations if actual performance lags projections

#### 2. Dividend Restrictions (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2134)

**Extraordinary Dividend Definition:**

Any dividend or distribution exceeding the **greater** of:
(a) **10% of policyholder surplus** as of December 31 preceding; or
(b) **Net gain from operations** (life insurers) for the twelve-month period ending December 31 preceding⁵⁶

**LLIC Calculation:**
- Current Surplus: $1.85 billion
- 10% threshold: $185 million
- **Maximum ordinary dividend without prior approval: $185 million**
- Any dividend >$185M requires 30-day advance notice to Director

**Practical Impact of RBC Deficiency:**

While the statutory extraordinary dividend threshold is $185M, LLIC's sub-200% RBC status creates additional restrictions:

⚠️ **Director Discretionary Authority:** Director may disapprove any dividend (ordinary or extraordinary) if payment would:
- Further reduce RBC ratio below 200%
- Jeopardize policyholders' interests
- Violate surplus adequacy standards under § 44-2136⁵⁷

**Estimated Dividend Capacity:**

**Scenario 1: Pre-Capital Injection (188% RBC)**
- Any material dividend would further reduce RBC ratio
- **Practical dividend capacity: $0** (Director likely to disapprove)

**Scenario 2: Post-$150M Capital Injection (203% RBC)**
- New surplus: $2.0B
- 10% threshold: $200M
- **Maximum dividend: ~$50-75M** (limited to amounts not reducing RBC below 210%)

**Scenario 3: After reaching 250% RBC safe harbor**
- Normalized dividend capacity resumes
- Subject only to statutory 10% test

#### 3. Investment Restrictions for Sub-200% RBC Insurers

**General Investment Authority (Nebraska Insurers Investment Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-5101 to 44-5177):**

Nebraska law permits insurers to invest in various asset classes subject to percentage limitations.⁵⁸

**Enhanced Scrutiny for Troubled Insurers:**

While Nebraska statutes do not explicitly impose additional investment restrictions solely based on RBC level, regulators apply heightened scrutiny to:

**Below-Investment-Grade Bond Exposure:**
- Corporate bonds rated NAIC 3-6 (below investment grade) carry higher RBC C-1 factors
- RBC C-1 factors for bonds expanded to 20 NAIC designations (from 6), with more punitive charges for sub-investment-grade bonds⁵⁹
- LLIC likely faces informal Director guidance to reduce NAIC 5-6 rated bond exposure

**Derivative and Hedging Restrictions:**
- Use of derivatives subject to Model Regulation approval
- RBC deficiency may trigger Director requirement for pre-approval of new hedging strategies

**Affiliate Transactions:**
- All material affiliate transactions require Form D filing under Insurance Holding Company System Act
- Sub-200% RBC status increases likelihood of Director disapproval for asset transfers to affiliates⁶⁰

**Mortgage and Real Estate Concentration:**
- Nebraska law limits investments in any one parcel of real estate
- RBC deficiency may result in Director requiring diversification of concentrated exposures

**PRACTICAL IMPACT - Investment Strategy Constraints:**

| Asset Class | Normal Limit | Sub-200% RBC Informal Limit | Impact on LLIC |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| NAIC 5-6 Bonds (Below IG) | 20% of assets | <10% of assets | Potential forced sales of $500M-$1B in high-yield bonds |
| Commercial Mortgages | 25% of assets | <20% of assets | Limited new originations |
| Affiliated Investments | Subject to Form D | Director approval required | Eliminates flexibility for intra-group transactions |
| Derivatives (notional) | 2× admitted assets | Pre-approval for new strategies | Restricts interest rate hedging implementation |

#### 4. Enhanced Reporting and Examination Frequency

**Quarterly Financial Statements (Enhanced Surveillance):**

Sub-200% RBC insurers typically subject to:
- Quarterly unaudited financial statement filings (beyond annual statutory requirement)
- Monthly cash flow projections
- Weekly liquidity monitoring reports if RBC deteriorates below 175%⁶¹

**Financial Examination Frequency:**

Nebraska law requires examination of domestic insurers at least once every five years.⁶² However:
- **RBC deficiency triggers accelerated examination cycle:** Every 2-3 years
- **Risk-focused examination:** Concentrated on capital adequacy, asset quality, reserve adequacy
- **Estimated examination costs:** $250,000 - $500,000 per triennial examination

**NAIC Financial Analysis Working Group Referral Risk:**

If LLIC's financial condition deteriorates or exhibits unusual trends:
- Nebraska DOI may refer LLIC to NAIC Financial Analysis (E) Working Group
- Multi-state coordination increases regulatory burden
- May trigger coordinated examinations by multiple state regulators⁶³

### E. Multi-State Regulatory Coordination

#### 1. Lead State Doctrine and Nebraska's Role

**Nebraska as Domiciliary Regulator:**

Nebraska serves as the **lead state** for LLIC's regulatory supervision under NAIC principles:⁶⁴

**Lead State Responsibilities:**
- Coordinate with all states where LLIC is licensed (assumed 25+ jurisdictions)
- Serve as "central point of contact for purposes of gathering and distributing information to all regulators"
- Facilitate multi-jurisdictional examinations and RBC Plan reviews
- Determine depth of insurance holding company analysis and enterprise risk assessment⁶⁵

**"Windows and Walls" Approach:**
- **Windows:** Other state regulators have visibility into LLIC's financial condition via Nebraska's reporting
- **Walls:** Other states cannot directly intervene but may impose additional requirements for licensed operations in their jurisdictions⁶⁶

**Interstate Compact Coordination:**

Under NAIC accreditation standards, non-domiciliary states typically defer to lead state for:
- Financial examinations (participate but Nebraska leads)
- RBC Plan approval (Nebraska's determination controls)
- Holding company transaction approvals (Form A/D/E filings)

However, non-domiciliary states retain authority to:
- Impose additional licensing conditions
- Restrict new business writings in their state
- Require separate RBC Plans if LLIC's in-state business materially deteriorates

#### 2. Multi-State Licensing Risk

**Licensing Revocation/Suspension Risk:**

While Nebraska's Form A approval is necessary for acquisition, **each state where LLIC operates may independently assess the acquisition's impact:**⁶⁷

**Potential State Responses to 188% RBC Acquirer:**

| State Action | Trigger | Probability (LLIC) | Impact |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Require separate RBC Plan** | RBC <200% | 40-60% | Increase regulatory burden; multi-state reporting |
| **Condition license on capital injection completion** | Acquisition + RBC deficiency | 70-85% | Delay new business until capital injected |
| **Suspend new business writings** | RBC <175% | 15-25% (if RBC deteriorates post-acquisition) | Revenue loss; policyholder run-off risk |
| **Require reinsurance or guaranty** | RBC <150% (Regulatory Action Level) | <10% (assumes capital injection occurs) | Expensive; may be unavailable |

[METHODOLOGY: Probability ranges based on (1) multi-state regulatory coordination precedent, (2) NAIC accreditation standards emphasizing lead state deference, (3) risk that non-domiciliary states impose stricter conditions than domiciliary regulator]

#### 3. Guaranty Fund Assessment Exposure

**Nebraska Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-2701 to 44-2719):**

**Coverage Limits Per Policyholder (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2703):**⁶⁸

| Policy Type | Coverage Limit |
|-------------|----------------|
| Life insurance death benefits | $300,000 |
| Life insurance cash surrender value | $100,000 |
| Annuity present value benefits | $250,000 |
| Health benefit plans | $500,000 |
| Disability/LTC insurance | $300,000 |
| **Aggregate per individual (life + annuity)** | **$300,000** |
| **Aggregate per individual (health + life/annuity)** | **$500,000** |

**Maximum Assessment on Member Insurers (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2708):**⁶⁹

"Total assessments in one calendar year **shall not exceed 2% of that member insurer's average annual premiums received in this state**."⁷⁰

**LLIC Guaranty Fund Assessment Exposure Calculation:**

**Scenario: LLIC Placed in Receivership (Hypothetical)**

**Assumptions:**
- LLIC licensed in 30 states (Nebraska + 29 others)
- Each state has similar 2% maximum assessment limit
- Total U.S. life/health insurance industry direct premiums: ~$900 billion⁷¹
- LLIC's market share: ~0.5% (estimated)
- LLIC policyholders nationwide: ~50,000 (estimated)
- Average claim per policyholder: $200,000 (blended life/annuity/health)
- Total guaranty association obligations: ~$10 billion (capped by per-policy limits)

**Assessment to Other Insurers:**

Each member insurer in each state would face assessment based on:
- **Class B Assessment:** Allocated pro rata based on member's premiums in that state relative to total member premiums
- **Maximum Annual Assessment:** 2% of member's average annual state premiums
- **Multi-Year Assessments:** If $10B obligation exceeds single-year 2% cap, assessments spread over 5-10 years

**LLIC Would Owe Guaranty Fund Assessments (Pre-Insolvency):**

If other Nebraska-domiciled insurers became insolvent:
- LLIC's Nebraska premium base: Assume $500M annually
- Maximum annual assessment: 2% × $500M = **$10 million per year**
- **10-year cumulative exposure:** Up to **$100 million** in assessments

**CRITICAL CONSIDERATION:**
Sub-200% RBC insurers are **disproportionately vulnerable** to guaranty fund assessments because:
- Assessments reduce surplus, further lowering RBC ratio
- Creating potential RBC death spiral if multiple insurers fail simultaneously

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks - Company Action Level Status (188% RBC)

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Potential Financial Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **RBC Plan Rejection by Nebraska DOI** | HIGH | MEDIUM (30-40%) | Escalation to Regulatory Action Level; mandatory corrective order | Submit comprehensive plan with detailed capital injection timeline and conservative projections |
| **Form A Disapproval (Ground #3 - Financial Condition)** | CRITICAL | MEDIUM (25-40% if inadequate capital commitment) | Deal termination; LLIC remains undercapitalized | Demonstrate acquirer financial strength; commit $150M+ capital injection at closing |
| **Multi-State Licensing Restrictions** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (40-60%) | $50M-$150M annual revenue loss if new business suspended in key states | Proactive notification to top 10 premium states; coordinate with Nebraska lead state communications |
| **Dividend Restrictions Limiting ROI** | MEDIUM | HIGH (>90%) | Zero dividend capacity until RBC reaches 210%+; 3-5 year payback delay | Structure acquisition assuming no dividends for 36 months; rely on capital appreciation |
| **Guaranty Fund Assessment - Other Insurer Failures** | MEDIUM | LOW (10-15% annually) | Up to $10M/year in unexpected assessments | Maintain RBC buffer above 250% to absorb assessments without triggering new Company Action Level |
| **Forced Asset Sales - Below-IG Bonds** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (50-60%) | $100M-$500M in unrealized losses if forced to sell NAIC 5-6 bonds in distressed market | Negotiate transition period with Director; implement gradual de-risking over 24 months |
| **Accelerated Examination Costs** | LOW | HIGH (>90%) | $500K-$1M in additional regulatory costs every 2-3 years | Budget for enhanced regulatory compliance; maintain strong internal controls to reduce examination scope |
| **Reputational Damage - RBC Disclosure** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (40-50%) | Policy lapses/surrenders if RBC status becomes public; $200M-$500M in lost AUM | Proactive communication to agents and key distribution partners; demonstrate capital injection commitment |
| **Rating Agency Downgrade** | HIGH | HIGH (70-85%) | A.M. Best/S&P downgrade from A- to B++; loss of competitive positioning | Immediate capital injection; achieve 250%+ RBC within 6 months of acquisition |
| **Regulatory Action Level Escalation (if RBC falls <150%)** | CRITICAL | LOW (5-10% if capital injection executed) | Mandatory corrective order; potential supervisory control | Maintain 25% RBC buffer above Company Action Level threshold |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Immediate Attention

⚠️ **CRITICAL DEFICIENCY:** LLIC's 188% RBC ratio is **12 percentage points below** the 200% Company Action Level threshold, requiring mandatory RBC Plan submission and creating presumptive disapproval risk for Form A acquisition approval under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2127(1)(c) (financial condition jeopardizing stability).

⚠️ **CAPITAL INJECTION URGENCY:** $150M stated capital requirement appears calibrated to reach only ~215% RBC (not 250% safe harbor), leaving LLIC vulnerable to market volatility or unexpected losses that could re-trigger Company Action Level within 12-24 months.

⚠️ **MULTI-STATE COORDINATION RISK:** Non-domiciliary states may impose stricter conditions than Nebraska (e.g., suspending new business until capital injection completed), fragmenting LLIC's operations and reducing acquisition value.

⚠️ **DIVIDEND LOCKUP:** Practical dividend capacity is **$0 for 36+ months** until RBC reaches stable 250%+ level, materially extending acquirer's payback period and reducing IRR.

⚠️ **RATING AGENCY OVERHANG:** Current RBC status likely already known to A.M. Best and S&P; acquisition announcement without simultaneous capital injection commitment will trigger immediate downgrade review.

### C. Quantified Exposure Analysis

**Total Regulatory and Compliance Costs (3-Year Post-Acquisition Period):**

| Cost Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Probability-Weighted Expected Cost |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Capital Injection Required** | $150M (to reach 215%) | $610M (to reach 250% safe harbor) | $300M (assumes phased approach) |
| **Guaranty Fund Assessments** | $0 (no insurer failures) | $30M (3 years × $10M max) | $6M (20% probability × $30M) |
| **Enhanced Examination Costs** | $500K (one examination) | $1.5M (two examinations + follow-up) | $1M |
| **Legal and Compliance (Form A, RBC Plan, Multi-State)** | $1M | $3M | $2M |
| **Forced Asset Sales - Realized Losses** | $0 (orderly transition) | $200M (fire sale scenario) | $40M (20% probability × $200M) |
| **Lost Revenue - New Business Restrictions** | $0 (no restrictions) | $300M (3 years × $100M/yr) | $90M (30% probability × $300M) |
| **Investment Strategy Restrictions - Opportunity Cost** | $25M (250 bps yield give-up) | $75M (higher-yield assets prohibited) | $50M |
| **Rating Agency Downgrade - Business Impact** | $100M (moderate lapse increase) | $500M (severe competitive disadvantage) | $250M (50% probability of downgrade) |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED REGULATORY BURDEN** | **$276.5M** | **$1,719.5M** | **$739M** |

**After-Tax Impact (21% corporate tax rate):**
- **Expected Total Regulatory Burden (After-Tax): $584M**

**Transaction Value Implications:**
If LLIC acquisition price is $2.0B, regulatory and compliance burdens represent **29% of purchase price** on a probability-weighted basis.

### D. Outstanding Questions Requiring Due Diligence

1. **Acquirer Financial Capacity:** Can acquirer credibly commit to $610M capital injection to reach 250% RBC safe harbor, or only $150M minimum?

2. **LLIC's Detailed RBC Components:** What are the specific C1 (asset), C2 (insurance), C3 (interest rate), and C4 (business) risk components driving the Required RBC calculation? Which risks can be mitigated quickly?

3. **Historical RBC Trajectory:** Has LLIC's RBC ratio been deteriorating (160% → 188%) or improving (150% → 188%)? Trend affects Director's confidence in RBC Plan projections.

4. **Below-Investment-Grade Bond Portfolio:** What is LLIC's exposure to NAIC 5-6 rated bonds? Estimated unrealized losses if forced to liquidate?

5. **Multi-State Premium Distribution:** Which 10 states generate 80% of LLIC's premiums? Risk concentration if those states impose new business restrictions.

6. **Reinsurance Counterparty Credit Risk:** Does LLIC have significant reinsurance recoverables? Are any reinsurance agreements subject to RBC-based covenant triggers?

7. **A.M. Best Rating History:** What is LLIC's current A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating? When is next scheduled rating review?

8. **Management Retention:** Will LLIC's current management (familiar with RBC restoration strategies) remain post-acquisition, or will acquirer install new team?

9. **Nebraska DOI Informal Feedback:** Has LLIC had preliminary discussions with Nebraska DOI about RBC Plan acceptability or Form A approval timeline expectations?

10. **Alternative Capital Sources:** Has LLIC explored external surplus note investors (vs. parent-only capital injection) to diversify capital structure?

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **RBC Regulatory Framework - Company Action Level Triggered:** Liberty Life Insurance Company's 188% RBC ratio falls within the Company Action Level threshold (150-200%), mandating submission of a comprehensive RBC Plan to the Nebraska Director of Insurance within 45 days and creating heightened regulatory scrutiny that will persist until RBC reaches 250%+ safe harbor level.

2. **Capital Injection Structure - Surplus Notes Optimal:** Among three capital injection alternatives (surplus notes, subordinated debt, direct equity), **surplus notes provide the optimal structure** due to (a) 100% Tier 1 RBC capital credit, (b) potential tax deductibility of interest payments ($1.89M annual tax benefit), and (c) favorable regulatory treatment under Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-220, 44-221. Subordinated debt is **ineffective** because it creates no net surplus benefit (asset increase offset by liability).

3. **Capital Requirement Magnitude - $610M for Safe Harbor:** While the stated $150M capital injection reaches 203% RBC (marginally above Company Action Level), achieving the 250% regulatory safe harbor requires **$610M total capital injection** to eliminate ongoing regulatory intervention and restore dividend capacity. The $150M minimum only provides 15 RBC percentage points of cushion, insufficient to absorb normal market volatility.

4. **Form A Approval Risk - Moderate to High Without Strong Capital Commitment:** Nebraska's Form A approval under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2127 faces disapproval risk under Ground #3 (financial condition jeopardizing stability) unless acquirer demonstrates both (a) financial capacity to inject required capital and (b) ongoing support capability. **Approval probability: 85-90% with $150M committed capital at closing; 60-75% if capital injection timeline unclear or phased over multiple years.**

5. **Approval Timeline - 120-180 Days:** Combined Form A acquisition approval process and RBC Plan submission requires **minimum 120 days** from initial filing to closing (60-90 days for Form A public hearing and approval + 45 days for RBC Plan + 30 days for post-approval implementation), with potential extension to 180 days if Director requests additional information or conditions approval on capital injection completion.

6. **Ongoing Regulatory Burden - Material and Persistent:** Sub-200% RBC status triggers cascading restrictions including (a) zero practical dividend capacity until 210%+ RBC restored, (b) enhanced quarterly reporting and accelerated examination cycle, (c) informal investment restrictions on below-investment-grade bonds, and (d) multi-state licensing conditions potentially restricting new business writings in non-domiciliary states. **Total 3-year regulatory compliance cost: $584M after-tax (probability-weighted).**

7. **Multi-State Coordination Complexity:** While Nebraska serves as lead state under NAIC principles, non-domiciliary states (25+ jurisdictions assumed) retain independent authority to impose additional licensing conditions. **Probability of at least one major state imposing new business restrictions: 40-60%** pending capital injection completion.

8. **Guaranty Fund Assessment Exposure - Manageable but Non-Trivial:** Nebraska's 2% maximum annual assessment limit (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2708) caps LLIC's exposure at ~$10M annually, but multi-year assessments following large insurer failures could total $30M-$100M over 10 years, creating RBC ratio pressure if not anticipated in capital planning.

9. **Rating Agency Downgrade - Highly Probable:** Current 188% RBC status likely already under A.M. Best review; acquisition announcement without simultaneous capital injection commitment will trigger immediate downgrade inquiry. **Downgrade probability: 70-85%** absent proactive rating agency communication and capital commitment demonstration.

10. **Enterprise Risk Disclosure Requirements:** Nebraska's adoption of NAIC Model Act #440 enterprise risk provisions means any post-acquisition activity that could cause LLIC's RBC to fall into Company Action Level (or further deteriorate) constitutes a reportable "enterprise risk" requiring Form B/C/D disclosure to regulators, increasing holding company system transparency requirements.

### B. Recommended Next Steps - Transaction Structuring

#### PHASE 1: Pre-Acquisition Due Diligence (30-45 days)

1. **RBC Component Deep Dive:** Obtain LLIC's NAIC Annual Statement Schedule data to decompose the Required RBC calculation into C1 (asset), C2 (insurance), C3 (interest rate), and C4 (business) risk components. Identify which risks can be mitigated through (a) asset reallocation, (b) reinsurance, or (c) operational improvements to reduce Required RBC denominator (more efficient than increasing TAC numerator).

2. **Historical RBC Trajectory Analysis:** Request LLIC's RBC ratios for preceding 5 years to determine whether 188% represents deterioration from higher levels (red flag) or improvement from Regulatory Action Level (positive trend). Trajectory affects Director's confidence in RBC Plan projections.

3. **Multi-State Premium Concentration Study:** Map LLIC's premium distribution across all 25+ licensed states to identify top 10 jurisdictions generating 80% of revenue. Proactively engage those state DOIs to gauge likelihood of new business restrictions pending capital injection.

4. **Below-Investment-Grade Bond Audit:** Quantify LLIC's exposure to NAIC 5-6 rated bonds and structured securities with >30% RBC C-1 factors. Model unrealized losses if Director requires forced liquidation within 12-24 months to reduce asset risk.

5. **Reinsurance Covenant Review:** Audit all reinsurance agreements for RBC-based financial strength covenants that could trigger termination or collateral posting requirements if RBC remains <200%. Quantify replacement reinsurance costs.

#### PHASE 2: Regulatory Pre-Filing Strategy (30-60 days)

6. **Nebraska DOI Pre-Filing Conference:** Schedule confidential meeting with Nebraska Director and Chief Financial Examiner to:
   - Present acquirer's financial strength and insurance industry experience
   - Outline proposed capital injection structure and timeline
   - Request feedback on RBC Plan framework before formal submission
   - Gauge Director's risk tolerance for 203% vs. 250% target RBC ratio

7. **Form A Package Assembly:** Engage Nebraska-licensed insurance regulatory counsel (ideally with prior Nebraska DOI Form A experience) to prepare comprehensive Form A statement including:
   - Acquirer's audited financials for preceding 5 years
   - Detailed capital injection commitment letter with irrevocable funding mechanism
   - Pro forma LLIC RBC calculations showing immediate post-injection 203%+ ratio
   - Enterprise risk management framework demonstrating ongoing capital support capability
   - Policyholder protection commitments (no extraordinary dividends for 36 months)

8. **Parallel RBC Plan Development:** Simultaneously prepare LLIC's RBC Plan (required due to Company Action Level) for submission with or immediately after Form A filing. Plan should include:
   - 3-year financial projections showing RBC progression: 203% → 225% → 250%
   - Quarterly milestones with specific management actions at each stage
   - Contingency provisions if actual performance lags projections (e.g., additional capital injection triggers)
   - Risk mitigation initiatives reducing C1/C2/C3/C4 risk components

9. **Multi-State Notification Protocol:** Draft template notification letters to top 10 non-domiciliary state DOIs informing them of pending acquisition and Nebraska's lead state oversight role. Emphasize: (a) immediate capital injection at closing, (b) no material changes to LLIC operations, (c) management continuity.

10. **Rating Agency Pre-Briefing:** Schedule meetings with A.M. Best and S&P Ratings 30 days before Form A filing to:
    - Disclose acquisition and capital injection plans before public announcement
    - Provide acquirer financial strength documentation
    - Request rating affirmation (or controlled downgrade timeline if unavoidable)
    - Minimize policyholder/agent anxiety from unexpected rating action

#### PHASE 3: Filing and Approval Execution (60-90 days)

11. **Submit Complete Form A + $1,000 Filing Fee:** File comprehensive Form A statement with Nebraska DOI with all required exhibits, ensuring completeness to avoid Director's request for additional information (which restarts 30-day hearing clock).

12. **Submit RBC Plan Within 5 Business Days:** File LLIC's RBC Plan immediately following Form A submission to demonstrate proactive regulatory compliance and coordination between acquisition approval and capital restoration.

13. **Discovery Response Protocol:** Designate single point of contact (acquirer CFO or LLIC CEO) to respond to Director's information requests within 2-3 business days (statute allows 3 days before hearing for discovery completion; faster response demonstrates cooperation).

14. **Public Hearing Preparation:** Prepare testimony from:
    - Acquirer CEO: Financial strength, insurance industry experience, commitment to LLIC policyholders
    - Acquirer CFO: Capital injection mechanics, ongoing financial support capability
    - LLIC CEO: RBC Plan implementation roadmap, operational continuity assurances
    - Independent actuary: Validation of RBC Plan projections and capital adequacy

15. **Multi-State Concurrent Filings (if required):** Some states may require separate acquisition notices or Form A-equivalent filings. Coordinate simultaneous submissions to avoid sequential approval delays across 25+ jurisdictions.

#### PHASE 4: Post-Approval Implementation (30 days)

16. **Close Acquisition Within 60 Days:** Nebraska approval typically conditions closing deadline at 60 days post-approval (standard insurance M&A practice); coordinate with Form A approval effective date.

17. **Execute $150M Surplus Note Issuance:** Simultaneously with acquisition closing:
    - Fund $150M surplus note subscription (obtain Director approval if not already incorporated in Form A)
    - Wire funds to LLIC within 5 business days of closing
    - File updated NAIC Quarterly Statement showing surplus increase

18. **File Updated RBC Report:** Submit special RBC report (within 10 business days of capital injection) demonstrating:
    - New TAC: $2.0B (prior $1.85B + $150M)
    - RBC ratio: 203%+
    - Compliance with Company Action Level threshold (>200%)
    - Request Director acknowledgment that Company Action Level Event resolved

19. **Rating Agency Follow-Up:** Provide A.M. Best and S&P with updated RBC report and request rating review based on improved capital position. Target: Rating affirmation within 30 days of capital injection.

20. **Multi-State Compliance Notifications:** Notify all 25+ non-domiciliary state DOIs of:
    - Acquisition completion
    - Capital injection execution
    - Updated RBC ratio >200%
    - Request license condition removal (if any states imposed new business restrictions)

#### PHASE 5: Ongoing Monitoring and Path to 250% Safe Harbor (24-36 months)

21. **Quarterly RBC Monitoring Dashboard:** Implement internal quarterly RBC calculation and variance analysis comparing actual vs. RBC Plan projections. Escalate to Board of Directors if actual RBC lags plan by >5 percentage points.

22. **Annual RBC Plan Updates:** Submit revised RBC Plan annually (or as required by Director if quarterly performance materially diverges from projections) showing progress toward 250% safe harbor target.

23. **Phased Capital Injection Strategy (if targeting 250%):** If acquirer commits to 250% RBC target, structure capital injections in tranches:
    - **Tranche 1:** $150M at closing (reaches 203%)
    - **Tranche 2:** $200M at 12 months post-closing (reaches 225%)
    - **Tranche 3:** $260M at 24 months post-closing (reaches 250%+)
    - Tranches 2-3 contingent on LLIC achieving operational milestones (expense reduction, underwriting profitability improvement)

24. **Investment Portfolio De-Risking:** Implement 24-month plan to reduce NAIC 5-6 rated bond exposure from current levels to <10% of assets, reinvesting proceeds in NAIC 1-2 rated bonds (lower RBC C-1 factors reduce Required RBC denominator).

25. **Dividend Resumption Planning:** Once RBC reaches stable 225%+, develop dividend policy allowing distributions up to 50% of net income (subject to maintaining 210%+ RBC floor) to begin returning capital to acquirer while preserving regulatory cushion.

### C. Alternative Transaction Structures to Consider

**ALTERNATIVE 1: Pre-Acquisition Capital Injection by Current LLIC Shareholders**

If current LLIC shareholders can inject $150M capital **before** acquisition closes:
- ✓ Eliminates Form A disapproval risk (LLIC presents as 203% RBC at time of acquisition application)
- ✓ Reduces regulatory approval timeline by 30-45 days (no parallel RBC Plan submission complexity)
- ✓ Acquirer pays higher purchase price for better-capitalized entity, but avoids execution risk
- ⚠️ Requires current shareholders to have $150M available capital (may be infeasible)

**ALTERNATIVE 2: Partial Acquisition + Capital Injection Earn-Out**

Structure as two-step transaction:
- **Step 1:** Acquire 80% of LLIC for lower price, inject $75M capital (reaches ~197% RBC - still Company Action Level)
- **Step 2:** Acquire remaining 20% upon achieving 250% RBC within 24 months (acquirer injects additional $535M over time)
- ✓ Reduces upfront capital requirement; aligns acquisition cost with RBC performance
- ⚠️ Complex regulatory approval (two Form A filings); current LLIC shareholders may reject partial sale

**ALTERNATIVE 3: Consortium Acquisition with Multiple Capital Providers**

Form investor consortium where:
- Strategic acquirer owns 51% (operational control)
- Financial investors (PE funds, reinsurers) provide $400M mezzanine capital via surplus notes
- ✓ Diversifies capital sources; reduces single-entity financial strain
- ✓ Achieves 250% RBC immediately, eliminating multi-year regulatory overhang
- ⚠️ Governance complexity; multiple Form A filings for each 10%+ investor

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH:** **Primary strategy (surplus notes + phased capital)** unless current LLIC shareholders can execute Alternative 1 (pre-acquisition recap).

### D. Critical Success Factors

The acquisition of LLIC will succeed (achieving regulatory approval and sustainable operations) **only if**:

1. ✓ Acquirer demonstrates financial capacity to inject **minimum $150M at closing**, with credible path to $610M over 24-36 months to reach 250% safe harbor

2. ✓ Form A filing includes **irrevocable capital commitment** (escrow, letter of credit, or parent guarantee) eliminating Director's concern about acquirer's financial condition (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2127(1)(c))

3. ✓ RBC Plan submitted concurrently with Form A shows **conservative projections** with 25%+ cushion above Company Action Level to absorb market volatility or unexpected losses

4. ✓ Acquirer accepts **zero dividend capacity for 36 months**, structuring returns through long-term capital appreciation rather than short-term cash distributions

5. ✓ Multi-state coordination plan proactively addresses **top 10 premium states** to prevent fragmented licensing restrictions that undermine LLIC's national business model

6. ✓ Rating agency strategy achieves **rating affirmation or controlled downgrade** (maximum one notch) to preserve competitive positioning and prevent policyholder lapse spiral

7. ✓ Management continuity maintained post-acquisition to preserve **regulatory relationships** and institutional knowledge of RBC restoration strategies

**DEAL-KILLER SCENARIOS:**

The acquisition should **not proceed** if:
- ✗ Acquirer can only commit $150M capital with no pathway to 250% (leaves LLIC in perpetual regulatory intervention)
- ✗ Acquirer requires material dividends within 24 months to achieve IRR targets (incompatible with RBC restoration requirements)
- ✗ Nebraska Director expresses concerns about acquirer's financial condition or insurance industry experience during pre-filing conference
- ✗ Multiple major states (CA, TX, FL, NY) indicate intention to suspend new business pending multi-year observation period

- LLIC-specific RBC component breakdown (C1/C2/C3/C4) unavailable without access to NAIC Annual Statement Schedule data
- Multi-state licensing action probabilities based on limited public precedent (most state DOI actions are non-public)
- Liberty Life Insurance Company is hypothetical entity for demonstration purposes

### Confidence Levels by Research Category

| Research Category | Confidence | Supporting Evidence | Corroborating Sources |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **RBC Statutory Framework** | HIGH | Nebraska Rev. Stat. §§ 44-6001 to 44-6026; NAIC Model Act #312 | 5 primary sources (statutes, NAIC guidance, academic papers) |

### Known Limitations

1. **Liberty Life Insurance Company is Hypothetical Entity:** All LLIC-specific data (188% RBC ratio, $18.2B assets, $1.85B surplus) are hypothetical for demonstration purposes. Actual due diligence would require:
   - Access to LLIC's NAIC Annual Statement (Schedule BA for bonds, Schedule D for stocks, Schedule E for cash, etc.)
   - Detailed RBC calculation worksheets showing C1/C2/C3/C4 risk component breakdowns
   - Historical RBC trend analysis (5-year trajectory)
   - Management's internal RBC projections and stress test scenarios

2. **Nebraska DOI RBC Enforcement Precedent Unavailable:** Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-6016 imposes strict confidentiality on RBC data, preventing disclosure of:
   - Specific Company Action Level enforcement actions from 2019-2024
   - RBC Plan approval/rejection precedent
   - Director's informal guidance on capital injection structures
   - Actual timeline for Form A approvals involving sub-200% RBC targets

3. **Multi-State Licensing Action Data Gaps:** Non-domiciliary state responses to sub-200% RBC acquirers are generally non-public unless escalated to formal administrative proceedings. Probability assessments (40-60% for licensing restrictions) based on:
   - General NAIC coordination principles
   - Economic significance of lead state determinations
   - Expert judgment absent comprehensive data

4. **Tax Treatment of Surplus Notes - IRS Uncertainty:** Whether IRS will respect debt characterization for 30-60 year surplus notes depends on facts and circumstances analysis under Section 385 regulations and case law. No definitive ruling or private letter ruling precedent for LLIC-specific structure. Actual tax treatment should be confirmed via:
   - Tax opinion from national tax counsel
   - Potential IRS private letter ruling request
   - Analysis of acquirer's specific capital structure and business purpose

5. **Financial Exposure Quantification - Wide Confidence Intervals:** $584M probability-weighted regulatory burden estimate aggregates multiple sub-estimates with varying confidence levels:
   - Capital injection requirement ($150M-$610M range): HIGH confidence in calculation methodology; LOW confidence in target RBC selection (203% vs. 250%)
   - Forced asset sales losses ($0-$200M range): LOW confidence (depends on LLIC's actual NAIC 5-6 bond holdings and market conditions at liquidation)
   - Lost revenue from business restrictions ($0-$300M range): LOW confidence (depends on which states impose restrictions and duration)
   - Rating downgrade business impact ($100M-$500M range): MEDIUM confidence (based on industry lapse rate studies following downgrades)

6. **Date Range Limitations:**
   - Nebraska statutes current as of 2024 codification
   - NAIC guidance reflects 2025 framework
   - Precedent transactions limited to publicly disclosed acquisitions (Midwest Holding 2023; BCBSNE 2018)
   - No access to confidential Form A filings or Director approval orders from 2019-2024

7. **Reinsurance Covenant Data Unavailable:** Analysis assumes LLIC's reinsurance agreements may contain RBC-based financial covenants but cannot quantify specific exposure without:
   - Review of actual reinsurance treaty agreements
   - Identification of RBC trigger levels (e.g., <150%, <175%, <200%)
   - Quantification of collateral posting or termination financial impact

8. **Rating Agency Methodology Proprietary:** While AM Best publicly discloses surplus notes receive 90-95% capital credit, specific rating agency models for RBC sensitivity are proprietary. Downgrade probability (70-85%) based on:
   - Public AM Best rating criteria emphasizing RBC as key metric
   - Industry patterns (sub-200% RBC insurers typically rated B++ or below)
   - Expert judgment absent access to AM Best's internal rating committee deliberations

### Research Methodology Disclosure

- **High Probability (>75%):** Based on statutory certainty or near-universal regulatory practice (e.g., Director will require RBC Plan at Company Action Level)
- **Medium Probability (40-75%):** Based on limited precedent, regulatory discretion, and expert judgment (e.g., Form A approval probability with strong capital commitment)
- **Low Probability (<40%):** Based on adverse scenario analysis or limited data (e.g., multi-state licensing restrictions probability)

**Financial Exposure Quantification Methodology:**
- **Point Estimates:** Derived from mathematical formulas (e.g., RBC ratio calculation) or statutory provisions (e.g., 2% guaranty fund assessment cap)
- **Range Estimates:** Established through best-case/worst-case scenario modeling (e.g., $150M-$610M capital injection requirement)
- **Probability-Weighted Estimates:** Calculated as: (Low Estimate × Low Scenario Probability) + (Mid Estimate × Mid Scenario Probability) + (High Estimate × High Scenario Probability)
