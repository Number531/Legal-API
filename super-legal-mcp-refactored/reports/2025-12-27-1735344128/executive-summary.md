**Matter**: Project Icarus - Global Aviation Holdings Acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines
**Prepared for**: Global Aviation Holdings LLC Board of Directors
**Transaction Value**: $2.8 Billion (Headline) / $2.4 Billion (Recommended Adjusted Price)
**Date**: December 27, 2025

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS**

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

- **Recommendation**: PROCEED with the acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines at an adjusted purchase price of $2.4 billion (14.3% discount from $2.8B headline), subject to five non-waivable closing conditions and a layered risk protection structure totaling $1.23 billion.
- **Primary Basis**: While quantified risk exposure of $612 million (21.9% of purchase price) is material, the transaction remains commercially viable due to (a) strategic value of irreplaceable LGA/DCA slot portfolio ($304M), (b) established CPA relationships with United/Delta/American generating $1.74B annual revenue, and (c) robust risk allocation framework that preserves buyer optionality through MAE walk-away rights.
- **Immediate Action Required**: Within 7-14 days, obtain complete United/Delta/American CPA contracts to verify cost pass-through provisions; this determination is **dispositive** of transaction economics given $162M Year 1 ALPA labor cost increase.

### Rationale

The legal due diligence analysis across ten specialist domains identifies a **probability-weighted mean exposure of $612 million** (see **Section IV.I Financial Impact Analysis**), driven principally by three critical risk categories: (1) United Airlines CPA consent uncertainty representing $430.8M expected value (70.4% of total exposure); (2) ALPA pilot contract settlement costs of $162M Year 1 (26.5% of total exposure); and (3) labor strike risk contributing $69.6M expected value (11.4% of total exposure). The comprehensive regulatory pathway analysis (see **Sections IV.A Aviation Regulatory** and **Section IV.C Foreign Ownership**) confirms high probability (85-95%) of obtaining required FAA Part 119 certificate transfer and DOT fitness certification, though CPPIB's 30% equity stake necessitates governance restructuring to satisfy 49 U.S.C. Section 40102(a)(15) foreign ownership limitations.

The transaction structure recommended in **Section IV.J** addresses these exposures through a four-component hybrid mechanism: (a) $400M base price reduction reflecting 65% of expected exposure; (b) $500M CPA consent escrow with staggered release tied to United/Delta/American consent milestones; (c) $0-$180M ALPA Settlement Adjustment Payment (ASAP) holdback capping buyer exposure to labor cost overruns; and (d) $150M indemnification framework covering residual identified risks. This architecture provides maximum $1.23 billion downside protection (43.9% of base purchase price) while allowing seller to achieve premium outcome ($3.08B total payment in bull case) if risks are successfully mitigated.

Delaware MAE precedent under *Akorn, Inc. v. Fresenius Kabi AG* (see **Section IV.H MAE Analysis**) confirms that United CPA consent denial would constitute a clear Material Adverse Effect (80-90% probability), entitling GAH to terminate without penalty. This legal optionality is preserved by ensuring the MAE definition does NOT carve out "failure to obtain third-party consents" and that United CPA consent serves as both a non-waivable closing condition AND an MAE trigger.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **United Airlines CPA Consent** - See **Section IV.B Section 3.2** and **Section IV.J Section C.1**: Written consent from United obtained within 9-month Outside Date; consent conditions must not reduce CPA NPV by more than $50M or impose parent guarantee exceeding $100M

2. **CPPIB DOT Restructuring** - See **Section IV.C Section B.3**: CPPIB provides advance written consent to LLC Agreement amendment reducing voting rights to 19.9% and eliminating three veto rights (capital structure, asset sales, new debt); 75-85% probability DOT requires this restructuring

3. **FAA Certificate Transfer Approval** - See **Section IV.A Section C**: FAA Part 119 certificate transfer obtained within 150-210 day timeline; management team qualifications (Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, Director of Maintenance) must meet 14 C.F.R. Section 119.67 requirements

4. **MAE Definition Integrity** - See **Section IV.H Section E.1**: Purchase Agreement MAE definition must NOT carve out United CPA consent as "disclosed matter" or "known risk"; buyer walk-away right preserved if consent denied

5. **CPA Cost Pass-Through Verification** - See **Section IV.B Section D.4** and **Section IV.J Section C.2**: Complete United/Delta/American CPAs obtained within 7-14 days to verify labor cost escalation provisions; if no pass-through exists, purchase price requires additional $200-$300M reduction or transaction termination

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. United CPA Consent Cascade (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

The United Airlines Capacity Purchase Agreement representing 46% of Target revenue ($850M annually) creates cascading effects across six legal domains, making CPA consent the single most critical path dependency for transaction success.

**Primary Finding** (see **Section IV.B Section 3.2**):
United holds contractual right to consent or deny GAH's change-of-control under CPA assignment provisions. Based on Republic Airways/Mesa Air Group precedent (United consented November 2025 with 10-year term extension), baseline probability of consent is 70-80%. However, consent denial (20-30% probability) triggers catastrophic revenue loss: $850M annual revenue x 5.206 present value factor (8% discount, 7-year remaining term to 2033) = **$4.425 billion NPV exposure**.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:

1. **MAE Analysis (Section IV.H Section 3.1)**: United CPA consent denial constitutes clear Material Adverse Effect under Delaware *Akorn* precedent with 80-90% probability. The 46% revenue loss materially exceeds *Akorn*'s 25% threshold; loss is "durationally significant" (7+ years permanent); and effect is company-specific (GAH acquisition triggers consent, not industry conditions). Buyer obtains termination right under Article 9.1(b) without penalty.

2. **Transaction Structure (Section IV.J Section C.1)**: Requires $500M dedicated CPA consent escrow with staggered release: $300M upon United consent (6-9 months post-signing), $150M upon Delta/American consents (9-12 months), $50M upon 24-month CPA performance verification. Buyer retains escrow if consent denied or conditions exceed $50M NPV impact.

3. **Securities Disclosure (Section IV.G Section 4.1)**: Creates Item 303(a) MD&A disclosure obligation under Regulation S-K. Both SkyWest (pre-closing 8-Ks) and GAH (if SEC registrant) must disclose "known trends" that CPA consent is pending and failure to obtain consent would materially impact business. Failure to adequately disclose concentration risk could constitute material misstatement under Rule 10b-5.

4. **Aviation Regulatory (Section IV.A Section D)**: United may condition CPA consent on FAA certificate transfer approval, creating sequential dependency. If United requires GAH to demonstrate operational continuity (FAA-approved management team, OpSpecs compliance), consent timeline extends by 90-120 days beyond FAA approval. Modified parallel processing recommended: initiate United negotiations immediately, delay FAA application until Month 3 when consent probability can be assessed.

5. **Financial Impact (Section IV.I Section B.2)**: CPA loss eliminates 46% revenue base, rendering acquisition unviable at any price. EBITDA impact: $285M baseline EBITDA x 46% = $131M annual EBITDA loss; pro forma EBITDA falls to $154M. At $2.4B purchase price, implied multiple increases from 8.4x to 15.6x EBITDA - clearly uneconomic.

6. **Employment/Labor (Section IV.F Section D)**: United CPA contract loss triggers WARN Act obligations if resulting layoffs exceed 500 employees or 33% of workforce. 60-day advance notice required; potential $500/day per employee penalty for violation. Additionally, CPA loss creates 0.6 correlation with increased strike probability - pilot morale deterioration doubles strike risk from baseline 3.5% to 8-12%.

**Board-Level Implication**: United CPA consent is THE transaction-determinative dependency. The recommended structure (see **Section IV.J**) addresses this through:
- Non-waivable closing condition requiring United consent within 9-month Outside Date
- $500M dedicated escrow with buyer retention rights if consent denied
- MAE definition explicitly including United CPA consent denial (NOT carved out as "disclosed matter")
- Seller covenant to use commercially reasonable efforts with specific obligations (CEO-to-CCO engagement, CPA term extension offer to 2040)

### B. Labor Relations Cascade (SECOND HIGHEST PRIORITY)

ALPA collective bargaining agreement expiration on December 31, 2026 (12 months post-expected Q2 2026 closing) creates compounding risk across transaction timeline and CPA relationships.

**Primary Finding** (see **Section IV.F Section 2.1**):
- CBA expires December 31, 2026 with 2,800 ALPA pilots (34% of 8,200 workforce)
- Negotiations commenced August 2024; reached impasse January 2026
- 87% strike authorization vote already obtained (2,436 of 2,800 pilots)
- Railway Labor Act minimum timeline: 23 months from impasse (January 2026) to legal strike authority = earliest strike December 2027
- Industry pattern bargaining establishes 28-35% pay increase as market-clearing rate
- Year 1 settlement cost projected: $150M-$180M (midpoint: $162M)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:

1. **Financial Impact (Section IV.I Section C.1)**: $162M Year 1 cost includes: $113M incremental annual payroll (30% x $378M current pilot payroll), $30M signing bonus, $19M retroactive pay. Annual run-rate stabilizes at $110M-$115M in Years 2-5. NPV over 5 years at 8% discount: $497M. EBITDA margin compression: 15.4% to 14.0% (-1.4 percentage points).

2. **MAE Analysis (Section IV.H Section 4.1)**: Pattern bargaining labor cost increase standing alone does NOT constitute MAE under *IBP v. Tyson Foods* industry-wide effects exception - all regional carriers face identical ALPA pattern (Republic, Endeavor, GoJet, Mesa). Probability labor costs alone = MAE: 10-20%. However, strike exceeding 30 days likely constitutes MAE if causing operational shutdown.

3. **Transaction Structure (Section IV.J Section C.2)**: ALPA Settlement Adjustment Payment (ASAP) holdback mechanism: If Year 1 cost is at or below $150M, seller receives $180M; if cost is at or above $180M, seller receives $0; linear interpolation between thresholds. This caps buyer exposure while preserving seller upside if settlement favorable.

4. **United CPA Consent (Section IV.B Section 3.3)**: United may withhold consent until ALPA contract ratified (precedent: Mesa Air 2010). Strike or prolonged negotiations signal operational instability; United has historical practice of requiring labor peace as consent condition. Creates potential sequential dependency extending consent timeline.

5. **Securities Disclosure (Section IV.G Section 4.2)**: 87% strike authorization vote requires Item 103 legal proceedings disclosure in proxy materials and 8-K filings. Risk factor disclosure must quantify potential strike impact ($42.5M for 30-day; $545M for 90-day).

6. **CPA Cost Pass-Through (Section IV.B Section D.4)**: **CRITICAL DATA GAP** - Whether ALPA cost increase is economically absorbed by SkyWest/GAH or passed through to United depends entirely on CPA rate adjustment provisions. If CPAs permit cost pass-through: $113M annual cost is revenue-neutral (United bears cost). If CPAs have fixed rates: $113M compresses EBITDA by 40%, rendering transaction uneconomic. **Urgent pre-signing action**: Obtain complete CPAs within 7-14 days.

**Board-Level Implication**: Labor risk is manageable through the ASAP holdback structure ($0-$180M), but economic impact depends entirely on CPA cost pass-through provisions currently unknown. Recommend:
- Immediate CPA contract review as Tier 1 due diligence priority
- MAE definition includes "strike exceeding 30 days" but carves out "pattern bargaining cost increases affecting regional airline industry generally"
- Proactive ALPA engagement post-signing to accelerate contract ratification timeline

### C. Foreign Ownership / Regulatory Cascade

GAH's ownership structure (60% U.S. sponsors, 30% CPPIB, 10% European institutional) creates regulatory approval dependencies affecting transaction timeline and structure.

**Primary Finding** (see **Section IV.C Section B.1**):
- Total foreign voting equity: 40% (30% CPPIB + 10% European)
- Statutory limit under 49 U.S.C. Section 40102(a)(15): 25% foreign voting equity
- **GAH EXCEEDS statutory limit by 15 percentage points**
- CPPIB holds three veto rights: (1) capital structure changes, (2) major asset sales, (3) new debt issuance
- Under *Virgin America* DOT precedent (2016), veto rights trigger "actual control" analysis
- DOT restructuring probability: 75-85%

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:

1. **DOT Fitness Timeline (Section IV.C Section E.1)**: If DOT requires CPPIB restructuring, fitness review extends from 60-90 days baseline to 120-270 days. Added 60-120 day delay to critical path if restructuring occurs reactively (during DOT review) rather than proactively (before signing).

2. **Transaction Structure (Section IV.J Section D.1)**: CPPIB must provide advance written consent to LLC Agreement amendment before Purchase Agreement signing. Amendment reduces CPPIB voting equity to 19.9% (below 25% threshold) and eliminates three veto rights, converting to observer-only governance.

3. **FAA Certificate Transfer (Section IV.A Section D.2)**: FAA coordinates with DOT on citizenship determination. FAA Part 119 certificate transfer (150-210 days) cannot complete until DOT confirms citizenship compliance. Sequential dependency: DOT approval must precede FAA final approval.

4. **Financial Impact (Section IV.I Section D.1)**: Direct restructuring costs: $5M-$15M (legal, advisory, CPPIB negotiations). Indirect cost: Timeline delay potentially triggers acquisition agreement Outside Date extension fees ($2M-$5M per 30-day extension).

5. **CPPIB Economics (Section IV.C Section E.2)**: To secure CPPIB consent to governance reduction, GAH may need to offer enhanced economics: liquidation preference, anti-dilution protection, preferred dividend rights. These concessions reduce returns to U.S. sponsors.

**Board-Level Implication**: CPPIB restructuring is highly probable (75-85%) but manageable through proactive approach. Recommend:
- Execute CPPIB LLC Agreement Amendment BEFORE signing Purchase Agreement
- Engage DOT pre-filing consultation within 30 days to clarify specific restructuring requirements
- Timeline assumption: 60-90 day DOT process if proactive; 120-270 days if reactive

### D. Airport Slots / Valuation Cascade

LGA/DCA slot portfolio represents significant strategic asset value but requires FAA transfer approval and proper ASC 805 purchase price allocation.

**Primary Finding** (see **Section IV.D Section B.1**):
- LaGuardia (LGA): 32 slot pairs valued at $208M baseline ($6.5M per pair)
- Reagan National (DCA): 24 slot pairs valued at $96M baseline ($4.0M per pair)
- **Total slot portfolio: $304M (10.9% of $2.8B purchase price)**
- Slots are irreplaceable assets - no new slots created at capacity-controlled airports
- FAA slot transfer requires Part 93 compliance and citizenship verification

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:

1. **Purchase Price Allocation (Section IV.G Section A.2)**: Under ASC 805, slots must be separately identified and valued as intangible assets. $304M slot allocation creates 15-year straight-line amortization deduction = $20.3M annual tax benefit (at 26% combined rate) = $154M NPV tax value.

2. **FAA Slot Transfer (Section IV.D Section C.1)**: FAA must approve transfer under 14 C.F.R. Part 93 following certificate transfer. Timeline: 60-90 days post-FAA Part 119 approval. Slot transfer is ministerial if buyer meets citizenship and operating carrier requirements.

3. **JetBlue Dispute Analysis (Section IV.E Section B.1)**: Comprehensive research confirmed **NO ACTUAL DISPUTE EXISTS** between SkyWest and JetBlue regarding slot leases. SkyWest operates using mainline carrier slots (United, Delta, American hold FAA allocations); SkyWest does not lease slots from JetBlue. Transaction risk: $0.

4. **Slot Usage Requirements (Section IV.D Section C.2)**: FAA requires 80% slot usage over 2-month periods under 14 C.F.R. Section 93.227. Post-closing operational disruption (e.g., strike) could trigger slot recall if usage falls below threshold for extended period. Mitigation: FAA provides exceptions for strikes and "highly unusual conditions."

**Board-Level Implication**: Slot portfolio is strategic asset justifying premium valuation but requires integration planning. Recommend:
- Engage aviation valuation specialist (Duff & Phelps, Houlihan Lokey) for defensible slot valuation
- Monitor post-closing operational stability to maintain 80% usage requirement
- FAA slot transfer application filed concurrently with Part 119 certificate transfer

### E. Securities / Corporate Governance Cascade

Multiple disclosure obligations arise from transaction risks identified across all domains.

**Primary Finding** (see **Section IV.G Section A.1**):
- SkyWest, Inc. is publicly traded (NASDAQ: SKYW, CIK 0000793733)
- Material transaction triggers Item 303 MD&A, Item 1A Risk Factors, Item 103 Legal Proceedings disclosure obligations
- Post-acquisition leverage (65% debt, 1.86:1 debt-to-equity) affects DOT working capital adequacy

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:

1. **Item 303 MD&A (Section IV.G Section 4.1)**: Known trends requiring disclosure: (a) United CPA consent uncertainty (46% revenue concentration), (b) ALPA contract expiration December 31, 2026, (c) 87% strike authorization vote, (d) CPPIB foreign ownership restructuring requirement.

2. **DOT Working Capital (Section IV.G Section C.1)**: DOT requires 3 months operating expenses in working capital. SkyWest quarterly operating expenses: $160M x 3 = $480M minimum working capital. Post-acquisition debt of $1.82B creates $88M-$106M annual debt service, potentially straining working capital below DOT threshold. May require $100M-$200M additional equity injection.

3. **Credit Rating Impact (Section IV.G Section C.2)**: Addition of $1.402B ASC 842 lease liability to GAH's balance sheet may trigger credit rating downgrade from BBB- to BB+/BB. Downgrade increases borrowing costs 150-250 bps and complicates lessor consent negotiations.

4. **Proxy Disclosure (Section IV.G Section 4.3)**: SkyWest shareholder approval requires proxy statement with comprehensive risk factor disclosure. Inadequate disclosure of CPA consent risk, labor strike risk, or foreign ownership restructuring could expose directors to securities fraud claims under Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5.

**Board-Level Implication**: Disclosure obligations require careful coordination. Recommend:
- Engage securities counsel to review all proxy materials and 8-K filings for adequate risk disclosure
- Verify DOT working capital adequacy before signing; inject additional equity if necessary
- Consider impact of ASC 842 lease liability on credit facilities and negotiate covenant amendments pre-signing

### F. MAE Definition / Transaction Structure Cascade

The Material Adverse Effect definition in the Purchase Agreement allocates fundamental transaction risks and determines buyer walk-away optionality.

**Primary Finding** (see **Section IV.H Section E.1**):
- Delaware courts apply demanding two-prong test: (1) materiality and (2) durational significance (5+ years per *Bardy Diagnostics*)
- *Akorn* is only successful MAE defense in Delaware history (25% revenue decline, 86% EBITDA decline)
- United CPA loss (46% revenue) clearly exceeds *Akorn* thresholds: 80-90% MAE probability
- Labor cost increase alone: 10-20% MAE probability (industry-wide exception applies)
- 30-day strike: 5-10% MAE probability (temporary disruption under *IBP*)
- 90-day strike causing CPA termination: 70-85% MAE probability (permanent consequence)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:

1. **Closing Conditions (Section IV.J Section D.1)**: MAE is non-waivable closing condition under Article 7.2(a)(ii). If MAE occurs between signing and closing, buyer may terminate without penalty and receive deposit return.

2. **Escrow Release (Section IV.J Section C.1)**: CPA consent escrow release conditioned on absence of MAE. If United imposes consent conditions exceeding thresholds (>$50M NPV impact, >$100M guarantee), conditions constitute MAE triggering escrow retention.

3. **Seller Representations (Section IV.J Section F.1)**: Seller represents no MAE has occurred as of signing date and no events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in MAE. Breach of MAE representation entitles buyer to indemnification.

4. **Risk Allocation Philosophy (Section IV.J Section B.1)**: MAE definition must NOT carve out "failure to obtain third-party consents" - this would eliminate buyer protection for 46% revenue concentration risk. MAE definition SHOULD carve out "changes in labor market conditions affecting airline industry generally" - prevents seller from arguing routine pattern bargaining constitutes MAE excuse.

**Recommended MAE Definition Language** (see **Section IV.H Section E.1** for complete draft):
```
Material Adverse Effect shall EXPRESSLY INCLUDE:
(i) Loss or denial of change-of-control consent for any CPA representing 30%+ of revenue;
(ii) Strike lasting more than 30 days involving more than 50% of pilot workforce;
(iii) EBITDA decline exceeding 25% measured quarterly.

Material Adverse Effect shall NOT INCLUDE:
(i) Changes in labor market conditions affecting airline industry generally;
(ii) Pilot labor cost increases of 30% or less reflecting industry pattern bargaining;
(iii) Matters disclosed in Disclosure Schedules [LIMITED EXCEPTION].
```

**Board-Level Implication**: MAE definition drafting is transaction-determinative. Reject any seller attempt to carve out United CPA consent as "disclosed matter" or "known risk" - this would eliminate buyer's principal protection against 46% revenue concentration exposure.

| **Delta/American CPA Consent** | 3-4 months (after United) | 4-6 months | 80-85% each | United approval as leverage |
| **Aircraft Lessor Consents** | 5-9 months (rolling) | 9-12 months | 80-85% aggregate | Credit review; closing condition: 100/120 |

### Critical Path Analysis

**Optimistic Scenario (25% probability)**: All approvals obtained within 7-8 months
- Month 1: HSR filed; CPPIB Amendment executed; DOT pre-filing consultation
- Months 2-4: DOT citizenship/fitness approval (60-90 days)
- Months 3-5: FAA Part 119 approval (90-120 days, parallel with DOT)
- Months 4-6: United CPA consent obtained
- Months 5-7: FAA slot transfers; Delta/American consents
- Month 8: Closing

**Base Case Scenario (60% probability)**: All approvals obtained within 9-10 months
- Month 1: HSR filed; CPPIB Amendment executed; DOT pre-filing consultation
- Months 2-5: DOT citizenship/fitness approval (extended due to CPPIB review)
- Months 4-6: FAA Part 119 approval
- Months 4-8: United CPA consent negotiations
- Months 7-9: FAA slot transfers; Delta/American consents; lessor consents finalized
- Month 9-10: Closing

**Extended Scenario (15% probability)**: Complications extend to 11-12 months
- DOT requires CPPIB restructuring during review (+60-120 days)
- United consent delayed by FAA dependency (+30-60 days)
- Outside Date extension required (+30-60 days)

**9-Month Outside Date** (see **Section IV.J Section H**) accommodates base case timeline with 30-day buffer. Buyer extension right (+90 days) provides protection for extended scenario without requiring renegotiation.

### Approval Probability Matrix

| Agency | Unconditional Approval | Conditional Approval | Denial Risk | Key Risk Factors |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------|
| HSR (FTC/DOJ) | 90% | 5% (behavioral remedies) | 5% | Regional airline sector concentration (de minimis) |
| DOT Citizenship | 15-25% | 75-85% (CPPIB restructure) | 0% | CPPIB veto rights trigger *Virgin America* analysis |
| DOT Fitness | 70-80% | 20-30% (monitoring) | 0% | Working capital adequacy; management qualifications |
| FAA Part 119 | 85-90% | 10-15% (conditional OpSpecs) | 5-10% | Management qualifications; compliance history |
| Airport Slots | 90-95% | 5-10% | 0-5% | Citizenship; slot usage history |
| United CPA | 55-60% | 20-25% (conditions <$50M NPV) | 20-30% | GAH creditworthiness; term extension negotiations |
| Delta/American CPA | 75-80% | 10-15% | 10-15% | Sequential after United; lower concentration |

## VI. FINANCIAL IMPACT SYNTHESIS

### Probability-Weighted Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Total 5-Year NPV Exposure | Effective Price to Seller | Buyer All-In Cost | IRR |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Bull Case** | 25% | $419M | $3,080M (+10% premium) | $3,499M | 12-14% |
| **Base Case** | 60% | $469M | $2,995M (+7% premium) | $3,464M | 11-13% |
| **Bear Case** | 15% | $1,032M | $1,900M (-32% discount) | $2,932M | 14.7%* |

*Counterintuitive: Bear case produces highest IRR because heavily discounted purchase price ($1.9B effective) more than compensates for degraded business performance.

### Component Breakdown of $612M Expected Exposure

| Risk Category | Gross Exposure | Probability | Expected Value | % of Total |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| United CPA Consent | $4,425M (7-year NPV) | 25% denial | $430.8M | 70.4% |
| ALPA Settlement Year 1 | $162M | 90% | $145.8M | 23.8% |
| 90-Day Strike | $545M | 12.5% | $68.1M | 11.1% |
| Fleet Rationalization | $106M | 55% | $58.3M | 9.5% |
| Other Quantified Risks | $82M aggregate | Various | $40M | 6.5% |
| **Subtotal (Gross)** | | | **$743M** | 121.3%** |
| Less: Correlation Adjustment | | | -$131M | -21.3% |
| **TOTAL EXPECTED VALUE** | | | **$612M** | 100.0% |

**Note: Sum exceeds 100% before correlation adjustment because risks are not independent; 0.6 correlation between CPA denial and strike probability reduces combined expected value.

### Pro Forma Financial Impact (Base Case)

| Metric | Pre-Transaction | Post-Transaction (Year 2) | Change |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Revenue | $1,850M | $1,850M | 0% |
| Pilot Labor Cost | $378M | $491M | +$113M (+29.9%) |
| EBITDA | $285M | $259M | -$26M (-9.1%) |
| EBITDA Margin | 15.4% | 14.0% | -1.4 ppt |
| Debt/EBITDA | N/A | 6.8x | Aggressive |

### Recommended Purchase Price Structure

| Component | Amount | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Cash at Closing** | $2,400,000,000 | Base purchase price (-$400M from $2.8B) |
| **CPA Consent Escrow** | $500,000,000 | Staggered release: $300M (United), $150M (Delta/American), $50M (performance) |
| **ASAP Holdback** | $0-$180,000,000 | Performance-based: $180M if ALPA cost <=$150M; $0 if >=$180M |
| **Maximum Total** | $3,080,000,000 | Bull case (all escrows released, full ASAP paid) |
| **Expected Total** | $2,867,000,000 | Probability-weighted payment to seller |
| **Minimum Total** | $1,900,000,000 | Bear case (escrow retention, no ASAP) |

## VII. RISK ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK

### Layered Protection Strategy

| Risk Category | Mechanism | Buyer Protection | Cap/Limit |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **United CPA Consent** | $500M escrow + MAE walk-away | Retains $300M if denied; terminates if MAE | $300M retention |
| **Delta/American CPA** | $150M escrow tranche | Retains $75M each if denied | $150M combined |
| **ALPA Labor Costs** | $0-$180M ASAP holdback | Only pays if cost <=$150M; partial if $150M-$180M | $180M cap |
| **Known Litigation** | Indemnification + escrow | Seller pays settlements above basket | $150M general cap |
| **R&W Breaches** | $150M indemnification cap | 24-36 month survival; $12M tipping basket | $150M cap |
| **Fundamental Reps** | 6-year survival; no cap | Full purchase price recovery for fraud | $2.4B |
| **Unknown Liabilities** | R&W insurance (optional) | 6-year coverage; $150M policy | $150M policy |
| **Regulatory Denial** | Closing condition + MAE | Walk-away + deposit return | No breakup fee |

**Aggregate Buyer Protection**: $500M (CPA escrow) + $180M (ASAP) + $150M (indemnity) + $150M (R&W insurance optional) = **$980M-$1,130M at-risk capital**

### Risk Allocation Philosophy

- **Seller Retains**: Known material risks with quantifiable exposure (United CPA consent, ALPA labor settlement)
- **Buyer Accepts**: Industry-wide risks and base case operational costs (priced into $2.4B valuation)
- **Escrow Allocates**: Binary outcome risks where probability is uncertain but impact is quantifiable (CPA consent yes/no)
- **Insurance Covers**: Unknown R&W breaches discovered post-closing; tail risk beyond indemnification cap

## VIII. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

### Non-Negotiable Positions (Walk-Away Triggers)

| Issue | Walk-Away Trigger | Rationale | Section Reference |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| United CPA MAE carve-out | Seller demands CPA consent carved out of MAE definition | 46% revenue concentration requires walk-away protection | Section IV.H Section E.1 |
| CPA Escrow below $400M | Seller refuses escrow or demands <$400M | $430.8M expected value requires minimum coverage | Section IV.J Section C.1 |
| CPPIB restructuring | CPPIB refuses DOT governance rights reduction | 75-85% DOT restructuring probability makes deal-blocking | Section IV.C Section E.1 |
| Outside Date <8 months | Seller demands 6-month outside date without extension | 90-120 day FAA + 60-180 day United CPA = 7-10 months minimum | Section IV.J Section H |
| Price reduction <$300M | Seller refuses any adjustment despite $612M exposure | $612M quantified exposure requires meaningful discount | Section IV.J Section B.1 |

### Negotiable Positions (Room for Compromise)

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section Reference |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Base purchase price | $2.35B | $2.40B | $2.50B | Section IV.J Section B.1 |
| CPA escrow total | $550M | $500M | $450M | Section IV.J Section C.1 |
| ASAP cap | $200M | $180M | $150M | Section IV.J Section C.2 |
| Indemnification basket | $10M | $12M | $18M (0.75% of price) | Section IV.J Section F.1 |
| Indemnification cap | $175M | $150M | $125M | Section IV.J Section F.1 |
| Outside date | 10 months | 9 months | 7 months + 90-day extension | Section IV.J Section H |

### Anticipated Seller Counter-Positions

| Seller Argument | GAH Response |
|-----------------|--------------|
| "United CPA consent is a disclosed risk; should be carved out of MAE" | Knowledge of risk is not knowledge of occurrence; *Akorn* permits MAE even for known risk categories if actual event materializes; 46% concentration requires protection |
| "ALPA labor costs are industry-wide; cannot justify price reduction" | Industry-wide nature is precisely why labor costs are carved out of MAE but addressed through ASAP mechanism; unknown CPA pass-through provisions create genuine bilateral uncertainty |
| "$500M escrow is excessive; reduces seller liquidity" | $500M = 29% of $1.74B annual CPA revenue at risk; seller can monetize escrow through interest accrual; alternative is $640M escrow at $2.5B price |
| "9-month outside date is too long; seller needs certainty" | FAA certificate (150 days) + DOT fitness (90 days) + United consent (180 days) = 7-10 months sequential; 9 months with extension provides responsible buffer |
| "14% price reduction is punitive; market premium justified" | 14% discount reflects 65% of $612M expected value; remaining 35% covered by escrow mechanisms; seller achieves $3.08B in bull case (10% premium) |

## X. DECISION REQUIRED

```
DECISION REQUIRED: Board authorization to execute Purchase Agreement
DECISION-MAKER: GAH Board of Directors
DEADLINE: [To be determined based on LOI exclusivity expiration]

OPTIONS:

OPTION A: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS (RECOMMENDED)
- Execute Purchase Agreement at $2.4B base price
- Implement four-component risk allocation structure
- Condition on United CPA consent within 9-month Outside Date
- Condition on CPPIB restructuring before signing
- Risk: $612M expected exposure with layered protections
- Benefit: Acquire strategic regional airline platform; irreplaceable slot portfolio
- Status: RECOMMENDED

OPTION B: RENEGOTIATE FOR DEEPER DISCOUNT
- Demand $2.2B base price (-21% from headline)
- Increase CPA escrow to $640M
- Risk: Seller walks; transaction fails
- Benefit: Additional $200M downside protection
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (seller unlikely to accept)

OPTION C: TERMINATE NEGOTIATIONS
- Invoke due diligence findings as basis for termination
- Return deposit; no breakup fee
- Risk: Lose strategic opportunity; slot portfolio to competitor
- Benefit: Avoid $612M expected exposure
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (risks manageable with proper structure)

RECOMMENDED: Option A
Rationale: Transaction is commercially viable at $2.4B with layered risk protections.
Strategic value of LGA/DCA slots ($304M) and established CPA relationships justifies
acceptance of manageable quantified risks. MAE walk-away right preserves optionality
if United CPA consent denied (80-90% probability of successful MAE defense).

## XII. CLOSING STATEMENT

This acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines presents **strategic value** with **manageable but material risks**. The recommended $2.4 billion purchase price (14.3% discount from $2.8 billion headline) reflects comprehensive quantification of $612 million probability-weighted exposure across regulatory, commercial, labor, and litigation domains.

**The transaction is viable ONLY IF:**

1. **United Airlines consents to CPA assignment** (70-80% baseline probability) - This is the transaction-determinative dependency. The recommended structure preserves buyer walk-away rights through both non-waivable closing condition AND MAE definition inclusion. If United denies consent, Delaware courts will find MAE with 80-90% probability under *Akorn* precedent.

2. **CPPIB accepts DOT-required governance restructuring** (90% probability with proactive approach) - Execute LLC Agreement Amendment before signing Purchase Agreement to eliminate 60-120 day delay risk and demonstrate DOT compliance commitment.

3. **Buyer retains walk-away optionality** through properly structured MAE definition - Do NOT permit seller to carve out United CPA consent as "disclosed matter." The 46% revenue concentration requires protection; knowledge of risk is not knowledge of occurrence.

4. **Layered escrows and holdbacks ($680M-$860M) protect against quantified downside** - CPA consent escrow ($500M), ASAP holdback ($0-$180M), and indemnification ($150M cap) provide $830M-$980M aggregate protection against identified risks.

**Base case IRR of 11-13%** remains acceptable under $2.4B pricing assuming United consent obtained and ALPA settlement within $180M Year 1 cost threshold.

**Bear case exposure ($505M-$575M)** is manageable through escrow retention and indemnification claims.

**Worst case scenarios (10% probability tail risk)** are protected via MAE walk-away rights that preserve buyer optionality without closing obligation.

**RECOMMENDATION**: The Board should authorize execution of the Purchase Agreement with the conditions outlined above, enabling management to proceed with definitive negotiations while preserving deal optionality through the robust risk allocation framework developed in this memorandum.
