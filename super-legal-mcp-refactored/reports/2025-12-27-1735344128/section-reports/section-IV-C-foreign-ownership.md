## IV.C. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP & DOT FITNESS

### A. Legal Framework

#### 1. Statutory Citizenship Requirements: 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15)

The Federal Aviation Act imposes strict foreign ownership limitations on U.S. air carriers. To qualify as a "citizen of the United States" eligible to hold a Part 119 operating certificate, a corporation must satisfy three independent requirements under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15):¹

**First**: The corporation must be organized under the laws of the United States or a State.

**Second**: No more than 25% of the corporation's voting stock may be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons who are not citizens of the United States.²

**Third**: At least 75% of the corporation's total equity must be owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.³

**Fourth**: The president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and other managing officers must be U.S. citizens.⁴

**Fifth**: The corporation must be under the "actual control" of citizens of the United States.⁵

These requirements are conjunctive—failure to satisfy any single element renders the corporation ineligible for U.S. air carrier certification. The statutory framework reflects longstanding Congressional policy dating to the Air Commerce Act of 1926 that commercial aviation operations serving the U.S. market must remain under U.S. citizen control for national security, economic sovereignty, and reciprocity considerations.⁶

#### 2. The "Actual Control" Doctrine

The fifth statutory requirement—that the corporation be under the "actual control" of U.S. citizens—constitutes a substantive test that extends beyond the numerical ownership percentages specified in elements two and three. The Department of Transportation has consistently interpreted "actual control" to require a holistic analysis of all governance mechanisms, special rights, and operational influence arrangements that could enable foreign investors to exert control over strategic or operational decisions.⁷

The DOT's "actual control" analysis examines:

**Board Composition and Dynamics**: Not merely counting U.S. versus foreign directors, but analyzing whether foreign investors possess mechanisms (board observers, information rights, executive session participation) that enable influence beyond their formal voting power.⁸

**Negative Control Through Veto Rights**: Whether foreign investors hold veto or consent rights over fundamental corporate actions including: (a) capital structure changes, (b) major asset sales or acquisitions, (c) debt issuances above specified thresholds, (d) amendments to organizational documents, (e) entry into new lines of business, or (f) appointment/removal of senior management.⁹

**Financing Arrangements**: Whether debt covenants, shareholder agreements, or financing terms grant foreign investors leverage over operational decisions through default remedies, financial reporting requirements, or approval rights for business plan deviations.¹⁰

**Management Relationships**: Whether senior officers have pre-existing business or personal relationships with foreign investors that could compromise their independence in exercising day-to-day operational control.¹¹

**Trademark and Intellectual Property Licensing**: Whether licensing agreements with foreign entities contain conditions, remedies, or approval requirements that enable the foreign licensor to influence operational decisions, marketing strategies, or network planning.¹²

The DOT's actual control analysis reflects the principle that foreign investors can exercise effective control through contractual mechanisms and special rights even when their formal equity ownership complies with statutory percentage limits. As one DOT order explained, "control can be exerted through means other than the direct ownership of stock," including "contractual arrangements" that give foreign investors "the ability to exert influence over decisions critical to the air carrier's operations."¹³

#### 3. Virgin America Precedent: DOT Docket OST-2005-20295 (2006-2007)

The DOT's 2006-2007 review of Virgin America's fitness application established the modern framework for analyzing foreign investor special rights under the actual control doctrine. The case provides direct precedent for evaluating governance structures where foreign investors hold minority equity stakes combined with board representation and protective provisions.

**Initial Application and Denial (December 27, 2006)**

Virgin America Inc. applied for a Part 119 certificate in 2005 with an ownership structure featuring:
- Virgin Group (UK entity controlled by Sir Richard Branson): 25% equity
- U.S. investors: 75% equity
- Virgin Group board representation: 2 of 8 directors (25% of board)
- Trademark license agreement: Virgin America licensed the "Virgin" brand from Virgin Group
- Financial arrangements: Virgin Group provided approximately $88 million (50%) of initial startup capital¹⁴

On December 27, 2006, the DOT issued Order 2006-12-27 tentatively denying Virgin America's fitness application.¹⁵ The order found that Virgin America was "actually controlled" by foreign citizens notwithstanding facial compliance with the 75% U.S. citizen total equity requirement. The DOT cited four primary concerns:

**First, Pervasive Foreign Involvement**: Virgin Group's role in founding Virgin America, providing 50% of startup capital, and maintaining ongoing trademark and strategic relationships created "pervasive involvement" in the airline's creation and operation.¹⁶

**Second, Board Observer and Information Rights**: Although Virgin Group held only 25% board representation (within proportional limits), the combination of board seats, information rights, and observer access to confidential deliberations enabled Virgin Group to exert influence beyond its formal voting power.¹⁷

**Third, Trademark License as Control Mechanism**: The Virgin trademark license agreement contained provisions requiring Virgin America to maintain certain operating standards, obtain approval for trademark usage in new markets, and coordinate brand strategy with Virgin Group. The DOT determined these provisions gave Virgin Group undue influence over operational and strategic decisions.¹⁸

**Fourth, Management Relationships**: Virgin America's CEO, Fred Reid, had prior professional relationships with Sir Richard Branson, raising DOT concerns about management independence.¹⁹

**Restructuring and Approval (May 18, 2007)**

Following the December 2006 denial, Virgin America restructured its ownership and governance:

- Virgin Group equity reduced from 25% to **22% total equity**²⁰
- Voting shares placed in **DOT-approved voting trust** with U.S. citizen trustees²¹
- Board representation reduced to **2 of 8 directors** with restrictions on participating in competitive and international route decisions²²
- **Trademark license renegotiated** to eliminate provisions requiring Virgin Group approval for operational decisions²³
- **Enhanced U.S. management authority** with documented independence from Virgin Group influence²⁴

On May 18, 2007, the DOT issued Order 2007-5-11 granting Virgin America's certificate.²⁵ The order found that the restructured arrangement ensured "actual control" by U.S. citizens, noting specifically that:

- Foreign equity below 25% combined with voting trust protections ensured U.S. citizens maintained voting control²⁶
- Elimination of trademark approval rights removed Virgin Group's ability to influence operational decisions²⁷
- Board restrictions prevented Virgin Group directors from participating in decisions where their interests conflicted with U.S. operational control²⁸
- U.S. management's documented independence satisfied the DOT's concerns about day-to-day control²⁹

**Precedential Significance**

The Virgin America case established six principles that govern DOT actual control analysis:

**Principle One**: Foreign equity ownership **approaching or exceeding 20-25%** of total equity triggers heightened DOT scrutiny even when within the statutory 49% limit for non-voting equity.³⁰

**Principle Two**: **Board observer seats**, even without voting rights, constitute influence mechanisms that the DOT scrutinizes under the actual control doctrine because observers receive confidential information and participate in strategic deliberations.³¹

**Principle Three**: **Veto or consent rights** over capital structure changes, major asset sales, debt issuances, or amendments to organizational documents constitute "negative control" that can render a corporation "actually controlled" by foreign citizens regardless of equity ownership percentages.³²

**Principle Four**: The DOT applies a **totality-of-circumstances test**, examining all governance rights, contractual arrangements, financing terms, and personal relationships to determine whether foreign investors possess the ability to influence strategic or operational decisions.³³

**Principle Five**: **Restructuring timelines matter**—Virgin America's restructuring from initial denial (December 2006) to final approval (May 2007) required approximately **five months**, during which the airline could not commence operations or execute its business plan.³⁴

**Principle Six**: The DOT will **negotiate informally** with applicants to restructure governance arrangements before issuing formal denial orders, but applicants bear the burden of demonstrating that their revised structure ensures actual control by U.S. citizens.³⁵

#### 4. DOT Fitness Certification Requirements: 14 CFR Part 204

Beyond citizenship requirements, the DOT must determine that an applicant for certificate transfer possesses adequate "fitness" to conduct air carrier operations. The fitness determination encompasses three independent criteria codified at 14 CFR § 204.3:³⁶

**Financial Fitness**: The applicant must demonstrate "adequate financial resources to conduct its proposed operations" and maintain sufficient working capital to ensure safe operations.³⁷ The DOT historically requires evidence of:
- Minimum working capital equivalent to **three months of operating expenses**³⁸
- Access to committed credit facilities or cash reserves to cover seasonal fluctuations³⁹
- Pro forma financial projections demonstrating positive operating cash flow within 12-18 months⁴⁰
- Debt service coverage ratios adequate to service acquisition financing without compromising operational investment⁴¹

**Compliance Disposition**: The applicant must demonstrate a "satisfactory compliance disposition," meaning the carrier and its management possess a history of compliance with DOT economic regulations, FAA safety regulations, and labor laws.⁴² Outstanding enforcement actions, unresolved violations, or patterns of regulatory non-compliance can result in fitness denial or conditions requiring corrective action before approval.⁴³

**Managerial Competence**: The applicant's management team must possess adequate qualifications and experience to conduct proposed operations safely and in compliance with applicable regulations.⁴⁴ The DOT examines:
- Aviation industry experience of proposed directors and officers⁴⁵
- Prior safety records and enforcement history of management personnel⁴⁶
- Adequacy of proposed organizational structure to ensure regulatory compliance⁴⁷
- Whether key management positions (Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, Director of Maintenance) will be filled by qualified individuals⁴⁸

The fitness determination is not a mere formality—the DOT has denied or conditioned fitness approvals where applicants failed to demonstrate adequate financial resources, possessed problematic compliance histories, or proposed management teams lacking aviation expertise.⁴⁹

#### 5. DOT Review Timeline and Process

DOT fitness reviews for change-of-control transactions typically follow this timeline:⁵⁰

**Pre-Filing Consultation (Optional but Recommended)**: 30-45 days for informal discussions with DOT Office of Aviation Consumer Protection regarding foreign ownership structure and anticipated issues.⁵¹

**Formal Application Preparation**: 30-60 days to compile required financial statements, pro forma projections, compliance certifications, management biographies, and supporting documentation per 14 CFR § 204.3 requirements.⁵²

**DOT Initial Review**: 30-60 days for DOT staff review of application completeness and preliminary issues identification.⁵³

**DOT Substantive Review**: 60-90 days for DOT analysis of citizenship compliance, financial fitness, compliance disposition, and managerial competence.⁵⁴

**Public Comment Period (if required)**: 30 days for competitor and public comment on applications deemed to raise significant competitive or policy issues.⁵⁵

**Total Base Case Timeline**: 90-120 days from formal application filing to DOT order.⁵⁶

**Extended Timeline with Foreign Ownership Issues**: When foreign ownership restructuring is required, the timeline extends by 60-120 days for:
- Negotiation with foreign investors to modify governance rights (30-60 days)⁵⁷
- Drafting and execution of amended organizational documents (15-30 days)⁵⁸
- Revised DOT application submission and review (30-60 days)⁵⁹
- Total timeline with restructuring: **120-270 days** (4-9 months)⁶⁰

The DOT's review runs **concurrently with FAA Part 119 certificate transfer review**, but foreign ownership issues can become the critical path item because FAA approval cannot be finalized until DOT citizenship compliance is confirmed.⁶¹

#### 6. Consequences of Non-Compliance

Operating as a U.S. air carrier without satisfying citizenship requirements constitutes a violation of 49 U.S.C. § 41101 (prohibiting foreign air transportation without proper authority).⁶² The statutory penalties include:

**Certificate Revocation**: The DOT possesses authority under 49 U.S.C. § 46101 to revoke an air carrier certificate if the holder fails to maintain citizenship requirements.⁶³ Revocation proceedings typically commence with a show cause order requiring the carrier to demonstrate why its certificate should not be revoked.⁶⁴

**Civil Penalties**: Violations of citizenship requirements subject the carrier to civil penalties up to $32,666 per violation per day under 49 U.S.C. § 46301.⁶⁵ For ongoing violations (such as operating for multiple months without proper citizenship compliance), penalties can accumulate to millions of dollars.⁶⁶

**Operational Suspension**: The DOT can issue emergency orders suspending operations pending citizenship compliance hearings if it determines that continued operations pose risks to the public interest.⁶⁷

**Contract Voidability**: Capacity purchase agreements with major network carriers typically contain representations and warranties regarding Part 119 certificate validity. Loss of certification due to citizenship violations would constitute a breach of contract entitling the network carrier to terminate the CPA without liability.⁶⁸

While certificate revocation remains rare in practice (the DOT historically works with carriers to restructure ownership before resorting to revocation), the consequences of citizenship non-compliance create existential risk for an airline's operations and contractual relationships.⁶⁹

### B. Application to Transaction

#### 1. Global Aviation Holdings Ownership Structure

Global Aviation Holdings LLC, the proposed acquirer of SkyWest Regional Airlines, possesses the following ownership structure:⁷⁰

**U.S. Private Equity Sponsors**: 60% equity ownership⁷¹
**Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB)**: 30% equity ownership⁷²
**European Institutional Investors**: 10% equity ownership⁷³

**Total Foreign Ownership**: 40% (CPPIB 30% + European 10%)⁷⁴

The organizational documents provide CPPIB with three categories of special governance rights:⁷⁵

**Board Observer Rights**: CPPIB holds a non-voting board observer seat with:
- Right to attend all board meetings (excluding executive sessions limited to independent directors)⁷⁶
- Receipt of all board materials provided to voting directors⁷⁷
- Advance notice of board meetings equivalent to voting directors⁷⁸
- Access to management for follow-up inquiries on board agenda items⁷⁹

**Consent Rights (Material Transactions)**: CPPIB consent is required for:
- Any amendment to the LLC Agreement that adversely affects CPPIB's economic or governance rights⁸⁰
- Any change to the capital structure including issuance of new equity interests⁸¹
- Any sale, lease, or disposition of assets exceeding [specified threshold]⁸²
- Any incurrence of indebtedness exceeding [specified threshold]⁸³
- Any merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all assets⁸⁴

**Information Rights**: CPPIB receives quarterly and annual financial statements, operating metrics, and strategic plans equivalent to those provided to the board of directors.⁸⁵

#### 2. CPPIB Legal Status: Canadian Crown Corporation

The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is a Canadian Crown corporation established by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act, S.C. 1997, c. 40.⁸⁶ CPPIB manages approximately CAD $409.5 billion in assets on behalf of the Canada Pension Plan, which provides retirement benefits to Canadian workers.⁸⁷

**Critical Classification**: CPPIB qualifies as a "Canadian national" for purposes of aviation bilateral agreements, but remains a **foreign person** under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15).⁸⁸ CPPIB's status as a Crown corporation (government-affiliated entity) does not exempt it from foreign ownership limitations applicable to private foreign investors.⁸⁹

**CFIUS Precedent Distinguished**: CPPIB has successfully completed 16 CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) national security reviews between 2008-2019 with zero investments blocked.⁹⁰ However, **CFIUS approval standards differ materially from DOT citizenship requirements**:

- CFIUS reviews focus on **national security risks** from foreign government influence over critical infrastructure⁹¹
- DOT citizenship reviews enforce **statutory ownership limits** to maintain U.S. control of commercial aviation operations⁹²
- CFIUS may approve investments that DOT would require to be restructured under the actual control doctrine⁹³

CPPIB's favorable CFIUS track record does not create a presumption of DOT approval for airline ownership structures.⁹⁴

#### 3. Statutory Compliance Analysis

**Test One: Organization Under U.S. Law**

Global Aviation Holdings LLC is organized as a Delaware limited liability company.⁹⁵ Following the transaction, SkyWest Regional Airlines will be operated by its existing corporate entity (a U.S. corporation) owned by GAH.⁹⁶ This element is satisfied.

**Test Two: Voting Equity Limitation (≤25% Foreign Voting)**

The transaction documents indicate CPPIB holds **30% equity interest** in GAH LLC.⁹⁷ Delaware LLC law provides that members' voting rights default to their percentage interest unless the LLC agreement specifies otherwise.⁹⁸

**Critical Ambiguity**: The transaction facts do not specify whether CPPIB's 30% equity constitutes voting or non-voting membership interest. Under two scenarios:

**Scenario A (CPPIB Holds 30% Voting Interest)**:
- Total foreign voting: 40% (CPPIB 30% + European 10%)
- Statutory limit: 25% foreign voting
- **Result**: ❌ **EXCEEDS STATUTORY LIMIT BY 15 PERCENTAGE POINTS**

**Scenario B (CPPIB Holds Non-Voting Preferred Interest)**:
- Total foreign voting: 10% (European only)
- Statutory limit: 25% foreign voting
- **Result**: ✓ **WITHIN STATUTORY LIMIT**

The fact registry indicates that CPPIB's interest is presumed to be voting equity absent evidence to the contrary.⁹⁹ **This creates a presumptive statutory violation under the 25% voting limit that must be cured through restructuring.**

**Test Three: Total Equity Limitation (≤49% Foreign Total)**

Total foreign equity: 40% (CPPIB 30% + European 10%)
Statutory limit: 49% foreign total equity
**Result**: ✓ **WITHIN STATUTORY LIMIT** (with 9 percentage point cushion)

**Test Four: President and Board Composition**

The transaction facts do not specify GAH's board composition or officer citizenship. **Data room verification required** to confirm:
- President is U.S. citizen¹⁰⁰
- At least two-thirds of board directors are U.S. citizens¹⁰¹
- At least two-thirds of "other managing officers" are U.S. citizens¹⁰²

**Working Assumption**: Given 60% U.S. sponsor ownership, board composition likely satisfies two-thirds U.S. citizen requirement, but confirmation required.¹⁰³

**Test Five: "Actual Control" by U.S. Citizens**

This element presents the **highest risk** and is analyzed in detail in subsection 4 below.

#### 4. "Actual Control" Doctrine Application

Under Virgin America precedent, the DOT will examine whether CPPIB's 30% equity ownership combined with board observer rights and consent rights enables CPPIB to exert "actual control" over GAH and its subsidiary airline, thereby violating the requirement that the carrier be under actual control of U.S. citizens.

**Factor One: Equity Ownership Percentage**

| Precedent | Foreign Investor | Equity % | DOT Action |
|-----------|------------------|----------|------------|
| Virgin America (2006 initial) | Virgin Group | 25% | Denial - required restructuring to 22% |
| Virgin America (2007 approved) | Virgin Group | 22% | Approval with voting trust |
| Northwest/KLM (1989) | KLM | >25% total equity | Required voting trust for equity above 25% |

**Application to CPPIB**: CPPIB's 30% equity ownership **exceeds the 22% Virgin America benchmark** and approaches the 25% voting limit. While the Virgin America case involved voting equity and CPPIB's equity could potentially be structured as non-voting, the **combination of 30% equity with special rights** creates actual control concerns independent of voting/non-voting classification.¹⁰⁴

**Probability Assessment**: 70-80% probability DOT views 30% equity alone as sufficient to trigger heightened actual control scrutiny even if non-voting.¹⁰⁵

**Factor Two: Board Observer Rights**

The Virgin America order specifically identified board observer seats as mechanisms for exerting influence over management decisions:

> "An observer seat provides access to confidential board deliberations, strategic planning discussions, and management presentations that enable the observer to influence directors' decision-making even without a formal vote."¹⁰⁶

CPPIB's board observer rights grant:
- Attendance at all board meetings (except independent director executive sessions)¹⁰⁷
- Receipt of board materials equivalent to voting directors¹⁰⁸
- Ability to question management during board meetings¹⁰⁹
- Advance notice enabling CPPIB to coordinate with U.S. directors on agenda items¹¹⁰

**DOT Analysis**: Board observer rights are not per se disqualifying, but **combined with other special rights** (veto/consent rights), they constitute evidence of influence beyond economic participation.¹¹¹ The Virgin America restructuring did not eliminate board observers entirely but restricted their participation in competitive and international route decisions.¹¹²

**Probability Assessment**: 60-70% probability DOT requires restrictions on CPPIB observer rights (e.g., exclusion from meetings addressing strategic decisions, capital allocation, or operational matters where CPPIB interests conflict with U.S. control).¹¹³

**Factor Three: Consent Rights Over Capital Structure**

CPPIB's veto over capital structure changes directly parallels the Virgin America concerns. The Virgin America order noted:

> "Veto rights over capital structure decisions enable a foreign investor to prevent the airline from raising equity or restructuring debt in ways the investor opposes, thereby controlling the airline's access to capital—a fundamental attribute of corporate control."¹¹⁴

CPPIB's capital structure consent right enables CPPIB to:
- Block issuance of new equity that would dilute CPPIB's percentage interest¹¹⁵
- Prevent equity restructuring that eliminates CPPIB's special rights¹¹⁶
- Veto recapitalizations that alter economic rights among classes¹¹⁷

**DOT Concern**: An airline's ability to raise capital directly affects its financial fitness and operational capacity. Granting a foreign investor veto power over capital structure decisions means the foreign investor controls whether the airline can respond to financial stress, pursue growth opportunities, or comply with DOT working capital requirements.¹¹⁸

**Probability Assessment**: 90-95% probability DOT requires elimination or modification of capital structure veto right—this is the **single highest-risk governance provision** under Virgin America precedent.¹¹⁹

**Factor Four: Consent Rights Over Major Asset Sales**

CPPIB's veto over major asset sales enables CPPIB to block:
- Sale of aircraft to raise liquidity during financial stress¹²⁰
- Disposition of airport slots or terminal facilities¹²¹
- Sale of subsidiary operations or route authorities¹²²

**DOT Analysis**: Asset sales directly affect an airline's operational capabilities and network structure. The DOT views veto rights over major asset dispositions as enabling foreign investors to prevent management from making operational decisions necessary to respond to market conditions.¹²³

The Virgin America case addressed similar concerns where Virgin Group's trademark license gave it approval rights over Virgin America's use of certain markets and routes—the DOT found these provisions constituted undue foreign influence over operational strategy.¹²⁴

**Probability Assessment**: 80-85% probability DOT requires elimination or significant threshold increase (e.g., consent only for sale of >50% of total assets) for asset sale veto right.¹²⁵

**Factor Five: Consent Rights Over Debt Incurrence**

CPPIB's veto over indebtedness above specified thresholds enables CPPIB to:
- Block debt financing necessary for aircraft acquisitions¹²⁶
- Prevent working capital borrowings during seasonal downturns¹²⁷
- Veto refinancing of existing debt at more favorable terms¹²⁸

**DOT Analysis**: Access to debt capital is fundamental to airline operations given the capital-intensive nature of aircraft acquisition and maintenance. Foreign investor veto power over debt issuance gives the investor control over the airline's financial flexibility and ability to maintain adequate liquidity.¹²⁹

**Probability Assessment**: 85-90% probability DOT requires elimination or substantial threshold increase (e.g., consent only for debt exceeding $500 million) for debt incurrence veto right.¹³⁰

**Factor Six: Cumulative "Totality of Circumstances" Analysis**

The DOT does not analyze individual governance rights in isolation—it examines the **cumulative effect** of all special rights on the foreign investor's ability to influence strategic and operational decisions.¹³¹

**CPPIB Cumulative Rights**:
| Governance Mechanism | Effect on Control |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| 30% equity ownership | Largest single investor; veto-level blocking stake |
| Board observer seat | Access to confidential strategic deliberations |
| Capital structure veto | Control over equity and debt financing capacity |
| Asset sale veto | Control over fleet and network restructuring |
| Debt incurrence veto | Control over working capital and liquidity management |
| Information rights | Real-time visibility into financial and operational performance |

**Virgin America Comparison**:

| Factor | Virgin America (2006 Denied) | CPPIB/GAH (2025) | Comparison |
|--------|------------------------------|------------------|------------|
| Foreign equity % | 25% | 30% | ⚠️ CPPIB higher |
| Board seats | 2 of 8 directors (voting) | 1 observer (non-voting) | ✓ CPPIB better |
| Capital structure control | Trademark license conditions | Direct veto right | ❌ CPPIB worse |
| Operational influence | Trademark approval for markets | Asset sale veto | ❌ CPPIB worse |
| Financing control | Startup capital provider | Debt veto right | ❌ CPPIB worse |
| Management relationships | CEO-Branson relationship | No identified conflicts | ✓ CPPIB better |

**Conclusion**: CPPIB's governance rights profile presents **equal or greater actual control concerns** than the Virgin America structure that DOT initially denied in December 2006. While CPPIB's non-voting board observer status is less problematic than Virgin Group's voting board seats, CPPIB's three explicit veto rights create stronger "negative control" than the indirect influence mechanisms (trademark license, management relationships) that triggered Virgin America's initial denial.¹³²

**Aggregate Probability Assessment**: **75-85% probability DOT requires CPPIB governance rights restructuring** as a condition of fitness approval.¹³³

**Basis for Probability Range**:

**Lower Bound (75%)** assumes:
- DOT gives credit for CPPIB's Canadian national status under U.S.-Canada Open Skies Agreement¹³⁴
- DOT accepts modifications to veto rights (higher thresholds, supermajority vote requirements) without requiring complete elimination¹³⁵
- DOT views CPPIB's institutional investor profile (pension fund) as less concerning than strategic investor (Virgin Group)¹³⁶

**Upper Bound (85%)** assumes:
- DOT applies Virgin America precedent strictly without material distinction for CPPIB's institutional investor status¹³⁷
- DOT requires elimination (not merely modification) of all three veto rights¹³⁸
- DOT requires additional protections (voting trust, board restrictions) beyond elimination of veto rights¹³⁹

**Key Uncertainty**: DOT has not published post-Virgin America orders addressing institutional investor special rights in detail. The 75-85% range reflects uncertainty about whether DOT will distinguish institutional investors (pension funds, sovereign wealth funds) from strategic investors (industry competitors, foreign carriers) when evaluating actual control.¹⁴⁰

#### 5. U.S.-Canada Open Skies Agreement: Limited Mitigation

The United States and Canada maintain an Open Skies bilateral air services agreement effective March 12, 2007.¹⁴¹ The agreement permits liberal air services between the two countries and has been accompanied by DOT guidance suggesting regulatory flexibility for Canadian investments in U.S. carriers.¹⁴²

In memoranda of consultations with Open Skies partner countries, the DOT has stated:

> "Subject to the overall 25 percent limitation on foreign ownership of voting equity, ownership by [Open Skies partner] nationals of as much as 25 percent of the voting equity and/or as much as 49.9 percent of the total equity of a U.S. airline would not be deemed, **of itself**, to constitute control."¹⁴³

**Key Limitation**: The phrase "**of itself**" indicates that equity ownership within statutory limits does not automatically satisfy the actual control test—the DOT will still examine special rights, veto provisions, and governance arrangements.¹⁴⁴

**Application to CPPIB**: CPPIB qualifies as a Canadian national, and its 30% total equity falls within the 49.9% Open Skies threshold. However, the Open Skies flexibility does not insulate CPPIB's **veto rights and board observer seat** from actual control scrutiny.¹⁴⁵

**Probability CPPIB's Canadian Status Provides Material Advantage**: 25-35%

**Rationale**: The Open Skies policy may enable CPPIB to retain **higher equity ownership** (up to 49.9% non-voting) than a non-Open Skies investor, but likely will not enable CPPIB to retain **veto rights** that the DOT would require a non-Open Skies investor to eliminate.¹⁴⁶ Canadian national status provides a **marginal advantage** (perhaps reducing restructuring probability from 85% to 75%), but does not eliminate actual control concerns.¹⁴⁷

#### 6. Financial Fitness Analysis

Beyond citizenship compliance, the DOT must determine that GAH possesses adequate financial fitness to acquire and operate SkyWest Regional Airlines. The financial fitness analysis examines three components:

**Component One: Adequate Financial Resources**

**DOT Standard**: The applicant must demonstrate "financial resources adequate to conduct proposed operations and maintain adequate liquidity throughout reasonably foreseeable business cycles."¹⁴⁸

**Working Capital Requirement**: DOT precedent suggests airlines should maintain working capital equivalent to **three months of operating expenses**.¹⁴⁹ For SkyWest Regional Airlines:

Estimated annual operating expenses: $1.565 billion (assumes $1.85B revenue × 84.6% average operating ratio for regional carriers)¹⁵⁰
Three-month working capital requirement: **$391 million**¹⁵¹

**CRITICAL CONFLICT: Revenue Uncertainty**: The fact registry identifies a material conflict between stated transaction revenue ($1.85B) and verified SEC EDGAR data for SkyWest Inc. parent company ($3.53B).¹⁵² If the transaction involves full SkyWest Inc. rather than SkyWest Airlines subsidiary carve-out, the three-month working capital requirement increases to **$758 million**.¹⁵³ This conflict requires data room resolution.

**GAH Pro Forma Liquidity Analysis**:

Purchase price: $2.8 billion¹⁵⁴
Assumed acquisition financing: 65% debt / 35% equity¹⁵⁵
- Debt: $1.82 billion¹⁵⁶
- Equity: $980 million¹⁵⁷

**Post-Acquisition Balance Sheet (Pro Forma)**:

Assets:
- SkyWest tangible assets (owned aircraft, slots, facilities): [DATA ROOM REQUIRED]
- Operating lease right-of-use assets (ASC 842): $1.402 billion¹⁵⁸

Liabilities:
- Acquisition debt: $1.82 billion¹⁵⁹
- Operating lease liabilities (ASC 842): $1.402 billion¹⁶⁰
- Trade payables and accruals: [DATA ROOM REQUIRED]

Working Capital Position:
- Cash and equivalents: [DATA ROOM REQUIRED]
- Undrawn credit facility: [DATA ROOM REQUIRED]
- Less: Current liabilities: [DATA ROOM REQUIRED]
- **Net working capital: [CANNOT BE CALCULATED WITHOUT DATA ROOM ACCESS]**

**DOT Fitness Concern**: Leveraged buyout structures with 65% debt financing create DOT scrutiny regarding post-acquisition liquidity. The DOT will examine:

- Whether acquisition debt covenants restrict SkyWest's ability to access cash for operations¹⁶¹
- Whether debt service obligations ($100M-$130M annually at 5.5%-7.0% interest on $1.82B debt) reduce available working capital¹⁶²
- Whether the acquisition financing includes adequate credit facilities to cover seasonal working capital fluctuations¹⁶³
- Whether GAH sponsors have committed additional equity or subordinated debt to support liquidity needs¹⁶⁴

**Probability of DOT Financial Fitness Concerns**: **20-30%**

**Basis**: Regional airline acquisitions historically receive DOT financial fitness approval if the applicant demonstrates committed financing and adequate working capital projections. However, 65% leverage is at the upper end of typical airline LBO structures, creating modest DOT concern about debt service crowding out operational investment.¹⁶⁵

**Mitigation Strategy**: Prepare comprehensive working capital package demonstrating:
- Committed revolving credit facility ($200M-$300M) with no acquisition debt covenant restrictions on drawings¹⁶⁶
- Pro forma cash flow projections showing positive operating cash flow and debt service coverage ratio >1.5x¹⁶⁷
- Letters from acquisition debt lenders confirming no restrictions on operational liquidity access¹⁶⁸
- Sponsor equity commitment letter pledging additional capital ($50M-$100M) if working capital falls below DOT thresholds¹⁶⁹

**Component Two: Compliance Disposition**

**DOT Standard**: The applicant and its management must demonstrate a "satisfactory compliance disposition" with DOT economic regulations, FAA safety regulations, and labor laws.¹⁷⁰

**SkyWest Regulatory History**:

The target company possesses two pending regulatory matters that could affect DOT fitness determination:

**FAA Maintenance Violation (March-April 2024)**: SkyWest received FAA proposed penalty for emergency equipment inspection violations (14 CFR § 121.309).¹⁷¹
- Proposed penalty: $10,000-$25,000¹⁷²
- Status: Proposed (not final)¹⁷³
- DOT fitness impact: **LOW** - minor safety violation with proposed penalty <$25K unlikely to affect fitness determination¹⁷⁴

**DOT Tarmac Delay Incident (March 2024)**: SkyWest experienced tarmac delay exceeding three hours in violation of 14 CFR § 259.4.¹⁷⁵
- Proposed penalty: $100,000-$500,000¹⁷⁶
- Status: Enforcement investigation pending¹⁷⁷
- DOT fitness impact: **LOW-MEDIUM** - single tarmac delay violation does not constitute pattern suggesting systemic compliance problems, but DOT may condition fitness approval on payment/settlement of penalty and implementation of enhanced tarmac delay monitoring procedures¹⁷⁸

**GAH Sponsor Regulatory History**: [DATA ROOM REQUIRED]
- Prior airline ownership experience: [Unknown]
- Compliance history of other portfolio airlines: [Unknown]
- Management team aviation industry experience: [Unknown]

**Probability of Compliance Disposition Issues**: **10-15%**

**Basis**: Pending regulatory violations are modest in severity and do not suggest systemic compliance problems. The DOT may require settlement of pending matters before fitness approval or impose conditions requiring enhanced compliance monitoring, but unlikely to deny fitness solely on compliance grounds.¹⁷⁹

**Component Three: Managerial Competence**

**DOT Standard**: The applicant's proposed management team must possess adequate qualifications and experience to conduct safe operations in compliance with applicable regulations.¹⁸⁰

**Key Management Positions Requiring DOT Review**:
- Chief Executive Officer¹⁸¹
- Chief Operating Officer / President¹⁸²
- Chief Financial Officer¹⁸³
- Director of Operations (FAA required position per 14 CFR § 119.65)¹⁸⁴
- Chief Pilot (FAA required position per 14 CFR § 119.67)¹⁸⁵
- Director of Maintenance (FAA required position per 14 CFR § 119.69)¹⁸⁶

**GAH Management Structure**: [DATA ROOM REQUIRED]
- Will GAH retain existing SkyWest management team? [Unknown]
- Will GAH install new management from sponsor portfolio companies? [Unknown]
- Do proposed managers possess aviation industry experience? [Unknown]
- Do proposed managers satisfy FAA qualification requirements for required positions? [Unknown]

**DOT Review Standard**: The DOT examines management qualifications in coordination with FAA certificate transfer review. If proposed managers lack aviation experience or do not satisfy FAA qualification requirements for required positions, the DOT may:
- Deny fitness pending appointment of qualified managers¹⁸⁷
- Condition fitness approval on retention of existing management team for specified transition period¹⁸⁸
- Require enhanced FAA oversight (more frequent inspections) during initial post-acquisition period¹⁸⁹

**Probability of Managerial Competence Issues**: **15-25%** (if GAH proposes management changes); **<5%** (if GAH retains existing SkyWest management)

**Basis**: Regional airline operations require specialized expertise in Part 121 operations, CPA contract management, and FAA regulatory compliance. Private equity sponsors without aviation industry experience proposing to install non-aviation management create DOT and FAA concerns about operational oversight competence.¹⁹⁰

**Mitigation Strategy**: Commit to retaining SkyWest's existing management team (CEO, COO, CFO, Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, Director of Maintenance) for minimum 24-month transition period post-closing.¹⁹¹

#### 7. Aggregate DOT Fitness Risk Assessment

Combining citizenship compliance, financial fitness, compliance disposition, and managerial competence analyses:

| DOT Fitness Component | Issue Probability | Severity if Occurs | Expected Delay |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Foreign ownership restructuring | 75-85% | CRITICAL - Deal-blocking if CPPIB refuses | 60-120 days |
| Financial fitness concerns | 20-30% | MEDIUM - Requires enhanced working capital package | 15-30 days |
| Compliance disposition issues | 10-15% | LOW - Condition approval on penalty settlement | 15-30 days |
| Managerial competence concerns | 15-25% | MEDIUM - Requires management retention commitments | 30-45 days |

**Critical Path**: Foreign ownership restructuring (75-85% probability) is the **dominant risk factor** and potential deal-blocking issue. If DOT requires CPPIB governance rights restructuring and CPPIB refuses to accept modified terms, the transaction cannot proceed without replacing CPPIB's $294 million equity investment (30% of $980M total equity).¹⁹²

**Aggregate Probability of DOT Fitness Approval WITH Restructuring**: **90-95%** (DOT approves after CPPIB governance rights restructured)¹⁹³

**Aggregate Probability of DOT Fitness Approval WITHOUT Restructuring**: **15-25%** (DOT approves as-is structure)¹⁹⁴

**Transaction Timeline Impact**:
- Base case (no foreign ownership issues): 90-120 days¹⁹⁵
- With foreign ownership restructuring: 150-240 days (5-8 months)¹⁹⁶
- With CPPIB refusal to restructure: Transaction termination or 6-9 month delay to find replacement investor¹⁹⁷

### C. Risk Assessment

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| DOT requires CPPIB governance rights restructuring (eliminate veto rights, restrict board observer participation) | HIGH | 75-85% | $5M-$15M restructuring costs (legal, advisory, documentation) + 60-120 day closing delay | Proactive pre-signing restructuring with CPPIB; pre-filing DOT consultation |
| CPPIB refuses restructuring terms, creating deal-blocking condition | CRITICAL | 10-15% | Transaction termination OR 6-9 month delay + $15M-$30M costs to replace CPPIB equity ($294M) | CPPIB advance consent in LLC Agreement to DOT-required restructuring; alternative investor identified in advance |
| DOT conditions fitness approval on enhanced working capital commitments | MEDIUM | 20-30% | $50M-$100M sponsor equity commitment letter; $200M-$300M committed credit facility | Comprehensive financial fitness package prepared before formal DOT application |
| DOT requires settlement of pending tarmac delay penalty before approval | LOW | 10-15% | $100K-$500K penalty payment + compliance enhancement costs ($1M) | Proactive settlement negotiation with DOT before fitness application filed |
| DOT conditions approval on management retention commitments | MEDIUM | 15-25% | $5M-$10M retention bonuses for key executives; operational flexibility limitations | Pre-signing retention agreements with SkyWest CEO, COO, Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, Director of Maintenance |
| DOT rejects financial fitness due to inadequate working capital | LOW | 5-10% | Deal termination OR purchase price reduction to reduce debt leverage | Increase equity contribution from 35% to 40-45% ($140M-$280M additional equity) |
| Post-closing DOT monitoring conditions increase ongoing compliance costs | LOW | 30-40% | $500K-$1M annual compliance costs (quarterly certifications, enhanced reporting) | Accept as cost of doing business; implement robust compliance monitoring systems |
| United Airlines withholds CPA consent pending DOT foreign ownership approval | HIGH | 30-40% | Closing condition dependency creating timing risk; potential United CPA termination if DOT approval delayed beyond United's tolerance | Sequential closing structure: (1) obtain DOT approval, (2) obtain United consent, (3) close transaction |

**Section IV.C Aggregate Exposure:**
- **Gross Exposure**: $25M-$60M (restructuring, legal, working capital commitments, penalties, management retention)
- **Probability-Weighted Exposure**: $15M-$30M
- **Timeline Risk**: 60-240 day delay depending on CPPIB cooperation and DOT review speed
- **Deal-Blocking Risk**: 10-15% probability (CPPIB refusal to restructure + inability to find replacement investor within transaction timeline)

### D. Cross-Domain Implications

**CROSS-SECTION IMPACT**: DOT foreign ownership restructuring requirement (75-85% probability) directly affects:

**Section IV.A (Aviation Regulatory - FAA Certificate Transfer) §4.2**: FAA Part 119 certificate transfer application cannot be finalized until DOT citizenship compliance is confirmed under 14 CFR § 119.33(a). If CPPIB restructuring extends DOT review timeline to 150-240 days, FAA certificate transfer becomes dependent on DOT approval, extending the critical path by 60-120 days beyond FAA's base case 150-day review period. The FAA will not issue amended certificate until it receives DOT confirmation that GAH satisfies citizenship requirements, creating a **sequential dependency** that adds DOT timeline to FAA timeline rather than running concurrently.

**Section IV.B (Commercial Contracts - CPA Consent Analysis) §3.4**: United Airlines CPA contains change-of-control consent provision requiring United to evaluate GAH's financial stability and regulatory compliance. United's consent decision will likely be **conditional on DOT fitness approval** because United will not consent to change of control until GAH demonstrates it can maintain Part 119 certification. If DOT requires working capital commitments or raises financial fitness concerns, United may demand: (1) CPA financial covenant modifications, (2) parent guarantee from GAH sponsors, or (3) cash collateral/letter of credit ($50M-$100M) to secure SkyWest's CPA performance obligations. DOT financial fitness concerns create **negotiation leverage** for United to extract enhanced credit protections.

**Section IV.J (Transaction Structure & Closing Conditions) §2.1**: Purchase Agreement must include **regulatory approval closing condition** specifically addressing DOT fitness determination. Recommended provision:

> "Buyer's obligation to close is conditioned upon receipt of written confirmation from the U.S. Department of Transportation that the post-Closing ownership structure of Buyer and the Company satisfies the citizenship requirements of 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15) and DOT fitness standards, and does not create 'actual control' concerns requiring further restructuring."

Failure to include this condition creates risk that Buyer is obligated to close even if DOT requires post-closing restructuring (forcing retroactive CPPIB renegotiation under time pressure).

**Section IV.G (Securities & Corporate Governance) §5.2**: CPPIB veto rights reduction required by DOT constitutes **adverse modification** to CPPIB's governance rights under LLC Agreement Article [X.Y], requiring CPPIB's **advance consent** to the amendment. This creates circular dependency: DOT requires elimination of veto rights → LLC Agreement amendment requires CPPIB consent → CPPIB may refuse consent or demand enhanced economics. **Recommendation**: Execute LLC Agreement amendment **before signing** Purchase Agreement to ensure CPPIB has contractually agreed to accept DOT-mandated governance rights modifications without additional economic consideration.

**Section IV.H (Financing & Capital Structure) §4.3**: Acquisition debt financing commitments from lenders should include **foreign ownership restructuring flexibility** provisions permitting GAH to: (1) convert CPPIB equity from voting to non-voting without lender consent, (2) modify LLC Agreement governance provisions to comply with DOT requirements without triggering debt covenant violations, and (3) delay funding of acquisition debt until DOT fitness approval is obtained (preventing "dry closing" where debt funds but transaction cannot close due to DOT non-approval). Debt commitment letters lacking these provisions create risk that DOT-mandated restructuring triggers lender consent requirements or covenant defaults.

**Section IV.K (Employment & Labor Relations) §6.1**: DOT financial fitness concerns about working capital adequacy could affect GAH's ability to fund ALPA contract settlement. If DOT requires $50M-$100M sponsor equity commitment letter to demonstrate adequate liquidity, and ALPA contract settlement requires $150M-$180M Year 1 cost, **aggregate cash requirement** ($200M-$280M) may exceed GAH's available liquidity. DOT fitness approval becomes **conditional on labor cost management**, potentially requiring GAH to: (1) negotiate deferred payment terms with ALPA, (2) increase equity financing to accommodate both DOT working capital requirements and labor settlement costs, or (3) seek CPA rate increases from United/Delta/American to pass through labor cost increases (creating CPA consent dependency).

**Section IV.E (Antitrust & Competition) §2.5**: DOT fitness review includes limited competitive analysis examining whether the acquisition reduces competition in relevant markets. While regional carrier acquisitions typically receive minimal competitive scrutiny (unlike mainline carrier mergers), DOT may examine whether GAH's acquisition of SkyWest combined with any other GAH-owned regional carriers creates regional carrier market concentration. If GAH operates other Part 121 regional carriers, DOT may require divestitures or operational separation commitments to preserve competition for CPA contracts. **Data room investigation required** to identify GAH's existing airline holdings and assess DOT competitive concerns.

### E. Recommendations

#### 1. PROACTIVE CPPIB RESTRUCTURING (CRITICAL - EXECUTE BEFORE PURCHASE AGREEMENT SIGNING)

**Objective**: Eliminate DOT "actual control" concerns by restructuring CPPIB governance rights **before signing** definitive Purchase Agreement, avoiding closing condition dependency and timeline risk.

**Immediate Action (0-30 Days Pre-Signing)**:

**Step One**: Negotiate LLC Agreement Amendment No. 1 with CPPIB providing:

**(a) Convert CPPIB Voting Rights to Non-Voting Preferred Interest**

Restructure CPPIB's 30% equity from voting membership interest to non-voting preferred membership interest with economic rights equivalent to common membership interest (distributions, liquidation preference, capital appreciation) but **zero voting rights** on ordinary or extraordinary LLC matters.

**Rationale**: Reduces total foreign voting ownership from 40% (CPPIB 30% + European 10%) to 10% (European only), bringing GAH **within 25% voting limit** and eliminating statutory violation.

**(b) Eliminate CPPIB Veto Rights Over Capital Structure, Asset Sales, and Debt**

Delete LLC Agreement provisions granting CPPIB consent rights over:
- Capital structure changes and new equity issuances
- Asset sales or dispositions (except sales of >75% of total LLC assets, which should require consent of 75% of equity interests by value, not CPPIB individual veto)
- Indebtedness incurrence above specified thresholds

**Rationale**: Eliminates "negative control" mechanisms that Virgin America precedent identifies as constituting "actual control" regardless of equity ownership percentage.

**(c) Modify CPPIB Board Observer Rights**

Retain CPPIB board observer seat but with explicit **exclusions** from:
- Board meetings addressing competitive strategy, route network planning, or major aircraft acquisition decisions where CPPIB interests may conflict with U.S. operational control
- Executive sessions limited to U.S. citizen directors discussing sensitive DOT/FAA regulatory compliance matters
- Receipt of board materials containing commercially sensitive information about CPA negotiations with United/Delta/American (protecting U.S. competitive strategy from Canadian Crown corporation visibility)

**Rationale**: Virgin America precedent suggests board observers are acceptable if their participation is restricted to financial oversight matters and excluded from strategic/operational decisions. This approach balances CPPIB's legitimate investor oversight interests against DOT actual control concerns.

**(d) Replace Individual Veto with Supermajority Vote Requirements**

For truly extraordinary corporate actions requiring investor protection beyond ordinary governance:
- LLC dissolution or bankruptcy filing: Requires 75% supermajority vote of all membership interests
- Amendments to LLC Agreement adversely affecting CPPIB's economic rights (distribution priorities, liquidation preferences): Requires consent of affected class
- Voluntary sale of substantially all LLC assets (>75%): Requires 75% supermajority vote

**Rationale**: Supermajority vote requirements protect minority investors (including CPPIB) from harmful actions while **diffusing individual control**—CPPIB must persuade other investors to reach 75% threshold, preventing CPPIB alone from blocking actions.

**Draft LLC Agreement Amendment Language**:

```
AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO
AMENDED AND RESTATED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT
OF GLOBAL AVIATION HOLDINGS LLC

WHEREAS, Global Aviation Holdings LLC (the "Company") intends to acquire SkyWest Regional Airlines pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated [●], 2026 (the "Acquisition");

WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Transportation requires that U.S. air carriers be under the "actual control" of U.S. citizens as defined in 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15);

WHEREAS, the Members desire to restructure the governance rights of certain non-U.S. Members to ensure the Company and its airline subsidiaries satisfy DOT citizenship requirements;

NOW, THEREFORE, effective upon execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the LLC Agreement is amended as follows:

**Section 3.1 (Capital Structure) - CPPIB Non-Voting Preferred Interest:**

"The 30% membership interest held by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ('CPPIB') shall be designated as **Non-Voting Preferred Membership Interest**. The CPPIB Non-Voting Preferred Interest shall:

(a) **Economic Rights**: Possess distribution rights, liquidation rights, and capital appreciation rights identical to Common Membership Interests held by U.S. Sponsor Members and European Institutional Members;

(b) **Voting Rights**: Possess **zero voting rights** on any matters submitted to Members for vote, including without limitation: (i) election or removal of Managers, (ii) amendments to this LLC Agreement, (iii) approval of annual budgets, (iv) capital structure changes, (v) asset acquisitions or dispositions, (vi) indebtedness incurrence, (vii) entry into new lines of business, or (viii) any other ordinary or extraordinary Company matters.

(c) **Consent Rights**: Notwithstanding subsection (b), CPPIB retains consent rights (which shall not constitute 'voting' for purposes of 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15)) solely for: (i) amendments to this LLC Agreement that adversely affect the economic rights (distributions, liquidation priority, or capital appreciation) of the CPPIB Non-Voting Preferred Interest, or (ii) voluntary dissolution of the Company or voluntary bankruptcy filing."

**Section 4.2 (Board Observer Rights) - Modified:**

"Section 4.2 is amended to provide:

'CPPIB shall be entitled to designate one non-voting observer (the "Observer") to attend meetings of the Board of Managers, subject to the following conditions:

(a) **Excluded Meetings**: The Observer shall be excluded from meetings or portions of meetings addressing: (i) competitive strategy, route network planning, fleet acquisition decisions, or CPA contract negotiations; (ii) DOT or FAA regulatory compliance matters involving foreign ownership or citizenship issues; (iii) executive sessions limited to U.S. citizen Managers; or (iv) any matter where the Board determines in good faith that Observer attendance would create conflicts between CPPIB's interests as a Canadian Crown corporation and the Company's interests as a U.S. air carrier.

(b) **Information Rights**: The Observer shall receive board materials for meetings the Observer is entitled to attend, but shall not receive materials for Excluded Meetings under subsection (a). In lieu of Excluded Meeting materials, CPPIB shall receive quarterly written reports summarizing: (i) the Company's financial performance, (ii) major capital expenditures approved, (iii) compliance with financial covenants, and (iv) material litigation or regulatory proceedings.

(c) **Confidentiality**: The Observer shall execute the Company's standard director/observer confidentiality agreement and shall not disclose confidential Company information to any third parties including other CPPIB portfolio companies or CPPIB's Board of Directors, except as required by applicable Canadian law.'"

**Section 5.3 (Consent Rights) - DELETED and REPLACED:**

"Section 5.3 is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

**'Section 5.3 Supermajority Vote Requirements**

The following actions shall require the approval of Members holding at least 75% of the membership interests by capital account value:

(a) Voluntary dissolution of the Company or voluntary bankruptcy filing by the Company;

(b) Sale, lease, or disposition of assets constituting more than 75% of the Company's total assets measured by book value;

(c) Merger or consolidation of the Company where the Company is not the surviving entity.

**For clarity**: The following actions shall require only ordinary majority vote of the U.S. Sponsor Members holding Common Membership Interests (and shall not require CPPIB consent or any supermajority vote): (i) capital structure changes including issuance of new equity interests, (ii) asset sales or dispositions of less than 75% of total assets, (iii) incurrence of indebtedness in any amount, (iv) approval of annual budgets, (v) entry into new lines of business, (vi) amendments to this LLC Agreement that do not adversely affect the economic rights of any membership interest class.'"

**Section 12.7 (DOT Compliance Covenant) - NEW:**

"**Section 12.7 U.S. Citizenship and DOT Compliance**

(a) The Members acknowledge that any airline subsidiary of the Company must satisfy the citizenship requirements of 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15) to maintain its Part 119 operating certificate. The Company shall not take any action, and shall not permit any Member to take any action, that would cause any airline subsidiary to violate DOT citizenship requirements.

(b) If the DOT or FAA notifies the Company that the Company's ownership or governance structure creates citizenship compliance concerns, the Company shall, and the Members shall cooperate to, amend this LLC Agreement as necessary to satisfy DOT/FAA requirements within 30 days of such notice.

(c) CPPIB acknowledges and agrees that its Non-Voting Preferred Interest structure and modified Board Observer rights are intended to comply with DOT actual control requirements, and CPPIB shall not seek to amend this LLC Agreement in any manner that would recreate 'actual control' concerns under DOT precedent."
```

**Commercial Negotiation with CPPIB**:

CPPIB will likely resist elimination of veto rights that were negotiated as condition of its $294 million equity investment. **Potential concessions to obtain CPPIB consent**:

**(a) Enhanced Economic Rights**:
- Increase CPPIB's liquidation preference from pari passu with common to 1.25x invested capital priority
- Grant CPPIB anti-dilution protection (full ratchet or weighted average) if Company issues new equity below CPPIB's entry valuation
- Increase CPPIB's preferred distribution rate from [X%] to [X+1%]

**(b) Information Rights Enhancement**:
- Despite exclusion from certain board meetings, provide CPPIB with **enhanced quarterly reporting** including: monthly financial statements, annual business plans, multi-year strategic plans, major capital expenditure approvals
- Quarterly in-person meetings between CPPIB and Company CFO to review financial performance

**(c) Registration Rights** (if Company contemplates future IPO):
- Grant CPPIB demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights for its Non-Voting Preferred Interest
- Ensure CPPIB can achieve liquidity through IPO or sale notwithstanding non-voting structure

**(d) Tag-Along Rights**:
- If U.S. Sponsor Members sell their interests to third-party buyer, CPPIB has right to sell its Non-Voting Preferred Interest on same terms

**Fallback Position if CPPIB Refuses Restructuring**:

If CPPIB refuses to accept governance rights modifications, GAH has three alternatives:

**Alternative 1 - Replace CPPIB with U.S. Institutional Investor**:
- Identify U.S. pension fund, endowment, or institutional investor willing to invest $294M on equivalent economic terms without requiring special governance rights
- Timeline: 60-90 days to identify, negotiate, and close replacement investor
- Cost: Investment banking fees ($3M-$5M), legal fees ($1M-$2M), potential higher return requirements from replacement investor

**Alternative 2 - Increase U.S. Sponsor Equity Contribution**:
- U.S. Sponsors increase equity contribution from 60% ($588M) to 90% ($882M), replacing CPPIB entirely
- Reduces European institutional investor stake from 10% to 10% or eliminates European investors
- Cost: $294M additional equity requirement for U.S. Sponsors + increase in equity risk concentration

**Alternative 3 - Reduce European Institutional Investor Stake**:
- Reduce European institutional investors from 10% to 5%, using the redeemed 5% to reduce CPPIB from 30% to 25%
- CPPIB at 25% total equity (all non-voting) combined with elimination of veto rights may satisfy DOT
- Cost: Requires negotiation with European investors (may demand premium to accept dilution)

**Probability CPPIB Accepts Restructuring**: 75-85%

**Basis**: CPPIB is sophisticated institutional investor with extensive U.S. investment experience including 16 prior CFIUS reviews. CPPIB likely understands DOT citizenship requirements and anticipated need for governance rights restructuring. Offering enhanced economic rights (liquidation preference, anti-dilution, information rights) as substitute for veto rights provides CPPIB with equivalent investor protections through economic mechanisms rather than governance control.

**Probability CPPIB Refuses Restructuring**: 10-15%

**Basis**: If CPPIB's investment committee approval was conditioned on specific veto rights (particularly capital structure veto protecting against dilution), CPPIB may lack internal authority to accept modified terms without returning to its Board of Directors for re-approval (which could require 60-90 days and create deal timing risk).

#### 2. DOT PRE-FILING CONSULTATION (HIGH PRIORITY - EXECUTE 60-90 DAYS BEFORE ANTICIPATED CLOSING)

**Objective**: Obtain informal DOT guidance confirming that restructured CPPIB governance rights satisfy actual control requirements **before filing formal fitness application**, avoiding surprise issues during formal review period.

**Strategy**: Engage DOT Office of Aviation Consumer Protection (OACP) for pre-filing consultation meeting.

**Timeline**:
- Request pre-filing meeting: 30 days before formal application filing
- DOT schedules meeting: 15-30 days after request
- Pre-filing consultation meeting: 1-2 hour session with DOT staff attorneys and economists
- DOT provides informal feedback: 7-14 days after meeting
- Revise application based on feedback: 7-14 days
- File formal application: After incorporating DOT informal guidance

**Pre-Filing Meeting Agenda**:

**(a) Restructured CPPIB Governance Rights Presentation**:
- Describe original CPPIB structure (30% voting equity + board observer + three veto rights)
- Present amended structure (30% non-voting preferred + restricted board observer + supermajority vote requirements)
- Explain rationale: Virgin America precedent compliance while preserving CPPIB's legitimate investor protection interests

**(b) U.S.-Canada Open Skies Policy Discussion**:
- CPPIB qualifies as Canadian national under U.S.-Canada Open Skies Agreement
- Request confirmation that DOT's Open Skies policy guidance (permitting up to 49.9% total equity by Canadian nationals) applies to institutional investors like CPPIB
- Distinguish CPPIB (passive institutional investor) from Virgin Group (strategic industry investor)

**(c) Financial Fitness Package Preview**:
- Present pro forma balance sheet and cash flow projections demonstrating adequate working capital
- Describe committed credit facilities and sponsor equity commitment letters
- Address DOT concerns about 65% acquisition debt leverage

**(d) Compliance Disposition Discussion**:
- Disclose pending FAA maintenance violation ($10K-$25K proposed penalty) and DOT tarmac delay investigation ($100K-$500K range)
- Describe remedial actions taken (enhanced maintenance tracking systems, tarmac delay monitoring)
- Request DOT confirmation that pending minor violations will not delay fitness determination if settled before formal application filing

**Pre-Filing Consultation Benefits**:

- **Reduces approval timeline uncertainty**: DOT informal feedback enables applicant to address concerns before formal filing, reducing probability of DOT requests for additional information during formal review
- **Identifies unanticipated issues**: DOT may raise concerns not apparent from published precedent (e.g., specific questions about CPPIB's Crown corporation status)
- **Establishes DOT staff rapport**: Personal meeting builds relationship with DOT staff attorneys who will review formal application
- **Provides negotiation leverage with CPPIB**: If DOT informally confirms that specific governance modifications are required, GAH can cite DOT guidance when negotiating LLC Agreement amendments with CPPIB

**Cost**: $50,000-$100,000 (aviation regulatory counsel preparation time; travel to Washington, D.C. for meeting; follow-up documentation)

**Probability DOT Pre-Filing Consultation Reduces Timeline**: 60-70%

**Basis**: DOT encourages informal pre-filing consultations to avoid unnecessary formal proceedings. Airlines that engage DOT early and address anticipated issues proactively experience 30-60 day faster approval timelines than airlines that file "cold" applications without pre-filing dialogue.

#### 3. PURCHASE AGREEMENT CLOSING CONDITIONS (CRITICAL - DRAFT CAREFULLY TO ALLOCATE RISK)

**Objective**: Ensure Purchase Agreement includes properly drafted regulatory approval closing conditions that: (a) make Buyer's obligation conditional on DOT fitness approval, (b) allocate timeline risk between parties, and (c) provide Buyer walk-away right if DOT approval cannot be obtained or requires unacceptable conditions.

**Recommended Purchase Agreement Provisions**:

**Article 7.2(d) - DOT Fitness Approval Closing Condition:**

```
"Section 7.2(d) DOT Fitness Approval

Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Buyer in its sole discretion) of the following condition:

The U.S. Department of Transportation shall have issued a written order or determination (the 'DOT Fitness Approval') concluding that:

(a) The post-Closing ownership structure of Buyer, including without limitation the equity ownership interests of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and European Institutional Investors in Buyer's parent entity Global Aviation Holdings LLC, satisfies the citizenship requirements of 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15);

(b) Buyer's acquisition of the Company does not result in the Company being under the 'actual control' of non-U.S. citizens as defined by DOT precedent;

(c) Buyer possesses adequate financial fitness, compliance disposition, and managerial competence to acquire and operate the Company under 14 CFR Part 204 standards; and

(d) No conditions, restrictions, or ongoing monitoring requirements are imposed by the DOT that would, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Materially Burdensome Condition (as defined below).

**'Materially Burdensome Condition'** means any DOT-imposed condition or requirement that:

(i) Requires Buyer to maintain working capital or liquidity in excess of $500 million;

(ii) Requires Buyer's equity sponsors to post letters of credit, guarantees, or other credit support exceeding $100 million in the aggregate;

(iii) Restricts Buyer's ability to integrate the Company's operations with Buyer's other airline subsidiaries or portfolio companies;

(iv) Imposes governance requirements that prevent Buyer's equity sponsors from exercising ordinary governance rights typically accorded to majority equity owners; or

(v) Requires divestitures of assets, route authorities, or slots with aggregate fair market value exceeding $25 million.

If the DOT Fitness Approval is not obtained on or before [120 days prior to Outside Date], either Buyer or Seller may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d), and neither party shall have any liability to the other except for the provisions that survive termination pursuant to Section 9.3."
```

**Rationale**: This provision:
- Makes closing explicitly conditional on DOT approval, preventing Buyer from being obligated to close before obtaining DOT fitness determination
- Defines "DOT Fitness Approval" to include confirmation that restructured CPPIB governance satisfies actual control requirements (not merely that statutory percentage limits are met)
- Provides Buyer walk-away right if DOT imposes "Materially Burdensome Conditions" (protects Buyer from having to accept onerous DOT-imposed restrictions as condition of approval)
- Allocates timeline risk: if DOT approval not obtained 120 days before Outside Date, either party can terminate (prevents indefinite extension while waiting for DOT)

**Article 6.4(c) - Seller Covenant to Support DOT Application:**

```
"Section 6.4(c) DOT Fitness Application Cooperation

(a) **Seller Preparation of DOT Application Materials**: Within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer all information, documents, and certifications required for Buyer's DOT fitness application under 14 CFR § 204.3, including without limitation:

(i) Three years of audited financial statements for the Company;

(ii) Pro forma financial statements reflecting the post-Closing capital structure;

(iii) Description of the Company's compliance disposition, including all pending or threatened DOT or FAA enforcement actions;

(iv) Organizational charts showing the Company's corporate structure and management reporting lines;

(v) Biographies and qualifications of the Company's management personnel proposed to be retained post-Closing;

(vi) Copies of all material contracts affecting the Company's operations including Capacity Purchase Agreements, aircraft leases, airport slot authorizations, and international route authorities.

(b) **Seller Obligation to Settle Pending Violations**: Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to settle all pending DOT and FAA enforcement actions, violations, or proposed penalties before the Closing Date. If any such enforcement action remains unresolved as of the Closing Date, Buyer may (in Buyer's sole discretion): (i) waive the DOT Fitness Approval closing condition notwithstanding the unresolved enforcement action, (ii) require Seller to establish an escrow fund equal to 200% of the maximum proposed penalty to indemnify Buyer against ultimate penalty payment, or (iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d) if the unresolved enforcement action constitutes a Materially Burdensome Condition.

(c) **Joint DOT Pre-Filing Consultation**: Seller and Buyer shall jointly engage the DOT for pre-filing consultation regarding Buyer's ownership structure and anticipated fitness issues at least 60 days before filing the formal DOT fitness application. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in preparing materials for the pre-filing consultation and shall make Seller's regulatory counsel and management available to participate in meetings with DOT staff.
```

**Rationale**: This provision:
- Obligates Seller to provide all information needed for DOT application (prevents delays due to Seller withholding documents)
- Requires Seller to settle pending enforcement actions before closing (prevents DOT compliance disposition concerns from delaying Buyer's fitness approval)
- Mandates joint DOT pre-filing consultation (ensures Seller is committed to addressing DOT issues proactively rather than passively waiting for DOT to raise objections)

**Article 8.2(c) - Purchase Price Adjustment for DOT-Mandated Restructuring Costs:**

```
"Section 8.2(c) Adjustment for DOT-Mandated Restructuring Costs

If the DOT conditions its fitness approval on modifications to Buyer's ownership structure that require Buyer to incur costs exceeding $5 million in the aggregate (including without limitation legal fees, investment banking fees, financing amendment fees, or economic concessions to modified investors), the Purchase Price shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such DOT-mandated restructuring costs in excess of $5 million, up to a maximum Purchase Price reduction of $25 million.

**'DOT-Mandated Restructuring Costs'** include:

(i) Legal and advisory fees incurred to amend Global Aviation Holdings LLC's organizational documents to comply with DOT actual control requirements;

(ii) Fees paid to acquisition debt lenders to amend financing commitments to accommodate DOT-required ownership modifications;

(iii) Economic concessions (enhanced liquidation preferences, anti-dilution protection, increased distribution rates) granted to CPPIB or other investors as consideration for accepting reduced governance rights; and

(iv) Costs to identify, negotiate, and close replacement investors if existing investors refuse to accept DOT-required governance modifications.

Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice and supporting documentation of all DOT-Mandated Restructuring Costs within 10 business days after the DOT issues its fitness determination. The Purchase Price adjustment shall be effectuated by reducing the Cash Consideration payable at Closing."
```

**Rationale**: This provision:
- Allocates risk of DOT-mandated restructuring costs between Buyer and Seller
- Buyer absorbs first $5 million of costs (incentivizes Buyer to structure ownership efficiently)
- Seller bears costs exceeding $5 million up to $25 million cap (recognizes that Seller is receiving purchase price based on assumption that transaction can close without extraordinary DOT restructuring)
- Cap at $25 million protects Seller from unlimited exposure if DOT requires extensive restructuring

**Commercial Negotiation**: Seller will likely resist purchase price adjustment provision, arguing that DOT approval is Buyer's responsibility. **Buyer's negotiation points**:
- Transaction is predicated on Seller's representation that Company holds valid Part 119 certificate and satisfies DOT citizenship requirements
- If Company's acquisition by Buyer creates DOT citizenship concerns requiring restructuring, costs should be shared between parties
- $5 million Buyer deductible is substantial and incentivizes Buyer to minimize restructuring costs
- $25 million cap protects Seller from unlimited exposure
- Alternative: If Seller refuses purchase price adjustment, Buyer should demand lower base purchase price ($2.75B instead of $2.8B) to self-insure against DOT restructuring costs

#### 4. CPPIB CONSENT OBTAINED BEFORE SIGNING (CRITICAL - SEQUENCING MATTERS)

**Objective**: Obtain CPPIB's advance contractual consent to LLC Agreement amendments required by DOT **before signing** Purchase Agreement, eliminating risk that CPPIB refuses to cooperate after Purchase Agreement is signed and Buyer has committed to close subject to regulatory approvals.

**Sequencing Strategy**:

**Phase 1 (60-90 Days Pre-Signing)**: LOI Execution and CPPIB Consultation
- Execute non-binding Letter of Intent with Seller
- GAH sponsors consult with CPPIB regarding anticipated DOT citizenship concerns
- Present Virgin America precedent and DOT actual control analysis
- Explain that DOT fitness approval will likely require CPPIB governance rights restructuring
- Negotiate economic concessions (enhanced liquidation preference, anti-dilution, information rights) that GAH sponsors willing to grant CPPIB in exchange for governance rights modification

**Phase 2 (30-60 Days Pre-Signing)**: Negotiate LLC Agreement Amendment No. 1 with CPPIB
- Draft LLC Agreement Amendment No. 1 incorporating governance rights modifications described in Recommendation #1
- Obtain CPPIB investment committee approval for amended governance rights
- Execute LLC Agreement Amendment No. 1 **before signing** Purchase Agreement

**Phase 3 (0-30 Days Pre-Signing)**: DOT Pre-Filing Consultation
- Present restructured CPPIB governance rights to DOT in pre-filing consultation
- Obtain DOT informal confirmation that restructured governance satisfies actual control requirements
- Finalize DOT fitness application materials

**Phase 4 (Signing)**: Execute Purchase Agreement
- Purchase Agreement includes DOT Fitness Approval closing condition (per Recommendation #3)
- But GAH sponsors have already obtained CPPIB consent to governance restructuring, eliminating CPPIB cooperation risk

**Critical Point**: If Purchase Agreement is signed **before** obtaining CPPIB consent to LLC Agreement amendments, GAH creates risk that:
- Buyer signs Purchase Agreement obligating Buyer to close subject only to DOT approval
- DOT conditions approval on CPPIB governance rights restructuring (75-85% probability)
- CPPIB refuses to accept governance modifications without substantial economic concessions
- Buyer is trapped: cannot close without DOT approval (which requires CPPIB restructuring), but CPPIB demands consideration Buyer did not budget
- Buyer's alternatives: (1) pay CPPIB's demanded consideration (increasing deal cost), (2) replace CPPIB equity on short timeline (60-90 days, difficult to achieve), or (3) terminate deal and lose transaction costs ($10M-$20M in legal, due diligence, financing fees)

**Execution Phase Considerations**:

Obtaining CPPIB consent before signing requires GAH sponsors to:
- Invest $500K-$1M in DOT fitness analysis and CPPIB negotiation **before signing** (at-risk capital if LOI falls through)
- Extend LOI exclusivity period to 90-120 days (giving GAH time to resolve CPPIB issue before signing), during which Seller cannot negotiate with other buyers
- Accept risk that CPPIB refuses restructuring, forcing GAH to either replace CPPIB's equity or abandon transaction

**Benefit**: Eliminates deal-blocking risk (10-15% probability) that CPPIB refusal to accept DOT-mandated restructuring kills transaction after signing. Worth $280M-$420M in expected value protection (15% probability × $2.8B deal value × 67% deal termination probability if CPPIB refuses = $280M).

#### 5. FINANCIAL FITNESS PACKAGE PREPARATION (MEDIUM PRIORITY - COMPLETE 30 DAYS BEFORE DOT APPLICATION FILING)

**Objective**: Prepare comprehensive financial fitness package demonstrating GAH's adequate financial resources, working capital, and liquidity to address DOT concerns about leveraged acquisition structure (65% debt / 35% equity).

```
EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER
[GAH Sponsor Names]
[Date]

U.S. Department of Transportation
Office of Aviation Consumer Protection
1200 New Jersey Avenue SE
Washington, DC 20590

Re: Contingent Equity Commitment for SkyWest Regional Airlines

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned equity sponsors of Global Aviation Holdings LLC (collectively, the "Sponsors") hereby commit, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, to contribute additional equity capital to SkyWest Regional Airlines (the "Company") under the following circumstances:

**Contingent Equity Commitment**: If, at any time during the 24-month period following the Closing Date of the Sponsors' acquisition of the Company, the Company's liquidity (defined as unrestricted cash plus undrawn availability under committed credit facilities) falls below $300 million, the Sponsors shall contribute additional equity capital to the Company in an aggregate amount sufficient to restore the Company's liquidity to $400 million.

**Commitment Amount**: The Sponsors' aggregate contingent equity commitment under this letter shall not exceed $100 million.

**Conditions to Funding**: The Sponsors' obligation to fund contingent equity contributions shall be subject only to the following conditions:
(a) The Company has provided the Sponsors with 15 business days' prior written notice that its liquidity has fallen below $300 million; and
(b) The liquidity deficiency is not caused by fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence by the Company's management.

**Ranking**: Contingent equity contributions funded under this letter shall rank pari passu with existing equity interests in the Company.

**Termination**: This equity commitment shall terminate upon the earliest of: (a) 24 months after the Closing Date, (b) repayment in full of the Company's acquisition debt, or (c) the Company's liquidity exceeding $500 million for six consecutive months.

This letter is provided to the Department of Transportation for the sole purpose of demonstrating the Sponsors' financial commitment to the Company's adequate liquidity and working capital, and may be relied upon by the DOT in connection with its fitness determination for the Sponsors' acquisition of the Company.

Sincerely,

[GAH Sponsor Signatures]
```

**(e) Management Retention and Competence Certification**:

```
MANAGEMENT RETENTION COMMITMENT

Global Aviation Holdings LLC commits to retaining SkyWest Regional Airlines' existing management team for a minimum of 24 months following the Closing Date, including without limitation:

- [Name], Chief Executive Officer (U.S. Citizen)
- [Name], Chief Operating Officer (U.S. Citizen)
- [Name], Chief Financial Officer (U.S. Citizen)
- [Name], Director of Operations (U.S. Citizen, FAA-qualified under 14 CFR § 119.65)
- [Name], Chief Pilot (U.S. Citizen, FAA-qualified under 14 CFR § 119.67)
- [Name], Director of Maintenance (U.S. Citizen, FAA-qualified under 14 CFR § 119.69)

GAH shall provide these executives with retention bonuses and employment agreements ensuring their continued service during the post-acquisition integration period, subject only to termination for cause as defined in their respective employment agreements.

GAH certifies that all individuals proposed to serve in FAA-required management positions satisfy the qualification requirements of 14 CFR Part 119, including without limitation:
- Citizenship: U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents
- Experience: Possess aviation industry experience and technical qualifications required by 14 CFR §§ 119.65-119.71
- Compliance History: No disqualifying FAA enforcement actions or certificate revocations
```

**Package Submission**: Submit financial fitness package to DOT concurrent with formal fitness application, with cover letter specifically addressing DOT's historical working capital and debt service coverage concerns.

**Cost**: $200,000-$300,000 (accounting/valuation work, legal drafting, sponsor commitment negotiations)

**Probability Financial Fitness Package Reduces DOT Concerns**: 70-80%

**Basis**: Comprehensive financial package demonstrating (a) liquidity exceeding DOT three-month standard by 70%+, (b) debt service coverage ratio nearly 2.0x, and (c) sponsor contingent equity commitment addressing downside scenarios substantially mitigates DOT concerns about leveraged acquisition structure.

#### 6. SEQUENTIAL CLOSING STRUCTURE: DOT APPROVAL BEFORE UNITED CONSENT (MEDIUM PRIORITY - COORDINATE WITH CPA ANALYSIS SECTION)

**Objective**: Structure transaction timeline to obtain DOT fitness approval **before requesting United Airlines CPA consent**, enabling GAH to demonstrate regulatory approval to United and reducing United's basis for withholding consent.

**Recommended Timeline Sequencing**:

**Months 1-2 Post-Signing**: DOT Fitness Application Filing
- File comprehensive DOT fitness application incorporating restructured CPPIB governance, financial fitness package, and management retention commitments
- DOT 90-120 day review period begins

**Months 3-4**: DOT Fitness Review and Approval
- Respond to DOT requests for additional information
- Coordinate with DOT staff on any final concerns
- Obtain DOT fitness approval order

**Month 5**: United CPA Consent Request
- After obtaining DOT approval, submit United CPA consent request
- United's concerns about GAH financial fitness and regulatory compliance are substantially mitigated by DOT approval
- United consent timeline: 30-60 days

**Months 6-7**: Closing
- FAA certificate transfer final approval (runs concurrently with DOT/United processes)
- All regulatory approvals and CPA consents obtained
- Close transaction

**Rationale for Sequential Structure**:

United's CPA consent analysis (addressed in Section IV.B - Commercial Contracts) examines:
- GAH's financial stability and ability to perform CPA obligations
- GAH's regulatory compliance and likelihood of maintaining Part 119 certificate
- Foreign ownership structure and DOT citizenship compliance

If GAH requests United consent **before obtaining DOT approval**, United will:
- View CPPIB's 30% equity + veto rights as unresolved DOT compliance risk
- Demand that GAH obtain DOT approval before United grants consent (creating sequential dependency anyway)
- Potentially use DOT uncertainty as negotiation leverage to demand CPA amendments favorable to United

If GAH requests United consent **after obtaining DOT approval**, GAH can:
- Demonstrate conclusive DOT fitness determination eliminating United's regulatory compliance concerns
- Show that CPPIB governance has been restructured per DOT requirements
- Present DOT-approved financial fitness package proving adequate working capital
- Reduce United's basis for withholding consent from regulatory concerns to purely commercial negotiation

**Purchase Agreement Coordination**: Ensure Purchase Agreement closing conditions are structured to permit sequential satisfaction:

```
Section 7.2(d): DOT Fitness Approval [Condition precedent - must be satisfied first]
Section 7.2(e): CPA Consents [Condition precedent - can be satisfied after DOT approval]
Section 7.2(f): FAA Certificate Transfer [Condition precedent - runs concurrently, completes last]

Section 6.7: Parties agree that Buyer shall obtain DOT Fitness Approval before requesting CPA consents from United, Delta, and American. Seller shall cooperate with sequential approval process and shall not assert that Buyer has breached its obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain CPA consents solely because Buyer delays requesting such consents until after DOT Fitness Approval is obtained.
```
