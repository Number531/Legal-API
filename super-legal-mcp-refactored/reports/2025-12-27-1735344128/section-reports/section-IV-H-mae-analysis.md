## IV.H. MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ANALYSIS

### A. Legal Framework

#### 1. Delaware MAE Standard: The Foundational Doctrine

Material Adverse Effect (MAE) clauses serve as the critical "backstop" protecting buyers in M&A transactions from catastrophic developments between signing and closing. In the context of Global Aviation Holdings' proposed $2.8 billion acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines, MAE analysis is determinative: if United Airlines denies change-of-control consent and terminates the Capacity Purchase Agreement representing 46% of SkyWest's revenue, Delaware courts will highly likely (80-90% probability) find a Material Adverse Effect, entitling GAH to terminate the acquisition without liability.

The Delaware Chancery Court has articulated a demanding two-prong test that buyers must satisfy to establish an MAE:

**Prong 1: Materiality** — The adverse event, change, or effect must "matter" to a reasonable buyer in the specific industry context. Courts assess materiality from the long-term perspective of an informed acquiror, not based on short-term market reactions or operational disruptions.

**Prong 2: Durational Significance** — The adverse effect must be "durationally significant," meaning it affects the target's long-term earnings potential measured in years, not months. As Vice Chancellor Laster explained in *Bardy Diagnostics*, durational significance typically requires an impact period of five or more years, not merely one or two years.1

This high standard reflects Delaware's strong policy favoring deal certainty. Once parties sign a merger agreement, Delaware courts are reluctant to permit buyers to escape absent truly transformative deterioration of the target's business. As Chancellor Strine (now Chief Justice) articulated in *IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods*, "short-term hiccups in earnings should not suffice" to establish an MAE.2

#### 2. Seminal Delaware MAE Precedent

##### a. *Akorn, Inc. v. Fresenius Kabi AG* (2018) — First Successful MAE Defense

*Akorn, Inc. v. Fresenius Kabi AG*, 2018 WL 4719347 (Del. Ch. Oct. 1, 2018), represents the watershed moment in Delaware MAE jurisprudence: the first time a Delaware court upheld a buyer's termination of a merger agreement based on an MAE. The decision established critical benchmarks directly applicable to SkyWest's United CPA risk.

**Factual Background**: In April 2017, Fresenius Kabi AG agreed to acquire generic pharmaceutical manufacturer Akorn, Inc. for $4.75 billion ($34 per share). Following signing, Akorn's business performance "fell off a cliff": year-over-year revenue declined 25%, operating income dropped 105%, EBITDA fell 86%, and analyst valuations plummeted from $32 per share to $5-$12 per share.3 Akorn attributed the decline to loss of a key contract and unexpected competition. On April 22, 2018, Fresenius delivered a termination notice asserting MAE.

**Holdings**: Vice Chancellor Travis Laster ruled Fresenius could validly terminate the merger on three independent grounds: (1) Akorn suffered a general MAE, (2) Akorn breached representations regarding regulatory compliance with consequences constituting an MAE, and (3) Akorn materially breached ordinary course operating covenants.4 This marked the first time in Delaware M&A history that a court upheld an MAE defense.

**MAE Standard Articulated**: The Court defined a Material Adverse Effect as an event that has "materially impacted the earnings power of the company in a durationally significant manner."5 Key language establishes:

> "To qualify as material, the adverse effect must be material when viewed from the longer-term perspective of a reasonable acquiror... The Material Adverse Effect should substantially threaten the overall earnings potential of the target in a durationally-significant manner."6

**Critical MAE Factors from *Akorn***:
- **Revenue decline severity**: 25% year-over-year decline supported MAE finding
- **Customer concentration**: Loss of key customer contracts with high revenue concentration (similar to SkyWest's 46% United concentration)
- **Company-specific causation**: Decline attributable to target's specific circumstances, not industry-wide downturn
- **Permanence**: Decline represented structural transformation with no credible recovery path
- **Earnings power impact**: 86% EBITDA decline demonstrated fundamental deterioration of target's earnings capacity

**Relevance to SkyWest**: If United denies CPA consent and terminates the agreement, SkyWest faces a 46% revenue decline (exceeding *Akorn*'s 25% threshold) that is permanent (contract termination, not temporary disruption), company-specific (caused by GAH's acquisition, not industry conditions), and threatens earnings power (loss of highest-margin contract).7 The *Akorn* precedent strongly supports an MAE finding in the United CPA denial scenario.

---

##### b. *IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc.* (2001) — Temporary Disruptions Insufficient

*IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc.*, 789 A.2d 14 (Del. Ch. 2001), established the foundational principle that temporary earnings declines, even significant ones, do not constitute an MAE. This precedent is directly applicable to SkyWest's potential pilot strike scenarios.

**Factual Background**: On January 1, 2001, Tyson Foods agreed to acquire meat processor IBP, Inc. Post-signing, IBP disclosed disappointing fourth quarter 2000 and first quarter 2001 results. Tyson argued these results constituted a Material Adverse Change (MAC — the precursor term to MAE) entitling it to terminate. IBP sought specific performance to compel Tyson to close.

**Holding**: Vice Chancellor Strine (now Chief Justice of Delaware) rejected Tyson's MAC claim and ordered specific performance, requiring Tyson to complete the merger.8 The Court found IBP remained "a consistently but erratically profitable company" struggling to implement a strategy to reduce earnings cyclicality, but the poor quarters did not represent a fundamental transformation.

**MAE Standard Articulated**: The Court established that MAC clauses protect buyers from unknown or unsuspected developments that threaten or permanently damage the target's overall earnings for a significant period of time. Single-quarter earnings misses or temporary operational disruptions do not qualify as material from a long-term acquiror's perspective.9

Key language establishes the temporal requirement:

> "In the relatively short period between signing and closing, the target's business may suffer any number of adverse developments. If the contractual language swept away the buyer's obligation to close based merely on events having some adverse impact on the target, even an acquisition-hungry purchaser would have substantial reason to question its decision during the period leading up to closing."10

**Relevance to SkyWest**: A 30-day ALPA pilot strike causing $42.5 million in revenue loss (2.3% of annual revenue) clearly falls within *IBP*'s "short-term hiccup" category.11 Even a 90-day strike ($545 million loss, 29% of annual revenue) likely constitutes a temporary disruption if operations resume and customer contracts remain intact post-strike. However, if the strike causes permanent customer loss — specifically United terminating the CPA due to SkyWest's unreliability — then the *permanent consequence* (CPA termination) rather than the *temporary cause* (strike duration) determines MAE analysis.12

---

##### c. *Channel Medsystems, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp.* (2019) — Post-*Akorn* Reaffirmation of High Bar

*Channel Medsystems, Inc. v. Boston Scientific Corp.*, 2019 WL 6896462 (Del. Ch. Dec. 18, 2019), was the first Delaware MAE case decided after *Akorn*, and it confirmed that *Akorn* did not lower the traditional high bar for establishing an MAE.

**Factual Background**: In November 2017, Boston Scientific agreed to acquire medical device manufacturer Channel Medsystems, developer of the Cerene endometrial ablation device. In late December 2017, Channel discovered its VP of Quality Assurance had falsified FDA submission documents and stolen approximately $2.6 million from the company. Boston Scientific sent a termination notice claiming MAE on May 11, 2018. Before trial, the FDA approved Cerene on March 28, 2019.

**Holding**: Chancellor Andre G. Bouchard ruled Boston Scientific failed to prove an MAE and ordered specific performance.13 The Court found that FDA's subsequent approval of Cerene undermined claims of lasting regulatory harm and that Boston Scientific failed to demonstrate the quality assurance failures would have durationally significant impact on the target's long-term value.

**Key Principle**: *Akorn* did not relax MAE standards; buyers continue to face a heavy burden requiring proof of actual material harm with durational significance, not merely speculative future problems.14 The Court reaffirmed: "*Akorn* provides a clear example that a MAE can result from a 'dramatic, unexpected and company-specific downturn,' which continues to be a high threshold."15

**Relevance to SkyWest**: GAH cannot establish MAE based on speculative risks or disclosed uncertainties. For example, the mere fact that ALPA pilots authorized a strike (87% vote) or that CBA negotiations are in impasse does not constitute an MAE if no actual strike occurs and no permanent harm materializes. However, actual United CPA termination or actual 90-day strike causing permanent contract losses would satisfy *Channel Medsystems*' requirement of demonstrated actual harm.16

---

##### d. *Bardy Diagnostics, Inc. v. Hill-Rom, Inc.* (2021) — Durational Significance Requires 5+ Years

*Bardy Diagnostics, Inc. v. Hill-Rom, Inc.*, 2021 WL 5267748 (Del. Ch. Nov. 12, 2021), provides the most recent and detailed analysis of the "durational significance" requirement, establishing a critical benchmark: effects lasting less than five years typically fail the durational significance test.

**Factual Background**: In January 2021, Hill-Rom agreed to acquire cardiac monitoring device manufacturer Bardy Diagnostics for $375 million plus earnout. Post-signing, Medicare dramatically reduced reimbursement rates for Bardy's sole product (Carnation Ambulatory Monitor), threatening profitability. Hill-Rom sought to terminate based on MAE; Bardy sought specific performance.

**Holding**: Vice Chancellor Laster ruled the Medicare reimbursement reduction did not constitute an MAE and ordered Hill-Rom to close.17 The Court focused on whether effects were durationally significant: Hill-Rom's own projections showed Bardy would not be profitable until three years post-acquisition, and Hill-Rom acknowledged five-plus years would be durationally significant. The Court found the two-year period potentially affected by the rate decrease was insufficient for durational significance.18

**Critical Temporal Benchmark Established**:
- **2-year impact period**: Insufficient for durational significance
- **5+ year impact period**: Constitutes durational significance
- **Indefinite/permanent impact**: Clearly meets standard

Key language establishes:

> "The Delaware courts have consistently held that, to constitute an MAE, an event must have effects that are both sufficiently material and have durational significance (i.e., affect the long-term value of the company)."19

**Relevance to SkyWest**:
- **30-day strike**: Insufficient duration (weeks, not years)
- **90-day strike** (if operations resume): Insufficient duration (3 months, not 5+ years)
- **United CPA termination**: Permanent structural change affecting all remaining years of CPA term (2026-2033, 7 years) and indefinitely thereafter until replacement capacity secured (if ever) — clearly meets 5+ year threshold20
- **ALPA settlement increasing labor costs**: Ongoing annual expense for indefinite duration — meets durational threshold, but likely excluded by industry-wide effects carve-out (discussed below)21

---

#### 3. Delaware MAE Burden of Proof and Procedural Standards

**Burden Allocation**: The buyer asserting an MAE bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not).22 In practice, Delaware courts apply a heightened scrutiny approaching "clear and convincing evidence" given the policy favoring deal certainty.

**Quantitative Benchmark**: While no rigid formula exists, Delaware case law establishes an informal benchmark: sustained declines exceeding 40% in earnings or enterprise value create strong presumptions of materiality.23 *Akorn*'s 25% revenue decline combined with 86% EBITDA decline satisfied this standard; conversely, *IBP*'s single-quarter miss did not.

**Timing of Assessment**: Courts assess MAE as of the date the buyer seeks to terminate or as of the scheduled closing date, not retroactively based on post-termination developments. This creates strategic timing considerations: if GAH seeks to terminate based on MAE, it must demonstrate the MAE existed or was reasonably certain to occur as of the termination notice date.24

---

### B. Application to Transaction

#### 1. United Airlines CPA Consent Denial — Primary MAE Risk (80-90% Probability)

##### a. Factual Scenario

United Airlines Capacity Purchase Agreement represents $850 million in annual revenue (46% of SkyWest's $1.85 billion total revenue).25 The United CPA contains a change-of-control provision requiring United's written consent to any assignment of the agreement or transfer of substantial assets. GAH's acquisition of 100% of SkyWest's equity constitutes a change of control triggering this consent requirement.26

**Probability Assessment** (from Commercial Contracts Report):
- **20-30% probability**: United denies consent; CPA terminates 90 days post-change of control27
- **70-80% probability**: United provides consent, potentially with conditions (CPA term extension, enhanced performance metrics, financial assurances)28

If United denies consent, the consequences are catastrophic:
- **Immediate**: $850M annual revenue stream permanently lost
- **Redeployment costs**: $110-160 million to transition 45 aircraft to alternative capacity agreements (if available)29
- **Present value over remaining CPA term** (2026-2033, 7 years at 8% discount rate): $850M × 5.206 annuity factor = $4.425 billion total economic loss30
- **Margin compression**: United CPA likely has highest margins among SkyWest's capacity agreements; loss disproportionately impacts EBITDA (estimated 62% EBITDA impact assuming 70% contribution margins)31

---

##### b. Delaware MAE Analysis: *Akorn* Prongs Applied

**Prong 1: Materiality Analysis**

The loss of 46% of total revenue is objectively material to any reasonable buyer in the regional airline industry. Delaware courts assess materiality from the perspective of a "reasonable acquiror" in the specific industry, not an abstract standard.32

**Comparison to *Akorn* Precedent**:

| Factor | *Akorn* (MAE Found) | SkyWest United CPA Loss |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Revenue Decline | 25% year-over-year | 46% immediately and permanently |
| EBITDA Impact | 86% decline | Estimated 62-70% decline (loss of highest-margin contract) |
| Cause | Loss of key contract + competition | Loss of key contract (United CPA termination) |
| Customer Concentration | 57% customer concentration noted | 46% single customer (United) |
| Duration | Ongoing decline, no recovery path | Permanent unless replacement capacity secured (unlikely) |
| Industry Context | Company-specific | Company-specific (GAH acquisition-triggered) |

**Conclusion on Materiality**: SkyWest's United CPA loss is **more severe** than *Akorn* on revenue impact (46% vs. 25%) and comparably severe on EBITDA impact and permanence. The 46% revenue loss objectively "matters" to any reasonable acquiror under *Akorn*'s framework.33

**Regional Airline Industry Context**: The regional airline business model depends entirely on long-term capacity purchase agreements with major carriers. Unlike mainline carriers that sell tickets directly to passengers, regional carriers are essentially contract manufacturers with no independent revenue source. Loss of a CPA representing 46% of capacity fundamentally transforms the business model, reducing SkyWest to a 54%-capacity carrier with stranded aircraft and pilot contracts.34

---

**Prong 2: Durational Significance Analysis**

Under *Bardy Diagnostics*, durational significance requires an impact period of five or more years.35 United CPA loss satisfies this standard in multiple ways:

**Temporal Analysis**:
1. **Remaining CPA Term**: United agreement runs through 2033 (7 years remaining as of expected 2026 closing).36 Loss eliminates $850 million annual revenue for all 7 remaining years = permanent structural change.

2. **Indefinite Post-Term Impact**: Even beyond 2033, SkyWest cannot immediately replace 46% of capacity. Industry CPA negotiations take 6-18 months; major carriers (United, Delta, American) already have established regional partners; Alaska and other smaller carriers cannot absorb 45 additional aircraft (United's fleet commitment).37 The loss is not merely for the CPA's remaining term but indefinitely until (if ever) replacement capacity is secured.

3. **"Durationally Significant" vs. "Temporary"**:
   - *IBP*: Single quarter earnings miss = temporary, not durationally significant38
   - *Bardy*: 2-year revenue impact = insufficient; 5+ years = durationally significant39
   - **SkyWest CPA loss**: 7-year contractual term + indefinite post-term impact = clearly durationally significant

**Not a "Short-Term Hiccup"**: *IBP* excluded temporary operational disruptions from MAE analysis.40 United CPA termination is the opposite: a permanent, irrevocable loss of the company's largest revenue source. This is not a disruption from which SkyWest recovers; it is a fundamental transformation of the company's business model and scale.

---

**Company-Specific vs. Industry-Wide Analysis**

Delaware MAE provisions typically exclude "changes affecting the industry generally."41 United CPA loss does not fall within this exclusion:

**Company-Specific Factors**:
- Caused by **GAH's acquisition** (change of control), not by regulatory changes, economic downturn, or industry-wide pilot shortage
- **Only SkyWest** loses United CPA; Republic Airways, Endeavor Air, GoJet, and other United regional partners retain their agreements
- United's decision is specific to **GAH's creditworthiness, operational capabilities, or strategic concerns** about the new ownership structure42

**Not Industry-Wide**: If all regional carriers simultaneously lost major CPAs due to mainline carrier consolidation or regulatory changes, the "industry-wide effects" carve-out might apply. Here, the loss is entirely transaction-specific.43

---

##### c. Probability Assessment: Delaware Court Finding of MAE

**If United denies consent and CPA terminates, probability Delaware Chancery Court upholds GAH's MAE termination: 80-90%**44

**Rationale for High Probability**:

1. **Exceeds *Akorn* quantitative threshold**: 46% revenue loss > 25% threshold in the only successful MAE case
2. **Satisfies both prongs**: Clearly material (46% revenue) AND durationally significant (7+ years permanent loss)
3. **Company-specific causation**: GAH acquisition triggers consent requirement; loss is not industry-wide
4. **No credible recovery path**: SkyWest cannot replace 46% capacity quickly or possibly ever; unlike *IBP*'s cyclical meat processing business, this is structural transformation
5. **Objective "earnings power" impact**: $850M annual revenue disappears permanently, not temporarily

**Caveats Reducing Probability from 100% to 80-90%**:

1. **Delaware's Pro-Enforcement Policy**: Courts remain reluctant to find MAE given only one successful case (*Akorn*) in M&A history; strong policy favors deal certainty45
2. **Possible Recovery Arguments**: SkyWest might argue it can expand Delta (25% revenue) and American (23% revenue) CPAs or secure new partners (Alaska, Southwest regional operations), though evidence suggests this is speculative46
3. **MAE Definition Language**: Specific merger agreement language controls; if GAH-SkyWest agreement includes broad "customer consent" carve-out ("failure to obtain third-party consents shall not constitute MAE"), United CPA loss might be excluded47
4. **Knowledge Qualifier**: If merger agreement states MAE excludes "matters of which Buyer has Knowledge," and GAH conducted diligence on United CPA consent risk, exclusion might apply48

---

##### d. Strategic Implications for Deal Structuring

Given the 80-90% MAE probability if United denies consent, the transaction structure must address this binary risk:

**Option 1: United CPA Consent as Non-Waivable Closing Condition**

```
Section 7.2(a)(vii): United Airlines CPA Consent

The Company shall have received written consent from United Airlines, Inc.
to the assignment or change of control under the Capacity Purchase Agreement
dated [DATE], which consent shall be unconditional or subject only to
commercially reasonable modifications that do not reduce the expected net
present value of the United CPA by more than $50,000,000.

If this condition is not satisfied by [9 MONTHS POST-SIGNING], either
party may terminate this Agreement. Buyer may also terminate if United's
consent conditions are not commercially reasonable.
```

**Advantage**: Separates CPA consent from MAE analysis; GAH can terminate without proving MAE if United denies consent or imposes onerous conditions.49

---

**Option 2: CPA Consent Exclusion from MAE Definition (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

Some buyers might attempt to carve out "failure to obtain third-party consents" from the MAE definition. **This is strategically disadvantageous to GAH**:

```
"Material Adverse Effect" shall not include [...] (viii) any failure to
obtain consents from customers or suppliers, except to the extent such
failure, individually or in the aggregate, has a Material Adverse Effect.
[CIRCULAR DEFINITION - POORLY DRAFTED]
```

**Problem**: If United CPA loss is carved out of MAE, GAH loses walk-away rights even if the 46% revenue loss constitutes an obvious MAE under *Akorn* precedent. This benefits Seller (SkyWest) by forcing deal closure even if United denies consent.50

---

**Option 3: CPA Consent Escrow (Financial Risk Allocation)**

Rather than legal walk-away rights, allocate financial risk through escrow:

```
$500M CPA Consent Escrow:
- United consent obtained → $300M released to Seller
- Delta consent obtained → $75M released to Seller
- American consent obtained → $75M released to Seller
- 12-month performance (no CPA defaults) → $50M released to Seller
- Any consent denied → Buyer retains escrow up to documented damages
```

**Advantage**: Keeps deal alive even if United denies consent; financial adjustment compensates Buyer without requiring MAE litigation.51

**Recommended Structure**: **Combination of Option 1 (closing condition) AND Option 3 (escrow)**. Closing condition gives GAH unilateral walk-away right if consent denied; escrow provides additional financial protection if consent obtained but CPA later defaults.52

---

#### 2. ALPA Pilot Strike — Temporal Duration Determines MAE Risk

##### a. 30-Day Strike Scenario (2-5% Probability Within 12 Months)

**Factual Scenario**: ALPA pilots, having authorized strike by 87% vote, execute a 30-day strike following exhaustion of Railway Labor Act mediation processes (earliest possible date: December 2027, 18-24 months post-expected closing).53 Strike causes complete cessation of flight operations for 30 days.

**Financial Impact**:
- Direct revenue loss: $5.07M/day × 30 days = $152M (8.2% of annual revenue)54
- Restart costs: $10-15M (crew retraining, aircraft repositioning, schedule rebuilding)
- Reputational damage: Potential customer defections to competitors
- Total 30-day strike impact: $40-45M (including all costs)55

---

**Delaware MAE Analysis — *IBP* Controlling Precedent**:

**Materiality**: $45 million represents approximately 1.6% of the $2.8 billion purchase price and 8.2% of annual revenue. While non-trivial, this does not approach *Akorn*'s 25% revenue decline threshold or 40% informal benchmark for presumptive materiality.56

**Durational Significance — Fatal Flaw for MAE Claim**: Under *IBP* and *Bardy* precedent, 30 days is quintessentially a "short-term hiccup" insufficient for MAE:
- *IBP*: Single quarter earnings miss (90 days) insufficient57
- *Bardy*: Two-year impact insufficient; 5+ years required58
- **30-day strike**: One month operational disruption clearly fails durational significance test

**Post-Strike Recovery**: Critical to MAE analysis is whether operations return to normal post-strike:
- Pilots return to work under new CBA or after cooling-off period ends
- Flight schedules resume within 2-4 weeks of strike end
- Revenue returns to pre-strike levels within 60-90 days (assuming no permanent customer loss)
- SkyWest retains same fleet (145 aircraft), pilots (2,800), and CPAs (United, Delta, American)59

**The Business Remains Fundamentally Unchanged**: Post-strike, SkyWest remains a regional airline with $1.85B revenue capacity, 46% United CPA concentration, and ongoing operations. The 30-day disruption does not transform the company's earnings power or business model.60

**Probability 30-Day Strike Constitutes MAE: 5-10%**61

**Only Scenario Where 30-Day Strike = MAE**: If the strike causes **permanent secondary effects**, specifically United terminating the CPA due to unreliability. In that case, the MAE analysis shifts from "temporary strike" (insufficient) to "permanent CPA loss" (80-90% MAE probability per Section B.1 above). The *cause* (strike) may be temporary, but the *effect* (United CPA termination) is durationally significant.62

---

##### b. 90-Day Strike Scenario (10-15% Probability Within 24 Months)

**Factual Scenario**: Protracted strike extending 90 days (3 months) with complete operational shutdown.

**Financial Impact**:
- Direct revenue loss: $5.07M/day × 90 days = $456M (24.7% of annual revenue)63
- Restart costs: $30-50M (more extensive crew retraining, customer relationship rebuilding)
- Contract damages: Potential CPA penalty clauses for extended non-performance
- Reputational damage: Serious risk of permanent customer loss
- Total 90-day strike impact: $530-560M64

---

**Delaware MAE Analysis — Dual Scenarios**:

**Scenario A: Strike Ends, Operations Resume, No Permanent Customer Loss**

Even a 90-day strike, if followed by full recovery, likely fails durational significance:
- **Materiality**: 24.7% revenue loss approaches *Akorn*'s 25% threshold, suggesting materiality65
- **Durational Significance**: 90 days (3 months) is still temporary under *Bardy*'s 5-year requirement66
- Post-strike, SkyWest returns to $1.85B annual revenue capacity; 3-month disruption does not permanently damage "earnings power"67
- **Probability of MAE: 15-25%** — higher than 30-day strike due to magnitude, but still insufficient duration under *Bardy*68

**Scenario B: Strike Causes Permanent CPA Loss (United Terminates Due to Unreliability)**

If 90-day operational shutdown causes United to terminate the CPA citing force majeure, non-performance, or reputational concerns:
- **Primary MAE Driver**: United CPA termination ($850M annual revenue, 46% concentration) — not the strike itself
- **Causation**: Strike (temporary) → CPA termination (permanent) → MAE analysis focuses on permanent effect
- **Durational Significance**: CPA loss is permanent (7+ years remaining term + indefinite post-term) — clearly meets *Bardy* standard69
- **Materiality**: 46% revenue loss exceeds *Akorn* threshold70
- **Probability of MAE: 70-85%** — high probability because permanent consequence (CPA termination) satisfies both MAE prongs71

**Critical Distinction**: Delaware courts distinguish between the **event** (strike duration) and its **consequences** (permanent harm). *IBP* established that temporary events do not constitute MAE,72 but *Akorn* found that temporary causes producing permanent structural damage can satisfy MAE if the permanent consequences meet durational significance.73

---

**Correlation Risk: CPA Denial Increases Strike Probability**:

Financial Impact Analysis identifies a 0.6 correlation between CPA consent denial and increased strike probability.74 If United denies consent pre-closing, pilot morale deteriorates significantly:
- Pilots fear job security under new ownership without United's implicit backing
- ALPA negotiating leverage increases (GAH desperate to close without further complications)
- Strike probability escalates from baseline 2-5% to 8-12% (30-day) and 20-30% (90-day)75

**Cascading MAE Scenario**: United denies consent (20-30% probability) → pilots more likely to strike (probability doubles) → strike confirms United's concerns about GAH reliability → United formally terminates CPA → **combined probability of cascading failure: 8-12%** (0.25 probability CPA denial × 0.35 probability strike given denial)76

---

#### 3. Industry-Wide Labor Cost Increases — NOT MAE Under *IBP*

##### a. ALPA Pattern Bargaining Scenario

**Factual Background**: ALPA pilots nationwide are engaged in coordinated pattern bargaining across regional carriers (Republic Airways, Endeavor Air, GoJet Airlines, SkyWest). Industry pattern establishes 28-35% pay increases as the market-clearing rate to address regional-mainline pilot pay disparities and pilot shortage.77

**SkyWest ALPA Settlement Expected Terms**:
- Year 1 cost: $150-180M (includes 30% base pay increase, signing bonuses, improved work rules)78
- Annual ongoing cost: $110-115M (30% of current $378M annual pilot payroll)79
- EBITDA impact: 6.2 percentage point margin compression80
- Probability: 85-95% settlement within NMB mediation (late 2027); 2-5% strike risk81

---

**Delaware MAE Analysis — *IBP* Industry-Wide Exception**:

**Materiality**: $162M Year 1 cost represents 5.8% of purchase price and 56% of $285M EBITDA — objectively material in absolute terms.82

**Durational Significance**: ALPA contract is 3-year term (2026-2029) with automatic escalators, so impact extends minimally 3 years and likely 5+ years as subsequent contracts compound increases — meets *Bardy* durational threshold.83

**However: Industry-Wide Effects Exception Controls**:

Standard Delaware MAE definitions exclude "changes in Laws or industry conditions affecting the target's industry generally."84 *IBP* specifically held that industry-wide cost increases (feed costs, commodity prices affecting all meat processors) do NOT constitute MAE even if material and durationally significant to target.85

**Application to ALPA Costs**:
- **All regional carriers** face identical ALPA pattern bargaining (Republic, Endeavor, GoJet, SkyWest, Mesa)86
- United, Delta, American regional partners must all absorb similar 28-35% pilot pay increases
- Caused by nationwide pilot shortage and FAA-mandated training requirements (industry-wide regulatory factors)87
- **Not company-specific** to SkyWest; affects entire regional airline sector

**Conclusion**: ALPA labor cost increases, standing alone, do NOT constitute MAE under *IBP*'s industry-wide exception. Probability Delaware court finds MAE based solely on pattern bargaining labor costs: **10-20%**.88

---

**CRITICAL EXCEPTION — Cost Pass-Through Provisions**:

Whether ALPA costs constitute MAE may depend on **United CPA terms** (data gap requiring immediate due diligence):

**Scenario A: United CPA Includes Cost Pass-Through**
- If United CPA allows SkyWest to pass through labor cost increases to United (standard in many capacity agreements), ALPA settlement is financially neutral to SkyWest
- United bears the $113M annual incremental cost
- No earnings impact to SkyWest → no MAE → GAH cannot terminate89

**Scenario B: United CPA Has Fixed Rates (No Pass-Through)**
- SkyWest absorbs full $113M annual cost → 6.2% EBITDA margin compression → IRR falls below GAH hurdle rate
- Even though industry-wide, the **magnitude** of impact on SkyWest specifically (62% EBITDA reduction) could overcome industry-wide exception
- GAH could argue: While all regionals face labor increases, SkyWest's **inability to pass through costs** (unlike competitors with better CPA terms) makes this company-specific90

**URGENT ACTION REQUIRED**: GAH must obtain complete United, Delta, and American CPA contracts within 7-14 days to verify cost escalation/pass-through provisions. If no pass-through exists and $113M annual cost is unrecoverable, GAH should **renegotiate purchase price or terminate** pre-closing.91

---

#### 4. DOT Foreign Ownership Restructuring — De Minimis Impact (Not MAE)

**Factual Scenario**: GAH's ownership structure (60% U.S. sponsors, 30% CPPIB, 10% European institutional) totals 40% foreign voting equity, exceeding DOT's 25% statutory limit under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15).92 DOT fitness review (75-85% probability) requires restructuring CPPIB's 30% equity stake to non-voting or reducing ownership below 25%.93

**Financial Impact**:
- Direct restructuring costs: $5-15M (legal, advisory, CPPIB negotiations)94
- Timeline delay: 45-60 days for DOT approval95
- No operational impact on SkyWest's business

**Delaware MAE Analysis**:

**Materiality**: $5-15M represents 0.2-0.5% of $2.8B purchase price — clearly de minimis and fails materiality prong.96

**Durational Significance**: One-time restructuring cost with no ongoing impact — not durationally significant.97

**Conclusion**: DOT restructuring is a **regulatory approval condition**, not an MAE. Probability Delaware court finds MAE: **<5%**.98 GAH's remedy for DOT denial is termination under "Regulatory Approvals" closing condition (Section 7.2), not MAE provision.

#### 5. JetBlue Slot Dispute — Disclosed Litigation Not MAE Under *Bardy*

**Factual Scenario**: SkyWest and JetBlue dispute over 8 LaGuardia slots (valued $40-64M) regarding 80% usage requirements under 14 C.F.R. § 93.227.99 Settlement likely (85-90% probability) at $5-15M.100 If settlement fails, risk of FAA slot recall.

**Delaware MAE Analysis — *Bardy Diagnostics* Precedent**:

*Bardy* held that disclosed regulatory risks (FDA warning letter) known to buyer pre-signing do NOT constitute MAE if properly carved out in MAE definition.101 Similarly, if JetBlue dispute is disclosed in:
- SkyWest's disclosure schedules (Schedule 4.16 — Litigation)
- Due diligence materials provided to GAH
- SEC 10-K filings (Item 103 Legal Proceedings)

Then GAH had **knowledge** of the dispute pre-signing and cannot assert MAE based on known risks.

**Materiality**: Even assuming catastrophic loss (FAA recalls all 8 slots, $64M asset loss), this represents 2.3% of purchase price — marginal materiality.102

**MAE Definition Carve-Out**: Standard language: "Material Adverse Effect shall not include [...] (vii) matters disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules."103 If JetBlue dispute is disclosed, it is carved out by definition.

**Conclusion**: JetBlue slot dispute does NOT constitute MAE if disclosed. Probability: **<10%**.104 GAH's remedy is indemnification under Article IX (Seller liability for breach of litigation representations), not MAE termination.

### C. Risk Assessment

| MAE Scenario | Severity | Probability of Occurrence | Probability Court Finds MAE (If Occurs) | Buyer Walk-Away Right | Outcome |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **United CPA consent denied pre-closing** | CRITICAL | 20-30% | 80-90% | YES | **Most likely MAE scenario** — satisfies *Akorn* customer loss precedent; 46% revenue exceeds 25% threshold; durationally significant (7+ years permanent loss) |
| **30-day pilot strike (no CPA impact)** | MEDIUM | 2-5% | 5-10% | NO | *IBP* precedent controls: temporary disruption insufficient; operations resume, business unchanged |
| **90-day pilot strike (no CPA impact)** | HIGH | 10-15% | 15-25% | UNCERTAIN | Approaches *Akorn* 25% revenue threshold but still temporary under *Bardy* 5-year standard; likely insufficient duration |
| **90-day strike causes United CPA termination** | CRITICAL | 3-5% (cascading failure) | 70-85% | YES | Permanent CPA loss (not temporary strike) drives MAE; *Akorn* precedent applies to permanent consequence |
| **Combined: CPA denial + strike (correlated)** | CRITICAL | 6-10% (0.25 × 0.30) | 95%+ | YES | Cascading failure: CPA denial triggers pilot morale collapse → strike → confirms United concerns → formal termination |
| **ALPA/AFA labor costs alone (no CPA loss)** | MEDIUM | 90%+ (near certain) | 10-20% | NO | *IBP* industry-wide exception: pattern bargaining affects all regional carriers; not company-specific; standard MAE carve-outs exclude |
| **DOT foreign ownership restructuring** | LOW | 75-85% (requires action) | <5% | NO | De minimis cost ($5-15M); regulatory condition, not MAE; no operational impact |
| **JetBlue slot dispute** | LOW | 100% (exists currently) | <10% | NO | *Bardy* precedent: disclosed risk carved out; even $64M total loss only 2.3% of deal value |

**Key Insights**:

1. **United CPA consent is the DETERMINATIVE MAE trigger**: 46% revenue concentration makes this the transaction's Achilles' heel. All drafting efforts must ensure CPA consent is a non-waivable closing condition (Section 7.2), NOT carved out of MAE definition (Section 10.1).105

2. **Strike duration alone insufficient; permanent consequences required**: *IBP* and *Bardy* precedent establish that operational disruptions lasting weeks or even months do not satisfy durational significance unless they cause permanent harm (CPA termination, customer loss).106

3. **Labor cost increases excluded by industry-wide carve-out**: Unless GAH can prove company-specific harm (no cost pass-through while competitors have pass-through), ALPA costs fall within standard "industry conditions" exception.107

4. **Correlation/cascading risks compound MAE probability**: United CPA denial increases strike probability (0.6 correlation coefficient), which in turn confirms United's reliability concerns, creating a 6-10% probability of cascading MAE scenario.108

---

### D. Cross-Domain Implications

> **Cross-Section Impact**: MAE analysis synthesizes ALL material findings from Sections IV.A-G and determines whether they provide Buyer with walk-away rights under Delaware law:

**Section IV.B (Capacity Purchase Agreements) → Section IV.H (MAE)**:
- United CPA consent denial (20-30% probability, $850M revenue, 46% concentration) constitutes MAE with 80-90% probability under *Akorn* customer loss precedent.109
- MAE definition must NOT carve out "failure to obtain third-party consents" or GAH loses walk-away rights despite *Akorn* precedent supporting MAE.110
- Recommended structure: United consent as separate closing condition (Section 7.2(a)(vii)) PLUS inclusion in MAE definition (Section 10.1) for belt-and-suspenders protection.111

**Section IV.F (Employment & Labor) → Section IV.H (MAE)**:
- 30-day strike insufficient for MAE under *IBP* temporary disruption doctrine (5-10% probability).112
- 90-day strike insufficient standing alone (15-25% probability) unless causes permanent CPA termination (then 70-85% probability under *Akorn*).113
- ALPA labor cost increases ($162M Year 1) excluded from MAE by industry-wide effects carve-out under *IBP* (10-20% probability standing alone).114
- **CRITICAL DATA GAP**: United CPA cost pass-through provisions determinative of whether labor costs are economically material; if no pass-through, GAH should renegotiate purchase price pre-closing rather than rely on uncertain MAE claim.115

**Section IV.C (DOT Fitness/Foreign Ownership) → Section IV.H (MAE)**:
- DOT foreign ownership restructuring ($5-15M, 45-60 day delay) is de minimis and NOT MAE (<5% probability).116
- GAH's remedy for DOT denial is "Regulatory Approvals" closing condition termination, not MAE.117

**Section IV.D (Airport Slots) → Section IV.H (MAE)**:
- JetBlue slot dispute ($5-15M settlement, $40-64M if FAA recall) is disclosed litigation NOT constituting MAE under *Bardy* precedent (<10% probability).118
- Even catastrophic outcome ($64M slot recall) is only 2.3% of purchase price — fails materiality threshold.119
- GAH's remedy is indemnification (Article IX), not MAE termination.120

**Section IV.G (Securities Compliance/Disclosure) → Section IV.H (MAE)**:
- Item 303 MD&A disclosure requires SkyWest to disclose "known trends or uncertainties" that may cause MAE, specifically United CPA consent risk and ALPA negotiations.121
- Failure to disclose MAE risks could constitute securities fraud (Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5) if material misstatements in proxy materials.122
- GAH should verify SkyWest's proxy/8-K disclosures include adequate MAE risk factors for shareholder approval.123

### E. Recommendations

#### 1. MAE Definition Drafting (CRITICAL — Transaction-Determinative)

**Recommended MAE Definition for Section 10.1:**

```
"Material Adverse Effect" means any event, change, effect, development,
or circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with other events,
changes, effects, developments, or circumstances, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (a) the
business, results of operations, financial condition, or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) the ability of
Seller to consummate the Transactions;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that none of the following shall be deemed to
constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would be, a Material Adverse Effect:

(i) changes in general economic conditions or financial, credit, or capital
    market conditions generally, including changes in interest rates,
    exchange rates, or credit markets;

(ii) changes or conditions generally affecting the airline industry,
     including changes in fuel prices, aviation insurance costs, security
     requirements, or air traffic control delays;

(iii) changes in GAAP or applicable Law or the interpretation thereof, or
      changes in regulatory policies or enforcement priorities;

(iv) the announcement, pendency, or consummation of the Transactions,
     including (A) any loss of, or adverse change in, the relationship
     with customers, suppliers, lessors, or employees resulting from the
     announcement of the Transactions, or (B) compliance with the terms
     of this Agreement, including any action taken or refrained from at
     Buyer's request;

(v) any failure by the Company to meet internal or published projections,
    estimates, or expectations of revenues, earnings, or other financial
    metrics (PROVIDED that this clause (v) shall not prevent a
    determination that the underlying causes of such failures constitute
    an MAE unless such underlying causes are otherwise excluded by this
    definition);

(vi) acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, or
     other force majeure events;

(vii) any matter disclosed in Schedule 10.1 or the other Disclosure
      Schedules attached hereto;

(viii) changes in Labor Laws, collective bargaining obligations, or labor
       market conditions (including pilot or flight attendant shortages,
       wage inflation, or pattern bargaining) affecting the airline
       industry generally; PROVIDED that this clause (viii) shall not
       prevent a determination that an MAE has occurred if such changes
       have a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company relative to
       other similarly situated regional air carriers operating under
       capacity purchase agreements;

EXCEPT that any event, change, effect, development, or circumstance
referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (vi), or (viii) may be taken
into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred
to the extent it has a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other participants in the
airline industry.
```

**Key Drafting Points**:

1. **DO NOT carve out "matters of which Buyer has Knowledge"**: This would exclude United CPA consent risk (GAH knows about consent requirement from due diligence) and eviscerate GAH's MAE protection despite 46% revenue concentration satisfying *Akorn* precedent.124

2. **DO carve out "changes in labor market conditions affecting the airline industry generally"**: Clause (viii) implements *IBP*'s industry-wide exception for ALPA pattern bargaining, protecting GAH from seller arguing routine 30% pay increases constitute MAE.125

3. **DO include "disproportionate impact" exception**: The "EXCEPT" clause at the end ensures that even industry-wide changes (fuel costs, labor costs) can constitute MAE if they affect SkyWest **disproportionately** relative to peers. This preserves MAE claim if United CPA loss occurs (company-specific, not industry-wide).126

4. **DO NOT carve out "failure to obtain third-party consents"**: Some MAE definitions exclude "failure to obtain consents from customers or suppliers." **This language would be fatal to GAH's interests** because it would exclude United CPA consent denial from MAE analysis despite satisfying *Akorn* precedent. If Seller proposes this carve-out, GAH must reject it or negotiate narrow exception ("except for consents from customers representing more than 25% of annual revenue").127

5. **Clause (v) "failure to meet projections" carve-out preserves underlying MAE**: Standard language ensures that if SkyWest misses earnings projections, GAH cannot claim MAE based solely on the miss itself, but CAN claim MAE based on the underlying cause (e.g., United CPA termination causing the miss).128

---

#### 2. Closing Conditions Architecture (Dual Protection)

**Section 7.2(a): Buyer Closing Conditions**

Rather than relying solely on MAE, establish United CPA consent as a **separate closing condition**:

```
Section 7.2(a)(vii): Capacity Purchase Agreement Consents

The Company shall have received written consent from each of United
Airlines, Inc., Delta Air Lines, Inc., and American Airlines, Inc. to the
assignment or change of control contemplated by this Agreement under the
Capacity Purchase Agreements listed on Schedule 4.16(a), which consents
shall be unconditional or subject only to commercially reasonable
modifications that do not, individually or in the aggregate:

  (A) reduce the expected net present value of such Capacity Purchase
      Agreements by more than $50,000,000;

  (B) impose new termination rights not existing as of the date hereof;

  (C) reduce the Company's operational flexibility or impose performance
      metrics more stringent than those in effect as of the date hereof; or

  (D) require GAH or its Affiliates to provide financial guarantees,
      letters of credit, or other credit support in excess of $25,000,000
      in the aggregate.

If this condition is not satisfied on or before the date that is nine (9)
months after the date of this Agreement (the "Consent Outside Date"),
either party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(c)
without liability (other than Section 11.3 expenses), and Buyer shall
receive return of the Deposit.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this condition is IN ADDITION TO (and not
in lieu of) the Material Adverse Effect condition in Section 7.2(a)(i).
Buyer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to either: (A) failure to
obtain consents satisfying this Section 7.2(a)(vii), OR (B) Material
Adverse Effect pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) if circumstances indicate
loss or impairment of Capacity Purchase Agreements.
```

**Strategic Rationale**:

- **Dual protection**: GAH can terminate for EITHER failure to obtain consent (factual condition) OR MAE (legal standard). This eliminates risk that Delaware court finds 80% MAE probability insufficient.129

- **"Commercially reasonable modifications" standard**: Allows United to condition consent on reasonable terms (CPA extension, enhanced performance metrics) while preventing unreasonable demands (doubling penalty clauses, unlimited termination rights).130

- **$50M NPV threshold**: Permits modest concessions to secure consent (approximately 3-4% reduction in CPA value) while protecting against material impairment.131

- **9-month deadline**: Provides sufficient time for CPA consent negotiations (typical airline consent timeline: 6-9 months) while preventing indefinite closing delays.132

- **Belt-and-suspenders language**: Final paragraph clarifies that consent condition does NOT waive MAE rights, addressing potential Seller argument that specific consent provision displaces general MAE condition.133

---

**Section 7.2(a)(i): Material Adverse Effect Condition**

```
Section 7.2(a)(i): No Material Adverse Effect

(A) The representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article IV
    (other than the Fundamental Representations) shall be true and correct
    as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date
    (except for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific
    date, which shall be true and correct as of such date), except where
    the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
    correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
    expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and

(B) Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any
    Material Adverse Effect that is continuing.

For purposes of this Section 7.2(a)(i), the "Fundamental Representations"
(which must be true and correct in all material respects without
qualification for Material Adverse Effect) are:

    • Section 4.1 (Organization and Good Standing)
    • Section 4.2 (Capitalization)
    • Section 4.3 (Authority; Enforceability)
    • Section 4.16(a) (United Airlines Capacity Purchase Agreement)
    • Section 4.16(b) (Delta Air Lines Capacity Purchase Agreement)
    • Section 4.16(c) (American Airlines Capacity Purchase Agreement)
```

**Strategic Rationale**:

- **Separate prongs**: Prong (A) addresses breach of representations (false statements at signing); Prong (B) addresses post-signing MAE events.134

- **Fundamental Representations carve-out**: CPA representations (Section 4.16) are "Fundamental" and must be "true and correct in all material respects" without MAE qualifier. This means even immaterial inaccuracies in CPA disclosures give GAH walk-away rights.135

- **Why make CPA reps Fundamental?**: United, Delta, and American CPAs collectively represent 94% of revenue. Any misstatement about CPA terms, renewal rights, or termination provisions is material to deal value regardless of MAE analysis.136

---

#### 3. Bring-Down Mechanics and Knowledge Qualifiers

**Section 4.16: Capacity Purchase Agreement Representations**

```
Section 4.16: Capacity Purchase Agreements

(a) Schedule 4.16(a) lists all capacity purchase agreements, wet lease
agreements, and similar arrangements to which the Company is a party as of
the date hereof (collectively, the "CPAs"). True, correct, and complete
copies of the CPAs have been provided to Buyer.

(b) Each CPA is in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid,
and binding obligation of the Company and, to Seller's Knowledge, the
counterparty thereto, enforceable against the parties in accordance with
its terms.

(c) The Company is not in material default under any CPA, and no event has
occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default by the Company under any CPA.

(d) To Seller's Knowledge after reasonable inquiry of the individuals
listed on Schedule 1.1(a), (i) no counterparty to any CPA has indicated an
intention to terminate, not renew, or materially modify such CPA, and (ii)
no counterparty has withheld or indicated it may withhold consent to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) Schedule 4.16(e) identifies each CPA that requires counterparty
consent to the change of control or assignment contemplated by this
Agreement, including the United Express Agreement with United Airlines,
Inc., the Delta Connection Agreement with Delta Air Lines, Inc., and the
American Eagle Agreement with American Airlines, Inc.
```

**Knowledge Definition — Section 1.1(a):**

```
"Seller's Knowledge" or "to Seller's Knowledge" or similar formulations
means the actual knowledge of the following individuals after reasonable
inquiry of their direct reports with responsibility for the relevant
subject matter:

    (i)   [CEO Name], Chief Executive Officer
    (ii)  [CFO Name], Chief Financial Officer
    (iii) [CCO Name], Chief Commercial Officer
    (iv)  [CLO Name], Chief Legal Officer/General Counsel
    (v)   [COO Name], Chief Operating Officer

For purposes of Section 4.16 (Capacity Purchase Agreements), "reasonable
inquiry" shall include direct written or oral inquiry of:

    (A) the relationship manager for each CPA counterparty,
    (B) outside aviation counsel (if any) advising on CPA matters, and
    (C) any employee who has discussed CPA consent requirements with any
        counterparty within the twelve (12) months preceding the date
        hereof.
```

**Strategic Rationale**:

1. **Precise knowledge definition prevents disclaimers**: By requiring inquiry of specific personnel (CPA relationship managers, outside counsel), GAH prevents Seller from claiming lack of knowledge about United's likely consent position.137

2. **Schedule 4.16(e) forces disclosure**: Requiring Seller to identify CPAs requiring consent eliminates ambiguity about which agreements trigger change-of-control provisions.138

3. **"To Seller's Knowledge" qualifier**: Section 4.16(d) (counterparty intentions) uses knowledge qualifier because Seller cannot guarantee United's internal deliberations. However, Seller's knowledge standard requires reasonable inquiry, so Seller cannot ignore obvious warning signs.139

4. **Fundamental Rep status**: As discussed above, these CPA reps are Fundamental (Section 7.2(a)(i)), meaning GAH can terminate for breach regardless of MAE.140

---

#### 4. MAE Litigation Strategy (If Dispute Arises)

If GAH seeks to terminate based on MAE and Seller disputes, GAH should anticipate Delaware Chancery Court litigation under the following framework:

**Burden of Proof**: GAH (Buyer) bears burden of proving MAE by preponderance of evidence (more likely than not).141 In practice, Delaware courts apply heightened scrutiny approaching clear and convincing evidence.

**Specific Performance Remedy**: If GAH asserts MAE and refuses to close, Seller will file complaint in Delaware Chancery Court seeking specific performance (order compelling GAH to close). This triggers expedited trial (typically 60-90 days from complaint to trial).142

**Evidence GAH Must Present**:

1. **Quantitative Evidence**:
   - Financial analysis showing revenue decline (46% if United CPA lost)
   - EBITDA impact modeling (estimated 62% decline)
   - Comparison to *Akorn* 25% revenue / 86% EBITDA thresholds
   - Expert testimony from airline industry analysts on inability to replace United capacity143

2. **Qualitative Evidence**:
   - United's written consent denial (if available) or credible evidence consent will be denied
   - Industry expert testimony that 46% customer concentration loss is structural transformation, not temporary disruption
   - Evidence that redeployment of 45 United aircraft is commercially infeasible (no alternative CPA partners available)
   - Testimony that loss is permanent (7+ year remaining CPA term + indefinite inability to replace)144

3. **Rebutting Seller's Arguments**:
   - **Seller: "SkyWest can expand Delta/American CPAs to replace United"** → GAH Response: Delta (25%) and American (23%) already near capacity; expanding requires 2-3 years negotiation with uncertain outcome; speculative recovery does not negate permanent loss
   - **Seller: "This is 'change in customer relationship' carved out by MAE definition clause (iv)"** → GAH Response: Clause (iv) excludes relationship changes "resulting from announcement of Transactions"; United's consent denial is not mere relationship deterioration but contractual termination
   - **Seller: "GAH had Knowledge of consent risk"** → GAH Response: Knowledge of risk ≠ knowledge of occurrence; *Akorn* allows MAE even for known risk categories if actual event materializes145

---

**Timeline and Costs**:

- Delaware Chancery Court specific performance trial: 3-4 months from complaint to decision146
- Legal fees (both sides): $5-10M total (each party bears own fees absent prevailing party fee-shifting clause)147
- Outcome probability if United CPA denied: GAH prevails 80-90% (per *Akorn* precedent analysis above)148
- Outcome probability if 30-day strike only: Seller prevails 90-95% (per *IBP* temporary disruption precedent)149

---

#### 5. Alternative Risk Allocation Structures

If Seller resists MAE definition that preserves GAH's walk-away rights for United CPA loss, GAH should propose financial risk allocation alternatives:

**Alternative 1: CPA Consent Escrow** (Recommended in Financial Impact Analysis):

```
$500M CPA Consent Escrow:
  - Funded by Seller from purchase price proceeds at closing
  - Held by escrow agent (JPMorgan Chase) for 18-24 months
  - Released to Seller upon achieving milestones:
      • United consent: $300M released (6-9 months)
      • Delta consent: $75M released (9-12 months)
      • American consent: $75M released (9-12 months)
      • 12-month CPA performance (no defaults): $50M released (24 months)
  - If consent denied, Buyer retains escrow up to documented damages
  - Incentive alignment: Seller benefits from securing consents ($500M potential recovery)
```

**Advantage**: Keeps deal alive even if consent initially uncertain; financial adjustment compensates Buyer without requiring MAE litigation.150

**Disadvantage**: Does not provide GAH with walk-away right; GAH must close even if United denies consent, though retaining $500M escrow provides partial compensation for $4.4B NPV CPA loss.151

---

**Alternative 2: Representation & Warranty Insurance (RWI) Supplement**

```
$300M RWI Policy:
  - Coverage: Breach of CPA representations (Section 4.16)
  - Retention: $15M (GAH's first-dollar exposure)
  - Premium: $9-15M (3-5% of policy limit)
  - Exclusions: Forward-looking risks (CPA non-renewal) typically excluded;
    only covers breach of representations (false statements about existing CPA terms)
```

**Advantage**: Third-party risk bearer; cleaner transaction without escrow.152

**Disadvantage**: **CPA consent denial likely EXCLUDED from RWI coverage** because it is a forward-looking risk (event occurring post-closing), not a breach of representation (false statement about past/present facts). RWI typically covers only pre-signing misrepresentations, not post-signing developments.153

**Conclusion**: RWI is not viable substitute for MAE protection regarding CPA consent risk. GAH should pursue RWI for other risks (undisclosed litigation, regulatory violations, financial statement inaccuracies) but rely on MAE + closing condition for CPA consent.154

---

**Alternative 3: Contingent Value Rights (CVR) / Earnout**

```
$180M Labor Cost Adjustment Payment (ASAP):
  - Deferred payment due 18 months post-closing
  - Formula: IF ALPA Year 1 Cost ≤ $150M → Seller receives $180M
             IF ALPA Year 1 Cost = $165M → Seller receives $90M (linear)
             IF ALPA Year 1 Cost ≥ $180M → Seller receives $0
  - Purpose: Allocates ALPA settlement uncertainty between parties
```

**Advantage**: Addresses labor cost MAE risk (unlikely to succeed per *IBP* analysis, but provides financial hedge).155

**Limitation**: Does not address United CPA consent risk (separate mechanism required).156
