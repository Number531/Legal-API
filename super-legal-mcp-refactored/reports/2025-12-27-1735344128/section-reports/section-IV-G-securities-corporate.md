## IV.G. SECURITIES LAW & CORPORATE STRUCTURE

### A. Legal Framework

This section analyzes the securities law compliance, disclosure obligations, and corporate governance implications of Global Aviation Holdings LLC's ("GAH") proposed $2.8 billion acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines. The analysis addresses four critical areas: (1) target corporate structure verification and SEC disclosure requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (2) periodic reporting obligations for material risks under Regulation S-K Item 303 (Management's Discussion and Analysis); (3) board fiduciary duties under Delaware law; and (4) potential securities litigation exposure arising from disclosure failures or breach of fiduciary duty.

#### 1. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 - Periodic Reporting Requirements

Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires every issuer with securities registered under Section 12 to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.¹ These mandatory filings include:

- **Form 10-K**: Annual report containing audited financial statements, business description, risk factors, and management's discussion and analysis, due within 60-90 days of fiscal year-end (timing depends on filer status).²
- **Form 10-Q**: Quarterly report containing unaudited financial statements and updated MD&A, due within 40-45 days of quarter-end.³
- **Form 8-K**: Current report disclosing material corporate events within four business days of occurrence, including material acquisitions (Item 1.01), material dispositions (Item 2.01), and other specified triggering events.⁴

For acquisition transactions involving publicly-traded companies, Form 8-K Item 1.01 (Entry into Material Definitive Agreement) requires disclosure of the principal terms of the acquisition agreement within four business days of signing. If the target company constitutes a "significant subsidiary" under Regulation S-X Rule 1-02(w), pro forma financial statements must be filed within 71 calendar days of transaction closing (Item 2.01 - Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets).⁵

#### 2. Regulation S-K Item 303 - Management's Discussion and Analysis

Regulation S-K Item 303 mandates that MD&A disclosure in Forms 10-K and 10-Q include management's analysis of "known trends, events, uncertainties and other prospective information."⁶ The Supreme Court established the materiality standard for MD&A disclosure in *TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.*:

> "[A]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote... [or] if there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available."⁷

The SEC's 1989 interpretive release on MD&A clarified that Item 303 requires disclosure of:
- Known trends or uncertainties that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.
- Material events and uncertainties known to management that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial condition.⁸

Courts have held that Item 303 creates an affirmative duty to disclose material trends even in the absence of a specific SEC rule requiring disclosure. In *In re Tesla Motors, Inc. Securities Litigation*, the Northern District of California held that "Item 303 requires disclosure of material information even when no specific line item mandates it," and failure to disclose constitutes a material omission actionable under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.⁹

#### 3. Regulation S-K Item 101(h) - Customer Concentration Disclosure

Item 101(h) of Regulation S-K requires disclosure in annual reports when revenues from a single customer or a small group of customers constitute a significant portion of registrant's revenues:

> "If revenues from a single customer or a few customers are a significant portion of the registrant's revenues, the registrant shall disclose the identity of the customer or customers and the amount of revenues from those customers... [and] the impact of the loss of such customers."¹⁰

SEC staff guidance interprets "significant portion" as 10% or more of total revenues. Regional airlines with capacity purchase agreement (CPA) concentration routinely disclose major airline customers exceeding this threshold. Mesa Air Group, for example, discloses 100% revenue concentration with United Airlines and warns that "loss of our United CPA would have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in bankruptcy or liquidation."¹¹

#### 4. Regulation S-K Item 103 - Legal Proceedings Disclosure

Item 103 requires disclosure of any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business. Specifically, registrants must disclose:
- Bankruptcy or receivership proceedings.
- Material proceedings involving governmental authorities where sanctions exceeding $300,000 may be imposed.
- Other material proceedings, considering both the amount involved and the potential effect on the business.¹²

The $300,000 threshold for environmental and governmental proceedings establishes a bright-line rule, but registrants must exercise judgment regarding materiality for other litigation based on qualitative and quantitative factors.

#### 5. Delaware Fiduciary Duty Standards for Board of Directors

Delaware law imposes two fundamental fiduciary duties on corporate directors: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. In most business decisions, directors receive the protection of the business judgment rule, which "is a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company."¹³

However, in certain contexts—particularly change-of-control transactions—Delaware courts apply enhanced scrutiny. Two key doctrines govern acquisition transactions:

**Revlon Duties (Sale of Control)**: When a board decides to sell the company or effect a change of control, directors must seek to obtain the highest value reasonably available for shareholders. Enhanced scrutiny applies, and directors must demonstrate they acted reasonably to secure the best available transaction for stockholders.¹⁴ This typically requires:
- A pre-signing market check (soliciting competitive bids) or post-signing "go-shop" period.
- A competitive bidding process or compelling evidence that alternatives were explored.
- Reasonable deal protection measures (break-up fees limited to 2-4% of transaction value).
- An independent financial advisor's fairness opinion.

*Revlon* duties apply when: (1) a company initiates an active bidding process seeking to sell itself; (2) the company abandons its long-term strategy and seeks an alternative transaction involving breakup of the company; or (3) approval of a transaction results in a "sale or change of control" (typically defined as acquisition by a single buyer or control group).¹⁵

**Corwin Cleansing (Stockholder Vote Ratification)**: In *Corwin v. KKR Financial Holdings LLC*, the Delaware Supreme Court held that when a merger that is not subject to the entire fairness standard of review is approved by a fully-informed, uncoerced vote of the disinterested stockholders, the business judgment rule standard of review applies.¹⁶ This stockholder vote "cleanses" the transaction, replacing enhanced Revlon scrutiny with deferential business judgment review. The cleansing effect requires:
- A fully-informed stockholder vote (no material disclosure deficiencies).
- Majority-of-minority approval (disinterested stockholders comprise voting majority).
- No coercion (stockholders free to reject transaction without penalty).

If *Corwin* applies, post-closing litigation challenging the transaction faces a high bar: plaintiffs must plead waste (no rational person would view consideration as fair) to overcome business judgment protection.

#### 6. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 - Securities Fraud Liability

Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 prohibit fraudulent or deceptive practices in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.¹⁷ To establish a securities fraud claim, plaintiffs must prove:
1. A material misrepresentation or omission.
2. Scienter (intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud).
3. Connection between the misstatement or omission and the purchase or sale of a security.
4. Reliance on the misstatement or omission.
5. Economic loss.
6. Loss causation (causal connection between the material misrepresentation and loss).¹⁸

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) heightened pleading standards for securities fraud claims, requiring plaintiffs to plead facts giving rise to a "strong inference" of scienter—meaning the inference must be "cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged."¹⁹

#### 7. Delaware Material Adverse Effect (MAE) Doctrine

Delaware courts define a Material Adverse Effect as an event or circumstance that "substantially threatens the overall earnings potential of the target in a durationally-significant manner."²⁰ In *IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc.*, Vice Chancellor (now Chief Justice) Strine articulated the foundational MAE standard:

> "A Material Adverse Effect is a backstop protecting the acquiror from the occurrence of unknown events that substantially threaten the overall earnings potential of the target in a durationally-significant manner. A short-term hiccup in earnings should not suffice."²¹

For 17 years following *IBP* (2001-2018), no Delaware court found that an MAE had occurred—until *Akorn, Inc. v. Fresenius Kabi AG*.²² In *Akorn*, Vice Chancellor Laster found an MAE where the target suffered:
- 25% revenue decline year-over-year.
- 86% EBITDA decline.
- Loss of key customer contract.
- Fundamental business deterioration with no recovery path.

The Court held this constituted a "dramatic, unexpected and company-specific downturn" meeting the MAE threshold.²³ Subsequent decisions confirm *Akorn* did not lower the MAE bar—buyers continue to face a heavy burden proving material, durationally-significant harm.²⁴

---

### B. Application to Transaction

#### 1. Target Corporate Structure: Entity Verification Required

**Critical Issue Identified**: The transaction documents describe the target as "SkyWest Regional Airlines" with $1.85 billion annual revenue and $285 million EBITDA. However, SEC EDGAR research identified **SkyWest, Inc. (NASDAQ: SKYW, CIK 0000793733)** as a publicly-traded Delaware corporation that filed a Form 10-K on February 13, 2025, reporting **$3,527.9 million revenue** for fiscal year 2024—nearly double the stated transaction revenue.²⁵

**Corporate Structure Verification** (from SEC filings):
- **SkyWest, Inc.** (parent holding company, publicly traded on NASDAQ)
  - **SkyWest Airlines** (wholly-owned operating subsidiary)
  - **SkyWest Leasing** (aircraft leasing segment)
  - **25% ownership stake in Contour Airlines** (Part 135 charter operator)

The revenue discrepancy creates entity identification uncertainty. Three scenarios explain the $1.85B vs. $3.53B gap:

**Scenario A - Subsidiary Carve-Out Transaction**: GAH is acquiring SkyWest Airlines (the operating subsidiary), representing approximately 52% of SkyWest Inc.'s consolidated operations. This structure would require:
- SkyWest Inc. Form 8-K filing under Item 2.01 (Disposition of Assets) within four business days of closing.
- Stockholder approval under Delaware General Corporation Law § 271 if SkyWest Airlines constitutes "substantially all assets" of the parent corporation.²⁶
- Proxy Statement (Schedule 14A) with fairness opinion if stockholder vote required.²⁷
- Appraisal rights disclosure (DGCL § 262) allowing dissenting stockholders to seek judicial valuation.²⁸

**Scenario B - Going-Private Transaction**: GAH is acquiring 100% of SkyWest Inc. stock (taking the public company private). This structure would require:
- Schedule 13E-3 filing disclosing fairness of the going-private transaction.²⁹
- Rule 13e-3 fairness analysis and detailed disclosure to public shareholders.
- Proxy statement with fairness opinion and management projections.
- Potential tender offer compliance (if structured as cash tender followed by squeeze-out merger).

**Scenario C - Alternative Regional Carrier**: "SkyWest Regional Airlines" is a separate entity unaffiliated with publicly-traded SkyWest Inc. This scenario is unlikely given name similarity, industry context, and the fact that no other "SkyWest" airline operates in the United States.

**Recommendation**: Obtain immediate confirmation of target entity legal name, corporate structure, and relationship (if any) to publicly-traded SkyWest Inc. If the target is SkyWest Airlines (subsidiary), coordinate SEC disclosure timeline with transaction signing and closing schedule, and prepare for potential proxy process adding 60-90 days to closing timeline.

#### 2. Buyer Ownership Structure: CPPIB Minority Investor Governance

**GAH Ownership Composition**:
- 60% U.S. Private Equity Sponsors
- 30% Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB)
- 10% European Institutional Investors

**CPPIB Special Rights** (per transaction facts):
- Board observer seat (non-voting but access to confidential board materials)
- Veto rights over: (a) capital structure changes, (b) major asset sales, (c) new debt issuance above undisclosed threshold

While CPPIB's 30% minority equity position does not create securities law filing obligations for GAH (which is a private entity), it creates **DOT fitness review complications** and **governance structure risks** that could impact post-acquisition operations and potentially trigger disclosure obligations for the target (if publicly traded) or the buyer (if debt is publicly issued).

**Securities Law Implications**:
- If GAH issues high-yield bonds to finance the acquisition, bond offering documents (Rule 144A private placement memorandum or SEC-registered offering) must disclose CPPIB's 30% ownership and special governance rights as material risk factors.
- If SkyWest Inc. is the target (public company), proxy statement must disclose buyer ownership structure and any post-closing governance arrangements that affect target stockholder interests.
- CPPIB veto rights over capital structure and debt issuance could constrain post-acquisition financial flexibility, requiring disclosure as a material limitation on management's ability to execute growth strategy.

#### 3. Regulation S-K Item 303 MD&A Disclosure Analysis

Item 303 requires disclosure of "known trends or uncertainties" reasonably likely to have a material effect on financial condition or operating results.³⁰ This analysis evaluates whether risks identified in other sections of this memorandum trigger affirmative MD&A disclosure obligations for both the target (in its next periodic report) and the buyer (in any post-acquisition public filings).

**Finding 1: United Airlines CPA Consent Requirement (46% Revenue Concentration)**

**Facts** (from Section IV.B - Commercial Contracts Analysis):
- United CPA represents $850 million annual revenue (46% of total).
- Industry-standard CPAs contain change-of-control consent provisions.
- Consent withheld in 20-30% of airline M&A transactions; United has leverage to demand enhanced terms or deny consent.
- Expected value exposure: $430.8 million (probability-weighted).³¹

**Materiality Analysis**:
- Quantitatively material: 46% revenue concentration exceeds all SEC materiality thresholds (10% bright-line rule; 5% SAB 99 qualitative guidance).³²
- Qualitatively material: Loss of United CPA would fundamentally transform business model; regional airline cannot operate at profitable scale with 54% of prior capacity.
- Known trend: Change-of-control event is planned and certain; consent requirement is known; United's discretion to withhold creates uncertainty reasonably likely to affect future operations.

**Item 303 Disclosure Required**: **YES - Both Target and Buyer**

**Target Disclosure** (in next Form 10-Q or 10-K):
> "On [date], the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with Global Aviation Holdings LLC providing for GAH's acquisition of the Company for $2.8 billion. The transaction requires consent from United Airlines, which currently accounts for approximately 46% of the Company's annual revenue under a capacity purchase agreement. United has the right to withhold consent to the change of control or to condition consent on modified CPA terms. If United withholds consent and terminates the CPA, the Company's revenue, operating results, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that United consent will be obtained or that the transaction will close."

**Buyer Disclosure** (in Form 8-K announcing transaction, or in any public debt offering):
> "The acquisition is subject to receipt of consents from United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines under their respective capacity purchase agreements with SkyWest. United represents 46% of SkyWest's revenue. Failure to obtain United's consent would permit GAH to terminate the merger agreement and would likely result in loss of the United CPA, which could prevent the transaction from closing or materially impair the value of the acquired business."

**Precedent**: In *In re Bausch & Lomb, Inc. Securities Litigation*, plaintiffs alleged that Bausch & Lomb violated Item 303 by failing to disclose a known adverse trend (declining contact lens sales in key markets). The Second Circuit held that Item 303 creates liability for failure to disclose material trends even when no specific SEC rule mandates disclosure.³³

**Finding 2: ALPA Contract Settlement Costs ($150M-$180M Year 1)**

**Facts** (from Section IV.F - Employment & Labor Analysis):
- Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) CBA expires December 31, 2026 (12 months post-expected closing).
- Negotiations commenced August 2024; parties reached impasse January 2026.
- Expected settlement: 28-35% pay increase = $150M-$180M Year 1 total cost ($110M-$115M annual run-rate).
- Probability: 85-95% settlement during National Mediation Board mediation; 2-5% strike risk within 12 months.³⁴
- Impact: 6.2% EBITDA margin compression; reduces acquirer's projected internal rate of return by 100-200 basis points.

**Materiality Analysis**:
- Quantitatively material: $150M-$180M represents 53-63% of stated $285M EBITDA; 8-10% of $1.85B revenue.
- Qualitatively material: Transforms post-acquisition economics; affects buyer's ability to service acquisition debt; labor cost is largest operating expense for regional airlines.
- Known trend: CBA expiration is certain; industry pattern bargaining (United pilots settled for 34.5% increase in 2023; Delta 30% in 2023; American 41% in 2023) establishes reasonable expectation of 28-35% settlement.³⁵
- Durational significance: Annual run-rate cost continues indefinitely; not a one-time expense.

**Item 303 Disclosure Required**: **YES - Post-Closing MD&A**

If the target is SkyWest, Inc. (publicly traded), the company's Form 10-Q filed after acquisition closing must disclose:
> "The Company's pilot collective bargaining agreement expires on December 31, 2026. Negotiations with the Air Line Pilots Association commenced in August 2024 and reached impasse in January 2026. The parties are currently in National Mediation Board mediation. Based on recent industry pattern bargaining settlements (United 34.5%, Delta 30%, American 41%), management expects a settlement resulting in pilot pay increases of 28-35%, which would increase annual operating expenses by approximately $110-115 million on a run-rate basis. This increase would compress EBITDA margins by approximately 6 percentage points. The Company's capacity purchase agreements [include/do not include] cost pass-through provisions that would allow the Company to recover increased labor costs through higher rates charged to airline partners."

**Critical Data Gap**: Whether United, Delta, and American CPAs include labor cost pass-through provisions is **determinative of economic impact**. If CPAs include cost-plus pricing, the $110M annual increase is borne by airline partners (neutral to SkyWest). If CPAs have fixed rates, SkyWest bears the full cost (6.2% margin compression, potentially below debt covenant thresholds). Disclosure must clarify which scenario applies.

**Finding 3: Foreign Ownership Restructuring (DOT Fitness Review)**

**Facts** (from Section IV.C - Regulatory Analysis):
- GAH's ownership structure: 40% foreign equity (30% CPPIB + 10% European) exceeds DOT's 25% voting equity limit under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15).
- CPPIB holds three veto rights (capital structure, asset sales, debt) creating "actual control" issue under Virgin America precedent.³⁶
- Probability DOT requires restructuring: 75-85%.
- Timeline impact: 30-60 days additional negotiation with CPPIB; potential deal delay or termination if CPPIB unwilling to modify governance rights.

**Materiality Analysis**:
- Qualitatively material: DOT fitness approval is mandatory regulatory closing condition; failure to obtain approval terminates transaction.
- Uncertainty about regulatory approval timeline creates uncertainty about ability to close transaction.
- CPPIB restructuring may require renegotiating buyer equity arrangements, potentially affecting purchase price or deal terms.

**Item 303 Disclosure Required**: **YES - Conditional Disclosure**

If transaction is publicly disclosed via Form 8-K or proxy statement:
> "The transaction is subject to receipt of DOT fitness approval under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15). GAH's ownership structure includes 30% equity held by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and 10% held by European institutional investors. GAH's current governance structure may require modification to satisfy DOT's citizenship requirements, which mandate at least 75% of voting equity be held by U.S. citizens and that the carrier be under 'actual control' of U.S. citizens. GAH is engaged in discussions to restructure CPPIB's governance rights to address DOT requirements. There can be no assurance that the necessary restructuring will be completed or that DOT approval will be obtained, and failure to obtain approval would prevent the transaction from closing."

**Finding 4: Airport Slots Portfolio (10.9% of Purchase Price)**

**Facts** (from Section IV.D - Regulatory Analysis):
- SkyWest holds 32 LaGuardia slot pairs + 24 Reagan National slot pairs.
- Estimated fair market value: $304 million (baseline valuation).³⁷
- Slots represent 10.9% of $2.8B purchase price.
- Material asset requiring separate identification in ASC 805 purchase price allocation.

**Materiality Analysis**:
- Quantitatively material: 10.9% of purchase price exceeds SEC's 5% quantitative materiality threshold.
- Slots are intangible assets with indefinite useful life (no amortization under ASC 350-30).
- FAA slot recapture risk: If SkyWest fails to maintain 80% usage (14 C.F.R. § 93.227), FAA may recall slots.³⁸

**Item 303 Disclosure Required**: **PARTIAL - Asset Description, Not Uncertainty**

SEC staff guidance requires disclosure of material intangible assets in Item 1 (Business Description) but does not require forward-looking disclosure unless specific uncertainty exists. If no active slot disputes or usage compliance issues, disclosure limited to:
> "As of December 31, 2024, the Company holds 32 slot pairs at LaGuardia Airport and 24 slot pairs at Reagan National Airport, with an estimated fair market value of approximately $304 million (10.9% of total assets). These slots are held under FAA grandfather rights and are subject to continued usage requirements under 14 C.F.R. § 93.227 (use-or-lose rule)."

**Exception**: If JetBlue slot dispute identified in transaction due diligence involves SkyWest-leased slots with usage compliance issues, Item 303 disclosure required regarding risk of FAA slot recall.

#### 4. Regulation S-K Item 103 Legal Proceedings Disclosure

Item 103 requires disclosure of material pending legal proceedings and any proceeding involving governmental sanctions exceeding $300,000.³⁹ This analysis evaluates litigation and enforcement matters identified in specialist reports.

**Proceeding 1: DOT Tarmac Delay Violation (March 2024)**

**Facts** (from Section IV.E - Regulatory Enforcement):
- Incident date: March 2024 (Winter Storm Elliott).
- Alleged violation: 14 C.F.R. § 259.4(b) (tarmac delay exceeding 3 hours for domestic flight).
- Proposed penalty: $100,000-$500,000 (estimated based on DOT precedent).⁴⁰
- Mitigation: Extraordinary weather circumstances (Bomb Cyclone Elliott); airport coordination issues beyond carrier control.
- Settlement probability: 85-90% at $75,000-$200,000.

**Item 103 Disclosure Analysis**:
- **Threshold**: Potential sanctions exceed $300,000 threshold → Disclosure required.
- **Materiality**: $100K-$500K penalty is not quantitatively material to $1.85B revenue company, but disclosure mandatory under $300K bright-line rule.

**Required Disclosure**:
> "In March 2024, the Company experienced a tarmac delay exceeding three hours during Winter Storm Elliott. The Department of Transportation has proposed a civil penalty in the range of $100,000 to $500,000 under 14 C.F.R. § 259.4(b). The Company is engaged in settlement discussions with DOT and believes the delay resulted from extraordinary weather circumstances beyond its control. Management believes the matter will be resolved through payment of a settlement amount materially lower than the proposed penalty, and the outcome is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations."

**Proceeding 2: FAA Maintenance Records Violation**

**Facts** (from Section IV.E - Regulatory Enforcement):
- Proposed civil penalty: $25,000 (settled).
- Violation: 14 C.F.R. § 121.369 (maintenance record-keeping discrepancies).
- No safety incidents; technical record-keeping deficiency.

**Item 103 Disclosure Analysis**:
- **Below $300,000 threshold**: No mandatory disclosure.
- **Immaterial**: $25K penalty represents 0.0014% of revenue; no disclosure required.

**Proceeding 3: EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination Charge**

**Facts** (from Section IV.F - Employment & Labor Analysis):
- EEOC investigation issued "reasonable cause" finding.
- Charging party alleges failure to accommodate pregnancy under Pregnancy Workers Fairness Act.
- Settlement range: $125,000-$250,000 (individual claim).
- Class action risk: 40-55% probability; potential exposure $2.5M-$15M if certified.⁴¹

**Item 103 Disclosure Analysis**:
- **Individual claim below threshold**: $125K-$250K < $300K → No mandatory disclosure.
- **Class action potential**: If class certified, exposure exceeds $300K → Disclosure required.
- **Qualitative materiality**: PWFA statute new (effective June 2023); sets precedent for company accommodation practices; affects 2,600 flight attendants.

**Recommended Disclosure** (prudent practice even if not technically required):
> "The Company is responding to an EEOC charge alleging failure to accommodate an employee's pregnancy-related restrictions under the Pregnancy Workers Fairness Act of 2022. The EEOC has issued a reasonable cause finding and invited the parties to participate in conciliation. The Company denies any violation and believes its accommodation practices comply with applicable law. Management believes the matter will be resolved through settlement or, if litigation ensues, the Company will defend vigorously. The Company is reviewing its accommodation policies to ensure compliance with the PWFA, which became effective in June 2023. Based on information currently available, management does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations."

**Additional Note**: If EEOC conciliation fails and charging party files a civil lawsuit that is certified as a class action, Item 103 disclosure becomes mandatory and must be updated in the next periodic report.

#### 5. Board Fiduciary Duties: Sale-of-Control Analysis

**Threshold Question**: Does the GAH acquisition trigger enhanced Revlon scrutiny, or does business judgment rule apply?

**Revlon Analysis** (assuming Scenario A - SkyWest Inc. selling SkyWest Airlines subsidiary):

If the transaction involves SkyWest Inc. (public company board) approving sale of its wholly-owned SkyWest Airlines subsidiary for $2.8 billion, Revlon duties apply if:
- SkyWest Airlines constitutes "substantially all assets" under DGCL § 271.⁴²
- The sale effects a change of control of SkyWest Inc. (unlikely if SkyWest Inc. retains SkyWest Leasing and Contour Airlines stake).

**"Substantially All Assets" Test**: Delaware courts apply a qualitative and quantitative analysis:
- **Quantitative**: If SkyWest Airlines generates $1.85B of SkyWest Inc.'s $3.53B revenue (52%), likely not "substantially all."
- **Qualitative**: If SkyWest Airlines is the core operating business and remaining assets are ancillary, may constitute "substantially all" despite <75% quantitative threshold.⁴³

**If Revlon Applies**: SkyWest Inc. board must demonstrate:
1. **Reasonable Market Check**: Board solicited competitive bids, conducted auction process, or can articulate compelling reasons why market check was unnecessary (e.g., GAH's offer materially exceeds any alternative bid board reasonably believed obtainable).
2. **Fair Process**: Board engaged independent financial advisor (e.g., Lazard, Evercore) to provide fairness opinion; negotiated deal terms at arm's length; considered alternatives (retain subsidiary, different buyer, different structure).
3. **Reasonable Deal Protections**: If merger agreement includes break-up fee payable to GAH if board accepts superior proposal, fee limited to 2-4% of transaction value ($56M-$112M).⁴⁴

**If Revlon Does Not Apply**: Business judgment rule applies. Board receives deference; plaintiff challenging transaction must plead waste (no rational person would view consideration as fair value) to overcome presumption of validity.

**Corwin Cleansing Opportunity**: If SkyWest Inc. stockholder vote required under DGCL § 271, and vote is:
- Fully informed (proxy statement includes all material information, including valuation methodology, board process, financial projections),
- Uncoerced (no threats or penalties for voting against transaction), and
- Approved by disinterested majority (institutional stockholders unaffiliated with GAH vote in favor),

Then *Corwin* applies and post-closing litigation challenging board's decision-making process faces high barrier (must plead waste).⁴⁵

**Alternative Scenario**: If GAH is acquiring 100% of SkyWest Inc. stock (going-private transaction), Revlon duties clearly apply because transaction effects change of control. Enhanced scrutiny mandatory; stockholder vote cleanses transaction only if disclosure is complete.

#### 6. Delaware MAE Analysis: United CPA Consent Risk

**Scenario**: United Airlines withholds change-of-control consent; United CPA (46% of revenue, $850M annually) terminates effective 90 days after change of control.

**Legal Question**: Does loss of United CPA constitute a Material Adverse Effect permitting GAH to terminate the merger agreement?

**Delaware MAE Framework** (from *Akorn, Inc. v. Fresenius Kabi AG*):⁴⁶

A Material Adverse Effect requires:
1. **Materiality**: The adverse event "matters" to a reasonable buyer in the industry.
2. **Durational Significance**: The adverse event has lasting impact on long-term earnings potential, measured in years not months.
3. **Company-Specific**: The adverse event results from target-specific circumstances, not industry-wide conditions (unless MAE definition excludes industry downturns).

**Application to United CPA Loss**:

**Prong 1 - Materiality**: ✓ SATISFIED
- Loss of 46% of total revenue is objectively material to any regional airline buyer.
- $850M annual revenue loss represents fundamental business transformation.
- Exceeds *Akorn* threshold: Court found MAE where revenue declined 25% year-over-year; here, permanent 46% loss.⁴⁷

**Prong 2 - Durational Significance**: ✓ SATISFIED
- Loss of United CPA is **permanent**—contract terminated, not temporarily suspended.
- SkyWest cannot immediately replace 46% of capacity with other airline partners; CPA negotiations require months/years.
- Not a "short-term hiccup" (per *IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods*).⁴⁸
- Contrast with *Bardy Diagnostics, Inc. v. Hill-Rom, Inc.*: Court held 2-year revenue impact insufficient; 5+ years = durationally significant.⁴⁹ United CPA loss is permanent unless replacement capacity secured (uncertain timeline).

**Prong 3 - Company-Specific**: ✓ SATISFIED
- United CPA loss caused by GAH's acquisition (change-of-control event), not industry conditions.
- Other regional carriers (Republic Airways, Mesa Air Group) retain their United CPAs.
- Not attributable to regulatory changes, economic downturn, or force majeure events.

**Quantitative Comparison to *Akorn***:

| Factor | *Akorn* (MAE Found) | SkyWest United CPA Loss |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Revenue Decline | 25% year-over-year | 46% permanently |
| EBITDA Impact | 86% decline | 70-90% decline (lost margin on $850M) |
| Cause | Loss of key contract + competition | Loss of key contract (change of control) |
| Duration | Ongoing, no recovery path | Permanent unless replacement secured |
| Buyer's Perspective | Fundamental deterioration | Fundamental deterioration |

**Conclusion**: United CPA loss **exceeds *Akorn* materiality threshold** (46% vs. 25% revenue decline) and clearly satisfies durational significance (permanent vs. temporary).

**Probability Assessment**: **80-90% probability Delaware court finds MAE**

**Rationale**:
- Meets all three prongs (materiality, durational significance, company-specific).
- Quantitatively exceeds *Akorn* precedent on revenue impact.
- Permanent structural change to business model, not temporary disruption.
- $850M annual revenue loss objectively "matters" to reasonable buyer.

**Caveats Reducing Probability Below 95%**:
- Delaware courts remain reluctant to find MAE (*Akorn* only case in merger history).
- Specific MAE definition language in GAH-SkyWest merger agreement controls; if MAE provision excludes "failure to obtain third-party consents," United CPA loss may be carved out.
- If merger agreement makes United consent an explicit closing condition (not part of MAE analysis), failure to obtain consent terminates agreement without MAE determination.
- SkyWest may argue other CPAs (Delta 25%, American 23%) can expand to absorb United capacity, reducing permanence of harm.

**Strategic Recommendation**: GAH should structure merger agreement to make United CPA consent a **non-waivable closing condition** rather than relying on MAE analysis. This creates clean termination right if consent not obtained, avoiding litigation over whether MAE standard satisfied.

#### 7. Securities Litigation Exposure Assessment

**Disclosure Violation Risk - Item 303 Failure to Disclose Material Trends**

If SkyWest Inc. (assuming public company) fails to disclose United CPA consent risk, ALPA contract settlement exposure, or DOT foreign ownership uncertainty in its next Form 10-Q or 10-K, the company faces potential Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 liability:

**Elements of Securities Fraud Claim**:
1. **Material Misrepresentation or Omission**: ✓ — Failure to disclose 46% revenue concentration risk meets materiality threshold; reasonable investor would consider it important.
2. **Scienter**: Plaintiff must plead facts creating "strong inference" management knew or was reckless in not knowing about undisclosed risk. If merger negotiations ongoing and management aware of consent requirement, scienter plausible.
3. **Loss Causation**: If stock price declines after disclosure (or after consent denied and deal terminated), investors who purchased during nondisclosure period suffer compensable loss.

**Estimated Exposure** (if securities fraud claim filed):
- **Defense Costs**: $5-15 million (securities litigation through summary judgment or settlement).
- **Settlement Range**: $10-50 million (depends on stock price decline, class size, egregiousness of omission).
- **Trial Risk**: 30-40% plaintiff win probability if case survives motion to dismiss (Item 303 creates affirmative duty to disclose; failure constitutes material omission).⁵⁰

**Mitigation**: Ensure Form 10-Q filed in quarter following merger agreement signing includes comprehensive Item 303 disclosure of CPA consent risk, labor settlement exposure, and regulatory approval uncertainty. Disclosure eliminates or substantially reduces litigation risk.

**Board Fiduciary Duty Breach Claims**

If SkyWest Inc. stockholders challenge board's decision to sell SkyWest Airlines subsidiary (or approve going-private transaction), potential derivative suit alleging:
- Breach of Revlon duties (failure to maximize stockholder value).
- Inadequate market check (no competitive bidding process).
- Conflicted board (if management equity arrangements favor deal closing).

**Defense**: If *Corwin* applies (fully-informed stockholder vote approves transaction), business judgment rule standard applies and derivative claims face high dismissal probability (>90%).⁵¹ Without *Corwin* cleansing, board must demonstrate reasonable process under enhanced Revlon scrutiny.

**Estimated Exposure** (if derivative suit filed):
- **Defense Costs**: $3-8 million (derivative litigation through summary judgment).
- **Settlement Range**: $5-20 million (typically insurance-funded settlement; rarely results in personal director liability).
- **Dismissal Probability**: 70-80% if *Corwin* applies; 40-50% if Revlon scrutiny applies without stockholder vote.

**D&O Insurance**: SkyWest Inc. should verify director and officer liability insurance includes:
- Securities claim coverage (Side B/C coverage for entity and directors/officers).
- Retention (deductible) typically $1-5 million.
- Policy limits typically $50-150 million for companies of SkyWest's size.
- Six-year "tail" coverage for claims arising post-closing (extended reporting period).

### C. Risk Assessment

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Target Entity Ambiguity** ($1.85B vs. $3.53B Revenue) | HIGH | 100% (exists) | Transaction delay 30-60 days; proxy process adds 60-90 days if stockholder vote required | **IMMEDIATE**: Obtain definitive confirmation of target legal entity; review transaction documents for entity name; access data room for organizational chart and SEC filings. |
| **Item 303 Disclosure - United CPA Risk** | HIGH | 20-30% consent denial | Securities litigation $10-50M if disclosure omitted | **Within 45 days**: Ensure Form 10-Q includes MD&A disclosure of CPA consent requirement, 46% concentration, and risk of transaction termination or CPA loss. Draft language: "The pending GAH acquisition requires United consent; United represents 46% of revenue; consent denial could prevent closing or result in CPA termination with material adverse effect." |
| **Item 303 Disclosure - ALPA Settlement** | MEDIUM-HIGH | 90% settlement probable | Securities litigation $5-20M if disclosure inadequate | **Post-closing**: Form 10-Q must disclose CBA expiration December 31, 2026; industry pattern bargaining 28-35%; expected cost $150M-$180M Year 1, $110M-$115M run-rate; EBITDA margin compression 6%; [disclose whether CPAs include cost pass-through]. |
| **Item 303 Disclosure - DOT Restructuring** | MEDIUM | 75-85% restructuring required | Securities litigation $3-10M; transaction delay 30-60 days | **Within 45 days** (if disclosed publicly): Disclose GAH ownership structure; 40% foreign equity; DOT fitness approval required; restructuring discussions ongoing; no assurance approval obtained. |
| **Item 103 - DOT Tarmac Delay Penalty** | LOW | 90% settlement < $300K | $75K-$200K penalty; disclosure likely not required (below threshold after settlement) | **Within 90 days**: Settle with DOT below $300K if possible to avoid disclosure threshold; if settlement exceeds $300K, include Item 103 disclosure in next Form 10-K. |
| **United CPA Loss = MAE** | CRITICAL | 80-90% MAE if CPA lost | $850M annual revenue loss; deal termination; stockholder litigation $5-20M | **Pre-signing**: Make United consent **non-waivable closing condition** (9-month deadline); negotiate CPA term extension to 2040 + enhanced terms; if consent denied, GAH terminates without MAE litigation. Alternative: Include CPA consent escrow ($300M released to seller upon consent; retained by buyer if denied). |
| **Board Fiduciary Duty - Revlon** | MEDIUM | 40-60% derivative suit filed | Defense costs $3-8M; settlement $5-20M (insurance-funded) | **If stockholder vote required**: Obtain fairness opinion from Lazard/Evercore; document market check process (other bidders contacted); limit break-up fee to 3% ($84M); fully disclose valuation methodology and board process in proxy. **Corwin cleansing**: Ensure proxy disclosure complete (all material trends, risks, valuation assumptions). |
| **Securities Fraud - Item 303 Omission** | MEDIUM | 30-40% plaintiff win probability if filed | Defense costs $5-15M; settlement $10-50M | **Prevention**: Comprehensive MD&A disclosure in Form 10-Q filed post-signing. Include: CPA consent risk, labor settlement exposure, DOT approval uncertainty, slot portfolio value, all material trends. Disclosure eliminates fraud claim (truth defense). |
| **EEOC PWFA Case - Class Certification** | LOW-MEDIUM | 40-55% class certified | Individual $125K-$250K; class $2.5M-$15M | **IMMEDIATE**: Settle individual claim during EEOC conciliation ($100K-$150K) before civil suit filed. Conduct accommodation policy audit; update PWFA procedures to prevent class action exposure. If class certified, defend aggressively (class definition may be overbroad; individualized accommodation inquiries required). |

**Aggregate Securities/Corporate Risk Exposure**: $50M-$150M (probability-weighted, includes litigation defense costs, settlement amounts, and disclosure compliance costs)

**Highest Priority Risks**:
1. **United CPA consent = MAE** (80-90% if consent denied): $850M revenue loss; deal termination right.
2. **Entity ambiguity** (100% exists): Transaction delay; proxy process; stockholder approval uncertainty.
3. **Item 303 disclosure failures** (material if omitted): Securities fraud liability $10-50M.

### D. Cross-Domain Implications

> **Cross-Section Impact: United CPA Consent Risk**
>
> This finding directly affects:
> - **Section IV.B (Commercial Contracts)**: United CPA change-of-control consent provision creates 20-30% denial risk; expected value exposure $430.8M; consent must be secured pre-closing to avoid deal termination.
> - **Section IV.C (DOT/FAA Regulatory)**: GAH's 40% foreign ownership (30% CPPIB + 10% European) creates DOT fitness approval uncertainty; 75-85% probability restructuring required; timeline delay 30-60 days could affect United consent negotiation window.
> - **Section IV.F (Employment & Labor)**: If United withholds consent and deal uncertainty persists, ALPA pilot morale deteriorates; strike probability increases from 3.5% baseline to 8-12%; correlation coefficient 0.6 between CPA denial and strike risk.⁵²
> - **Acquisition Agreement Negotiation - MAE Definition**: United CPA loss satisfies Delaware *Akorn* standard (46% > 25% revenue threshold; permanent = durationally significant); GAH has 80-90% probability of MAE termination right if consent denied. **Recommended structure**: Make United consent **non-waivable closing condition** rather than rely on MAE analysis; creates clean termination without litigation.
> - **Purchase Price Structure**: Recommend **$300M CPA consent escrow** (released to seller upon United, Delta, American consents; retained by buyer if denied) + $500M total escrow including performance holdback.⁵³

> **Cross-Section Impact: ALPA Contract Settlement Costs**
>
> This finding directly affects:
> - **Section IV.F (Employment & Labor)**: CBA expires December 31, 2026 (12 months post-closing); industry pattern bargaining 28-35% establishes settlement range $150M-$180M Year 1, $110M-$115M run-rate; 90% settlement probability during NMB mediation.
> - **Section IV.B (Commercial Contracts)**: **CRITICAL DATA GAP** — Whether United/Delta/American CPAs include labor cost pass-through provisions determines economic impact. If pass-through, ALPA cost neutral (United bears cost). If fixed rates, $110M annual increase compresses SkyWest EBITDA margin 6.2%, potentially violating debt covenants. **Item 303 disclosure must clarify cost allocation**.
> - **Financial Impact Analysis**: $162M Year 1 expected value (probability-weighted); affects GAH's projected IRR (reduction of 100-200 bps); requires **$180M ASAP** (ALPA Settlement Adjustment Payment) deferred payment structure.⁵⁴
> - **Acquisition Agreement - Indemnification**: Seller should not indemnify buyer for post-closing labor settlements (forward-looking cost, not breach of representation); ASAP structure allocates risk fairly (seller receives $0-$180M based on actual settlement amount).

> **Cross-Section Impact: DOT Foreign Ownership Restructuring**
>
> This finding directly affects:
> - **Section IV.C (DOT/FAA Regulatory)**: 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15) requires ≤25% foreign voting equity + "actual control" by U.S. citizens; GAH's 40% foreign equity (30% CPPIB + 10% European) exceeds limit; CPPIB veto rights over capital, assets, debt create Virgin America "actual control" issue; 75-85% probability DOT requires restructuring.⁵⁵
> - **Section IV.G (Securities/Corporate)**: If GAH issues public debt (high-yield bonds) to finance acquisition, offering documents must disclose CPPIB 30% ownership and governance rights as material constraint on financial flexibility; rating agencies may view veto rights negatively (limits management ability to raise capital, sell assets, or refinance debt).
> - **Timeline Impact**: DOT fitness approval typically 90-120 days; ownership restructuring adds 30-60 days negotiation with CPPIB; total regulatory approval 5-8 months. United CPA consent negotiation overlaps DOT process; United may condition consent on DOT approval obtained (creates sequential dependencies extending timeline to 9-12 months).
> - **Item 303 Disclosure**: If transaction publicly disclosed, must disclose GAH ownership structure, DOT approval requirement, restructuring discussions, uncertainty regarding approval, and closing condition dependency.

> **Cross-Section Impact: Item 303 Disclosure Obligations**
>
> This finding directly affects:
> - **Section IV.B (Commercial Contracts)**: United CPA 46% concentration triggers Reg S-K Item 101(h) disclosure (>10% threshold); Item 303 requires disclosure of "known trends" — change-of-control event + consent requirement = known trend reasonably likely to affect operations.
> - **Section IV.F (Employment & Labor)**: ALPA CBA expiration December 31, 2026 + industry pattern bargaining 28-35% = known trend requiring Item 303 disclosure of expected settlement costs and EBITDA margin impact.
> - **Section IV.C (DOT/FAA Regulatory)**: DOT fitness approval uncertainty (75-85% restructuring required) + CPPIB governance rights = uncertainty reasonably likely to delay or prevent closing, requiring Item 303 disclosure.
> - **Section IV.D (Airport Slots)**: Slot portfolio $304M (10.9% of purchase price) requires Item 1 Business Description disclosure as material asset; if JetBlue dispute or usage compliance issues exist, Item 303 disclosure of FAA recapture risk required.
> - **Legal Exposure**: Failure to disclose material trends creates Section 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 securities fraud liability ($10-50M settlement risk); Item 303 creates affirmative duty to disclose even without specific SEC rule mandate (per *Tesla Motors* precedent).

> **Cross-Section Impact: Board Fiduciary Duties (Revlon/Corwin)**
>
> This finding directly affects:
> - **Transaction Structure**: If SkyWest Airlines = "substantially all assets" of SkyWest Inc., DGCL § 271 requires stockholder vote; Revlon duties apply (maximize stockholder value); board must conduct market check or articulate why GAH's offer exceeds alternatives.
> - **Corwin Cleansing Opportunity**: Fully-informed stockholder vote replaces enhanced scrutiny with business judgment rule; requires comprehensive proxy disclosure including: (a) all Section IV.G material trends (CPA consent risk, labor costs, DOT approval), (b) valuation methodology (DCF assumptions, comparable transactions), (c) fairness opinion, (d) board process (other bidders contacted, negotiations timeline).
> - **Deal Protection Limits**: If Revlon applies, break-up fee limited to 2-4% of $2.8B ($56M-$112M); no-shop provision must include fiduciary out permitting board to consider superior proposals.
> - **D&O Insurance**: Verify Side B/C coverage for derivative suit defense ($3-8M costs); six-year tail coverage for post-closing claims; confirm $50-150M policy limits adequate for securities claims.

> **Cross-Section Impact: Delaware MAE Analysis (United CPA Loss)**
>
> This finding directly affects:
> - **Acquisition Agreement - MAE Definition**: Recommend excluding "failure to obtain third-party consents" from MAE definition OR making United consent explicit closing condition (not part of MAE analysis); avoids litigation over whether 46% revenue loss meets *Akorn* standard.
> - **Closing Conditions**: Make United/Delta/American CPA consents **non-waivable closing conditions** with 9-month deadline from signing; if not obtained, either party may terminate (mutual walk-away right).
> - **Escrow Structure**: Alternative to closing condition: **$500M CPA consent escrow** — $300M for United, $150M for Delta/American, $50M for 12-month performance. Escrow released to seller upon consent obtained; retained by buyer if consent denied (damages cap).
> - **Litigation Risk**: If United withholds consent and merger agreement silent on MAE/consent interplay, expect Delaware Chancery Court litigation (12-18 months, $5-15M defense costs); 80-90% probability court finds MAE based on *Akorn* precedent (46% > 25% revenue loss; permanent = durationally significant).

---

### E. Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions Required (Pre-Signing - Week 1):

**1. Target Entity Legal Identity Confirmation (URGENT - 24-48 hours)**

**Issue**: Transaction documents refer to "SkyWest Regional Airlines" with $1.85B revenue; SEC EDGAR identifies publicly-traded SkyWest Inc. (CIK 0000793733) with $3.53B revenue. Revenue discrepancy creates entity ambiguity.

**Action Items**:
- Obtain definitive confirmation of target legal entity name from seller's counsel.
- Access data room: Review organizational chart, articles of incorporation, SEC filings.
- Determine transaction structure:
  - **If Scenario A** (SkyWest Airlines subsidiary carve-out): Prepare for DGCL § 271 stockholder vote process; 60-90 day proxy timeline; coordinate Form 8-K Item 2.01 filing.
  - **If Scenario B** (SkyWest Inc. going-private): Prepare Schedule 13E-3 filing; fairness opinion from investment bank; going-private disclosure requirements.
  - **If Scenario C** (alternative entity): Revise all transaction assumptions based on correct target identity.

**Responsible Party**: Transaction counsel (Skadden Arps, Wachtell Lipton, or equivalent M&A practice).

**Timeline**: Complete within 48 hours; cannot finalize merger agreement without correct legal entity name.

**2. United/Delta/American CPA Complete Contract Review (URGENT - 7-14 days)**

**Issue**: **CRITICAL DATA GAP** — Unknown whether CPAs include labor cost pass-through provisions. $110M annual ALPA cost increase is either (a) neutral to SkyWest if pass-through exists, or (b) 6.2% EBITDA margin compression if fixed rates. Determines deal economics and Item 303 disclosure content.

**Action Items**:
- Obtain complete United, Delta, American CPAs from data room (likely 150-300 pages each).
- Engage airline industry counsel (Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Latham & Watkins aviation practice) for cost escalation analysis.
- Focus on: (1) labor cost adjustment provisions, (2) escalation caps, (3) change-of-control consent terms, (4) termination definitions.
- If CPAs unavailable pre-signing, include **specific representation** in acquisition agreement: "Seller represents that United, Delta, and American CPAs include labor cost pass-through provisions permitting Target to recover increased pilot costs through rate adjustments." Breach = seller indemnification if representation false.

**Responsible Party**: Due diligence counsel + airline regulatory specialist.

**Timeline**: Complete within 7-14 days; dispositive for purchase price negotiation.

**3. Item 303 MD&A Disclosure Drafting (Week 1)**

**Issue**: If SkyWest Inc. is publicly traded, Form 10-Q filed in quarter following merger agreement signing must disclose material trends: CPA consent risk, ALPA settlement, DOT approval uncertainty.

**Action Items**:
- Draft Item 303 disclosure language for three material trends:
  - **United CPA Consent**: "The Company entered into a merger agreement with GAH for $2.8B. Transaction requires United consent; United represents 46% of revenue. Consent denial could prevent closing or result in CPA termination with material adverse effect. No assurance consent will be obtained."
  - **ALPA Settlement**: "Pilot CBA expires December 31, 2026. Based on industry pattern bargaining (United 34.5%, Delta 30%, American 41%), management expects settlement resulting in 28-35% pay increases, increasing annual operating expenses $110M-$115M (6% EBITDA margin compression). CPAs [include/exclude] cost pass-through provisions."
  - **DOT Approval**: "Transaction requires DOT fitness approval. GAH ownership structure includes 30% CPPIB + 10% European investors. GAH restructuring discussions ongoing to satisfy DOT citizenship requirements. No assurance approval will be obtained."
- Coordinate with SEC reporting group; ensure disclosure reviewed by disclosure committee before Form 10-Q filing.

**Responsible Party**: Corporate secretary + securities counsel + disclosure committee.

**Timeline**: Draft within 7 days of signing; file Form 10-Q within 45 days of quarter-end.

**4. Acquisition Agreement - United CPA Consent Closing Condition (Pre-Signing)**

**Issue**: United CPA loss constitutes MAE (80-90% probability under Delaware law); relying on MAE analysis creates litigation risk.

**Action Items**:
- Structure merger agreement with **non-waivable closing condition**: "The Buyer's and Seller's obligation to close is conditioned upon receipt of written consents from United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines to the change of control under their respective capacity purchase agreements. If consents not obtained within nine (9) months of signing, either party may terminate this Agreement without liability."
- **Alternative Structure** (if seller resists non-waivable condition): **$500M CPA Consent Escrow**:
  - $300M for United consent (released to seller within 30 days of consent; retained by buyer if consent denied).
  - $150M for Delta/American consents (released within 30 days; retained if denied).
  - $50M for 12-month CPA performance (no material defaults; released 12 months post-closing).
- **MAE Definition Carve-Out**: If escrow structure adopted, exclude "failure to obtain third-party consents" from MAE definition to clarify that CPA consent issues resolved via escrow, not MAE litigation.

**Responsible Party**: M&A counsel (drafting); principals (commercial negotiation).

**Timeline**: Finalize before signing; non-negotiable for buyer; seller may negotiate escrow release terms.

**5. Board Process Documentation (If Stockholder Vote Required - Weeks 1-8)**

**Issue**: If SkyWest Inc. selling SkyWest Airlines = "substantially all assets," DGCL § 271 requires stockholder vote. Revlon duties apply; board must demonstrate reasonable process to maximize stockholder value. *Corwin* cleansing available if vote fully informed.

**Action Items**:
- **Retain Financial Advisor**: Engage Lazard, Evercore, or Centerview Partners for fairness opinion ($2-5M fee).
- **Document Market Check**: Board minutes should reflect: (a) outreach to other potential bidders (private equity firms, strategic buyers), (b) reasons why GAH's offer superior to alternatives, (c) consideration of retaining subsidiary vs. selling.
- **Fairness Opinion**: Financial advisor must opine that $2.8B consideration is fair to stockholders from financial point of view. Opinion based on: DCF analysis, comparable transactions, comparable companies, precedent premiums.
- **Break-Up Fee Limit**: If merger agreement includes break-up fee (payable to GAH if board accepts superior proposal), limit to 3% of $2.8B = $84M (Delaware courts approve 2-4% range).
- **Proxy Statement**: If stockholder vote required, Schedule 14A proxy must include:
  - Background of transaction (board process, bidders contacted, negotiations).
  - Fairness opinion (full text included as appendix).
  - Management projections (DCF assumptions disclosed).
  - Valuation methodology (multiples, premiums paid, comparable transactions).
  - All material risks (Section IV.G trends: CPA consent, ALPA settlement, DOT approval).
  - Appraisal rights notice (DGCL § 262 - dissenting stockholders may seek judicial valuation).

**Responsible Party**: Board of directors + board secretary + securities counsel + financial advisor.

**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks from signing to stockholder vote (SEC proxy review 30 days; stockholder notice period 20 days; vote meeting).

**6. D&O Insurance Tail Coverage Procurement (Weeks 2-4)**

**Issue**: Post-closing derivative suits alleging breach of Revlon duties, or securities fraud claims alleging Item 303 disclosure failures, may be filed 12-36 months after closing. Standard D&O policies terminate at closing unless "tail" coverage purchased.

**Action Items**:
- Verify SkyWest Inc. D&O policy limits ($50-150M typical for $3.5B revenue company).
- Purchase six-year "tail" coverage (extended reporting period) for claims first made post-closing.
- Tail premium typically 200-300% of annual premium (if annual premium $2M, tail coverage $4-6M).
- Ensure coverage includes: (a) Side B coverage (indemnification of directors/officers), (b) Side C coverage (entity coverage), (c) securities claims, (d) derivative suits.
- Retention (deductible): Negotiate $1-2M retention to control costs while maintaining meaningful coverage.

**Responsible Party**: Risk management + insurance broker + board compensation committee.

**Timeline**: Procure before closing; tail coverage effective upon closing date.

#### Post-Signing Actions (Months 1-9):

**7. United CPA Consent Negotiation (Months 1-6)**

**Issue**: United consent is **most critical closing condition**; 20-30% denial risk; $850M annual revenue exposure; MAE if lost.

**Action Items**:
- **Week 1 Post-Signing**: GAH CEO meets with United Chief Commercial Officer to present GAH ownership, management team, operational capabilities, financial strength.
- **Months 1-3**: Negotiate consent terms; offer inducements:
  - CPA term extension: Current expiration 2033 → extend to 2040 (7 additional years).
  - Enhanced performance metrics: 99% completion factor (vs. current 98%); reduced delays; customer satisfaction improvements.
  - Lease rate reduction: 2-3% rate reduction in exchange for term extension and consent.
- **Month 3**: Obtain written consent from United Chief Commercial Officer (executed amendment to CPA incorporating term extension and enhanced terms).
- **Months 4-6**: Repeat process with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines; leverage United consent to facilitate Delta/American negotiations ("United approved; we expect your approval").

**Responsible Party**: GAH CEO + commercial contracts team + airline regulatory counsel.

**Timeline**: Obtain United consent by Month 6 (nine-month closing condition deadline provides 3-month cushion).

**8. DOT Fitness Application Preparation and Filing (Months 1-4)**

**Issue**: DOT fitness approval required under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15); 75-85% probability restructuring required for CPPIB ownership and veto rights.

**Action Items**:
- **Month 1**: Engage DOT aviation counsel (Hogan Lovells, Holland & Knight, Cooley LLP aviation regulatory practice) for informal pre-filing consultation with DOT Staff.
- **Month 2**: Negotiate CPPIB governance restructuring:
  - Convert CPPIB 30% to non-voting preferred stock (satisfies 25% voting limit).
  - Eliminate three veto rights (capital, assets, debt) or replace with 75% board supermajority vote (dilutes CPPIB individual control).
  - Remove board observer seat or limit to non-confidential board sessions.
- **Month 3**: Prepare DOT fitness application (14 CFR Part 204):
  - Pro forma financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flows).
  - Sources and uses of funds (demonstrate $400M working capital reserve = 3 months operating costs).
  - Managerial competence (GAH management team resumes; FAA experience; aviation industry background).
  - Ownership structure (post-restructuring chart showing CPPIB non-voting preferred; U.S. sponsors 60% voting).
- **Month 4**: File DOT fitness application; pay filing fee; await DOT Staff review (90-120 day timeline).

**Responsible Party**: DOT regulatory counsel + GAH CFO (financial exhibits) + GAH management (managerial competence).

**Timeline**: File Month 4; obtain approval Month 7-8 (overlaps with United CPA consent timeline).

**9. EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination Case Settlement (Months 1-3)**

**Issue**: EEOC "reasonable cause" finding strengthens charging party's case; individual exposure $125K-$250K; class action risk $2.5M-$15M if case not resolved.

**Action Items**:
- **Month 1**: Engage in EEOC conciliation; offer settlement $100K-$150K (back pay, compensatory damages, no admission of liability).
- If conciliation fails, charging party files civil suit; immediately engage employment litigation counsel (Littler Mendelson, Jackson Lewis, Ogletree Deakins).
- **Month 2-3**: Conduct accommodation policy audit (Pregnancy Workers Fairness Act compliance review); update written policies; train HR and management; document accommodation interactive process.
- **Settlement Priority**: Resolve before discovery on accommodation practices; avoid class certification motion (40-55% certification risk if evidence of systemic denial policy).

**Responsible Party**: Employment counsel + HR Director + risk management.

**Timeline**: Settle within 90 days of EEOC conciliation invitation; budget $100K-$200K (settlement + policy audit + training).

**10. Item 303 Quarterly Updates (Quarterly - Months 3, 6, 9)**

**Issue**: Item 303 requires **continuous disclosure**—not one-time disclosure at signing. Each Form 10-Q must update material trends: CPA consent status, ALPA negotiations, DOT approval process.

**Action Items**:
- **Q1 Form 10-Q** (Month 3): "United CPA consent negotiations ongoing; GAH has proposed term extension to 2040 and enhanced performance metrics. United has not yet provided consent. Management believes consent will be obtained, but no assurance."
- **Q2 Form 10-Q** (Month 6): Update if consent obtained ("United provided written consent on [date]; closing condition satisfied") or if negotiations stalled ("United consent discussions continue; closing deadline extended from [date] to [date]; parties remain committed to transaction").
- **Q3 Form 10-Q** (Month 9): Final update before expected closing; disclose any material developments (DOT approval obtained, ALPA negotiations status, regulatory penalties settled).

**Responsible Party**: Corporate secretary + disclosure committee + securities counsel.

**Timeline**: Each Form 10-Q within 45 days of quarter-end; coordinate with investor relations to manage stockholder expectations regarding closing timeline.
