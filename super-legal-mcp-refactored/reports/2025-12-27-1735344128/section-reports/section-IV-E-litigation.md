## IV.E. PENDING LITIGATION & DISPUTES

### A. Legal Framework

#### 1. Delaware Material Adverse Effect Standard for Litigation Exposure

Delaware courts apply a stringent standard when evaluating whether pending or threatened litigation constitutes a Material Adverse Effect (MAE) sufficient to excuse an acquirer's closing obligations. The seminal case *Akorn, Inc. v. Fresenius Kabi AG*¹ established that an MAE requires both (1) **materiality** from the perspective of a reasonable long-term buyer, and (2) **durational significance** affecting the company's long-term earnings potential, not merely short-term disruptions.

For litigation to constitute an MAE under Delaware law, the adverse effect must "substantially threaten the overall earnings potential of the target in a durationally-significant manner."² Vice Chancellor (now Chief Justice) Leo E. Strine articulated in *IBP, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc.* that MAC (Material Adverse Change) provisions serve as a "backstop" protecting buyers from unknown or fundamental developments, but do not protect against ordinary business risks or temporary setbacks.³

**Litigation-Specific MAE Analysis:** Pending litigation rarely constitutes an MAE unless: (1) the potential adverse judgment or settlement would materially impair the target's financial condition on a long-term basis, (2) the litigation threatens core business operations or key contracts, or (3) the litigation creates permanent reputational harm affecting customer relationships.⁴ Single lawsuits with capped damages, routine employment claims, or regulatory enforcement actions with typical penalty ranges do not meet the MAE threshold absent extraordinary circumstances.⁵

**Application to Acquisition Context:** In the context of Global Aviation Holdings LLC's $2.8 billion acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines, litigation exposure must be evaluated not only for direct financial impact but also for potential triggering of CPA (Capacity Purchase Agreement) termination rights, insurance coverage adequacy, and interaction with representations and warranties in the merger agreement.

#### 2. Federal Aviation Act Preemption of State Tort Claims

The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, codified at 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b)(1), preempts state law claims "related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier."⁶ This broad preemption doctrine significantly limits state tort claims against airlines, particularly those relating to passenger injuries, flight delays, and baggage handling.

**Scope of Preemption:** Federal courts have interpreted ADA preemption expansively. In *Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg*, the Supreme Court held that state common law claims are preempted if they have a "significant impact" on airline prices, routes, or services, even if not directly regulating those areas.⁷ Common preempted claims include:

- Breach of contract claims for flight delays or cancellations (preempted; governed by airline's Contract of Carriage and DOT regulations)
- Negligent misrepresentation regarding flight schedules or connections
- Emotional distress claims arising from service failures
- Punitive damages claims for lost or delayed baggage (capped at Montreal Convention limits for international flights)⁸

**Non-Preempted Claims:** ADA preemption does not extend to:
- Traditional tort claims for physical injury (slip-and-fall, aircraft accidents)
- Federal statutory claims (ADA disability discrimination, Title VII employment discrimination)
- Claims under federal aviation safety regulations (strict liability for safety violations)
- Fraud or intentional misconduct claims not related to airline services

**Relevance to SkyWest:** As a regional carrier operating exclusively under Capacity Purchase Agreements with mainline carriers (United, Delta, American), SkyWest's exposure to passenger tort claims is limited by: (1) ADA preemption of service-related claims, (2) CPA indemnification provisions shifting liability to mainline partners, and (3) comprehensive liability insurance maintained by both SkyWest and its CPA partners.⁹

#### 3. Employment Litigation Standards Under Federal Anti-Discrimination Statutes

##### Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.)

Title VII prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), and national origin.¹⁰ The statute applies to employers with 15 or more employees and provides for administrative exhaustion through the EEOC before federal court litigation.¹¹

**EEOC "Reasonable Cause" Determinations:** When the EEOC issues a "reasonable cause" determination after investigating a charge of discrimination, it signals that the agency believes unlawful discrimination likely occurred.¹² While not binding on courts, reasonable cause findings carry significant evidentiary weight and result in substantially higher settlement values and plaintiff win rates at trial.¹³ Studies indicate plaintiffs prevail in 60-70% of cases that proceed to trial following an EEOC reasonable cause determination, compared to 30-40% baseline win rates for employment discrimination claims generally.¹⁴

##### Pregnancy Discrimination Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k))

The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 amended Title VII to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.¹⁵ The PDA requires employers to treat pregnant employees "the same for all employment-related purposes... as other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work."¹⁶

**Supreme Court Framework - *Young v. United Parcel Service*:** In 2015, the Supreme Court established a modified burden-shifting framework for PDA accommodation claims.¹⁷ A pregnant employee establishes a prima facie case by showing: (1) she belongs to the protected class (pregnant); (2) she sought an accommodation; (3) the employer did not accommodate her; and (4) the employer accommodated others "similar in their ability or inability to work."¹⁸

The critical fourth prong requires comparison with non-pregnant employees receiving accommodations. If the employer provides light duty, modified schedules, or lifting restrictions to employees injured on the job, employees with ADA disabilities, or employees who lost DOT medical certifications, but denies similar accommodations to pregnant employees, the plaintiff establishes a strong prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination.¹⁹

##### Pregnancy Workers Fairness Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000gg)

The PWFA, enacted December 27, 2022 and effective June 27, 2023, represents the most significant expansion of pregnancy accommodation rights in 45 years.²⁰ The Act requires covered employers (15+ employees) to provide "reasonable accommodations" for known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the accommodation would impose an "undue hardship" on the employer.²¹

**Key Differences from PDA:**

| Feature | PDA (1978) | PWFA (2023) |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Legal Standard | Comparative (treat pregnant workers same as similar non-pregnant workers) | Absolute (must accommodate unless undue hardship) |
| Accommodation Trigger | Only if employer accommodates comparable employees | Required regardless of comparator accommodations |
| Interactive Process | Not required by statute | Mandatory good-faith interactive process²² |
| Undue Hardship Defense | Not applicable | Employer must prove "significant difficulty or expense"²³ |

**EEOC Final Regulations (Effective June 18, 2024):** The EEOC's implementing regulations at 29 C.F.R. Part 1636 provide detailed guidance on PWFA requirements, including a non-exhaustive list of reasonable accommodations: additional break time, modified schedules, light duty assignments, temporary reassignment to vacant positions, and temporary suspension of essential job functions.²⁴ The regulations explicitly prohibit employers from requiring pregnant employees to accept unwanted accommodations or take leave if other reasonable accommodations exist.²⁵

**Damages Under Title VII/PDA/PWFA:** Available remedies include:
- **Back pay** (29 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(g)): Lost wages from adverse action through judgment
- **Front pay**: Future lost earnings if reinstatement not viable (typically 2-5 years)²⁶
- **Compensatory damages**: Emotional distress, mental anguish (capped by employer size)
- **Punitive damages**: Available upon showing of "malice or reckless indifference" (shares cap with compensatory)²⁷
- **Statutory caps**: For employers with 500+ employees: $300,000 combined cap on compensatory and punitive damages per plaintiff²⁸
- **Attorney's fees**: Mandatory award to prevailing plaintiff (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k))²⁹

**SkyWest Employee Count and Damages Cap:** With 8,200 total employees, SkyWest falls within the 500+ employee category, subjecting the company to the $300,000 statutory cap on compensatory and punitive damages per plaintiff (back pay, front pay, and attorney's fees are not subject to the cap).³⁰

##### Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.)

The ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability and requires reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities unless such accommodation would impose an undue hardship.³¹ While pregnancy itself is not a "disability" under the ADA, pregnancy-related complications that substantially limit major life activities may qualify for ADA protection.³² The PWFA now provides broader protection for pregnancy-related limitations without requiring a showing of "substantial limitation" under the ADA.³³

##### Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.)

The ADEA prohibits age discrimination against employees 40 years or older.³⁴ The statute is particularly relevant to airline pilot employment given mandatory retirement at age 65 under FAA regulations (14 C.F.R. § 121.383(c)).³⁵ Pilots approaching mandatory retirement may assert ADEA claims for constructive discharge, hostile work environment, or denial of training opportunities, though courts generally uphold the FAA's age-65 retirement rule as a bona fide occupational qualification.³⁶

#### 4. Insurance Coverage for Employment and Tort Claims

##### Commercial General Liability (CGL) Insurance

Standard CGL policies cover third-party bodily injury and property damage arising from the insured's operations.³⁷ For airlines, CGL policies typically provide:

- **Per-occurrence limits**: $1-5 million per incident
- **Aggregate limits**: $2-10 million per policy period
- **Coverage for**: Passenger slip-and-fall accidents, baggage handler injuries, aircraft ground damage, premises liability

**Excluded Claims:** CGL policies generally exclude:
- Employment-related claims (covered by Employment Practices Liability Insurance)
- Aircraft hull damage (covered by aviation hull insurance)
- In-flight accidents (covered by aviation liability insurance)
- Contractual liability (unless specifically endorsed)³⁸

##### Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI)

EPLI policies cover employment-related claims including wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.³⁹ Typical EPLI policies for regional airlines provide:

- **Coverage limits**: $2-10 million per policy period
- **Retention/deductible**: $25,000-$250,000 per claim
- **Covered claims**: Title VII discrimination, ADA claims, ADEA claims, retaliation, wrongful termination
- **Defense costs**: Usually covered within policy limits (eroding coverage)

**PWFA Coverage Issue:** Given the PWFA's June 2023 effective date, many EPLI policies written before 2023 may not explicitly reference PWFA claims. However, PWFA claims should be covered under standard "employment discrimination" policy language, as the PWFA is an amendment to Title VII.⁴⁰ Insureds should verify with carriers that PWFA claims fall within "employment practices" coverage.

**Duty to Defend vs. Duty to Indemnify:** EPLI policies typically impose a "duty to defend" (insurer must provide legal defense) that is broader than the "duty to indemnify" (insurer must pay judgments/settlements).⁴¹ Even if ultimate coverage is uncertain, the insurer must defend claims that potentially fall within policy coverage.

##### Aviation Liability Insurance

Regional carriers operating under Part 121 maintain comprehensive aviation liability insurance covering:

- **Passenger liability**: $500 million-$2 billion per occurrence (industry standard for regional carriers)⁴²
- **Third-party liability**: Ground damage, collisions
- **Hull insurance**: Aircraft damage or total loss
- **War risk and terrorism coverage**: Required by FAA post-9/11⁴³

**CPA Insurance Coordination:** Capacity Purchase Agreements typically require both the regional carrier and mainline partner to maintain specified insurance minimums, with the mainline carrier named as "additional insured" on the regional carrier's policies.⁴⁴ This creates overlapping coverage and reduces regional carrier's net exposure for passenger injury claims.

#### 5. Representations & Warranties Insurance and Litigation Exposure

In M&A transactions, Representations & Warranties Insurance (RWI) provides coverage for breaches of seller's representations and warranties in the purchase agreement.⁴⁵ RWI policies typically **exclude** coverage for:

- **Known litigation**: Any lawsuit, claim, or governmental proceeding disclosed in seller's disclosure schedules or known to buyer at closing⁴⁶
- **Pending EEOC charges**: Employment claims for which the EEOC has issued a determination or charging party has received a right-to-sue letter
- **Regulatory enforcement proceedings**: FAA or DOT penalty assessments disclosed pre-closing

**Litigation-Related Representations:** Standard purchase agreements include representations regarding:
- Absence of pending or threatened litigation
- Compliance with employment laws
- Absence of material violations of regulatory requirements
- Adequacy of insurance coverage

**Due Diligence Implications:** The buyer's knowledge of pending litigation (EEOC pregnancy discrimination case, FAA/DOT enforcement) eliminates RWI coverage for those matters, requiring the parties to allocate risk through: (1) purchase price adjustment, (2) seller indemnification, (3) escrow holdback, or (4) buyer assumption of liability.⁴⁷

### B. Application to Transaction: Litigation Inventory and Analysis

#### 1. Employment Discrimination Claims

##### EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination Case - Individual Charging Party

**Case Caption:** [REDACTED], Charging Party v. SkyWest Airlines, Inc.
**Forum:** EEOC Case No. [REDACTED]; potential federal district court litigation
**Status:** EEOC issued "Reasonable Cause" determination; charging party has 90-day window to file federal lawsuit
**Applicable Statutes:** Title VII (Pregnancy Discrimination Act), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k); Pregnancy Workers Fairness Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000gg (if adverse action occurred after June 27, 2023)

**Factual Background:**

A former SkyWest flight attendant (identity withheld per EEOC privacy rules) filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC alleging pregnancy discrimination in violation of Title VII and the PWFA.⁴⁸ The charging party's allegations include:

1. **Denial of Light Duty Accommodation:** While pregnant, charging party's physician imposed medical restrictions including no heavy lifting (baggage handling, emergency equipment), no extended flight duty periods, and modified schedule to reduce physical demands. Charging party requested temporary reassignment to ground-based position (gate agent, customer service) or modified flight attendant duties during pregnancy.

2. **Forced Unpaid Leave:** SkyWest denied the accommodation request and informed charging party that flight attendants with lifting restrictions cannot perform essential job functions. SkyWest required charging party to take unpaid medical leave for duration of pregnancy (approximately 4-6 months).

3. **Constructive Discharge:** Charging party alleges that after being forced onto unpaid leave and informed that no accommodation was available, she felt compelled to resign rather than endure extended unpaid leave with no guarantee of reinstatement post-pregnancy.

**EEOC Investigation and Determination:**

Following the charge filing (presumed filed within 180 days of adverse action as required by Title VII⁴⁹), the EEOC conducted an investigation including:
- Review of SkyWest's accommodation policies and procedures
- Interviews with charging party and SkyWest HR personnel
- Analysis of charging party's medical documentation
- Comparison of charging party's treatment to other employees receiving accommodations

The EEOC issued a **"Reasonable Cause"** determination, finding that "reasonable cause exists to believe" that SkyWest violated Title VII's prohibition on pregnancy discrimination.⁵⁰ This determination indicates the EEOC concluded that: (1) charging party's allegations are credible, (2) SkyWest's defenses are insufficient, and (3) unlawful discrimination likely occurred.

**Current Procedural Posture:**

Following the reasonable cause determination, the EEOC must attempt conciliation (settlement negotiations) between the parties.⁵¹ If conciliation fails, the EEOC issues a "Notice of Right to Sue" and the charging party has **90 days** from receipt to file a federal lawsuit.⁵² The charging party is presumed to be within this 90-day window as of the transaction due diligence period (December 2025).

**Legal Analysis:**

**Prima Facie Case Under PDA:**

Applying the *Young v. UPS* framework,⁵³ charging party must establish:

1. ✅ **Protected class membership:** Uncontested - charging party was pregnant
2. ✅ **Sought accommodation:** Medical documentation supports request for light duty
3. ✅ **Employer denied accommodation:** SkyWest required unpaid leave instead
4. ⚠️ **Comparator analysis:** Charging party must show SkyWest accommodated non-pregnant employees "similar in ability or inability to work"

**Critical Comparator Evidence:** Charging party will seek discovery on whether SkyWest provides light duty or modified assignments to:
- Flight attendants injured on the job (workers' compensation claims)
- Flight attendants with ADA-qualifying disabilities
- Flight attendants who lost FAA medical certificates temporarily
- Flight attendants with other temporary medical restrictions (back injuries, surgery recovery)

If SkyWest provided accommodations to **any** of these categories but denied accommodation to pregnant flight attendant, *Young v. UPS* establishes a strong prima facie case of disparate treatment.⁵⁴ The EEOC's reasonable cause determination suggests the agency found such comparator evidence during its investigation.

**Prima Facie Case Under PWFA (If Applicable):**

The PWFA's effective date of June 27, 2023 creates a critical threshold question: **When did the adverse action occur?**⁵⁵

- **If adverse action occurred before June 27, 2023:** Only PDA applies; charging party must establish comparator evidence
- **If adverse action occurred after June 27, 2023:** PWFA applies; charging party need NOT establish comparators - SkyWest must simply provide reasonable accommodation unless it proves undue hardship

**WORKING ASSUMPTION:** Given that the EEOC issued a recent reasonable cause determination (presumed 2024-2025 based on typical 10-16 month investigation timelines⁵⁶) and charging party has 90 days to sue, the adverse action likely occurred in **2023 or 2024, making PWFA applicable.**

Under the PWFA, charging party establishes prima facie case by showing:
1. ✅ She had a known limitation related to pregnancy (medical restrictions documented by physician)
2. ✅ She requested reasonable accommodation (light duty or temporary reassignment)
3. ✅ The limitation affected her ability to perform essential job functions
4. ✅ SkyWest denied the accommodation

Burden then shifts to SkyWest to prove accommodation would cause **"undue hardship"** - "significant difficulty or expense" considering employer's size, financial resources, and operational impact.⁵⁷

**SkyWest's Defenses:**

**Defense 1 - Flight Attendant Essential Functions:** SkyWest will argue that flight attendants must be able to:
- Lift and operate emergency evacuation equipment (exit doors, slides) weighing up to 40 pounds⁵⁸
- Physically assist passengers during emergency evacuations
- Perform safety demonstrations and enforce safety regulations
- Handle heavy baggage and assist passengers with overhead bins
- Work irregular schedules including overnight flights, long duty periods

SkyWest will contend that a pregnant flight attendant with lifting restrictions cannot perform these essential functions, and therefore no "reasonable accommodation" exists that would enable her to work as a flight attendant.⁵⁹

**Weakness of Defense:** The PWFA regulations explicitly authorize temporary suspension of essential job functions as a reasonable accommodation where the suspension does not impose undue hardship.⁶⁰ Additionally, SkyWest could have offered:
- Temporary reassignment to ground-based position (gate agent, customer service representative, training assistant)
- Modified flight schedules (short-haul flights only, reduced monthly hours)
- Temporary administrative duties within flight operations

The EEOC's reasonable cause determination suggests the agency found these alternative accommodations feasible and that SkyWest's refusal to explore them constituted unlawful discrimination.

**Defense 2 - No Comparators (PDA-Specific):** Under the PDA, SkyWest may argue it does not provide light duty or modified assignments to **any** employees with temporary medical restrictions, pregnant or non-pregnant.

**Weakness of Defense:** If SkyWest provides workers' compensation light duty to employees injured on the job, or if SkyWest accommodates ADA-qualifying disabilities with temporary reassignment, *Young v. UPS* establishes that SkyWest must provide similar accommodations to pregnant employees.⁶¹ The EEOC's reasonable cause finding strongly suggests such comparator evidence exists.

**Defense 3 - Undue Hardship (PWFA-Specific):** SkyWest may argue that temporarily reassigning a pregnant flight attendant to a ground position would cause:
- Staffing shortages requiring expensive backfill (overtime, temporary hires)
- Scheduling disruptions affecting flight operations
- Administrative burden of creating temporary positions
- Increased training costs

**Weakness of Defense:** Courts apply the PWFA's "undue hardship" standard rigorously, requiring proof of "significant difficulty or expense."⁶² For a company with 8,200 employees and $1.85 billion in annual revenue,⁶³ the cost of temporarily reassigning one flight attendant will be difficult to characterize as "significant expense." Temporary reassignment to an existing vacant ground position would not impose operational difficulty. The EEOC regulations emphasize that undue hardship requires individualized, fact-specific analysis, and employer speculation about potential operational difficulties is insufficient.⁶⁴

**Defense 4 - Voluntary Resignation:** SkyWest may argue charging party resigned voluntarily and was not constructively discharged.

**Weakness of Defense:** Constructive discharge occurs when an employer makes working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign.⁶⁵ Forcing a pregnant employee to take 4-6 months of unpaid leave (with attendant loss of income, health insurance complications, and uncertainty about reinstatement) when reasonable accommodations exist may establish constructive discharge. The EEOC's reasonable cause determination likely credited charging party's constructive discharge theory.

**Probability Assessment:**

| Outcome | Probability | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Charging party files lawsuit** | 85-90% | EEOC reasonable cause finding; high-merit case; attorney's fees available to prevailing plaintiff |
| **Liability finding if case goes to trial** | 65-75% | EEOC reasonable cause determination correlates with 60-70% plaintiff win rate; strong comparator evidence presumed; PWFA imposes high burden on employer |
| **Settlement (avoiding trial)** | 75-85% | Litigation costs, bad optics of pregnancy discrimination case, transaction pressure to resolve |

**Damages Exposure Analysis:**

**Scenario A: Trial Judgment (15-25% Probability)**

| Damage Category | Calculation | Amount |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Back Pay** | $45,000-$55,000/year × 2 years (forced leave through judgment) | $90,000-$110,000 |
| **Front Pay** | $50,000/year × 3 years (until comparable employment secured) | $150,000 |
| **Compensatory Damages** | Emotional distress from forced resignation while pregnant; loss of income during pregnancy; anxiety over financial insecurity | $100,000-$150,000 |
| **Punitive Damages** | Awarded if employer acted with "malice or reckless indifference"; probability 40-50% given EEOC reasonable cause; if awarded, 1:1 to compensatory | $75,000-$150,000 |
| **Statutory Cap** | Combined compensatory + punitive capped at $300,000 for 500+ employee employer⁶⁶ | (applies cap) |
| **Total Damages to Plaintiff** | Back pay + front pay + capped compensatory/punitive | $340,000-$560,000 |
| **Attorney's Fees** | 200-400 hours × $350-$500/hour + costs | $80,000-$230,000 |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE (Trial)** | Damages + fees | **$420,000-$790,000** |

**Most Likely Trial Outcome:** $500,000-$600,000 [Mid-range estimate accounting for strong liability case but uncertain punitive damages]

**Scenario B: Pre-Litigation Settlement (60-70% Probability)**

EEOC conciliation typically results in settlements at **50-70% of estimated trial damages** to reflect litigation risk, time value of money, and avoidance of defense costs.⁶⁷ Recent comparable EEOC pregnancy discrimination settlements include:

- Walgreens (March 2024): $205,000 settlement for pregnant employee denied leave⁶⁸
- Symphony Deerbrook (April 2023): $400,000 settlement for 11 employees (~$36,000 each)⁶⁹
- Res-Care/Equus: $125,000 for high-risk pregnancy discrimination⁷⁰
- Dollar General (October 2023): $42,500 settlement⁷¹

**SkyWest Settlement Valuation:**

Factors elevating settlement value:
- ✅ EEOC reasonable cause finding (strong case)
- ✅ Constructive discharge (higher emotional distress damages)
- ✅ PWFA applicability (stronger legal standard than PDA alone)
- ✅ Transaction pressure (GAH wants pre-closing resolution)

Factors reducing settlement value:
- ⬇️ Single plaintiff (not class action)
- ⬇️ Defendant has colorable defenses (essential functions argument)
- ⬇️ Damages capped at $300,000 for compensatory/punitive

**Estimated Individual Settlement Range: $125,000-$250,000**

**Most Likely Settlement Value: $175,000** [METHODOLOGY: Median of recent EEOC pregnancy settlements adjusted upward for reasonable cause finding and constructive discharge]

**Settlement Components:**
- Back pay/compensatory damages: $125,000
- Attorney's fees: $30,000-$50,000
- Policy changes: Revised pregnancy accommodation policy implementing PWFA compliance
- Training: Mandatory training for HR and management on PWFA requirements
- Non-admission clause: Settlement does not constitute admission of liability
- Confidentiality: Subject to EEOC approval (EEOC disfavors overly broad confidentiality)

**Scenario C: Post-Litigation Settlement (15-25% Probability)**

If charging party files lawsuit but parties settle after discovery/depositions but before trial:

**Estimated Settlement Range: $200,000-$400,000** [Reflects completed discovery revealing strength of comparator evidence, deposition testimony, and escalating defense costs]

**Defense Costs Through Settlement:** $150,000-$300,000 (attorney's fees for motion practice, discovery, depositions, expert retention)

##### Class Action Risk Assessment

**Critical Question:** Are there other SkyWest flight attendants who were denied pregnancy accommodations?

**Class Certification Requirements (Fed. R. Civ. P. 23):**

A class action requires:⁷²
1. **Numerosity:** Sufficient number of class members (typically 40+ for class treatment to be superior to individual actions)
2. **Commonality:** Common questions of law or fact across all class members
3. **Typicality:** Named plaintiff's claims typical of class claims
4. **Adequacy:** Named plaintiff will adequately represent class interests
5. **Predominance (Rule 23(b)(3)):** Common questions predominate over individual questions
6. **Superiority:** Class action is superior method of adjudication

**Pattern-or-Practice Analysis:**

Charging party's counsel will seek to establish that SkyWest has a **policy or practice** of denying pregnancy accommodations:

**Evidence Supporting Class Certification:**
- SkyWest has written policy stating flight attendants with lifting restrictions cannot work (applies uniformly to all pregnant FAs)
- HR personnel consistently applied policy without individualized assessment (systemic rather than isolated)
- Multiple pregnant flight attendants were forced onto unpaid leave 2020-2025

**Evidence Against Class Certification:**
- Each pregnancy accommodation request involved individualized medical restrictions (some involved lifting, others involved scheduling, some involved both)
- SkyWest's decision-making was case-by-case, not pursuant to blanket policy
- Damages vary significantly by individual (back pay depends on leave duration, emotional distress is individualized)

**Discovery Requests to Assess Class Viability:**

Plaintiff's counsel will propound:
1. All EEOC charges filed against SkyWest in last 5 years (particularly pregnancy-related)
2. All pregnancy accommodation requests submitted 2020-2025 and outcomes
3. Personnel policies regarding pregnancy, light duty, and medical leave
4. Statistical data on pregnancy-related leaves, terminations, and resignations among flight attendants

**Potential Class Size Estimation:**

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Female flight attendants | 2,600 FAs × 50% = 1,300 women⁷³ | 1,300 |
| Pregnancy rate (5-year period) | 1,300 × 12% annual pregnancy rate × 20% overlap with employment = 31/year × 5 years | 155 pregnancies |
| Accommodation requests | 155 × 30% (assuming 30% required medical restrictions)⁷⁴ | 46 requests |
| Denials/forced leave | 46 × 60% (assuming SkyWest denied majority pre-PWFA) | **28 potential class members** |

**Class Action Damages Exposure (If Certified):**

| Component | Calculation | Amount |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Average back pay per plaintiff** | $50,000 (varied leave durations) | × 28 = $1,400,000 |
| **Average compensatory damages** | $100,000 per plaintiff (capped individually) | × 28 = $2,800,000 |
| **Punitive damages** | Limited by cap; typically reduced in class actions | $500,000-$1,000,000 |
| **Injunctive relief** | Policy changes, training, monitoring (non-monetary) | — |
| **Class counsel attorney's fees** | 25-33% of recovery or lodestar multiplier⁷⁵ | $1,500,000-$2,500,000 |
| **TOTAL CLASS EXPOSURE** | | **$6.2M-$7.7M** |

**Alternative Settlement Scenario:** If class certified, SkyWest would likely settle for $3-5 million (including attorney's fees, cy pres awards, and claims administration) to avoid trial risk and negative publicity.

**Class Certification Probability: 30-40%** [METHODOLOGY: Requires showing of pattern or practice; depends on discovery revealing multiple denials; individualized accommodation assessments may defeat commonality; 28 potential class members exceeds numerosity threshold but relatively small class]

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**

✅ **Immediate Action:** Settle individual case during EEOC conciliation ($150,000-$200,000 range) to prevent lawsuit filing
✅ **Avoid Discovery:** Settlement before litigation prevents plaintiff's counsel from discovering other potential class members
✅ **Policy Reform:** Implement PWFA-compliant pregnancy accommodation policy to demonstrate corrective action (reduces punitive damages risk and shows good faith for any subsequent claims)
✅ **Indemnification:** Require seller indemnification for pre-closing employment claims in purchase agreement

**Aggregate Pregnancy Discrimination Exposure:**

| Scenario | Probability | Exposure | Expected Value |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Individual settlement (pre-litigation) | 60% | $175,000 | $105,000 |
| Individual trial judgment | 25% | $550,000 | $137,500 |
| Class action settlement | 12% | $4,000,000 | $480,000 |
| Class action trial judgment | 3% | $7,000,000 | $210,000 |
| **TOTAL EXPECTED EXPOSURE** | **100%** | | **$932,500** |

**Rounded Expected Value: $900,000-$1,000,000**

#### 2. Regulatory Enforcement Proceedings

##### FAA Maintenance Records Violation

**Proceeding:** FAA Proposed Civil Penalty
**Citation:** 14 C.F.R. § 121.380 (Maintenance Recording Requirements)⁷⁶
**Violation Date:** Estimated March-April 2024
**Proposed Penalty:** $25,000

**Factual Background:**

During a routine FAA surveillance inspection of SkyWest's maintenance records, FAA inspectors identified deficiencies in the carrier's recording and tracking of aircraft maintenance actions.⁷⁷ Specific violations included:
- Incomplete entries in aircraft maintenance logs (missing technician signatures, incomplete descriptions of work performed)
- Failure to properly document return-to-service authorizations
- Delays in updating maintenance tracking system (lag between maintenance performance and electronic record updates)

The violations were classified as **moderate severity** because: (1) no actual safety incidents resulted from the recordkeeping deficiencies, (2) the aircraft were airworthy and maintenance was actually performed, (3) the deficiencies involved administrative compliance rather than safety-critical failures.⁷⁸

**FAA Enforcement Philosophy:**

The FAA's compliance philosophy prioritizes corrective action over punishment for non-egregious violations.⁷⁹ FAA Order 2150.3C establishes the agency's "Compliance Action" program, which encourages:
- Voluntary self-disclosure of violations
- Root cause analysis and systemic corrective action
- Partnership between FAA and regulated entities to improve safety culture

For administrative violations without safety consequences, the FAA typically accepts compliance actions (corrective action plans, enhanced training, procedural improvements) in lieu of civil penalties or reduces penalties by 50-80% upon satisfactory corrective action.⁸⁰

**Settlement Analysis:**

**Comparable FAA Maintenance Penalties:**
- Southwest Airlines (2015): $12 million proposed for repetitive maintenance violations; settled for $7.5 million (37.5% reduction) after corrective action⁸¹
- United Airlines (2016): $1.9 million proposed for maintenance program violations; settled for $900,000 (52.6% reduction)⁸²
- Regional carrier (name redacted, 2023): $35,000 proposed for recordkeeping violations; settled for $18,000 (48.6% reduction)⁸³

**SkyWest Settlement Factors:**

✅ **Favors Reduced Penalty:**
- No safety incidents resulted from violations
- SkyWest immediately implemented corrective action plan upon FAA notification
- Violations were administrative/recordkeeping in nature, not safety-critical
- SkyWest has strong overall maintenance compliance history (no major enforcement actions in previous 5 years)⁸⁴

⚠️ **Neutral Factors:**
- Proposed penalty ($25,000) already at lower end of FAA penalty range, limiting negotiation room
- Violations occurred despite SkyWest's established maintenance QA program

**Estimated Settlement Range: $12,000-$18,000 (50-70% penalty reduction)**

**Settlement Probability: 90-95%** [METHODOLOGY: FAA administrative violations without safety consequences virtually always settle; trial before FAA ALJ is rare and expensive]

**Settlement Timeline:** 60-120 days from proposed penalty notice through final settlement

**Settlement Terms (Typical):**
- Reduced civil penalty ($15,000 estimated)
- No admission of liability clause
- Corrective Action Plan: Enhanced maintenance technician training, revised recordkeeping procedures, independent audit of maintenance records
- Compliance monitoring by FAA for 12-18 months
- No suspension of operations or certificate action

**Transaction Impact:** Minimal - settled amount ($12K-$18K) is immaterial to $2.8 billion transaction; corrective action already implemented; no ongoing operational impact.

##### DOT Tarmac Delay Rule Violation

**Proceeding:** DOT Proposed Civil Penalty
**Citation:** 14 C.F.R. § 259.4 (Tarmac Delay Contingency Plan)⁸⁵
**Violation Date:** March 2024 (during Winter Storm Elliot)
**Proposed Penalty Range:** $100,000-$500,000

**Factual Background:**

On March 15, 2024, during Winter Storm Elliot (a "bomb cyclone" that caused widespread flight disruptions across the eastern United States), a SkyWest flight operating as United Express Flight 3456 from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Boston Logan (BOS) experienced an extended tarmac delay at ORD.⁸⁶ The aircraft pushed back from the gate at 2:15 PM CST and held on the taxiway for 3 hours 55 minutes before returning to the gate at 6:10 PM CST.

The DOT's tarmac delay rule prohibits airlines from permitting domestic flights to remain on the tarmac for more than **3 hours** without allowing passengers to deplane, except for safety, security, or air traffic control reasons.⁸⁷ SkyWest exceeded the 3-hour limit by **55 minutes**, constituting a violation.

**DOT Penalty Guidelines:**

The DOT's penalty matrix for tarmac delay violations considers:⁸⁸
- Number of passengers affected: 65 passengers (CRJ-700 aircraft)
- Duration of excess delay: 55 minutes over 3-hour limit (25% overage)
- Carrier's history of tarmac violations: First violation in last 3 years
- Mitigating factors: Extraordinary weather, ATC ground stop, safety considerations

**Penalty Range by Duration:**
- 0-30 minutes over limit: $27,500-$100,000 per violation
- 31-90 minutes over limit: $100,000-$250,000 per violation
- 91+ minutes over limit: $250,000-$500,000 per violation

**SkyWest falls in second tier: $100,000-$250,000 base range**

**Mitigating Factors:**

✅ **Weather/Safety Justification:**
- Winter Storm Elliot caused 4,200+ flight cancellations nationwide on March 15, 2024⁸⁹
- ORD airport was under ATC ground stop for 2+ hours due to de-icing operations and runway closures
- Captain's decision to remain on taxiway was based on ATC instructions and safety concerns about returning to gate in ice/snow conditions
- Alternate gate assignment required crossing active runways, creating safety risk

✅ **Passenger Care:**
- SkyWest provided water, snacks, and operational lavatories throughout delay (as required by 14 C.F.R. § 259.4(b)(4))⁹⁰
- Flight crew provided frequent updates to passengers regarding status
- No passengers required medical attention during delay

✅ **No Prior Violations:**
- SkyWest has no tarmac delay violations in previous 36 months
- Clean compliance record under DOT consumer protection regulations

**Comparable DOT Tarmac Delay Penalties:**

- Southwest Airlines (2021): $240,000 for single 3-hour-24-minute tarmac delay; settled for $140,000 (41.7% reduction) with corrective action⁹¹
- ExpressJet (2016): $900,000 for 15 tarmac delays in single weather event; settled for $400,000 (55.6% reduction)⁹²
- Mesa Airlines (2019): $50,000 for first-time violation with strong mitigating factors; settled for $35,000 (30% reduction)⁹³

**Settlement Analysis:**

Given mitigating factors (extraordinary weather, safety-based decision, first violation, strong passenger care), SkyWest should achieve **50-70% penalty reduction** from baseline.

**Baseline Penalty (DOT Proposed):** $150,000 (mid-range of $100K-$250K tier)
**Settlement Range After Mitigation:** $75,000-$200,000
**Most Likely Settlement:** $100,000-$125,000

**Settlement Probability: 85-90%** [METHODOLOGY: DOT consumer protection violations routinely settle; carriers rarely proceed to ALJ hearing given cost and uncertain outcome]

**Settlement Timeline:** 90-180 days from Notice of Proposed Civil Penalty through final consent order

**Settlement Terms (Typical):**
- Reduced civil penalty ($100,000-$125,000)
- Consent order published in DOT docket (publicly available)
- Corrective action: Enhanced tarmac delay training for flight crews and operations control, updated Tarmac Delay Contingency Plan
- No admission that weather/safety exception did not apply
- Payment within 30 days of consent order execution

**Transaction Impact:** Low - settlement amount ($100K-$125K) is immaterial to transaction; incident was isolated; corrective action demonstrates compliance commitment; no pattern of consumer protection violations.

##### Aggregate Regulatory Enforcement Exposure

| Proceeding | Proposed Penalty | Settlement Range | Most Likely Settlement | Probability |
|------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| FAA Maintenance Records | $25,000 | $12,000-$18,000 | $15,000 | 90-95% |
| DOT Tarmac Delay | $150,000 (est.) | $75,000-$200,000 | $110,000 | 85-90% |
| **TOTAL REGULATORY** | **$175,000** | **$87,000-$218,000** | **$125,000** | **87.5%** |

**Expected Value Calculation:**
(90% × $15,000) + (87.5% × $110,000) = **$13,500 + $96,250 = $109,750**

**Rounded Expected Value: $110,000**

#### 3. Commercial Disputes - Absence of Material Litigation

**Critical Finding:** Comprehensive due diligence research, including review of:
- SEC EDGAR filings (SkyWest, Inc. Form 10-K and 10-Q filings 2022-2024)⁹⁴
- Federal court PACER database searches (all U.S. district courts)
- State court litigation searches (Utah state courts, primary jurisdiction)
- Aviation industry litigation databases
- FAA and DOT enforcement dockets

revealed **NO EVIDENCE** of material pending commercial litigation involving SkyWest.

**Specifically:**

✅ **No Slot Lease Disputes:** The research plan referenced a hypothetical "JetBlue slot lease dispute (8 LGA slots at risk)," but comprehensive research found no actual dispute exists.⁹⁵ SkyWest does not lease slots to JetBlue at LaGuardia Airport, and no litigation, arbitration, or FAA administrative proceedings involve slot lease arrangements between these parties.

✅ **No CPA Litigation:** SkyWest's Capacity Purchase Agreements with United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines are not subject to any pending litigation, arbitration, or material disputes as of December 2025.⁹⁶

✅ **No Aircraft Lease Disputes:** While SkyWest operates 120 leased aircraft under operating leases with various lessors (AerCap, SMBC Aviation Capital, others),⁹⁷ no material disputes regarding maintenance reserves, return conditions, or lease assignment have been disclosed or identified through litigation searches.

✅ **No Vendor/Supplier Litigation:** No material contract disputes with fuel suppliers, maintenance providers, or other vendors.

**Implications for Due Diligence:**

The absence of material commercial litigation is a **positive indicator** suggesting:
- SkyWest maintains strong contractual relationships with CPA partners (United, Delta, American)
- SkyWest's aircraft maintenance and lease return practices meet lessor requirements
- SkyWest's operations comply with CPA performance standards (on-time performance, completion factor)
- No major customer disputes or breach of contract claims

**Representations and Warranties:** SkyWest's disclosure schedules should represent that no material litigation exists beyond the disclosed EEOC case and regulatory enforcement proceedings. The absence of undisclosed litigation reduces RWI underwriting concerns and seller indemnification exposure.

#### 4. Passenger Tort Claims - Limited Exposure

**Aviation Liability Insurance Coverage:**

As a Part 121 regional air carrier, SkyWest maintains comprehensive aviation liability insurance with policy limits of approximately **$500 million per occurrence** (industry standard for regional carriers operating 50-76 seat aircraft).⁹⁸ This coverage extends to:
- Passenger bodily injury claims (slip-and-fall, in-flight injuries, evacuation injuries)
- Wrongful death claims arising from aircraft accidents
- Third-party ground damage claims

**CPA Indemnification Structure:**

SkyWest's Capacity Purchase Agreements with United, Delta, and American typically include mutual indemnification provisions whereby:
- The **mainline carrier** assumes liability for passenger injuries arising from SkyWest's operation of flights under the mainline's flight code (e.g., United Express, Delta Connection)⁹⁹
- SkyWest agrees to indemnify mainline partners for claims arising from SkyWest's gross negligence or willful misconduct
- Both parties maintain insurance naming the other as "additional insured"

This structure significantly limits SkyWest's net exposure for passenger tort claims, as most claims are either: (1) covered by SkyWest's $500M aviation liability insurance, (2) indemnified by the mainline CPA partner, or (3) both.

**No Material Passenger Tort Claims Identified:**

Due diligence review identified **no pending passenger tort claims** against SkyWest exceeding $1 million in claimed damages. Routine slip-and-fall claims, baggage handling injuries, and minor in-flight incidents are covered by insurance and do not pose material transaction risk.

**Probability of Catastrophic Aviation Accident:** While any catastrophic accident (hull loss with passenger fatalities) would trigger intense FAA/NTSB investigation and potential litigation, the probability of such an event between signing and closing (estimated Q2 2026) is extremely low given SkyWest's strong safety record and Part 121 operational standards.¹⁰⁰ Insurance coverage ($500M per occurrence) would cover all but the most catastrophic scenarios.

#### 5. Potential Future Litigation - Seniority Integration Disputes

**Contingent Risk: Railway Labor Act Single Carrier Determination**

While not "pending litigation" as of December 2025, a significant potential future litigation exposure exists **if** Global Aviation Holdings operates other airlines and the National Mediation Board determines that GAH and SkyWest constitute a "single carrier" under the Railway Labor Act.¹⁰¹

**Legal Framework:**

When two airlines merge or integrate operations, the NMB determines whether they constitute a "single carrier" for purposes of collective bargaining representation.¹⁰² If the NMB finds single carrier status, the McCaskill-Bond Amendment (49 U.S.C. § 42112) requires "fair and equitable" seniority integration for pilots, flight attendants, and other represented employee groups.¹⁰³

**Seniority Integration Process:**

1. **Negotiation (Section 3 of Allegheny-Mohawk LPPs):** The unions representing each carrier's employees negotiate a seniority integration agreement.¹⁰⁴
2. **Arbitration (Section 13 of Allegheny-Mohawk LPPs):** If negotiations fail, either party may invoke binding arbitration before a three-member panel.¹⁰⁵
3. **Implementation:** The arbitration award is binding and must be implemented in the single collective bargaining agreement.¹⁰⁶

**Litigation Risk - Nicolau Scenario:**

The most cautionary precedent is the **US Airways/America West pilot seniority integration** (2005-2018), which resulted in 13+ years of litigation despite a binding arbitration award.¹⁰⁷ While the Ninth Circuit's decision in *Beckington v. American Airlines, Inc.* clarified that arbitration awards are binding and unions cannot unilaterally abandon them,¹⁰⁸ the US Airways precedent demonstrates that contentious seniority integrations can generate:
- $50+ million in legal fees over 10+ years
- Pilot union decertification efforts and formation of new unions
- Work slowdowns and labor unrest (though not formal strikes)
- FAA safety concerns due to pilot distraction/morale issues

**Probability Assessment:**

| Scenario | Probability | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **GAH operates other airlines** | UNKNOWN¹⁰⁹ | Research plan did not specify GAH's existing airline holdings |
| **NMB single carrier determination (IF GAH operates other airlines and integrates operations)** | 70-90% | United/Continental, American/US Airways, Delta/Northwest precedent establishes predictable NMB test¹¹⁰ |
| **Seniority integration required** | 100% | Mandatory under McCaskill-Bond if single carrier determination¹¹¹ |
| **Voluntary negotiated agreement** | 50-65% | Most integrations resolve through negotiation; arbitration avoidable with goodwill and retention bonuses¹¹² |
| **Arbitration required** | 35-50% | Significant minority of integrations require arbitration |
| **Protracted Nicolau-style litigation** | 20-35% | Depends on: (1) relative seniority of pilot groups, (2) career expectation disparities, (3) union leadership competence, (4) carrier's integration strategy¹¹³ |

**Exposure Estimate (IF Single Carrier Integration Required):**

| Cost Component | Baseline Scenario (Negotiated) | Contentious Scenario (Arbitration + Litigation) |
|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Legal fees (outside counsel) | $3-5 million | $15-30 million |
| Arbitration fees and expenses | $500,000-$1 million | $2-5 million |
| Retention bonuses to prevent attrition | $5-10 million | $15-25 million |
| IT systems integration (seniority, bidding, scheduling) | $2-3 million | $3-5 million |
| Union negotiations and implementation | $2-4 million | $10-20 million |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | **$12.5-23 million** | **$45-85 million** |

**Probability-Weighted Expected Value (IF Single Carrier):**
(60% × $17M) + (40% × $65M) = **$10.2M + $26M = $36.2M**

**Caveat:** This exposure is **contingent** on: (1) GAH operating other airlines, AND (2) NMB single carrier determination. If GAH is a financial buyer with no existing airline operations, this risk does not materialize.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

✅ Maintain SkyWest as separate operating entity with separate certificate
✅ Avoid operational integration (separate scheduling, separate crew bases) to delay or prevent single carrier determination
✅ Proactive labor relations: Begin pre-closing discussions with ALPA and AFA-CWA about integration concerns
✅ Retention bonuses: Offer retention payments to minimize attrition during integration process
✅ Escrow holdback: If single carrier integration is likely, establish $25-40 million escrow to cover integration costs

### C. Risk Assessment

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination - Individual Settlement** | MEDIUM | 75-85% settlement | $125K-$250K | **Immediate EEOC conciliation; settle at $150K-$175K; implement PWFA-compliant accommodation policy; seller indemnification in purchase agreement** |
| **EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination - Trial Judgment** | MEDIUM | 15-25% trial | $420K-$790K | Vigorous defense on essential functions and undue hardship; challenge comparator evidence; settle before/during discovery to avoid runaway verdict |
| **EEOC Pregnancy Class Action** | HIGH | 30-40% certification | $3M-$8M | **CRITICAL: Settle individual case pre-litigation to prevent class discovery; early settlement ($150K-$200K) is cheapest option; policy reform to prevent future claims** |
| **FAA Maintenance Penalty** | LOW | 90-95% settlement | $12K-$18K | Accept FAA settlement offer; implement corrective action plan; routine compliance matter with no operational impact |
| **DOT Tarmac Delay Penalty** | LOW | 85-90% settlement | $75K-$200K | Negotiate based on extraordinary weather/safety justification; accept reduced penalty ($100K-$125K); enhanced tarmac delay training |
| **Regulatory Penalties Aggregate** | LOW | 87.5% settlement | $87K-$218K | Both penalties immaterial to $2.8B transaction; settlements expected by Q2 2026 closing |
| **Seniority Integration (IF Single Carrier)** | HIGH | 70-90% IF GAH operates other airlines | $12.5M-$85M | **DATA GAP: Confirm GAH airline holdings; if other airlines exist, budget $25M-$40M escrow for integration; maintain separate operations to delay single carrier** |
| **Catastrophic Aviation Accident (Pre-Closing)** | CRITICAL | <0.5% probability | $100M-$500M | Covered by aviation liability insurance ($500M limits); CPA indemnification from mainline partners; include insurance certificate verification in closing conditions |

**Aggregate Quantified Litigation Exposure:**

| Risk Category | Expected Value (Probability-Weighted) | Notes |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| EEOC Individual Case | $210,000 | (75% × $175K settlement) + (25% × $550K trial) |
| EEOC Class Action | $600,000 | (35% × $1.7M class settlement risk) |
| Regulatory Penalties | $110,000 | (90% × FAA $15K) + (87.5% × DOT $110K) |
| Seniority Integration | $0-$36M | Contingent on GAH holdings; expected value if single carrier determination occurs |
| **TOTAL EXPECTED LITIGATION EXPOSURE** | **$920K-$36.92M** | Range depends on single carrier contingency |

**Baseline Scenario (No Single Carrier Integration):** $920,000 expected litigation exposure
**Adverse Scenario (Single Carrier + Contentious Integration):** $36.92 million expected exposure

---

### D. Cross-Domain Implications

> **Cross-Section Impact: Litigation Exposure and Material Adverse Effect Analysis**

The limited pending litigation identified in this Section directly affects **Section IV.H (Material Adverse Effect Analysis)** under Delaware M&A law. Applying the *Akorn v. Fresenius* framework:¹¹⁴

**Materiality Analysis:** The aggregate quantified litigation exposure of $920,000 (baseline) to $36.92 million (adverse scenario with single carrier integration) represents 0.033%-1.32% of the $2.8 billion purchase price. Under Delaware precedent, this magnitude does **not** constitute a Material Adverse Effect:

- *Akorn* involved 25% revenue decline and 86% EBITDA decline¹¹⁵
- *IBP* rejected MAE claim based on single quarter earnings miss¹¹⁶
- $1-37M litigation exposure (0.04%-1.32% of enterprise value) falls far below materiality thresholds

**Durational Significance:** The pending litigation consists primarily of: (1) individual employment claim (resolved within 6-18 months), (2) regulatory penalties (resolved within 6-12 months), (3) potential seniority integration (2-5 year timeline but not threatening to core business operations). None of these matters constitute "durationally significant" harm affecting SkyWest's long-term earnings potential.

**Conclusion for MAE Analysis:** The pending and threatened litigation disclosed in this Section **does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect** entitling GAH to terminate the acquisition agreement. The litigation exposure is: (1) quantifiable and limited, (2) subject to insurance coverage (aviation liability) and CPA indemnification (passenger claims), (3) resolvable through routine settlement processes, and (4) does not threaten SkyWest's fundamental business operations or key customer contracts.

**Exception:** If **new, undisclosed litigation** emerges between signing and closing (e.g., class action with >$100M exposure, FAA emergency order grounding aircraft, criminal investigation), GAH should evaluate whether such litigation constitutes MAE under the specific language of the purchase agreement's MAE provision.

> **Cross-Section Impact: Insurance Coverage Adequacy**

This Section's findings directly affect **Section IV.I (Insurance and Risk Transfer Analysis)**:

**Employment Practices Liability Insurance:**
- EEOC pregnancy discrimination exposure ($420K-$790K maximum individual trial exposure) likely **within** SkyWest's EPLI policy limits (typical $2-10M for regional carrier)¹¹⁷
- Class action exposure ($3M-$8M) may **exceed** EPLI retention/deductible ($25K-$250K) but should fall within policy limits
- **Action Item:** Verify EEOC case has been reported to EPLI carrier; confirm PWFA claims covered under "employment discrimination" policy language; assess whether potential class action exhausts policy limits

**Aviation Liability Insurance:**
- SkyWest's $500M per-occurrence aviation liability coverage is adequate for routine passenger tort exposure
- CPA indemnification from United/Delta/American provides additional layer of protection
- **No action required:** Standard coverage for regional carrier; no material passenger tort claims pending

**Regulatory Penalties:**
- FAA/DOT penalties ($87K-$218K) typically **not** covered by insurance (civil penalties are generally non-insurable as against public policy)¹¹⁸
- SkyWest will pay penalties from operating cash flow; immaterial amounts
- **No action required**

> **Cross-Section Impact: Purchase Price Adjustment and Indemnification Structure**

This Section's findings inform **Section IV.J (Purchase Agreement Negotiation Strategy)** regarding:

**Indemnification Basket and Cap:**

Standard M&A indemnification provisions include a "basket" (minimum threshold before seller has indemnification liability) and "cap" (maximum seller liability).¹¹⁹ For $2.8 billion transaction:

- **Typical Basket:** 0.5-1.0% of purchase price = $14-28 million (seller not liable unless losses exceed basket)
- **Typical Cap:** 10-25% of purchase price = $280-700 million (maximum seller liability)

**Application to SkyWest Litigation:**
- EEOC pregnancy case ($125K-$790K) falls **well below** typical basket threshold
- Regulatory penalties ($87K-$218K) falls **well below** basket
- Aggregate disclosed litigation ($920K-$1M) falls below basket unless basket is set below 1%

**Negotiation Strategy:**

**Buyer's Position (GAH):**
- Request **specific indemnification** for disclosed EEOC pregnancy case (liability + defense costs) outside of general indemnification basket
- Require seller to settle EEOC case pre-closing or establish $300K-$500K escrow for post-closing resolution
- Exclude disclosed regulatory penalties from indemnification (buyer assumes $87K-$218K exposure)
- If single carrier integration is likely, negotiate **separate escrow** for labor integration costs ($25M-$40M)

**Seller's Position (SkyWest):**
- Resist carve-out for EEOC case; argue it falls within general indemnification basket and buyer should bear routine employment litigation risk post-closing
- Offer to complete EEOC conciliation pre-closing (estimated $150K-$175K settlement) to eliminate uncertainty
- Refuse liability for regulatory penalties (buyer acquiring ongoing business with known compliance issues)
- Refuse liability for post-closing single carrier determination (arises from buyer's decision to integrate operations, not seller's pre-closing conduct)

**Recommended Resolution:**
- **EEOC Case:** Seller settles during EEOC conciliation pre-closing ($150K-$200K); if conciliation fails, establish $500K escrow (covers settlement + defense costs + buffer)
- **Regulatory Penalties:** Buyer assumes liability; seller agrees to cooperate with settlement negotiations
- **Class Action Risk:** Seller provides representation that no other pregnancy discrimination complaints or EEOC charges exist; if representation breached, seller indemnifies up to $5M (subject to general basket/cap)
- **Seniority Integration:** Buyer assumes all post-closing labor integration costs (single carrier determination is consequence of buyer's operational decisions)

> **Cross-Section Impact: Representations and Warranties Insurance Underwriting**

This Section's findings affect **RWI Policy Underwriting** (if GAH purchases R&W insurance):

**Standard RWI Exclusions:**¹²⁰
- **Known litigation:** Any lawsuit, claim, or proceeding disclosed in seller's disclosure schedules is excluded from RWI coverage
- **EEOC charges:** Employment claims for which EEOC has issued determination or right-to-sue letter are excluded as "known"
- **Regulatory proceedings:** Disclosed FAA/DOT penalties are excluded

**RWI Coverage Implications:**
- ✅ RWI **will cover** undisclosed litigation that emerges post-closing (e.g., previously unknown employment claims, contract disputes)
- ❌ RWI **will NOT cover** disclosed EEOC pregnancy case (known pre-closing)
- ❌ RWI **will NOT cover** disclosed FAA/DOT penalties (known pre-closing)
- ⚠️ RWI **may cover** EEOC class action risk if individual case settles pre-closing and class action is filed post-closing by different plaintiffs (depends on policy language re: "related claims")

**Underwriting Adjustment:**
- RWI carrier will likely **exclude** EEOC pregnancy discrimination from policy coverage or require **sub-limit** with higher retention ($500K-$1M)
- If class action risk is material concern, buyer may purchase **supplemental EPLI tail coverage** for post-closing employment claims arising from pre-closing conduct (coverage period: 3-6 years)

> **Cross-Section Impact: Labor Relations and Strike Risk**

This Section's seniority integration findings directly affect **Section IV.F (Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining)**:

**Interconnection with ALPA Pilot Strike Risk:**

If GAH operates other airlines and NMB determines single carrier status, the **timeline and complexity** of seniority integration will directly affect ALPA contract negotiations and strike risk:

- **Scenario A (No Single Carrier Integration):** SkyWest ALPA negotiations proceed independently; strike risk assessed in isolation (2-5% 12-month probability)¹²¹
- **Scenario B (Single Carrier Integration Required):** Seniority integration negotiations occur **simultaneously** with contract negotiations, creating:
  - **Increased Strike Risk:** Pilots will use strike leverage to influence seniority integration outcome (probability increases to 10-20%)
  - **Delayed Contract Resolution:** Seniority disputes prolong overall negotiation timeline by 12-24 months
  - **Dual Union Representation Issues:** If GAH's other airline has different pilot union (e.g., Teamsters instead of ALPA), NMB representation election required before seniority integration, adding 6-12 months

**Combined Exposure:** If single carrier integration and ALPA strike occur concurrently:
- 30-day strike: $40M-$45M revenue loss¹²²
- Seniority integration (contentious): $45M-$85M over 3-5 years
- **Total combined exposure:** $85M-$130M

**Mitigation:** Sequence integration steps to separate contract negotiations from seniority integration; offer retention bonuses ($10-15M) to secure labor peace during integration

---

### E. Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions Required (Pre-Closing)

**1. EEOC Pregnancy Discrimination Case - Settle Immediately**

| Action | Responsible Party | Deadline | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|----------|-----------|
| **Engage EEOC conciliation** | SkyWest General Counsel / Employment Counsel | Within 30 days | EEOC reasonable cause determination creates 60-90 day conciliation window before right-to-sue issued; early engagement maximizes settlement leverage |
| **Target settlement range** | $150,000-$200,000 (includes back pay, compensatory, attorney's fees) | Before right-to-sue issued | Avoids litigation costs ($150K-$300K defense), class action discovery risk, negative publicity |
| **Settlement terms** | (1) Payment to charging party: $125K-$150K; (2) Attorney's fees: $25K-$50K; (3) Neutral reference letter; (4) No admission of liability; (5) Confidentiality (EEOC-approved); (6) General release of all claims | Conciliation agreement | Standard EEOC settlement structure |
| **Policy reform** | Implement PWFA-compliant pregnancy accommodation policy (interactive process, presumption of accommodation, undue hardship documentation) | Within 60 days of settlement | Demonstrates corrective action; reduces punitive damages risk if future claims arise; shows good-faith compliance with PWFA |
| **HR training** | Mandatory training for all HR personnel and flight operations managers on PWFA requirements | Within 90 days | Prevents future violations; defensible evidence if subsequent claims filed |

**Estimated Cost:** $175,000-$250,000 (settlement) + $25,000-$50,000 (policy development and training) = **$200,000-$300,000 total**

**Allocation:** Seller (SkyWest) should bear settlement cost as pre-closing employment liability; include in purchase agreement indemnification or settle before closing

**2. Regulatory Enforcement Proceedings - Negotiate Settlements**

**FAA Maintenance Penalty:**

| Action | Responsible Party | Timeline |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Submit corrective action plan to FAA | SkyWest Director of Maintenance | Within 30 days of penalty notice |
| Negotiate penalty reduction based on: (1) immediate corrective action, (2) no safety consequences, (3) strong compliance history | FAA counsel | 60-90 days |
| Target settlement: $12,000-$18,000 (50-70% reduction from $25,000 proposed) | FAA Flight Standards District Office | Settlement within 120 days |

**DOT Tarmac Delay Penalty:**

| Action | Responsible Party | Timeline |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Submit response to DOT emphasizing: (1) extraordinary weather (Winter Storm Elliot), (2) ATC ground stop, (3) safety justification for remaining on taxiway, (4) passenger care provided, (5) first violation in 36 months | DOT Aviation Consumer Protection Division | Within 30 days of penalty notice |
| Negotiate penalty reduction to $100,000-$125,000 | DOT Office of General Counsel | 90-180 days |
| Enhanced tarmac delay training for flight crews and dispatch | SkyWest Flight Operations | Completed before settlement finalized |

**Estimated Cost:** $15,000 (FAA) + $110,000 (DOT) = **$125,000 total regulatory penalties**

**Allocation:** Buyer (GAH) should assume regulatory penalty costs as operating expenses of acquired business; immaterial amounts do not warrant seller indemnification

**3. Single Carrier Determination Risk Assessment - Critical Data Gap**

| Action | Responsible Party | Deadline | Purpose |
|--------|------------------|----------|---------|
| **Identify GAH's existing airline holdings** | GAH legal/corporate development team | **IMMEDIATE** | Determines whether single carrier integration risk exists; if GAH operates other Part 121 carriers, single carrier determination is 70-90% probable¹²³ |
| If GAH operates other airlines: Assess planned operational integration | GAH operations team + labor counsel | Before definitive purchase agreement execution | Degree of operational integration (combined scheduling, crew bases, shared aircraft) directly affects NMB single carrier analysis¹²⁴ |
| Model financial impact of seniority integration scenarios | GAH finance team + labor economist | Before definitive purchase agreement execution | Integration costs range $12.5M-$85M depending on negotiated vs. contentious arbitration scenario |
| Retention bonus structure for SkyWest pilots/FAs | GAH HR + labor counsel | If single carrier determination likely | $10-15M retention bonuses can prevent attrition and buy labor peace during integration |

**If GAH Operates Other Airlines:**

**Consider operational strategy:**

**Option A: Maintain Separate Operations (Avoid Single Carrier)**
- Keep SkyWest as standalone operating subsidiary with separate FAA certificate
- Maintain separate pilot/FA seniority lists and separate collective bargaining agreements
- Avoid operational integration (no shared crew bases, no aircraft interchange)
- **Advantage:** Avoids $12.5M-$85M seniority integration costs and 2-5 year integration timeline
- **Disadvantage:** Limits operational synergies and cost savings from combined operations

**Option B: Integrate Operations (Accept Single Carrier)**
- Combine operations for efficiency (shared crew bases, scheduling optimization, fleet rationalization)
- Budget $25M-$40M escrow for seniority integration (separate from purchase price)
- Proactively engage ALPA and AFA-CWA **before** closing to begin integration planning
- Retain experienced McCaskill-Bond arbitration counsel (labor law specialists)
- **Advantage:** Achieves long-term operational efficiencies and fleet optimization
- **Disadvantage:** $25M-$85M integration costs; 2-5 year timeline; potential labor unrest

**Recommended Approach:** If GAH operates other airlines, assume single carrier integration is likely and budget $30M escrow in purchase agreement (released to buyer post-closing to fund integration costs)

#### Purchase Agreement Provisions - Draft Contract Language

**Section 6.15 - Pre-Closing Settlement of EEOC Case**

```
Section 6.15 Pre-Closing Settlement of EEOC Case.

(a) Settlement Obligation. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to settle
the EEOC charge filed by [REDACTED] (EEOC Case No. [REDACTED]) during the EEOC
conciliation process prior to Closing. Seller shall keep Buyer informed of settlement
negotiations and shall not agree to any settlement that: (i) exceeds $250,000 in total
payments (including charging party payment, attorney's fees, and costs), (ii) includes
admission of liability beyond neutral settlement language, or (iii) imposes ongoing
obligations on the Company extending more than 12 months post-Closing, in each case
without Buyer's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld).

(b) Escrow for Unsettled EEOC Case. If the EEOC case is not settled prior to Closing,
Buyer and Seller shall establish an escrow in the amount of $500,000 (the "EEOC Escrow")
from the Purchase Price to be held by [Escrow Agent] pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The EEOC Escrow shall be released as follows:

    (i) If the EEOC case is settled within 180 days after Closing for an amount less
    than $500,000, the settlement amount (including attorney's fees incurred by the
    Company) shall be paid from the EEOC Escrow to the claimant and/or the Company's
    counsel, and the balance shall be released to Seller;

    (ii) If the EEOC case is not settled within 180 days after Closing and charging
    party files federal lawsuit, the EEOC Escrow shall remain in place until final
    resolution (settlement or judgment), provided that if the case is not resolved
    within 24 months after Closing, Buyer may draw on the EEOC Escrow for reasonable
    defense costs incurred by the Company, not to exceed $300,000, with the balance
    held for ultimate settlement or judgment;

    (iii) If the total resolution cost (settlement or judgment plus defense costs and
    attorney's fees) exceeds $500,000, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for amounts
    exceeding $500,000, up to a maximum of $1,000,000, subject to the general
    indemnification basket and cap provisions of Article 9.

(c) Class Action Representation. Seller represents and warrants that, to Seller's
Knowledge, no other current or former employees of the Company have filed EEOC charges
or complaints alleging pregnancy discrimination or denial of pregnancy-related
accommodations during the period from January 1, 2020 through the Closing Date. In
the event this representation is breached and a class action relating to pregnancy
discrimination is certified within 36 months after Closing, Seller shall indemnify
Buyer for 75% of all settlement costs, judgments, and defense costs related to such
class action, up to a maximum indemnification obligation of $5,000,000, subject to
the notice and defense provisions of Article 9.
```

**Section 6.16 - Regulatory Penalty Settlements**

```
Section 6.16 Regulatory Penalty Settlements.

(a) Cooperation. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to settle the FAA
maintenance penalty (FAA Case No. [REDACTED], proposed penalty $25,000) and the DOT
tarmac delay penalty (DOT Docket No. [REDACTED], proposed penalty range $100,000-
$250,000) prior to Closing or as soon thereafter as practicable.

(b) Allocation of Liability. Buyer shall assume all liability for regulatory penalties
disclosed in Schedule 3.11 (Litigation), including the FAA and DOT penalties described
in Section 6.16(a). Seller shall have no indemnification obligation for such penalties.

(c) Buyer Control. Following Closing, Buyer shall have sole control over settlement
negotiations with FAA and DOT, provided that Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed
and shall consider in good faith any settlement recommendations from Seller. Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer's settlement efforts, including providing
documents and making personnel available for interviews with FAA/DOT.

(d) No Purchase Price Adjustment. The parties acknowledge that the estimated settlement
amounts for the FAA penalty ($15,000) and DOT penalty ($110,000) were considered in
determining the Purchase Price, and no adjustment to Purchase Price shall be made based
on the actual settlement amounts unless the aggregate settlements exceed $300,000.
```

**Section 9.2(h) - Specific Indemnification for Employment Liabilities**

```
Section 9.2(h) Employment Liabilities.

Notwithstanding the indemnification basket set forth in Section 9.4(a), Seller shall
indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for:

    (i) Any Losses arising from or relating to the EEOC pregnancy discrimination case
    described in Section 6.15, to the extent such Losses exceed the EEOC Escrow amount
    of $500,000 and up to a maximum of $1,000,000 in aggregate Losses;

    (ii) Any Losses arising from breach of the representation in Section 6.15(c)
    regarding absence of other pregnancy discrimination complaints, up to a maximum
    of $5,000,000 in aggregate Losses;

    (iii) Any Losses arising from wage and hour violations under the Fair Labor
    Standards Act or state wage and hour laws relating to conduct occurring prior to
    the Closing Date, provided that Buyer provides Seller with written notice of any
    such claim within 24 months after the Closing Date (the "Employment Claims
    Survival Period");

provided, however, that Seller's aggregate indemnification obligation under this
Section 9.2(h) shall not exceed $10,000,000, and all claims under this Section 9.2(h)
are subject to the notice, defense, and mitigation provisions of Sections 9.5 and 9.6.

For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have no indemnification obligation for: (A)
employment claims arising from Buyer's post-Closing conduct, including but not limited
to termination decisions, compensation changes, or workplace policies implemented by
Buyer; (B) labor integration costs arising from any National Mediation Board single
carrier determination post-Closing; or (C) costs of complying with new employment laws
or regulations enacted after the Closing Date.
