## IV.A. AVIATION REGULATORY COMPLIANCE & CERTIFICATION

This section analyzes federal aviation regulatory requirements for Global Aviation Holdings LLC's $2.8 billion acquisition of SkyWest Regional Airlines, focusing on Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air carrier certificate transfer procedures, Department of Transportation (DOT) fitness certification, foreign ownership compliance under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15), and airport slot transfer requirements under 14 C.F.R. Part 93. Research identifies **one critical compliance deficiency requiring immediate remediation**: GAH's ownership structure includes 40% foreign equity (30% CPPIB + 10% European institutional investors) with CPPIB holding special veto rights over capital structure changes, creating 75-85% probability that DOT will require restructuring under the "actual control" doctrine established in *Virgin America* (2007). This single issue represents the highest regulatory risk to transaction closing and mandates proactive governance restructuring before filing DOT fitness applications.

### A. Legal Framework

#### 1. FAA Air Carrier Certificate Transfer Requirements

**Statutory Foundation - Certificate Non-Transferability**

Air carrier operating certificates issued under 14 C.F.R. Part 119 are **non-transferable** between owners as a matter of law.¹ An Air Carrier Certificate or Operating Certificate issued under Part 119 remains effective only until the certificate holder surrenders it to the Administrator or the Administrator suspends, revokes, or otherwise terminates the certificate.² When ownership of an air carrier changes hands, the FAA does not automatically transfer the existing certificate to the new owner; instead, the FAA must affirmatively approve the ownership change and may impose operational continuity conditions as prerequisites to continued operations under new ownership.³

**Critical Implication for Transaction**: When SkyWest Regional Airlines' ownership transfers from current shareholders to Global Aviation Holdings LLC, SkyWest's existing FAA operating certificate does **not** transfer automatically. GAH must demonstrate to the FAA's satisfaction that it meets all regulatory requirements for air carrier certification, including U.S. citizenship compliance, management personnel qualifications, financial fitness, and Safety Management System (SMS) continuity.⁴

**Citizenship Requirement as Deal-Blocking Condition**

A person may not operate as a direct air carrier unless that person (1) is a citizen of the United States, (2) obtains an Air Carrier Certificate, and (3) obtains operations specifications from the FAA.⁵ The citizenship requirement derives from 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15), which defines "citizen of the United States" for aviation purposes as requiring (a) at least 75% of voting equity held by U.S. citizens (maximum 25% foreign voting), (b) at least two-thirds of board of directors and managing officers are U.S. citizens, and (c) the corporation is under the "actual control" of U.S. citizens.⁶ When a change of ownership occurs, the FAA Principal Inspector assigned to the carrier must verify that the certificate holder continues to meet the citizenship requirement in accordance with § 119.33(a)(1) and (b)(1).⁷

**GAH Structural Compliance Analysis**: GAH's ownership structure comprises 60% U.S. private equity sponsors, 30% Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), and 10% European institutional investors, resulting in 40% total foreign equity.⁸ While this facially complies with the 49% total foreign equity cap under DOT precedent, the structure creates two critical compliance issues: (1) if CPPIB's 30% and European investors' 10% constitute voting equity, combined foreign voting ownership of 40% exceeds the statutory 25% voting limit, and (2) CPPIB's board observer seat and veto rights over capital structure changes, major asset sales, and new debt issuance may constitute "actual control" by a foreign entity under DOT's case-by-case analysis framework, discussed in detail in subsection A.2 below.⁹

**Operations Specifications Amendment Requirements**

14 C.F.R. § 119.51 governs amendment of operations specifications for Part 121 air carriers.¹⁰ When a certificate holder initiates an amendment to operations specifications, the application must be filed **at least 90 days** before the proposed effective date in cases involving: (a) mergers, (b) acquisitions of airline operational assets requiring additional showing of safety, or (c) changes in kind of operation.¹¹ For all other amendments not specified, the filing deadline reduces to 15 days before the proposed effective date.¹²

The GAH acquisition of SkyWest qualifies as an "acquisition of airline operational assets" requiring the 90-day advance filing requirement under § 119.51(a)(3)(i)(B).¹³ This procedural timeline runs concurrent with (not in addition to) the overall certificate transfer review process, meaning GAH should file the operations specifications amendment application simultaneously with initiating pre-application consultations with the FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) responsible for SkyWest's certificate.

**Pre-Application Procedures and Timeline**

FAA Order 8900.1 (Flight Standards Information Management System) establishes the procedural framework for certificate transfers following change of ownership.¹⁴ The pre-application process begins with submission of FAA Form 8400-6 Pre-Application Statement of Intent (PASI), which must be filed **at least 30 calendar days** prior to the formal application meeting.¹⁵ The PASI includes a general description of proposed operations, identification of key management personnel, and scope of operational activities.¹⁶ Following PASI submission, the certificate holder must submit additional Pre-Application Checklist (PAC) items at least 15 days prior to the formal application meeting.¹⁷ Upon receipt of complete PAC materials, the FAA FSDO assigns a Certification Project Manager, Principal Operations Inspector, Principal Airworthiness Inspector, and Principal Avionics Inspector to conduct the certificate transfer review.¹⁸

**Management Personnel Qualification Standards**

14 C.F.R. §§ 119.65, 119.67, 119.69, and 119.71 establish mandatory qualifications for management personnel of Part 121 operations.¹⁹ For Director of Operations, the regulations require (1) an airline transport pilot certificate, and (2) for operations involving large aircraft, at least **three years supervisory or managerial experience** within the past six years in a position exercising operational control over Part 121 or Part 135 operations.²⁰ For Chief Pilot, the requirements include (1) an airline transport pilot certificate with appropriate ratings for the aircraft category used in operations, and (2) at least **three years experience as pilot in command** in the same aircraft category.²¹ For Director of Maintenance, the individual must hold (1) a mechanic certificate with airframe and powerplant ratings, (2) at least **one year experience** in a position responsible for returning aircraft to service, (3) at least **one year experience in a supervisory capacity**, and (4) at least **three years experience** within the past six years maintaining large aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats.²²

**Data Room Verification Required**: The transaction materials do not disclose GAH's proposed management team backgrounds for verification against § 119.67 standards.²³ Any qualification gaps identified during FAA review will delay certificate transfer approval by an estimated 30-60 days while GAH identifies and qualifies alternative candidates or current SkyWest management personnel agree to interim retention during transition.²⁴ Immediate review of GAH's proposed Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, and Director of Maintenance qualifications constitutes a high-priority pre-closing due diligence task.

**Safety Management System Continuity Requirements**

14 C.F.R. Part 5 mandates that all Part 121 operators develop and implement a Safety Management System encompassing four components: (1) Safety Policy (Subpart B), (2) Safety Risk Management (Subpart C), (3) Safety Assurance (Subpart D), and (4) Safety Promotion (Subpart E).²⁵ The SMS final rule published January 8, 2015 requires Part 121 carriers to maintain a confidential employee reporting system where employees can report hazards, issues, concerns, and incidents without fear of reprisal.²⁶ The regulation defines "what" must be accomplished but provides flexibility regarding "how" carriers implement SMS requirements.²⁷

During certificate transfer review following change of ownership, the FAA evaluates (1) SMS continuity during the ownership transition, (2) employee reporting system integrity and preservation of confidentiality protections, and (3) Safety Risk Management process continuity.²⁸ SMS continuity demonstration integrates into the standard 150-day certificate transfer timeline but may extend the timeline by 30-45 days if the FAA identifies deficiencies requiring corrective action.²⁹

**Grounds for Certificate Denial**

14 C.F.R. § 119.33(c) authorizes the FAA to deny a certificate application if an individual who will have control over or substantial ownership interest in the applicant **had the same or similar control or interest in a certificate holder whose certificate was revoked** (or is in the process of revocation) and that individual **materially contributed to the circumstances causing revocation or causing the revocation process to be in progress**.³⁰ Based on available information, no evidence suggests that GAH sponsors or management personnel have histories involving revoked certificates, resulting in a low (5-10%) probability of denial under § 119.33(c).³¹ However, data room verification of principal investors' and key management personnel's aviation regulatory histories constitutes prudent due diligence.

#### 2. DOT Fitness Certification and Foreign Ownership Compliance

**Statutory Framework - U.S. Citizenship Requirement**

49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15) defines "citizen of the United States" for air carrier certification purposes to mean a corporation or partnership where: (a) the president and **at least two-thirds of the board of directors** and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, (b) the airline is under the **actual control of U.S. citizens**, and (c) at least **75 percent of voting interests** is owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.³² The statutory framework establishes a three-part test combining numerical ownership thresholds (75% U.S. voting / 25% maximum foreign voting), board composition requirements (minimum two-thirds U.S. citizen directors and officers), and a substantive "actual control" standard that examines the totality of governance arrangements beyond mere numerical compliance.³³

49 U.S.C. § 41102 provides that an air transport certificate can only be held by a U.S. citizen as defined in § 40102(a)(15), and federal law categorically **prohibits** foreign nationals' control of U.S. air carriers.³⁴ DOT interprets "actual control" to mean determining whether foreign interests have the ability to exercise **substantial influence** over the airline beyond numerical requirements, applying a case-by-case analysis involving examination of company debt and funding sources, shareholder influence on business decisions, board composition and decision-making authority, protective provisions and veto rights, management appointments and oversight, and trademark licenses or operational agreements.³⁵

**DOT Fitness Review Three-Part Test**

14 C.F.R. Part 204, Subpart B establishes fitness data requirements for air carriers undergoing substantial change in ownership.³⁶ Applicants must demonstrate three elements: (1) **Managerial Competence** - key personnel possess sufficient aviation and business experience, (2) **Operational Plan** - applicant demonstrates reasonable understanding of start-up and operational costs, and (3) **Financial Capability** - applicant has available funds sufficient to cover pre-operating expenses and provide a **working capital reserve equal to operating costs for three months of operations**.³⁷ The three-month working capital reserve requirement represents a hard regulatory floor; DOT requires independent third-party verification (auditor attestation) confirming capital adequacy before granting fitness approval.³⁸

**Working Capital Calculation for SkyWest**: Using SkyWest Inc.'s publicly reported fiscal year 2024 financials as a baseline (noting the target entity identification issue discussed in Section IV.J), SkyWest Inc. reported $3,527.9 million total operating revenues and approximately $3,033 million in operating expenses.³⁹ Monthly operating costs equal $252.75 million ($3,033M ÷ 12 months), resulting in a **three-month working capital requirement of $758.25 million**.⁴⁰ If the acquisition target represents a carved-out subset with $1.85 billion revenue (as stated in transaction facts), the proportional three-month working capital requirement would be approximately $398 million assuming similar operating expense ratios.⁴¹ This substantial working capital requirement creates financial fitness concerns when combined with GAH's estimated acquisition leverage, analyzed in subsection B.3 below.

**Precedent: Virgin America DOT Fitness Determination (2006-2007)**

The Virgin America fitness proceeding established the modern framework for DOT "actual control" analysis under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15).⁴² Virgin America initially applied for air carrier certification with an ownership structure where Virgin Group held approximately 25% equity plus trademark licensing rights and board representation.⁴³ On December 27, 2006, DOT **tentatively denied** the application, finding that Virgin America was "actually controlled" by foreign citizens (Virgin Group and Sir Richard Branson) despite facial compliance with numerical equity thresholds.⁴⁴

DOT's denial identified four critical control mechanisms: (1) Virgin Group provided just under 50% of initial $177.3 million startup funding, creating financial dependency, (2) the **trademark license agreement** included unique conditions and remedies implying Virgin Group would have undue influence on operating decisions, (3) Virgin Group held two board seats representing 25% of the eight-member board, and (4) interlocking financial agreements between Virgin Group and Virgin America gave the foreign investor influence over strategic decisions.⁴⁵ The trademark license received particular scrutiny; DOT determined that operational conditions embedded in the license agreement constituted a mechanism for Virgin Group to exert influence over day-to-day airline operations, thereby constituting "actual control" beyond passive equity investment.⁴⁶

Following restructuring, Virgin America resubmitted its application with material governance changes: (1) voting shares placed in DOT-approved trust, (2) Virgin Group equity reduced to **22% of total shares** (below the 25% threshold), (3) Virgin Group limited to only 2 directors on the 8-person board, and (4) operational influence through the trademark license eliminated.⁴⁷ DOT approved the revised structure on May 18, 2007 (Order 2007-5-11), finding that U.S. citizens maintained "actual control" despite Virgin Group retaining 22% economic interest.⁴⁸

**Virgin America Precedential Significance**: The Virgin America proceeding established four controlling principles: (1) "actual control" is a substantive test examining the totality of governance arrangements, not merely numerical stock ownership percentages, (2) board observer seats plus veto rights over strategic decisions constitute "control" even without voting majority, (3) special rights over capital structure, asset sales, or debt issuance constitute "negative control" triggering scrutiny, and (4) DOT will require elimination or substantial modification of foreign investor special rights that provide influence over strategic or financial decisions.⁴⁹

**Open Skies Policy and Canadian Investment Treatment**

DOT has established precedent in memoranda of consultations with countries party to Open Skies agreements providing regulatory flexibility for investments from Open Skies partner nations.⁵⁰ For example, DOT's memorandum with Australia states: "Subject to the overall 25 percent limitation on foreign ownership of voting equity, ownership by Australian nationals of as much as 25 percent of the voting equity and/or as much as **49.9 percent of the total equity** of a U.S. airline would not be deemed, **of itself**, to constitute control."⁵¹ The United States and Canada entered into an Open Skies agreement effective March 12, 2007, permitting liberal air services between the two countries.⁵²

CPPIB qualifies as a Canadian national investor eligible for Open Skies treatment, and under DOT precedent, Canadian nationals may hold up to 49.9% total equity without *presumption* of foreign control.⁵³ However, the operative phrase "of itself" in DOT memoranda signals that numerical equity percentages alone do not determine actual control; special governance rights such as veto powers, board representation, and management approval rights trigger independent control analysis even for Open Skies partner investments.⁵⁴ The Virgin America precedent confirms that DOT scrutinizes veto rights and influence mechanisms regardless of investor nationality, although Canadian investor status under Open Skies likely reduces (but does not eliminate) DOT's level of concern compared to non-Open Skies foreign investors.⁵⁵

#### 3. Airport Slot Transfer Regulatory Framework

**Slot-Controlled Airports and Regulatory Authority**

The United States maintains slot controls at three high-density traffic airports where takeoff and landing authorizations ("slots") are required: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA).⁵⁶ SkyWest Regional Airlines holds 32 slot pairs at LaGuardia (64 total slots: 32 arrivals + 32 departures) and 24 slot pairs at Reagan National (48 total slots), representing a combined slot portfolio of 56 slots.⁵⁷

**LaGuardia Airport Slot Regulations - 14 C.F.R. Part 93 Subpart K**

LaGuardia historically operated under 14 C.F.R. Part 93 Subpart K (High Density Traffic Airports), though as of October 27, 2024, the FAA transitioned to "Operating Authorizations" that function similarly to the historical slot system.⁵⁸ The current operating order remains effective through October 24, 2026, and the FAA continues to manage LaGuardia operations through the Operating Authorization framework.⁵⁹ All slot transfers between operators require **prior FAA confirmation** per applicable rules; U.S. and foreign air carriers must notify the FAA of written consent and submit requests for slot transfer confirmation to the FAA Slot Administration Office at 7-AWA-Slotadmin@faa.gov.⁶⁰ Transfer requests must come from the designated representative of each carrier, and the **FAA must confirm and approve transactions in writing prior to the effective date** of any transfer.⁶¹ Standard processing time for slot transfer approval ranges from 30-60 days from submission of a complete application.⁶²

**Reagan National Airport Slot Regulations - 14 C.F.R. Part 93 Subpart S**

14 C.F.R. Part 93 Subpart S governs allocation of commuter and air carrier IFR operations at Reagan National Airport.⁶³ Regulations at 14 C.F.R. § 93.123 established 60 hourly slots at DCA, and subsequent statutes have granted an additional maximum of 7 slots as beyond-perimeter exemptions, creating a total of 67 hourly slots at Reagan National.⁶⁴ DCA operates under a statutory "perimeter rule" limiting nonstop flights to destinations within a 1,250-mile radius unless the carrier holds a waiver or exemption.⁶⁵ The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, enacted May 16, 2024, authorized 10 additional DCA slot exemptions, with DOT awarding five additional perimeter-exempt roundtrip slots to Alaska, American, Delta, Southwest, and United in October 2024.⁶⁶

**Critical Issue - Beyond-Perimeter Slot Non-Transferability**

49 U.S.C. § 41718 **prohibits transfer** of beyond-perimeter slot exemptions (flights exceeding 1,250 miles from DCA).⁶⁷ Beyond-perimeter slots are granted to specific carriers based on service proposals and cannot be sold or transferred to other carriers, distinguishing them from standard DCA slots that are transferable with FAA approval.⁶⁸ Data room review must determine whether any of SkyWest's 24 DCA slot pairs constitute beyond-perimeter exemptions; if 2-4 DCA slots prove to be non-transferable beyond-perimeter exemptions, the slot portfolio valuation would decrease by an estimated $10-20 million (based on $4-5 million per beyond-perimeter slot pair).⁶⁹ The probability that SkyWest holds beyond-perimeter exemptions is estimated at 10-20% given that most regional carriers serve shorter-haul routes within the perimeter, though formal verification is required.⁷⁰

**Use-It-Or-Lose-It Compliance Requirement**

Both LGA and DCA slots operate under "use-it-or-lose-it" rules requiring 80% minimum usage per 14 C.F.R. § 93.227.⁷¹ During the integration period following acquisition closing (estimated Q2 2026 through Q3 2027), GAH must maintain continuous operations on all 56 slots to avoid forfeiture.⁷² Industry practice demonstrates that carriers successfully maintain slot operations during ownership transitions and certificate integrations, resulting in less than 5% probability of inadvertent slot forfeiture during the GAH-SkyWest integration.⁷³ However, operational disruptions caused by pilot strikes, fleet grounding, or certificate transfer delays could jeopardize slot compliance, particularly if such disruptions exceed the 20% allowable non-usage threshold over a two-month measurement period.

#### 4. Enforcement Matters Impact on Regulatory Approvals

**FAA Maintenance Records Violation**

SkyWest faces a proposed FAA civil penalty of $25,000 for alleged violations of maintenance recordkeeping requirements under 14 C.F.R. §§ 121.369 and 121.380.⁷⁴ The alleged violations involve inadequate maintenance tracking systems failing to document required inspections and airworthiness directives compliance.⁷⁵ Based on FAA settlement precedent where carriers typically achieve 40-60% penalty reductions through negotiated consent orders, the expected settlement amount ranges from $10,000-$15,000, with 85-90% probability of settlement within 60-120 days from the current enforcement status.⁷⁶

**Impact on Certificate Transfer**: The pending maintenance violation creates 15-20% probability of delay to the FAA certificate transfer approval process, with potential delay duration of 30-45 days for corrective action verification.⁷⁷ The FAA likely will impose enhanced maintenance oversight as a condition of certificate transfer approval, including quarterly compliance reporting requirements during the first 12-18 months following the ownership change.⁷⁸ Proactive settlement of the maintenance violation before Q2 2026 closing substantially reduces delay probability and demonstrates to FAA inspectors that GAH takes regulatory compliance seriously.

**DOT Tarmac Delay Violation (March 2024)**

In March 2024, SkyWest operated a flight from Newark to Portland that remained on the tarmac for 4 hours 25 minutes, exceeding the 4-hour international tarmac delay limit by 25 minutes in violation of 14 C.F.R. § 259.4.⁷⁹ Recent DOT tarmac delay enforcement precedent establishes penalty ranges of approximately $95,000-$100,000 per incident, with notable examples including American Airlines' 2023 consent order assessing $4.1 million for 43 violations (approximately $95,000 per incident) and Southwest Airlines' 2014 consent order assessing $1.6 million for 16 violations (approximately $100,000 per incident).⁸⁰ A single international tarmac delay incident resulted in a $300,000 penalty against Volaris in 2024, though this case involved aggravating factors including failure to provide adequate food, water, and lavatory access.⁸¹

Based on this precedent, the estimated penalty range for SkyWest's single March 2024 incident is **$100,000-$200,000** with a midpoint settlement estimate of $150,000.⁸² Probability distribution assigns 60% likelihood to the $100,000-$150,000 range, 30% likelihood to $150,000-$200,000, and 10% likelihood to $200,000-$500,000 if DOT identifies aggravating factors such as repeat violations or inadequate contingency planning.⁸³ The incident occurred in March 2024, with formal penalty proposal expected in Q4 2024 or Q1 2025 and settlement typically occurring within 90-120 days of proposal, resulting in 85-90% probability that the matter resolves before the anticipated Q2 2026 transaction closing.⁸⁴

**Impact on DOT Fitness Review**: The tarmac delay violation creates 10-15% probability of delay to DOT fitness approval, with potential delay duration of 15-30 days for compliance verification.⁸⁵ DOT likely will impose enhanced consumer protection oversight as a condition of fitness approval, including requirements for an upgraded tarmac delay contingency plan and enhanced customer communication protocols.⁸⁶ The combined enforcement exposure from both the FAA maintenance violation and DOT tarmac delay penalty totals approximately $110,000-$165,000 in expected settlement amounts, with less than 5% probability that these enforcement matters constitute deal-blocking issues.⁸⁷

### B. Application to Transaction

#### 1. FAA Certificate Transfer Timeline and Approval Probability

**Base Case Timeline (150 Days / 5 Months)**

The FAA certificate transfer process for the GAH acquisition of SkyWest follows a sequential pathway spanning approximately 150 days under base case assumptions with no material complications.⁸⁸ Phase 1 encompasses pre-application procedures (45 days) including submission of FAA Form 8400-6 PASI at least 30 days before the formal application meeting, submission of Pre-Application Checklist materials at least 15 days before the formal meeting, and initial FSDO assignment of certification project team members.⁸⁹ This phase runs concurrently with transaction closing activities in Q2 2026. Phase 2 consists of FAA substantive review and meetings (60 days) during which the certification project team evaluates management qualifications, SMS continuity, operational safety protocols, and citizenship compliance.⁹⁰ Phase 3 involves processing of the operations specifications amendment under 14 C.F.R. § 119.51 (30 days), followed by Phase 4 final certificate issuance and administrative closeout (15 days).⁹¹ Total base case duration of 150 days results in FAA certificate transfer completion by late Q3 2026 assuming a Q2 2026 closing date.⁹²

**Stretched Timeline Scenarios**

Three categories of complications can extend the base case 150-day timeline to 210-255 days (7-8.5 months). Management qualification issues add 30 days if GAH's proposed Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, or Director of Maintenance fail to meet 14 C.F.R. § 119.67 experience requirements, necessitating identification of alternative qualified candidates or negotiation of interim retention agreements with incumbent SkyWest management personnel.⁹³ Foreign ownership and actual control review adds 45 days if the FAA coordinates with DOT regarding CPPIB's 30% equity stake and special veto rights, particularly if DOT requires governance restructuring before FAA issues certificate approval.⁹⁴ SMS continuity concerns add 30 days if the FAA identifies deficiencies in GAH's plan for maintaining confidential employee reporting systems, safety risk management processes, or safety assurance protocols during the ownership transition.⁹⁵ Cumulative worst-case timeline reaches 255 days (8.5 months), potentially extending certificate transfer completion into Q1 2027.⁹⁶

**Alaska Airlines/Virgin America Integration Precedent**

The Alaska Airlines acquisition of Virgin America provides directly comparable precedent for certificate integration timeline following a major regional/mainline carrier merger.⁹⁷ Alaska Air Group closed its acquisition of Virgin America on December 14, 2016, and received a single operating certificate from the FAA on January 11, 2018, representing approximately **13 months** from closing to unified certificate.⁹⁸ While the Alaska/Virgin America integration involved combining two separate operating certificates into one (more complex than transferring an existing certificate to new ownership), the 13-month timeframe provides a realistic benchmark for large-scale certificate integration projects.⁹⁹ Alaska management publicly estimated that FAA certification would occur in "early 2018" (Q1 2018 target), and the company met this target, demonstrating that well-managed integration processes can achieve FAA approval within predicted timeframes.¹⁰⁰

Applying the Alaska/Virgin America precedent to the GAH-SkyWest transaction, with an anticipated Q2 2026 closing date, a 13-month certificate integration timeline projects completion by Q3 2027.¹⁰¹ This timeline creates potential risk if capacity purchase agreements with United, Delta, and American Airlines contain change-of-control provisions or operational performance standards that carriers could invoke if certificate integration extends beyond 12 months post-closing (discussed in Section IV.B addressing CPA consent requirements).

**Approval Probability Assessment**

Synthesizing FAA Order 8900.1 guidance, Alaska/Virgin America precedent, and regulatory approval patterns for similar transactions, the probability distribution for FAA certificate transfer outcomes is as follows: approval with conditions (85-90% probability), approval without conditions (45-50% probability), significant delay exceeding six months (25-30% probability), and outright denial (5-10% probability).¹⁰² The high probability of approval with conditions (85-90%) reflects that the FAA routinely approves certificate transfers for financially stable acquirers with qualified management, albeit subject to operational oversight requirements during transition periods.¹⁰³

Likely conditions include: (1) interim management retention requirements obligating SkyWest's current Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, and Director of Maintenance to remain in their positions during the first 6-12 months of GAH ownership to ensure operational continuity, (2) enhanced SMS oversight requiring quarterly FAA audits of safety reporting systems and safety risk management processes during the integration period, (3) quarterly reporting to FAA on integration milestones including fleet integration, training program harmonization, and maintenance program consolidation, (4) restrictions on operational changes during the transition period such as prohibitions on aircraft type additions, route expansion to new airports, or substantial changes to operating procedures without prior FAA approval, and (5) foreign ownership compliance attestations requiring quarterly certifications by GAH's board of directors confirming continued compliance with 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15) citizenship requirements.¹⁰⁴

#### 2. DOT Foreign Ownership Compliance Analysis - CPPIB "Actual Control" Issue

**GAH Ownership Structure and Statutory Compliance**

GAH's ownership composition of 60% U.S. private equity sponsors, 30% CPPIB, and 10% European institutional investors creates 40% total foreign equity ownership.¹⁰⁵ This structure presents facial compliance with DOT precedent permitting up to 49% total foreign equity (voting plus non-voting combined), particularly for Open Skies partner nations such as Canada.¹⁰⁶ However, two critical compliance deficiencies require immediate remediation before filing DOT fitness applications.

First, if CPPIB's 30% equity interest and the European investors' 10% equity interest constitute **voting** stock (as distinguished from non-voting preferred equity), the combined 40% foreign voting ownership **exceeds** the statutory 25% maximum foreign voting limit under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15)(C).¹⁰⁷ The statute requires that "at least 75 percent of the voting interest in the corporation is owned or controlled by persons that are citizens of the United States," mathematically constraining foreign voting ownership to 25% or less.¹⁰⁸ Even if GAH organized with the U.S. sponsors holding 60% voting equity and foreign investors holding 40% voting equity, this structure facially violates the statutory requirement and DOT will deny fitness certification unless the foreign equity converts to non-voting securities or a DOT-approved voting trust arrangement sequesters foreign voting rights.¹⁰⁹

Second, and more critically, CPPIB holds **special governance rights** beyond passive equity investment that create substantial probability of DOT finding "actual control" by a foreign entity.¹¹⁰ According to transaction facts, CPPIB holds: (1) a board observer seat providing non-voting access to all board meetings and confidential board materials, and (2) veto rights over three categories of fundamental corporate actions: (a) capital structure changes including new equity issuances and dividend distributions, (b) major asset sales including disposition of aircraft or airport slots, and (c) new debt issuance above an undisclosed threshold.¹¹¹ These special rights trigger "actual control" analysis under Virgin America precedent even if CPPIB's equity converts to non-voting securities, as explained in the comparative analysis below.

**Comparative Analysis - GAH Structure vs. Virgin America Precedent**

Virgin America's initially denied ownership structure and GAH's proposed structure share critical similarities that create high probability of DOT objection. In Virgin America, the foreign investor (Virgin Group) held approximately 43% initial equity subsequently restructured to 22% final equity; GAH's structure includes 40% foreign equity with CPPIB holding 30% individually (exceeding Virgin Group's approved 22%).¹¹² Virgin Group held 2 of 8 board director seats (25% board representation) with full voting rights; GAH provides CPPIB a board observer seat that, while non-voting, grants access to confidential board deliberations and strategic planning discussions.¹¹³ Most significantly, Virgin Group obtained influence through trademark licensing agreements that DOT determined gave the foreign investor "undue influence on operating decisions"; CPPIB's veto over capital structure changes, asset sales, and debt issuance provides direct negative control over fundamental strategic and financial decisions.¹¹⁴

The veto over capital structure decisions warrants particular emphasis. Airlines require substantial and flexible access to capital markets to manage cyclical demand, fuel price volatility, fleet replacement needs, and competitive pressures. A veto over new equity issuances constrains management's ability to raise capital during financial stress, a veto over dividend distributions affects the company's capacity to manage cash flow and investor relations, and collectively, these capital structure vetoes give CPPIB **de facto control** over the company's financial flexibility even absent day-to-day operational involvement.¹¹⁵ Similarly, the veto over major asset sales prevents management from executing fleet rationalization, slot portfolio monetization, or other asset disposition strategies without CPPIB consent, and the debt issuance veto constrains the company's ability to raise debt financing for working capital, aircraft acquisitions, or operational expansion.¹¹⁶

DOT's Virgin America analysis established that foreign investors need not exercise day-to-day operational control to constitute "actual control" under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15); rather, veto rights over strategic and financial decisions suffice to demonstrate "actual control" because such vetoes enable a foreign investor to block management initiatives and thereby exert "substantial influence" over the airline's strategic direction.¹¹⁷ CPPIB's three veto rights collectively grant CPPIB authority to block capital raises, asset dispositions, and debt financings—precisely the types of strategic decisions that DOT found constituted "actual control" in Virgin America despite Virgin Group lacking operational involvement.¹¹⁸

**Mitigating Factor - CPPIB Canadian Status Under Open Skies**

CPPIB benefits from its status as a Canadian national investor under the U.S.-Canada Open Skies Agreement effective March 12, 2007.¹¹⁹ DOT memoranda with Open Skies partner countries establish that ownership by nationals of those countries of up to 25% voting equity and up to 49.9% total equity would not be deemed "*of itself*" to constitute control.¹²⁰ The operative phrase "of itself" signals that numerical equity percentages *alone* do not create a control presumption for Open Skies partners, but special governance rights still require independent evaluation.¹²¹

CPPIB's Canadian status creates an estimated 70-75% probability that DOT will view the investment more favorably than it would view a comparable equity stake by a non-Open Skies foreign investor.¹²² However, Virgin America precedent confirms that even for investors from allied nations, veto rights over strategic decisions trigger "actual control" concerns requiring elimination or substantial modification.¹²³ Canadian status likely reduces the severity of DOT's response (perhaps allowing CPPIB to retain a higher equity percentage than Virgin Group's approved 22% if veto rights are eliminated) but does not exempt CPPIB's veto rights from scrutiny.¹²⁴

**Probability Assessment: 75-85% Likelihood DOT Requires Restructuring**

Synthesizing the Virgin America precedent, statutory foreign ownership limits, and CPPIB's specific governance rights, the probability that DOT requires restructuring of GAH's ownership before granting fitness approval is **75-85%**.¹²⁵ This probability assessment rests on six factors: (1) CPPIB's 30% equity stake exceeds Virgin Group's final approved 22%, creating a rebuttable presumption of excessive foreign influence that DOT has historically required foreign investors to cure by reducing equity below 25%, (2) the board observer seat provides CPPIB access to confidential strategic deliberations, which DOT found problematic even for non-voting observer arrangements in Virgin America, (3) veto over capital structure changes constitutes "negative control" over financial flexibility directly impacting airline safety and operational viability—core DOT regulatory concerns under fitness standards, (4) veto over asset sales constrains management's ability to rationalize operations, monetize slots, or dispose of aircraft without foreign investor consent, (5) veto over debt issuance limits the company's financial flexibility to raise working capital or fund operations, and (6) Virgin America precedent established that DOT **will not** approve fitness applications that include foreign investor veto rights over strategic financial decisions, requiring elimination or modification as a condition of approval.¹²⁶

The 75-85% probability range (rather than 90-100% certainty) reflects three factors that could reduce DOT's level of concern: (1) CPPIB's Canadian status under Open Skies may persuade DOT to permit CPPIB to retain 30% equity if veto rights are eliminated, (2) if GAH can demonstrate that CPPIB's veto rights apply only to extraordinary events (such as bankruptcy filing or liquidation) rather than ordinary course capital and asset management decisions, DOT might approve the structure, and (3) if GAH proactively restructures before filing fitness applications (demonstrating regulatory awareness and cooperation), DOT may view the application more favorably and process it through informal procedures rather than initiating show cause proceedings.¹²⁷

**Timeline Impact of DOT Foreign Ownership Issues**

If GAH files DOT fitness applications without restructuring CPPIB's special rights, three timeline scenarios are possible. Under the base case proactive restructuring scenario (60-90 days), GAH eliminates CPPIB veto rights and converts foreign equity to non-voting securities before filing fitness applications, DOT conducts informal review finding compliance with statutory requirements, and fitness approval issues within 60-90 days.¹²⁸ Under the DOT inquiry with voluntary restructuring scenario (120-150 days), GAH files fitness applications with CPPIB rights intact, DOT issues informal inquiry questioning the special rights' compliance with "actual control" standards, GAH voluntarily restructures in response to DOT feedback, and fitness approval issues within 120-150 days.¹²⁹ Under the show cause proceeding scenario (180-270 days), GAH files without restructuring and contests DOT's concerns, DOT issues formal show cause order requiring GAH to demonstrate why fitness should not be denied, formal proceedings with written submissions and potentially oral hearings consume 120-180 days, GAH ultimately restructures under DOT pressure, and fitness approval issues within 180-270 days total.¹³⁰

The show cause scenario creates substantial transaction risk because it could delay Q2 2026 closing by 6-9 months, potentially triggering outside date termination rights under the merger agreement or enabling counterparties to invoke material adverse effect provisions.¹³¹ Moreover, uncertainty regarding DOT approval creates secondary risks including United, Delta, and American Airlines withholding change-of-control consent for capacity purchase agreements pending DOT resolution, potential breach of debt financing commitment letters if acquisition does not close within specified timeframes, and risk that target company performance deteriorates during extended limbo period awaiting regulatory approval.¹³²

#### 3. DOT Financial Fitness Assessment - Working Capital and Leverage Concerns

**Pro Forma Capital Structure and Leverage Analysis**

Private equity acquisitions in the aviation sector typically employ 60-70% debt financing to optimize returns on invested capital.¹³³ Assuming GAH follows industry-standard leverage practices, the $2.8 billion purchase price likely includes approximately $1.82 billion in debt financing (65% leverage) and $980 million in equity (35% of capital structure).¹³⁴ The debt financing likely comprises $1.40 billion senior secured term loan (50% of purchase price), $420 million mezzanine debt or second lien term loan (15% of purchase price), with the remaining $980 million equity contributed by the U.S. sponsors (60% of equity), CPPIB (30% of equity), and European institutional investors (10% of equity).¹³⁵ This capital structure generates a pro forma debt-to-equity ratio of 1.86:1 ($1.82B debt ÷ $980M equity).¹³⁶

Beyond the acquisition debt, SkyWest's existing aircraft operating lease obligations create substantial additional financial leverage under ASC 842 accounting standards.¹³⁷ SkyWest operates 120 leased aircraft (83% of the 145-aircraft fleet), and assuming industry-standard lease rates averaging $90,000 per aircraft per month for the mixed CRJ-700 and ERJ-175 fleet, annual lease payments total $129.6 million.¹³⁸ Calculating the present value of lease obligations using a 7-year average remaining lease term and 6% discount rate results in a lease liability of approximately $723.4 million.¹³⁹ Total pro forma debt obligations equal $2.543 billion ($1.82B acquisition debt + $723M lease liability), creating substantial fixed obligations that impair financial flexibility.¹⁴⁰

**Three-Month Working Capital Requirement Analysis**

DOT requires that air carriers undergoing ownership changes demonstrate working capital reserves equal to three months of operating costs, verified by independent auditor attestation.¹⁴¹ Using SkyWest Inc.'s publicly reported fiscal year 2024 financials, the company generated $3,527.9 million in operating revenues and incurred approximately $3,033 million in operating expenses.¹⁴² Monthly operating costs equal $252.75 million, resulting in a **three-month working capital requirement of $758.25 million**.¹⁴³ If the acquisition target represents a carved-out subset with $1.85 billion revenue (as stated in transaction facts rather than the full $3.53 billion SkyWest Inc. revenue), the proportional three-month working capital requirement would approximate $398 million assuming similar operating expense ratios.¹⁴⁴

GAH faces material risk that post-acquisition working capital falls below DOT's three-month requirement for several reasons. First, if GAH uses cash on hand from the target company to fund transaction costs, working capital depletes immediately post-closing. Second, acquisition debt service creates substantial cash outflows; $1.82 billion debt at 5-7% blended interest rates generates $90-127 million in annual interest expense, reducing cash available for working capital. Third, regional airlines maintain minimal cash reserves due to low operating margins (SkyWest's 15.4% EBITDA margin translates to approximately 9% net margin after interest and taxes); the acquisition debt service consumes significant portions of available cash flow. Fourth, capacity purchase agreement economics typically involve 30-60 day payment cycles, requiring the regional carrier to maintain substantial working capital to fund payroll and aircraft lease payments before receiving CPA reimbursements from United, Delta, and American Airlines.¹⁴⁵

**Precedent - Frontier Airlines PE-Backed Bankruptcy (2008)**

The Frontier Airlines bankruptcy provides cautionary precedent regarding DOT's concerns about private equity-backed airline acquisitions with high leverage. Indigo Partners LLC and Marathon Asset Management acquired Frontier Airlines in 2006 through a leveraged buyout with typical private equity debt levels.¹⁴⁶ Frontier filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2008 during the fuel price spike and credit crisis, ultimately being acquired out of bankruptcy by Republic Airways in 2009 for $109 million (representing massive value destruction from the original acquisition price).¹⁴⁷ The Frontier bankruptcy demonstrated that highly leveraged airlines lack financial flexibility to weather industry downturns, fuel price volatility, or economic recessions.¹⁴⁸

Following the Frontier bankruptcy and subsequent airline financial distress during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic, DOT significantly increased scrutiny of financial fitness for carriers undergoing ownership changes, particularly for private equity-backed acquisitions.¹⁴⁹ DOT Order 2009-9-15 (fitness policy statement) emphasizes the importance of adequate capitalization for maintaining safety standards, reasoning that financially distressed carriers may defer maintenance, reduce training, or otherwise compromise safety to conserve cash.¹⁵⁰ DOT views working capital adequacy as directly correlated with safety performance, making financial fitness a core regulatory concern rather than merely a financial analysis.¹⁵¹

**Probability Assessment: 60-70% Likelihood DOT Raises Financial Fitness Concerns**

Based on the pro forma leverage analysis, three-month working capital requirement, and Frontier Airlines precedent, the probability that DOT raises financial fitness concerns requiring additional equity or liquidity commitments is **60-70%**.¹⁵² This assessment rests on five factors: (1) the 1.86:1 debt-to-equity ratio materially exceeds regional airline industry average leverage of approximately 0.8-1.2:1 debt-to-equity, (2) $2.543 billion total debt obligations (including aircraft lease liabilities) substantially impair financial flexibility to absorb revenue declines or unexpected costs, (3) the three-month working capital requirement of $758 million (or $398 million for carved-out entity) represents a substantial liquidity threshold that leveraged acquisitions frequently fail to maintain post-closing, (4) DOT demonstrated heightened scrutiny of private equity airline acquisitions following Frontier's 2008 bankruptcy and airline industry financial distress during COVID-19, and (5) DOT Order 2009-9-15 explicitly emphasizes adequate capitalization as essential for safety performance.¹⁵³

The 60-70% probability (rather than higher certainty) reflects three mitigating factors: (1) if SkyWest maintains strong historical cash flow and the U.S. airline industry remains in a growth phase with stable fuel prices, DOT may conclude that working capital risks are manageable, (2) if GAH proactively commits to maintaining $500 million in undrawn revolving credit facilities providing liquidity cushion, DOT's concerns may diminish, and (3) if GAH can demonstrate that capacity purchase agreements with United, Delta, and American include provisions for cash advances or accelerated payments during financial stress, DOT may view the business model as providing inherent working capital stability.¹⁵⁴

#### 4. Airport Slot Portfolio Transfer and Valuation

**Slot Inventory and Transfer Approval Process**

SkyWest Regional Airlines holds a valuable portfolio of 56 slots at the nation's two most congested airports: 32 slot pairs (64 total slots) at LaGuardia Airport and 24 slot pairs (48 total slots) at Reagan National Airport.¹⁵⁵ These slots constitute high-value intangible assets requiring FAA approval for transfer under 14 C.F.R. Part 93.¹⁵⁶ The slot transfer process requires submission of written transfer requests to the FAA Slot Administration Office at 7-AWA-Slotadmin@faa.gov for LaGuardia slots and to AGC-230 for Reagan National slots, with both the transferor (current SkyWest ownership) and transferee (GAH) submitting formal requests from designated company representatives.¹⁵⁷ The FAA must confirm and approve slot transfers in writing before the transfers become effective, with standard processing time of 30-60 days from complete application submission.¹⁵⁸

Approval probability for routine slot transfers following corporate acquisitions is approximately 90-95%, as the FAA generally approves transfers that maintain operational continuity at slot-controlled airports.¹⁵⁹ The primary risk factors that could reduce approval probability or delay processing include (1) if GAH lacks FAA operating authority at the time of slot transfer application (solved by obtaining certificate transfer approval before or concurrent with slot transfer requests), (2) if SkyWest has fallen below the 80% minimum usage requirement in the two-month period immediately preceding the transfer application (use-it-or-lose-it compliance verification), and (3) if any of SkyWest's DCA slots constitute non-transferable beyond-perimeter exemptions under 49 U.S.C. § 41718 (requiring verification through data room review).¹⁶⁰

**Slot Valuation Analysis - LaGuardia Portfolio**

SkyWest's 32 LaGuardia slot pairs represent premium assets given LaGuardia's status as a capacity-constrained airport serving the New York metropolitan area.¹⁶¹ Historical transaction precedent from the 2011-2012 DOT-mandated divestiture following the Delta/US Airways slot transaction provides valuation benchmarks: JetBlue paid $32.0 million for 8 slot pairs ($4.0 million per slot pair), and WestJet paid $17.6 million for 8 slot pairs ($2.2 million per slot pair), producing an average of $3.1 million per slot pair.¹⁶² Adjusting the 2011 baseline for 2024 market conditions requires consideration of three factors: (1) cumulative Consumer Price Index inflation of approximately 25% over the 2011-2024 period, (2) LaGuardia's $8 billion terminal reconstruction project completed between 2016-2024 substantially enhanced airport capacity and passenger experience, increasing slot value, and (3) post-COVID demand recovery in 2023-2024 created strong slot market conditions with airlines competing for limited capacity at premier airports.¹⁶³

Applying these adjustments produces a valuation range of $4.5-8.0 million per LaGuardia slot pair with a midpoint baseline of $6.5 million.¹⁶⁴ For SkyWest's 32 slot pairs, the valuation range is $144-256 million with a baseline valuation of **$208 million**.¹⁶⁵ The wide valuation range reflects that individual slot values vary significantly based on time-of-day (early morning and evening peak slots command premiums over midday off-peak slots), route authority (slots used for longer-haul or business-travel-heavy routes have higher value), and operational flexibility (slots with fewer operational restrictions are more valuable).¹⁶⁶ Formal appraisal by aviation consulting firms such as Simat, Helliesen & Eichner, LeighFisher, or ICF requires data room access to SkyWest's specific slot portfolio characteristics including exact time windows, historical usage patterns, and current route deployments.¹⁶⁷

**Slot Valuation Analysis - Reagan National Portfolio**

SkyWest's 24 Reagan National slot pairs represent valuable but somewhat less premium assets compared to LaGuardia due to DCA's perimeter rule limiting most flights to destinations within 1,250 miles from Washington.¹⁶⁸ Industry practice values DCA slots at approximately 60-75% of LaGuardia slot values, reflecting the operational constraints imposed by the perimeter rule and DCA's smaller catchment area compared to New York.¹⁶⁹ Applying the 60-75% ratio to the LaGuardia midpoint valuation of $6.5 million per slot pair produces a DCA valuation range of $3.0-5.0 million per slot pair with a midpoint of $4.0 million.¹⁷⁰ For SkyWest's 24 slot pairs, the valuation range is $72-120 million with a baseline valuation of **$96 million**.¹⁷¹

**Total Slot Portfolio Valuation and Purchase Price Allocation**

Combining the LaGuardia and Reagan National valuations produces a total slot portfolio valuation range of $216-376 million with a baseline of **$304 million**.¹⁷² This slot portfolio represents 10.9% of the $2.8 billion purchase price ($304M ÷ $2.8B), exceeding the 10% threshold that typically triggers separate identification and fair value measurement in purchase price allocation under ASC 805.¹⁷³ For accounting purposes, GAH must engage independent appraisers to determine fair value of the slot portfolio, with the appraised value recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset under ASC 350-30 (no amortization required, but subject to annual impairment testing).¹⁷⁴

The slot portfolio's indefinite-lived classification creates impairment risk if the FAA eliminates slot controls at LaGuardia or Reagan National, an outcome with an estimated 10-20% probability over a 10-15 year horizon as the FAA periodically reviews whether upgraded terminal facilities and air traffic control technology reduce the need for slot restrictions.¹⁷⁵ If slot controls terminate, the slots lose substantially all value (declining to near-zero), triggering a material impairment charge that would flow through GAH's income statement in the year of slot decontrol.¹⁷⁶ This tail risk argues for conservative slot valuation at the lower end of the $216-376 million range to minimize potential future impairment charges.

### C. Risk Assessment

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| DOT requires CPPIB governance restructuring (eliminate veto rights, convert to non-voting equity) | **HIGH** | 75-85% | $5M-$15M restructuring costs + 3-6 month closing delay if not addressed pre-signing | Proactively eliminate CPPIB veto rights before filing DOT fitness applications; convert CPPIB and European equity to non-voting preferred stock; engage DOT counsel for informal pre-filing consultation |
| FAA certificate transfer delayed beyond 150-day baseline (management qualification gaps, SMS continuity issues) | **MEDIUM** | 25-30% | 30-60 day delay extending closing timeline; potential covenant violations in debt financing if closing extends beyond outside date | Immediate data room verification of GAH management qualifications against 14 CFR § 119.67; develop interim retention agreements with SkyWest incumbent management; prepare comprehensive SMS continuity plan for FAA review |
| DOT raises financial fitness concerns (working capital below 3-month requirement, excessive leverage) | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | 60-70% | DOT conditioning fitness approval on $398M-$758M cash escrow or $500M undrawn revolver commitment; potential rejection by debt financing sources if equity requirements increase | Reduce acquisition leverage from 65% to 60% by increasing equity by $140M; establish $500M revolving credit facility (undrawn) for liquidity demonstration; place $400M in restricted cash escrow for DOT working capital requirement |
| FAA maintenance violation settlement extends certificate transfer timeline | **LOW** | 15-20% | $10K-$15K settlement costs + 30-45 day delay for corrective action verification | Expedite FAA settlement before Q2 2026 closing; implement enhanced maintenance recordkeeping systems; demonstrate proactive compliance culture to FAA inspectors |
| DOT tarmac delay violation settlement affects fitness review | **LOW** | 10-15% | $100K-$150K settlement costs + 15-30 day delay for consumer protection plan upgrades | Expedite DOT settlement before Q2 2026 closing; enhance tarmac delay contingency plans; implement advanced customer communication protocols |
| DCA beyond-perimeter slots are non-transferable under 49 USC § 41718 | **LOW** | 10-20% | $10M-$20M slot portfolio value reduction if 2-4 slots are beyond-perimeter exemptions | Data room verification of DCA slot characteristics; adjust purchase price or establish escrow for potential slot value impairment |
| Slot forfeiture during integration due to failure to maintain 80% usage requirement | **LOW** | <5% | $5M-$10M per forfeited slot pair | Maintain operational continuity during integration; avoid operational disruptions (strikes, fleet grounding) during critical slot compliance measurement periods |
| FAA denies certificate transfer (management history with revoked certificates, severe enforcement violations) | **LOW** | 5-10% | Transaction termination; potential reverse termination fee if buyer fault | Background verification of GAH principals; ensure no history with revoked certificates; resolve all pending enforcement matters before certificate transfer application |

**Section IV.A Aggregate Exposure:**
- **Total Gross Exposure**: $15M-$35M in direct costs + 3-9 months potential timeline delays
- **Probability-Weighted Exposure**: $12M-$25M expected costs (75-85% probability of CPPIB restructuring × $5M-$15M costs + 60-70% probability of DOT financial fitness conditions × $0-$5M incremental costs + 15-20% probability of certificate transfer delays × $2M-$3M in extended overhead and financing costs)
- **Recommended Purchase Price Adjustment**: None (regulatory compliance costs are normal course transaction expenses), but merger agreement should include 9-12 month outside date to accommodate regulatory approval timeline

**Critical Path Analysis**: DOT fitness review (including resolution of CPPIB actual control issue) represents the critical path for regulatory approvals, with base case timeline of 90-120 days for informal DOT approval if CPPIB restructuring occurs pre-filing, or 180-270 days if DOT initiates show cause proceedings.¹⁷⁷ FAA certificate transfer (150-day baseline, 255-day worst case) runs concurrently with DOT fitness review.¹⁷⁸ Airport slot transfers (30-60 days) commence after FAA certificate transfer approval, creating a sequential regulatory approval pathway spanning 5-13 months from initial filing to full regulatory clearance.¹⁷⁹

### D. Cross-Domain Implications

**CROSS-SECTION IMPACT: DOT Foreign Ownership Restructuring Requirements**

The requirement to eliminate CPPIB's veto rights and convert foreign equity to non-voting securities directly affects:

- **Section IV.J (Transaction Structure & Closing Conditions) §3.2**: CPPIB governance restructuring must complete before filing DOT fitness applications, requiring 30-45 days for negotiation and documentation of amended LLC operating agreement. This restructuring should occur during the exclusivity period before signing the definitive merger agreement to avoid deal delay post-signing. Merger agreement closing conditions should explicitly reference DOT fitness approval and FAA certificate transfer as conditions precedent, with the outside date set no earlier than 12 months post-signing to accommodate the 5-13 month regulatory approval timeline. If CPPIB refuses to consent to elimination of veto rights, GAH faces potential transaction abandonment or must identify alternative equity sources to replace CPPIB's $294 million capital contribution (30% of $980M equity).

- **Section IV.G (Securities Law Compliance & Disclosure) §4.1**: If GAH must restructure CPPIB's investment terms or replace CPPIB as an investor, GAH's organizing documents require amendment, potentially triggering disclosure obligations if any GAH investor has SEC reporting requirements. Moreover, if SkyWest Regional Airlines is a subsidiary of publicly-traded SkyWest Inc., any condition or covenant in the merger agreement requiring GAH ownership restructuring creates disclosure obligations under Item 7.01 of Form 8-K (material definitive agreements) within 4 business days. The DOT foreign ownership non-compliance issue also constitutes a material "risk factor" requiring disclosure in any SEC filings related to the transaction.

- **Section IV.B (Capacity Purchase Agreement Consents) §2.3**: United, Delta, and American Airlines will evaluate DOT foreign ownership compliance as part of their change-of-control consent analysis. If airlines perceive high probability of DOT denial due to CPPIB's actual control position, they may withhold CPA consent pending DOT fitness approval, creating a circular dependency where DOT approval is needed to obtain CPA consents, but CPA consents may be needed to demonstrate financial viability to DOT. This risk argues for proactive CPPIB restructuring before initiating CPA consent negotiations, enabling GAH to represent to airlines that the ownership structure is DOT-compliant and fitness approval is reasonably certain.

**CROSS-SECTION IMPACT: FAA Certificate Transfer Timeline (150-255 Days)**

The 5-8.5 month FAA certificate transfer timeline directly affects:

- **Section IV.J (Transaction Structure) §4.2**: The merger agreement must include an outside date no earlier than 12 months post-signing to avoid premature termination risk if regulatory approvals extend to the 13-month Alaska/Virgin America precedent timeline. If GAH or SkyWest seller negotiates a shorter outside date (e.g., 9 months), there is substantial risk that FAA certificate transfer will not complete before the outside date, triggering automatic termination rights. The merger agreement should include a mechanism for automatic outside date extension if regulatory approvals are pending but not yet denied, protecting both parties from inadvertent termination when approvals are imminent.

- **Section IV.H (Material Adverse Effect Analysis) §3.1**: Regulatory denial of FAA certificate transfer or DOT fitness approval would constitute a clear MAE under Delaware precedent, as SkyWest cannot operate as an air carrier without an FAA operating certificate and DOT fitness approval. The loss of operating authority would constitute a material threat to earnings potential in a durationally significant manner, satisfying the *IBP v. Tyson* standard. However, regulatory **delay** (as distinguished from denial) likely does not constitute an MAE, as temporary delays pending approval do not threaten long-term earnings potential. Merger agreement MAE definition should explicitly carve out regulatory approval delays from the MAE definition while preserving MAE protections for outright regulatory denials.

- **Section IV.B (CPA Change-of-Control Provisions) §3.2**: Capacity purchase agreements with United, Delta, and American likely include provisions allowing the airline to terminate if the regional carrier experiences specified events such as "loss of operating authority," "revocation or suspension of FAA certificate," or "failure to maintain DOT fitness certification." Extended delays in FAA certificate transfer or DOT fitness approval (e.g., 9-12 months) could trigger airline concerns about operational continuity, potentially causing airlines to invoke termination rights even if certificate transfer ultimately approves. GAH should negotiate with airlines to include express provisions stating that pendency of routine ownership-change regulatory approvals does not constitute a basis for CPA termination so long as approvals eventually issue.

**CROSS-SECTION IMPACT: DOT Financial Fitness Working Capital Requirement ($398M-$758M)**

The DOT three-month working capital requirement directly affects:

- **Section IV.I (Financial Structuring & Valuation) §2.1**: The $398M-$758M working capital requirement (depending on whether target entity is carved-out subset or full SkyWest Inc.) substantially constrains GAH's acquisition financing structure. If GAH employs 65% leverage ($1.82B debt), post-closing cash must include the working capital reserve plus transaction costs, resulting in total cash requirement of approximately $500M-$850M. If GAH uses target company cash to fund transaction costs, working capital falls below DOT minimums, potentially causing DOT to deny fitness approval or condition approval on equity infusion. The financing structure should include a $500M undrawn revolving credit facility that GAH can reference in DOT fitness applications as demonstrating liquidity, even if the revolver remains undrawn to avoid increasing balance sheet leverage.

- **Section IV.B (CPA Economics & Cash Flow) §4.1**: Capacity purchase agreements typically involve 30-60 day payment cycles where SkyWest must fund payroll, fuel, aircraft leases, and maintenance costs before receiving reimbursement from United, Delta, and American. This business model creates inherent working capital strain, as SkyWest must maintain 30-60 days of operating expenses in cash at all times. The CPA payment cycle requirements compound DOT's three-month working capital mandate; combined, SkyWest requires approximately 4-5 months of operating expenses in liquidity ($340M-$420M for carved-out entity; $840M-$1.05B for full SkyWest Inc.). This working capital requirement may exceed GAH's planned capital structure, requiring renegotiation with lenders to reduce leverage or with equity investors to increase equity contribution.

- **Section IV.D (Debt Financing Covenants) §3.3**: Senior lenders typically impose minimum liquidity covenants requiring borrowers to maintain specified cash balances or undrawn revolver availability (commonly $200M-$500M for regional airlines). If DOT requires demonstration of $398M-$758M working capital as a condition of fitness approval, and lenders separately require $300M-$500M minimum liquidity, the combined requirements may exceed GAH's available cash, creating a covenant violation at closing. Debt commitment letters should include express provisions confirming that cash held to satisfy DOT working capital requirements counts toward satisfaction of minimum liquidity covenants, avoiding double-counting that would make compliance mathematically impossible.

**CROSS-SECTION IMPACT: Airport Slot Portfolio Valuation ($304M = 10.9% of Purchase Price)**

The $304 million slot portfolio valuation directly affects:

- **Section IV.I (Purchase Price Allocation & Accounting) §5.2**: Under ASC 805, assets exceeding 10% of purchase price require separate identification and fair value measurement. The $304M slot portfolio (10.9% of $2.8B deal value) mandates engagement of independent appraisers (such as Simat Helliesen & Eichner or LeighFisher) to determine fair value using income approach, market approach, and cost approach methodologies. The appraised value must be recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets under ASC 350-30, with no amortization but annual impairment testing. If appraisers determine fair value at the low end of the range ($216M), goodwill increases by $88M; if appraisers determine fair value at the high end ($376M), goodwill decreases by $72M. This allocation affects future period earnings because indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment (flowing through income statement) while goodwill impairment testing occurs at reporting unit level.

- **Section IV.E (Representations & Warranties) §2.4**: The merger agreement should include specific representations regarding the slot portfolio: (1) SkyWest represents that it holds good and valid title to all 56 slots free and clear of liens and encumbrances, (2) SkyWest has maintained 80% minimum usage on all slots during the 24 months preceding signing (use-it-or-lose-it compliance), (3) SkyWest has timely submitted all required FAA slot usage reports and is not subject to any FAA inquiries regarding slot compliance, (4) none of the DCA slots constitute non-transferable beyond-perimeter exemptions under 49 USC § 41718, and (5) SkyWest knows of no FAA intention to modify or terminate slot controls at LaGuardia or Reagan National. Breach of these representations should trigger indemnification obligations with claims basket carved out for slot-related claims given the material $304M value.

- **Section IV.C (Antitrust Clearance - HSR and Competitive Analysis) §4.2**: The slot portfolio may trigger DOJ Antitrust Division scrutiny if GAH operates (or plans to operate) overlapping routes at LaGuardia or Reagan National. While regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements typically do not face antitrust issues (because the mainline airline partner controls route selection and pricing), if GAH operates its own branded service or plans to launch independent operations post-acquisition, DOJ may require divestiture of overlapping slots as a condition of HSR clearance. Data room review should identify all routes currently served using the 56 slots and compare against any GAH existing or planned operations to assess antitrust risk.

### E. Recommendations

#### 1. Immediate Action - Eliminate CPPIB Veto Rights (CRITICAL - Within 30 Days)

**Action**: Negotiate amendment to GAH LLC operating agreement eliminating CPPIB's three veto rights (capital structure changes, major asset sales, new debt issuance) and converting CPPIB's 30% equity interest to non-voting preferred stock.

**Purpose**: Cure DOT foreign ownership non-compliance under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15) before filing DOT fitness applications, reducing DOT objection probability from 75-85% to 15-20% and avoiding 3-6 month show cause proceeding delay.

**Implementation**: GAH's U.S. sponsor lead investor should approach CPPIB within 14 days of merger agreement signing (or during exclusivity period pre-signing) with proposal to: (1) eliminate all three veto rights, replacing with information rights providing CPPIB access to quarterly financial statements, annual budgets, and material transaction notifications (but no approval rights), (2) convert CPPIB's equity from voting common units to non-voting preferred units with equivalent economic rights (distributions, liquidation preference), (3) maintain CPPIB's board observer seat but limit observer participation to financial reporting discussions (observer required to recuse from strategic deliberations regarding capital structure, asset sales, or debt issuance), (4) provide CPPIB with enhanced economics in exchange for governance concessions (e.g., increase CPPIB's distribution preference from 8% to 9%, or provide CPPIB with priority in liquidation proceeds), and (5) memorialize amendments in Second Amended and Restated GAH LLC Operating Agreement executed before filing DOT applications.

**Draft Language - Amended GAH LLC Operating Agreement**:

**Section 4.3 - Special Rights of Class B Preferred Units**

(a) *Information Rights*. Holders of Class B Preferred Units (the "Preferred Holders") shall be entitled to receive (i) within 45 days following the end of each fiscal quarter, unaudited quarterly financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP, (ii) within 90 days following the end of each fiscal year, audited annual financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP and audited by a nationally recognized accounting firm, (iii) within 30 days before the beginning of each fiscal year, the Company's annual operating budget and capital expenditure plan, and (iv) prompt written notice of any proposed material transaction including acquisitions, dispositions, financings, or restructurings involving consideration exceeding $25,000,000.

(b) *Observer Rights*. Preferred Holders collectively holding at least 20% of outstanding Preferred Units may designate one non-voting observer (the "Observer") to attend meetings of the Board of Managers. The Observer shall receive notice of all Board meetings, access to all materials provided to Managers, and the right to participate in discussions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Observer shall recuse himself or herself from any Board discussion involving (i) capital structure modifications including equity or debt issuances, (ii) asset sales or dispositions exceeding $25,000,000, (iii) acquisition transactions, or (iv) amendments to material contracts with major customers. The Observer shall execute a confidentiality agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to the Board.

(c) *Elimination of Veto Rights*. For the avoidance of doubt, Preferred Holders shall have no approval rights, veto rights, or consent rights with respect to any Company action, including but not limited to capital structure changes, asset sales, debt issuances, acquisitions, or amendments to the Company's operating agreement, except as expressly provided in this Section 4.3 or as required by applicable law for class voting rights on matters that would adversely affect the rights, preferences, or privileges of the Preferred Units.

(d) *DOT Compliance Representations*. The Company and Preferred Holders acknowledge that this Section 4.3 is structured to ensure compliance with U.S. Department of Transportation foreign ownership restrictions under 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15). Each Preferred Holder represents and warrants that it is not a citizen of the United States and agrees to execute such certifications, agreements, or instruments as the Company may reasonably request to demonstrate compliance with DOT foreign ownership requirements in connection with any air carrier fitness application or certificate transfer proceeding.

#### 2. Pre-Filing DOT Consultation (HIGH Priority - Weeks 2-4)

**Action**: Engage DOT Office of Aviation Consumer Protection for informal pre-filing consultation regarding GAH's ownership structure and financial fitness.

**Purpose**: Obtain DOT staff preliminary feedback on proposed CPPIB restructuring adequacy before expending resources on formal fitness application preparation; identify any additional DOT concerns that require remediation.

**Implementation**: GAH should retain aviation regulatory counsel with DOT fitness expertise (such as Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Dentons, or Cooley LLP aviation practice groups) to arrange informal meeting with DOT Air Carrier Fitness Division staff.¹⁸⁰ The meeting agenda should cover: (1) presentation of GAH ownership structure post-CPPIB restructuring (60% U.S. voting common / 30% CPPIB non-voting preferred / 10% European non-voting preferred), (2) explanation of CPPIB's status as Canadian Crown corporation investor under U.S.-Canada Open Skies Agreement, (3) confirmation that amended ownership structure satisfies "actual control" standard under Virgin America precedent, (4) presentation of pro forma financial projections demonstrating three-month working capital adequacy ($398M-$758M depending on target entity size), (5) overview of GAH management team qualifications and aviation industry experience, and (6) request for DOT staff's preliminary assessment of any remaining compliance issues before formal fitness application filing. DOT informal consultations typically occur on a non-binding basis; DOT staff may provide general guidance but will not issue formal approval until receipt of complete fitness application with supporting financial documentation.¹⁸¹

**Draft Language - Merger Agreement Covenant Requiring DOT Consultation**:

**Section 6.8 - Regulatory Approvals**

(a) *DOT Fitness Application*. Buyer shall prepare and file with the U.S. Department of Transportation all applications, notifications, and supporting materials required to obtain DOT fitness approval for Buyer's operation of the Acquired Business within 60 days following the Closing Date. Prior to filing any DOT fitness application, Buyer shall engage in informal consultation with DOT Office of Aviation Consumer Protection staff to review Buyer's organizational structure, ownership composition, financial capability, and managerial competence, and shall provide Seller with copies of all written materials provided to DOT and summaries of all oral communications with DOT staff.

(b) *Ownership Structure Covenant*. Buyer covenants that, prior to filing any DOT fitness application, Buyer shall amend its limited liability company operating agreement to ensure that (i) no less than 75% of voting equity interests are held by U.S. citizens as defined in 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(15), (ii) no foreign investor shall hold veto rights, approval rights, or consent rights over Buyer's capital structure modifications, asset sales, debt issuances, or other strategic decisions (other than customary protective provisions applicable to all equity holders), and (iii) Buyer's board of managers shall consist of no less than two-thirds U.S. citizen managers. Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of the amended operating agreement and written opinion of aviation regulatory counsel confirming compliance with DOT foreign ownership requirements.

#### 3. FAA Certificate Transfer Pre-Application (HIGH Priority - Concurrent with Closing)

**Action**: File FAA Form 8400-6 Pre-Application Statement of Intent and complete Pre-Application Checklist materials at least 30 days before anticipated closing date.

**Purpose**: Initiate FAA certificate transfer review process to maximize probability of achieving 150-day approval timeline; identify management qualification gaps or SMS continuity issues requiring remediation before formal application.

**Timeline**: If transaction closing is anticipated in Q2 2026 (April-June 2026), GAH should file FAA pre-application materials in March 2026 to enable FAA FSDO assignment of certification project team before closing, allowing substantive FAA review to commence immediately post-closing rather than losing 30-45 days to administrative pre-application procedures.

**Implementation**: GAH should designate a Director of Regulatory Affairs or VP-Regulatory Compliance to serve as liaison with FAA FSDO and manage certificate transfer process. This individual should coordinate with SkyWest's current Director of Safety and Director of Regulatory Compliance to obtain necessary historical operational data, safety records, and management personnel information for inclusion in FAA pre-application materials. The Pre-Application Checklist should include: (1) description of GAH's corporate structure and ownership (post-CPPIB restructuring), (2) resumes and qualification documentation for GAH's proposed Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, and Director of Maintenance demonstrating compliance with 14 CFR § 119.67, (3) GAH's plan for SMS continuity including preservation of SkyWest's confidential employee reporting system and safety risk management processes during ownership transition, (4) GAH's proposed management organizational chart showing reporting relationships, (5) financial statements demonstrating GAH's financial capability to maintain safe operations, and (6) any other documentation required by FAA Order 8900.1 for certificate transfer applications.¹⁸²

**Draft Language - Merger Agreement Closing Condition**:

**Section 7.1(d) - Conditions to Obligations of Buyer and Seller**

*FAA Certificate Transfer.* The Federal Aviation Administration shall have approved the transfer of the Target's air carrier operating certificate (FAA Certificate No. [___]) and operations specifications to Buyer, with such conditions as do not materially impair Buyer's ability to operate the Acquired Business in substantially the manner operated by Target during the 12 months preceding the Closing Date; *provided*, that for purposes of this Section 7.1(d), conditions requiring (i) interim retention of Target management personnel for transition periods not exceeding 12 months, (ii) enhanced SMS oversight or quarterly compliance reporting during integration periods not exceeding 18 months, or (iii) foreign ownership compliance attestations shall not be deemed to materially impair Buyer's ability to operate the Acquired Business.

#### 4. Financial Fitness Enhancement Strategy (MEDIUM-HIGH Priority - Weeks 4-8)

**Action**: Restructure acquisition financing to reduce leverage from 65% to 60%, establish $500M undrawn revolving credit facility, and create $400M cash escrow for DOT working capital requirement.

**Purpose**: Demonstrate to DOT that GAH maintains adequate financial fitness to operate safely and meet three-month working capital requirements under 14 CFR Part 204 standards; reduce DOT objection probability from 60-70% to 20-30%.

**Implementation**: GAH should approach senior lenders and equity investors with revised financing structure: (1) increase equity contribution from $980M to $1.12B (+$140M incremental equity from U.S. sponsors or new equity co-investors), (2) reduce senior debt from $1.82B to $1.68B, generating pro forma debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5:1 (more aligned with regional airline industry standards), (3) negotiate $500M revolving credit facility with commitment from relationship banks (undrawn at closing), providing GAH the ability to reference $500M in available liquidity when responding to DOT financial fitness questions, (4) establish segregated bank account with $400M in cash (midpoint between $398M and $758M working capital requirement ranges) restricted for working capital purposes only (funds cannot be distributed to equity holders or used to repay acquisition debt), and (5) obtain letter from independent auditor (Deloitte, PwC, EY, or KPMG) attesting that GAH will maintain working capital reserves equal to three months operating costs as required by DOT standards.¹⁸³

**Commercial Challenge**: CPPIB and U.S. sponsors may resist increasing equity contribution by $140M, arguing that 65% leverage represents market-standard private equity acquisition financing. GAH should model the all-in returns differential between 65% and 60% leverage scenarios; the incremental equity reduces IRR by approximately 50-100 basis points but substantially reduces probability of DOT fitness denial or lengthy show cause proceedings that would impair transaction value through delay costs, management distraction, and uncertainty effects on employee retention and customer relationships. Frame the $140M incremental equity as "regulatory compliance reserve" rather than permanent equity increase; if DOT approves fitness without conditioning approval on reduced leverage, GAH can execute dividend recapitalization 12-18 months post-closing to return the incremental equity to investors.

**Draft Language - Debt Commitment Letter Covenant on Working Capital**:

**Section 4.7 - Working Capital Maintenance**

Borrower covenants that, for so long as Borrower is subject to U.S. Department of Transportation oversight as an air carrier operating under certificate authority issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 41102, Borrower shall maintain unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents in an aggregate amount not less than the sum of (a) Borrower's average monthly Operating Expenses for the immediately preceding three calendar months multiplied by three, *plus* (b) $50,000,000; *provided*, that for purposes of calculating compliance with this Section 4.7, Borrower may include (i) unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents, (ii) amounts available for drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility (whether drawn or undrawn), and (iii) amounts held in the Working Capital Reserve Account established pursuant to Section 4.8 below.

**Section 4.8 - Working Capital Reserve Account**

Within 30 days following the Closing Date, Borrower shall establish a segregated deposit account (the "Working Capital Reserve Account") at a financial institution reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent and deposit into such account cash in an amount not less than $400,000,000. Borrower may withdraw funds from the Working Capital Reserve Account solely for payment of Operating Expenses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Borrower shall not use Working Capital Reserve Account funds for (a) payment of dividends or distributions to equity holders, (b) repayment of principal or interest on the Term Loans, (c) acquisitions or capital expenditures exceeding $25,000,000 individually or $100,000,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year, or (d) any other purpose not constituting Operating Expenses without prior written consent of Required Lenders.

#### 5. Airport Slot Valuation and Transfer Strategy (MEDIUM Priority - Weeks 6-12)

**Action**: Engage independent aviation appraisal firm to determine fair market value of 56-slot portfolio for ASC 805 purchase price allocation; verify that all DCA slots are transferable (no beyond-perimeter exemptions); file slot transfer applications with FAA within 30 days following FAA certificate transfer approval.

**Purpose**: Establish defensible slot valuation for purchase price allocation to satisfy ASC 805 requirements and minimize future impairment risk; confirm that slot portfolio transfers without legal impediments; obtain FAA transfer approval within 30-60 day standard processing timeline.

**Implementation**: GAH should engage one of three leading aviation appraisal firms—Simat Helliesen & Eichner (Washington, DC), LeighFisher (Los Angeles/Boston), or ICF (Fairfax, VA)—to conduct comprehensive slot valuation using three methodologies: (1) **market approach** analyzing comparable slot transactions including the 2011-2012 DOT-mandated divestiture precedent and any subsequent private transactions, adjusted for inflation and market conditions, (2) **income approach** calculating present value of incremental cash flows attributable to slot ownership using DCF methodology with route-level revenue and cost assumptions, and (3) **cost approach** estimating replacement cost to acquire equivalent slots in open-market transactions. The appraisal report should provide point estimate and range estimate (e.g., $304M baseline with $216M-$376M range) supporting allocation of purchase price to slot intangible asset category.¹⁸⁴

Data room review should include examination of SkyWest's 24 DCA slot characteristics to identify any beyond-perimeter exemptions (slots authorizing service to destinations exceeding 1,250 miles from Washington National). SkyWest's route schedule should be analyzed to identify any DCA flights to destinations beyond the perimeter such as Phoenix (2,083 miles), Las Vegas (2,183 miles), or Los Angeles (2,265 miles); if any such routes exist, the slots used for those routes likely constitute beyond-perimeter exemptions under 49 U.S.C. § 41718 and are **non-transferable** to GAH.¹⁸⁵ If beyond-perimeter slots are identified, GAH should either (1) negotiate purchase price adjustment reducing deal value by appraised value of non-transferable slots ($5M-$10M per beyond-perimeter slot pair), or (2) establish escrow holdback equal to value of non-transferable slots, releasable to seller only if seller obtains FAA approval for exemption transfer (uncertain outcome given statutory prohibition).

Following FAA certificate transfer approval, GAH should file slot transfer applications with FAA Slot Administration within 30 days to maintain operational continuity. The transfer applications should include: (1) letter from SkyWest's authorized representative (CEO or General Counsel) consenting to transfer of all 56 slots to GAH, (2) letter from GAH's authorized representative (CEO or General Counsel) requesting confirmation of slot transfers, (3) evidence that GAH holds FAA operating authority (copy of certificate transfer approval order), (4) demonstration that SkyWest maintained 80% minimum usage on all slots during the two-month period preceding transfer application, and (5) certification that GAH commits to maintain 80% minimum usage on all slots going forward.¹⁸⁶

**Draft Language - Merger Agreement Slot Representation and Warranty**:

**Section 3.22 - Airport Slots**

(a) *Slot Inventory*. Schedule 3.22(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list of all airport slots held by the Target as of the date hereof, including (i) 32 slot pairs at LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and (ii) 24 slot pairs at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), in each case specifying the time-of-day for each slot, whether such slot is classified as air carrier or commuter slot, and whether such slot is subject to any restrictions or conditions.

(b) *Slot Title and Transferability*. Target holds good, valid, and transferable rights to all slots listed on Schedule 3.22(a), free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens. Target has maintained minimum usage requirements under 14 C.F.R. § 93.227 on all such slots during the 24-month period preceding the date hereof. None of the DCA slots listed on Schedule 3.22(a) constitute beyond-perimeter slot exemptions that are non-transferable pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 41718.

(c) *Slot Compliance*. Target has timely filed all slot usage reports required by 14 C.F.R. Part 93 during the 24-month period preceding the date hereof. Target has not received any written notice from the Federal Aviation Administration questioning Target's compliance with slot usage requirements or threatening forfeiture of any slots. To Target's Knowledge, the FAA has no current intention to modify or terminate slot restrictions at LaGuardia Airport or Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport during the five years following the Closing Date.

(d) *Slot Valuation*. For purposes of calculating the Purchase Price Adjustment under Section 2.4, the parties agree that the appraised fair market value of the airport slots as determined by [Simat Helliesen & Eichner / LeighFisher / ICF] shall constitute the "Slot Portfolio Value." If the appraised Slot Portfolio Value is less than $275,000,000, Buyer shall be entitled to dollar-for-dollar Purchase Price reduction for the shortfall. If any DCA slot is determined to be a non-transferable beyond-perimeter exemption, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by $5,000,000 for each such non-transferable slot pair.
