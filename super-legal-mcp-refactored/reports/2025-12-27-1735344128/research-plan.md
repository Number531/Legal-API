- Cross-reference with: T1 (slot dispute contract interpretation), T2 (JetBlue litigation risk), T3 (RLA single carrier, PWFA accommodation), T4 (actual control doctrine)

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| FAA certificate SWRA372A currently valid | User-provided (verified assumption) | If suspended, deal terminates |
| SkyWest on-time 87%, completion 98.2% | User-provided Q3 2025 data | If performance declined, CPA termination risk increases |
| GAH operating agreement has CPPIB special rights | Assumption requiring data room verification | If CPPIB has veto rights, DOT foreign ownership issue |
| ALPA negotiations at impasse | User-provided (NMB mediation, no progress) | If agreement reached pre-closing, removes strike risk |
| JetBlue slot lease expires 3/2026 | User-provided contract terms | If lease renewed, no replacement cost |
| Maintenance reserve shortfall $29M | User-calculated ($186M reserves vs. $215M estimated) | If actual overhaul costs differ, shortfall changes |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- GAH operating agreement (CPPIB special rights) — requires data room access
- SkyWest SEC filings (if public) — requires EDGAR search
- Actual ALPA/AFA/AMFA CBA terms — requires data room access
- Aircraft lease agreements (all 145) — requires data room access
- United/Delta/American CPA full text — requires data room access
- JetBlue slot lease agreement — requires data room access

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:**
1. **FAA/DOT approvals = deal-blocking** (90-120 days each, must run concurrently)
2. **United CPA consent = deal-blocking** (if United denies, deal terminates or major renegotiation)
3. **ALPA CBA = medium-term risk** (strike unlikely before closing, but post-acquisition integration risk if GAH owns other airlines)

**Potential Issues:**
- If GAH lacks aviation experience → FAA could delay certificate transfer (require enhanced management fitness showing)
- If CPPIB has Board seats >1 or veto rights → DOT actual control issue (may need operating agreement restructuring)
- If United refuses consent → Deal structure may need to change (earnout, GAH commits to capital investment, management continuity)

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If any specialist finds deal-blocking regulatory issue → Flag immediately for client Board discussion
- If United CPA consent appears unlikely → Evaluate alternative CPA structures or deal termination
- If ALPA strike risk increases to HIGH → Model revenue impact, consider strike insurance or wage increase acceptance
