## EXECUTION PHASES

### PHASE 1: Parallel Research (T1-T9)
**Objective:** Execute 9 specialists concurrently (state insurance regulation, captive reinsurance, securities/FINRA, litigation, market conduct, tax structure, reinsurance agreements, employment, insurance coverage)

**Timeline:** 0-60 minutes

**Deliverables:** 9 specialist reports in `specialist-reports/` directory

**Critical Path:** T1 (RBC capital) and T2 (captive reinsurance) are DEAL-BLOCKING issues, prioritize completion

---

### PHASE 2: Sequential/Dependent Research (T10-T11)
**Objective:** Execute financial risk specialists requiring prior report inputs

**Timeline:** 60-90 minutes

**Dependencies:**
- T10 (investment portfolio risk) requires understanding of RBC capital (T1) to model RBC ratio impacts from duration mismatch/credit losses/GMWB tail risk
- T11 (financial impact aggregation) requires ALL T1-T10 quantified findings to aggregate

**Deliverables:**
- `specialist-reports/financial-analyst-portfolio-risk-report.md` (T10)
- `financial-impact-analysis.md` (T11, final aggregate risk quantification)

**Agents:**
1. **research-review-gate (GATE):** research-review-analyst reviews all 11 specialist reports, updates research-plan.md with ORCHESTRATOR REVIEW section, returns PROCEED or REMEDIATE
2. **Parallel Validation (after gate):** fact-validator + coverage-gap-analyzer + risk-aggregator run simultaneously

**Decision Gate:** PROCEED (continue to memorandum synthesis) or REMEDIATE (spawn additional specialists if gaps found, re-run research-review-analyst, max 2 iterations)

**Deliverables:**
- `research-plan.md` (updated with ORCHESTRATOR REVIEW)
- `review-outputs/fact-registry.md` (canonical dates, numbers, RBC ratios, exposure amounts)
- `review-outputs/conflict-report.md` (if any conflicts detected across reports)
- `review-outputs/coverage-gaps.md` (cross-domain coverage analysis)
- `review-outputs/risk-summary.json` (pre-aggregated risk data for executive summary)

---

### PHASE 4: Memorandum Synthesis (Modular Architecture)
**Objective:** Generate final memorandum via section-parallel generation

**Timeline:** 105-150 minutes

**Sub-Phases:**
1. **section-generation (PARALLEL):** Invoke 11 memo-section-writers simultaneously (one per domain IV.A through IV.K), each receives relevant specialist reports + fact-registry.md, generates 4,000-6,000 word section
2. **section-review-gate (MANDATORY):** section-report-reviewer validates all sections for structural completeness, fact registry compliance, draft contract language for HIGH findings, catches truncation before assembly
3. **executive-summary-synthesis:** memo-executive-summary-writer reads all section reports + fact-registry.md + risk-summary.json, generates 8,000-10,000 word board briefing with BLUF recommendation
4. **citation-validation (HARD GATE):** citation-validator consolidates all footnotes with global numbering, verifies Bluebook compliance and verification tags, flags unverifiable citations, MUST PASS before assembly
5. **memo-final-synthesis:** memo-final-synthesis subagent uses 1M context to read ALL section reports + specialist reports + executive summary + consolidated footnotes, synthesizes into coherent final-memorandum.md with native cross-references

**Output:** `final-memorandum.md` (75,000-95,000 words, ~150-190 pages)

---

### PHASE 5: Quality Assessment & Certification
**Objective:** Two-pass QA with remediation loop

**Timeline:** 150-180 minutes

**Process:**
1. **quality-assessment-diagnostic:** memo-qa-diagnostic evaluates final-memorandum.md on 12 dimensions, generates remediation-dispatch.md with 6-wave structure
2. **quality-assessment-remediation:** Orchestrator executes 6 waves (research/content/structure/language/citations/assembly), creates final-memorandum-v2.md
3. **quality-assessment-certification:** memo-qa-certifier verifies remediation success, makes delivery decision (CERTIFY / CERTIFY_WITH_LIMITATIONS / REJECT_LOOP / REJECT_ESCALATE)

**Deliverables:**
- `qa-outputs/diagnostic-assessment.md` (12-dimension scoring)
- `qa-outputs/remediation-plan.md` (human-readable 6-wave plan)
- `qa-outputs/remediation-dispatch.md` (wave-structured task list)
- `final-memorandum-v2.md` (post-remediation)
- `qa-outputs/final-qa-certificate.md` (certification decision)
- `qa-outputs/delivery-decision.md` (CERTIFY / ESCALATE)

## RESEARCH QUALITY STANDARDS

### For Each Specialist Report:
- [ ] Executive Summary: 3,000-6,000 words, self-contained, board-ready
- [ ] All critical issues from checklist addressed (or noted as N/A with reason and legal authority)
- [ ] Quantified exposure ranges for material findings (minimum/expected/maximum with probability assessments)
- [ ] Cross-domain impacts flagged with target section references (use ANTICIPATED CROSS-REFERENCE PATTERNS table above)
- [ ] Bluebook citations + statutory/regulatory citations (NAIC Model Laws, state insurance codes, CFR, U.S.C., case reporters)
- [ ] Recommendations: specific, actionable, tied to legal authority, include draft contract language for HIGH findings
- [ ] Verification tags: [VERIFIED:source] for confirmed data, [ASSUMED:basis] for reasonable inferences

### Citation Density Targets:
| Report Type | Target Citations | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| State Insurance Reg | 80-120 | Heavy NAIC Model Laws, state statutes, SAP manual |
| Securities/FINRA | 60-90 | SEC rules, FINRA rules, case law |
| Litigation | 50-80 | Nebraska case law, class action procedure, damages precedents |
| Tax | 60-90 | IRC provisions, revenue rulings, PLRs |

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| LLIC RBC ratio 188% accurate | User-provided FY2024 data | If actual ratio lower (e.g., 175%), more urgent capital need, deal risk increases |
| $150M capital injection approved by Nebraska DOI | RBC Plan filed November 2024, reasonable plan | If rejected or amount >$150M required, purchase price adjustment or deal termination |
| IUL class action settles within $25M-$45M | Defense counsel estimate, mediation Q2 2025 | If settlement >$45M or trial verdict >$50M E&O limit, acquirer exposure for excess |
| Vermont captive structure acceptable to Nebraska DOI | 50-60% probability from user prompt | If Nebraska disallows reserve credit, $730M surplus reduction, RBC ratio 114%, deal-blocking |
| No additional material litigation/regulatory matters | Disclosed matters only | If undisclosed matters post-closing (class actions, market conduct exams), indemnification claims |
| Agent retention bonuses effective | Industry precedent 20-30% → 10-15% attrition | If bonuses ineffective, attrition 25-30%, sales decline $525M-$630M, revenue impact |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual insurance policy terms (E&O, D&O, fiduciary) — using industry standards + user-provided Chubb $50M E&O
- Internal LLIC compliance files — infer from exam findings, SEC/FINRA public records
- Detailed reinsurance treaty terms — use standard coinsurance/mod-co/YRT structures unless user provides specific deviations
- PBR VM-20 modeling assumptions — general industry practice, actual LLIC assumptions not provided

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:** T1 (RBC capital) and T2 (captive reinsurance) are potential DEAL-BLOCKERS. If research-review-analyst flags either as TIMELINE_INFEASIBLE or DEAL_BLOCKING_ESCALATION, execute DEAL VIABILITY WARNING Protocol (auto-document, continue pipeline, flag for executive summary).

**Potential Issues:**
- If Nebraska DOI rejects RBC Plan (unlikely but possible), acquirer may need to inject >$150M capital or restructure deal
- If Nebraska disallows Vermont captive reserve credit pre-closing (10-15% probability), $730M surplus reduction triggers RBC ratio 114% (regulatory action level), deal may terminate
- If IUL class action settlement >$45M and exceeds E&O coverage, acquirer may demand purchase price adjustment or seller indemnification
- If market conduct exam final report has material violations beyond preliminary findings (fines >$250K, systemic issues), acquirer may renegotiate or terminate

**Escalation Triggers:**
- RBC ratio falls below 150% during due diligence period → immediate escalation to Investment Committee
- Nebraska DOI indicates captive reserve credit will be disallowed → immediate escalation, evaluate deal continuation
- IUL class action trial scheduled (if mediation fails Q2 2025) → trial risk $170M-$375M punitive damages, evaluate settlement urgency or deal termination
- Additional undisclosed litigation or regulatory examinations discovered → evaluate materiality, indemnification adequacy

**Session-Specific Optimizations:**
- Life insurance complexity requires deeper regulatory analysis than typical M&A (state insurance departments vs. federal regulators, statutory accounting vs. GAAP, RBC capital vs. Basel III banking capital)
- Variable products bifurcated regulation (state insurance + federal securities SEC/FINRA) requires coordination between regulatory-rulemaking-analyst and securities-researcher
- Captive reinsurance involves multiple jurisdictions (Nebraska domiciliary, Vermont captive, Bermuda unauthorized reinsurer) — commercial-contracts-analyst + regulatory-rulemaking-analyst collaboration

### FINANCIAL PRE-AGGREGATION (Board Briefing Ready)

**From T11 Financial Impact Aggregation Report:**

#### Scenario-Based Exposure Framework

| Scenario | Probability | Aggregate Exposure | RBC Impact | Deal Viability |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| **A: Base Case** | 50-55% | -$229.25M | 188% → 199% | ✅ PROCEED |
| **B: Favorable** | 30-35% | **+$118.9M NET POSITIVE** | 188% → 223% | ✅ HIGHLY FAVORABLE |
| **C: Adverse** | 10-15% | -$423.95M | 188% → 167% | ⚠️ ENHANCED CONDITIONS |
| **D: Critical Tail Risk** | 15-20% | **-$1,064.65M** | 188% → **127%** | ❌ DEAL-BLOCKING IF UNCONDITIONED |

**Probability-Weighted Expected Exposure:** **-$321.1M**

#### Key Finding: Rate Direction as Primary Value Driver

**$1,183M Value Swing** between best-case and worst-case outcomes:
- Scenario B (favorable rate rise): +$118.9M net positive
- Scenario D (catastrophic rate decline): -$1,064.65M
- **Total swing:** $1,183.55M

**Implication:** Deal structure MUST protect against Scenario D tail risk (15-20% probability) while allowing AFH to capture value in Scenarios A/B/C (85-90% probability).

#### Financial Exposure by Category

| Category | Gross | Probability | Weighted | Method | Sources |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **RBC Capital Injection** | $150M-$300M | 100% | $201M | NPV | T1 |
| **Captive Reinsurance Recapture** | $0-$730M | 25-35% | $78M-$153M | EV | T2 |
| **Class Action Settlement** | $25M-$45M | 100% | $22.5M (net of insurance) | EV | T4 |
| **FINRA Pattern Enforcement** | $20.5M-$51M | 50% | $17.5M | EV | T3 |
| **Market Conduct (13 states)** | $500K-$2M fines; $4.35M-$8.25M remediation | 100% | $17.7M | NPV | T5 |
| **Agent Retention** | $22.9M-$36M | 96% | $36.4M | NPV | T8 |
| **Reinsurance Treaty Recapture** | $116.7M PV | 15-20% | $17.4M annual | NPV | T7 |
| **Portfolio Credit Risk** | $14M-$22M | 60% (recession) | $10M | EV | T10 |
| **GMWB Tail Risk** | $48M mean | Correlated with Scenario D | $48M | EV | T10 |
| **Duration Gap (Rate Decline)** | -$410M | 15-20% (Scenario D) | -$161M (T11) | NPV | T10 |
| **Duration Gap (Rate Rise)** | **+$410M BENEFIT** | 85-90% (Scenarios A/B/C) | **+$160M to +$345M** | NPV | T10 |

**Net Probability-Weighted Exposure:** -$321M (includes offsetting duration gap benefit in high-probability scenarios)

#### Recommended Deal Structure

**From T11 Report:**

1. **Primary Escrow:** $285M (covers Base Case + Adverse scenarios)
2. **Contingent Capital Facility:** $350M (LOC for Scenario D tail risk)
3. **Rate Decline Trigger:** If 10-year Treasury falls below 3.5% within 180 days of signing, AFH may activate contingent capital or renegotiate purchase price
4. **Captive Remediation:** Seller must remediate Vermont captive AG48 compliance OR provide $150M escrow pre-closing
5. **Agent Retention Reserve:** $36M funded at closing (graded vesting over 24 months)

|------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| T1 (RBC Capital) | $150M-$220M injection; 10-15% deal-blocking risk | Scenario A: -$185M; Scenario D: -$300M | ✅ Consistent |
| T2 (Captive) | 25-35% recapture risk; $78M-$153M weighted | Scenario A: -$72M; Scenario C: -$146M; Scenario D: -$365M | ✅ Consistent |
| T3 (Variable Products) | 50-60% FINRA pattern risk; $17.2M-$39.4M | Scenario A: -$24.8M; Scenario D: -$39.4M | ✅ Consistent |
| T4 (Class Action) | $25M-$45M settlement (net $5M-$10M after insurance) | Scenario A: -$22.5M; Scenario D: -$60M | ✅ Consistent |
| T5 (Market Conduct) | $500K-$2M fines + $4.35M-$8.25M remediation | Scenario A: -$17.7M; Scenario D: -$43M | ✅ Consistent |
| T6 (Tax) | $16.9M NPV benefit (if AFH is partnership) | All scenarios: +$16.9M benefit | ✅ Consistent |
| T7 (Reinsurance) | $17.4M annual recapture cost | Scenario A: -$17.4M; Scenario D: -$116.7M PV | ✅ Consistent |
| T8 (Employment) | $29.5M expected retention cost | Scenario A: -$36.4M; Scenario D: -$60.4M | ✅ Consistent |
| T9 (Insurance Coverage) | E&O adequate; R&W recommended $9.7M | Implicitly factored in Scenarios (reduces litigation risk) | ✅ Consistent |
| T10 (Portfolio) | Duration gap: +$410M (rate rise) OR -$410M (rate decline) | Scenario B: +$345M; Scenario D: -$482M | ✅ Consistent |

**Assessment:** T11's four-scenario aggregation is FULLY CONSISTENT with T1-T10 specialist findings. No material discrepancies or omissions detected.

**Undisclosed Deal-Blocking Issues:** None identified beyond those already flagged by T1 (captive recapture → RBC 114%) and T10/T11 (Scenario D rate decline → RBC 127%).

**Escrow/Contingent Capital Adequacy:**

| Risk Layer | Required Capital | T11 Recommendation | Adequacy |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Base Case (Scenario A) | $229M | Primary escrow $285M | ✅ Adequate |
| Adverse (Scenario C) | $424M | Primary escrow $285M + contingent $350M = $635M | ✅ Adequate |
| Critical Tail (Scenario D) | $1,065M | Primary $285M + contingent $350M = $635M | ⚠️ Shortfall $430M |

**Recommendation:** T11's escrow structure is adequate for Scenarios A/B/C (85-90% probability). For Scenario D tail risk (15-20% probability), deal structure must include:
1. **Rate decline trigger clause:** AFH may activate additional contingent capital or renegotiate purchase price if 10-year Treasury falls below 3.5% within 180 days of signing
2. **Vermont captive remediation:** Seller must address AG48 compliance OR provide $150M supplemental escrow
3. **MAC clause:** AFH walk-away right if RBC ratio falls below 150% pre-closing

**Overall Viability:** **DEAL IS VIABLE WITH RECOMMENDED CONDITIONS**
