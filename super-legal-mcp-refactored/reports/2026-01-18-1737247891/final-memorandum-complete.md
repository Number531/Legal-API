## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Project Chronos - American Financial Holdings Acquisition of Liberty Life Insurance Company
**Prepared for**: American Financial Holdings Board of Directors and Investment Committee
**Date**: January 18, 2026
**Purchase Price**: $2.9 billion (stock purchase)

---

### I.A. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Overall Risk Assessment**: HIGH

#### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

AFH should **PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS** on the $2.9 billion acquisition of LLIC. The probability-weighted expected exposure of $321.1M (11.1% of purchase price) is manageable through the three-tier protection structure (price adjustment, escrow, contingent capital), yielding 85% probability of positive returns with expected ROI of 10%. Immediate action required: execute $385M escrow agreement and $350M LOC facility commitment within 30 days of signing to protect against the 17.5% Scenario D tail risk.

#### Rationale

The transaction presents favorable risk-adjusted returns in 85% of probability scenarios, driven by three primary factors:

1. **Interest Rate Direction (Primary Value Driver)**: LLIC's -0.7-year duration gap creates $1,183M value swing based on rate direction. Rate stability or rise scenarios (85% combined probability) generate +$160M to +$345M portfolio gains, while rate decline (15-20% probability) triggers -$482M loss requiring contingent capital protection.

2. **Regulatory Capital Position**: RBC ratio of 188% (below 200% Company Action Level) requires $150M-$220M capital injection as a closing condition, with probability-weighted requirement of $201M. This is factored into deal economics and provides stable post-closing capital position above regulatory thresholds.

3. **Captive Reinsurance Structure**: Vermont captive's $850M reserve credit (supported by $730M parental guarantee) creates 25-35% recapture probability. Full disallowance would reduce RBC to 114%, creating a deal-blocking scenario. Pre-closing Nebraska DOI written confirmation of reserve credit maintenance is a critical closing condition.

#### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **Nebraska DOI RBC Plan Approval** - See **Section IV.A** for regulatory approval analysis
2. **Rate Decline Contingent Escrow ($100M)** - See **Section IV.J** for portfolio duration risk
3. **LOC Facility Commitment ($350M)** - See **Section IV.K** for contingent capital structure
4. **Thompson Class Action Settlement ($45M cap)** - See **Section IV.D** for litigation exposure
5. **Captive Reserve Credit Confirmation** - See **Section IV.B** for reinsurance risk analysis

### I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question (Abbreviated) | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Is RBC ratio 188% sufficient for Nebraska DOI Form A approval? | **Probably Yes** | RBC Plan filed November 2024 proposing $150M-$220M capital injection; DOI approval expected Q1 2025 with conditions | IV.A |
| 2 | Does Vermont captive structure comply with AG48 requirements? | **Uncertain** | Parental guarantee ($730M) may be inadequate under AG48 primary security requirements; 10-15% disallowance probability | IV.B |
| 3 | Will traditional reinsurers (Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA) consent to change of control? | **Probably Yes** | 85-92% historical consent rate for PE acquisitions; Swiss Re absolute discretion clause creates negotiation leverage | IV.B |
| 4 | Can Thompson class action settle within E&O coverage limits ($50M)? | **Yes** | Settlement range $25M-$45M falls within $50M E&O limits; $5M SIR is only net exposure to AFH | IV.D |
| 5 | Do market conduct exam findings create material liability? | **Probably Yes** | Probability-weighted exposure $17.7M across illustration violations, agent training deficiencies, and claims handling | IV.E |
| 6 | Is surplus notes structure ($200M) tax-efficient under IRC Section 163? | **Yes** | Interest deductibility creates $16.9M NPV benefit over 10 years; requires AFH to be LLC/partnership | IV.F |
| 7 | Does investment portfolio duration gap create unacceptable tail risk? | **Probably No** | 85% probability of rate stability/rise generating gains; 15-20% tail risk addressed through contingent capital | IV.J |
| 8 | Is total deal structure adequate to protect against Scenario D? | **Probably Yes** | $1,010M protection waterfall covers 95.1% of $1,064.65M Scenario D exposure; $54.65M residual risk acceptable | IV.K |
