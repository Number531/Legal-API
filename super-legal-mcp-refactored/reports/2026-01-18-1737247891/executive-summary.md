# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Project Chronos - American Financial Holdings Acquisition of Liberty Life Insurance Company
**Prepared for**: American Financial Holdings Board of Directors and Investment Committee
**Date**: January 18, 2026
**Purchase Price**: $2.9 billion (stock purchase)

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Overall Risk Assessment**: HIGH

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

AFH should **PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS** on the $2.9 billion acquisition of LLIC. The probability-weighted expected exposure of $321.1M (11.1% of purchase price) is manageable through the three-tier protection structure (price adjustment, escrow, contingent capital), yielding 85% probability of positive returns with expected ROI of 10%. Immediate action required: execute $385M escrow agreement and $350M LOC facility commitment within 30 days of signing to protect against the 17.5% Scenario D tail risk.

### Rationale

The transaction presents favorable risk-adjusted returns in 85% of probability scenarios, driven by three primary factors:

1. **Interest Rate Direction (Primary Value Driver)**: LLIC's -0.7-year duration gap creates $1,183M value swing based on rate direction. Rate stability or rise scenarios (85% combined probability) generate +$160M to +$345M portfolio gains, while rate decline (15-20% probability) triggers -$482M loss requiring contingent capital protection.

2. **Regulatory Capital Position**: RBC ratio of 188% (below 200% Company Action Level) requires $150M-$220M capital injection as a closing condition, with probability-weighted requirement of $201M. This is factored into deal economics and provides stable post-closing capital position above regulatory thresholds.

3. **Captive Reinsurance Structure**: Vermont captive's $850M reserve credit (supported by $730M parental guarantee) creates 25-35% recapture probability. Full disallowance would reduce RBC to 114%, creating a deal-blocking scenario. Pre-closing Nebraska DOI written confirmation of reserve credit maintenance is a critical closing condition.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **Nebraska DOI RBC Plan Approval** - See **Section IV.A** for regulatory approval analysis
2. **Rate Decline Contingent Escrow ($100M)** - See **Section IV.J** for portfolio duration risk
3. **LOC Facility Commitment ($350M)** - See **Section IV.K** for contingent capital structure
4. **Thompson Class Action Settlement ($45M cap)** - See **Section IV.D** for litigation exposure
5. **Captive Reserve Credit Confirmation** - See **Section IV.B** for reinsurance risk analysis

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question (Abbreviated) | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Is RBC ratio 188% sufficient for Nebraska DOI Form A approval? | **Probably Yes** | RBC Plan filed November 2024 proposing $150M-$220M capital injection; DOI approval expected Q1 2025 with conditions | IV.A |
| 2 | Does Vermont captive structure comply with AG48 requirements? | **Uncertain** | Parental guarantee ($730M) may be inadequate under AG48 primary security requirements; 10-15% disallowance probability | IV.B |
| 3 | Will traditional reinsurers (Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA) consent to change of control? | **Probably Yes** | 85-92% historical consent rate for PE acquisitions; Swiss Re absolute discretion clause creates negotiation leverage | IV.B |
| 4 | Can Thompson class action settle within E&O coverage limits ($50M)? | **Yes** | Settlement range $25M-$45M falls within $50M E&O limits; $5M SIR is only net exposure to AFH | IV.D |
| 5 | Do market conduct exam findings create material liability? | **Probably Yes** | Probability-weighted exposure $17.7M across illustration violations, agent training deficiencies, and claims handling | IV.E |
| 6 | Is surplus notes structure ($200M) tax-efficient under IRC Section 163? | **Yes** | Interest deductibility creates $16.9M NPV benefit over 10 years; requires AFH to be LLC/partnership | IV.F |
| 7 | Does investment portfolio duration gap create unacceptable tail risk? | **Probably No** | 85% probability of rate stability/rise generating gains; 15-20% tail risk addressed through contingent capital | IV.J |
| 8 | Is total deal structure adequate to protect against Scenario D? | **Probably Yes** | $1,010M protection waterfall covers 95.1% of $1,064.65M Scenario D exposure; $54.65M residual risk acceptable | IV.K |

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Interest Rate Direction Cascade

The -0.7-year duration gap creates interconnected risks across multiple domains:

**Primary Finding**: Portfolio assets reprice faster than liabilities in rate movements, creating $410M surplus gain in rate rise but $410M surplus loss in rate decline. (See **Section IV.J**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **RBC Capital (Section IV.A)**: Rate decline scenario reduces RBC from 188% to 127%, breaching 150% RAL threshold
- **GMWB Tail Risk (Section IV.C)**: Combined rate decline + equity crash creates $477M total exposure (isolated GMWB $67M + portfolio $410M)
- **Captive Reinsurance (Section IV.B)**: Economic stress triggers recapture provisions, compounding RBC deterioration
- **Deal Structure (Section IV.K)**: Scenario D requires $350M contingent capital facility activation

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: -$482M to +$345M ($827M swing range)

### B. Regulatory Scrutiny Cascade

Regulatory findings in one domain trigger examinations in others:

**Primary Finding**: Nebraska DOI market conduct examination findings corroborate Thompson class action allegations. (See **Section IV.E**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Class Action Litigation (Section IV.D)**: Market conduct findings admissible under FRE 803(8)(A)(iii); increases settlement pressure from $25M-$45M to $35M-$50M
- **FINRA Compliance (Section IV.C)**: Agent training deficiencies on variable products create 40% probability of FINRA cause examination
- **Form A Approval (Section IV.A)**: Unsettled examination creates 30% probability of 60-120 day closing delay

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $72.5M (correlated regulatory exposures)

### C. Reinsurance Structure Dependencies

Vermont captive and traditional reinsurance consent decisions affect capital position:

**Primary Finding**: Cumulative recapture of captive ($850M) and traditional reinsurance ($550M) would reduce RBC to 169%. (See **Section IV.B and IV.G**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **RBC Capital (Section IV.A)**: Combined recapture requires $420M additional capital injection beyond base $220M
- **Investment Management (Section IV.J)**: RGA mod-co covenant restricts below-IG allocation to maintain consent
- **Tax Structure (Section IV.F)**: Capital injection structure (surplus notes vs. common stock) affects tax efficiency

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $867M-$927M gross; $82M-$165M probability-weighted

### D. Litigation-Regulatory Feedback Loop

Thompson settlement timing affects multiple regulatory outcomes:

**Primary Finding**: Q2 2025 settlement before closing removes RGA consent uncertainty and reduces reputational harm to agent force. (See **Section IV.D**)

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Reinsurance Consent (Section IV.G)**: Pre-closing settlement within $45M increases RGA consent probability from 65% to 75-80%
- **Agent Retention (Section IV.H)**: Unresolved litigation compounds M&A attrition from 20-30% to 35-55%
- **Form A Approval (Section IV.A)**: Settlement execution is recommended closing condition

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $5M-$10M net litigation + $36.4M-$60.4M agent retention = $41.4M-$70.4M

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section Reference |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Purchase Price Reduction | $300M | $275M | $225M minimum | Section IV.K |
| Total Escrow | $450M (15.5%) | $385M (13.3%) | $325M minimum | Section IV.K |
| Thompson Indemnity Cap | $60M | $45M | Unlimited for fraud | Section IV.D |
| Market Conduct Escrow | $30M | $20M | $15M minimum | Section IV.E |
| RBC Covenant | 200% maintenance | 180% maintenance | 165% absolute floor | Section IV.A |
| LOC Facility | $400M | $350M | $300M minimum | Section IV.K |
| Survival Period | 48 months | 36 months | 24 months minimum | Section IV.K |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **RBC Deficiency**: LLIC's 188% RBC ratio creates seller urgency; transaction provides capital injection seller cannot otherwise obtain
2. **Thompson Settlement Timing**: LLIC's reputational interest in resolving litigation before acquisition announcement provides leverage
3. **Regulatory Approval Dependency**: Nebraska DOI Form A conditions provide price adjustment mechanism

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| # | Expected Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence Basis |
|---|--------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | "Price reduction excessive; $150M maximum" | HIGH | $321M probability-weighted exposure justifies $275M adjustment (85.6% coverage) | Section IV.K aggregation |
| 2 | "Market escrow 10%, not 13.3%" | HIGH | Multi-state complexity (13 states) and Scenario D tail risk justify above-market escrow | Jackson National precedent (0.4% for single-state) |
| 3 | "Litigation buyback insurance unnecessary" | MEDIUM | Eliminates E&O coverage disputes; protects against $255M-$500M trial verdict | Section IV.D tail risk |
| 4 | "18-month survival sufficient" | MEDIUM | FINRA examination cycle 2-4 years; 36-month survival covers regulatory window | Section IV.E FINRA trigger |

## VI. TIMELINE & CRITICAL PATH

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Risk Level | Section Reference |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Nebraska DOI RBC Plan Approval | Q1 2025 | RBC Plan filed November 2024 | MEDIUM | Section IV.A |
| Thompson Class Action Mediation | Q2 2025 | Settlement within $45M | MEDIUM | Section IV.D |
| Form A Filing | 30 days post-RBC approval | Biographical affidavits, financial projections | MEDIUM | Section IV.A |
| Reinsurer Consent Requests | Q2 2025 | Form A filing; Thompson settlement progress | MEDIUM | Section IV.G |
| Form A Approval | Q2 2025 | Multi-state coordination | HIGH | Section IV.A |
| R&W Insurance Binding | 3-4 weeks pre-close | Litigation buyback endorsement | LOW | Section IV.I |
| **Target Closing** | **Q3 2025** | **All conditions precedent** | **MEDIUM** | — |
| Thompson Final Court Approval | Q1 2026 | 5-8 months post-settlement | LOW | Section IV.D |
| Escrow First Release (50%) | Settlement + 60 days | Court approval; <15% opt-out | LOW | Section IV.D |

### Critical Path Risks

- **Nebraska DOI RBC Plan Rejection**: If DOI requires capital >$300M, triggers price adjustment negotiation (15-20% probability)
- **Market Conduct Settlement Delay**: Unsettled examination creates 60-120 day closing delay risk (30% probability)
- **Rate Decline Pre-Closing**: Treasury rate decline >100 bps before closing triggers MAC clause renegotiation (15-20% probability)

## VIII. DECISION REQUIRED

```
DECISION REQUIRED: Board approval to proceed with $2.9B acquisition of LLIC
                   with three-tier protection structure by February 15, 2026.

OPTIONS:

Option A: PROCEED WITH FULL CONDITIONS
- Risk: Seller rejects $275M price reduction (25-35% probability)
- Benefit: Maximum protection against $321M probability-weighted exposure
- Status: RECOMMENDED

Option B: PROCEED WITH REDUCED CONDITIONS
- Risk: Inadequate protection against Scenario D ($54.65M -> $204.65M residual)
- Benefit: Higher probability of seller acceptance
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (unacceptable tail risk)

Option C: DO NOT PROCEED
- Risk: Loss of strategic opportunity; $15M-$25M transaction costs forfeited
- Benefit: Eliminates all acquisition risks
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED (favorable risk-adjusted returns)

RECOMMENDED: Option A

Rationale: 85% probability of positive returns with expected ROI of 10% justifies
proceeding with full protective conditions; Scenario D tail risk adequately
addressed through $1,010M protection waterfall.
