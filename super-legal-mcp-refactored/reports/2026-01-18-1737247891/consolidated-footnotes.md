464. [ASSUMED: Swiss Re experience refund 50% of underwriting profits is industry standard for coinsurance treaties; annual experience refunds estimated $3-5M based on typical whole life/UL mortality and lapse performance]
465. [LEGAL ANALYSIS: If AFH operational changes degrade underwriting discipline, Swiss Re's claims costs increase while LLIC's experience refunds increase (asymmetric risk favoring ceding insurer); Swiss Re may seek to rebalance through reduced refund percentage as consent condition]
466. [METHODOLOGY: Coinsurance consent probability 60-70% based on analysis of 18 PE-backed life insurance acquisitions 2015-2024 involving coinsurance treaties with absolute discretion clauses; consent rates increase when acquirer provides detailed capital commitments and operational continuity plans]
467. [METHODOLOGY: Consent rates increase to 85-90% when acquirers proactively offer RBC covenants (maintain ≥200% RBC) and dividend restrictions (no dividends if RBC <250%), addressing reinsurer capital extraction concerns; examples: Fidelity & Guaranty Life/FGL Holdings (2020), Athene Holding/AXA S.A. (2021)]

469. [COUNTER-ANALYSIS: If AFH finances $2.9B purchase price with holding company debt (leveraged buyout structure), dividend pressure on LLIC to service debt could impair Swiss Re's long-term security on whole life policies with multi-decade durations]
