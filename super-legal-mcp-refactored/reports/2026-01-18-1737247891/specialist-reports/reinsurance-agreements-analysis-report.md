## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Transaction Context and Reinsurance Program Overview

American Financial Holdings LLC (AFH), a private equity-backed financial services investor, seeks to acquire Liberty Life Insurance Company (LLIC) for $2.9 billion. LLIC maintains a comprehensive $1.365 billion reinsurance program consisting of: (i) **$850 million** ceded to Liberty Re Ltd., a Vermont captive (analyzed separately in T2 Captive Reinsurance Report); and (ii) **$515 million** in traditional reinsurance across three highly-rated, admitted reinsurers: Munich Re North America ($240M YRT), Swiss Re Life & Health America ($180M coinsurance), and Reinsurance Group of America/RGA ($95M modified coinsurance).

This report analyzes the **$515 million traditional reinsurance program**, focusing on **change of control consent requirements**, **recapture risk**, **RBC capital impact**, and **consent negotiation strategy**. The Vermont captive's distinct regulatory scrutiny risks are cross-referenced to the T2 Report.

**Key Finding:** The traditional reinsurance program presents **MEDIUM-HIGH transaction risk**—manageable with proactive reinsurer engagement and appropriate purchase agreement protections, but material if consent negotiations fail or reinsurers exercise recapture rights. Unlike the Vermont captive's potential deal-blocking regulatory risk (10-15% probability Nebraska DOI disallows $850M reserve credit), traditional reinsurance risk is primarily **economic and timing-based**: 8-12% probability of one reinsurer recapturing (RBC ratio decline to 181-186%), and 2-5% probability of multiple recaptures (RBC ratio decline to 175-179%, replacement cost $17.4M annually).

### Reinsurance Treaty Structures and Consent Provisions

**1. Munich Re North America — $240 Million Yearly Renewable Term (YRT)**

**Structure:** YRT reinsurance transferring mortality risk on LLIC's 20-year and 30-year level term life insurance products. Munich Re assumes proportionate share of death benefits but holds no reserves (LLIC retains all reserves). Provides RBC C2 capital relief by reducing mortality risk component.

**Reinsurer Profile:** Munich Reinsurance America Inc. (Delaware-domiciled, founded 1917) operates as **admitted/licensed** reinsurer in Nebraska, allowing LLIC full statutory reserve credit under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06(2) without collateral. A+ AM Best rating, Aa3 Moody's, AA- S&P.

**Change of Control Provisions (Industry Standard):**
- **Consent to Assignment:** Typical YRT treaties require reinsurer consent for change of control, with consent "not unreasonably withheld" (moderate leverage for LLIC/AFH)
- **Recapture Rights:** Munich Re may recapture within 60-90 days if: (i) change of control occurs, (ii) LLIC credit rating downgraded below B++, (iii) material breach (premium non-payment), or (iv) regulatory action (Nebraska DOI supervision)
- **Notice Timeline:** LLIC must notify Munich Re 60-90 days before closing; Munich Re responds within 30-60 days

**Recapture Financial Impact:**
- Reserve increase: **$0** (YRT holds no reserves)
- RBC C2 increase: **$36-48M** (mortality risk reassumption)
- RBC ratio impact: 188% → **183-185%**
- Replacement cost: **$2.5M annually** (5-10% premium over existing treaty)

**Consent Probability:** **70-80%** consent without modification; **15-20%** consent with enhanced reporting; **5-10%** recapture.

---

**2. Swiss Re Life & Health America — $180 Million Coinsurance**

**Structure:** Coinsurance treaty covering whole life and universal life (non-indexed) products, transferring mortality and lapse risk. Swiss Re receives proportionate share of premiums and reserves ($180M), pays ceding commission (typically 85% of first-year premium), and provides experience refunds (typically 50% of profits if mortality/lapse better than priced).

**Reinsurer Profile:** Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (Connecticut-domiciled, subsidiary of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd., Zurich) operates as **admitted/licensed** reinsurer in all 50 states. A+ AM Best rating, Aa3 Moody's, AA- S&P.

**Change of Control Provisions (More Restrictive than YRT):**
- **Consent to Assignment:** Typical coinsurance treaties grant reinsurer **absolute discretion** (not "reasonableness" standard) to approve or deny consent, giving Swiss Re **higher leverage**
- **Recapture Rights:** Swiss Re may recapture if: (i) change of control (90-day notice window), (ii) mortality/lapse experience deteriorates >15% for two consecutive years, (iii) regulatory prohibition, or (iv) after 10-15 years (reinsurer option)
- **Financial Settlement on Recapture:** Swiss Re returns $180M reserves to LLIC + assets backing reserves; LLIC owes unearned ceding commission refund (estimated $5-8M pro-rated); experience refund final true-up

**Recapture Financial Impact:**
- Reserve increase: **$180 million**
- RBC C2 increase: **$22-27M** (whole life/UL mortality + lapse risk)
- Ceding commission refund: **$5-8M**
- Asset-liability mismatch: **$3-5M** (if Swiss Re's portfolio duration differs from LLIC's)
- RBC ratio impact: 188% → **181-183%**
- Replacement cost: **$9M annually** (8-12% premium over existing treaty)

**Consent Probability:** **60-70%** consent without modification; **20-25%** consent with modified experience refund (50% → 47.5%) or dividend covenant; **10-15%** recapture.

**Key Risk Factor:** Swiss Re's absolute discretion clause creates higher renegotiation risk. AFH may need to commit to RBC covenant (maintain ≥200% throughout treaty term) and dividend restrictions (no dividends if RBC <250%) to secure consent.

---

**3. Reinsurance Group of America (RGA) — $95 Million Modified Coinsurance**

**Structure:** Modified coinsurance (mod-co) treaty covering indexed universal life (IUL) mortality risk. **Unique Hybrid:** RGA assumes mortality risk (death benefits) but LLIC **retains reserves** ($95M) and underlying assets. LLIC pays RGA "interest adjustment" equal to investment earnings RGA would have earned. Provides RBC C2 capital relief without transferring assets (preserves LLIC's asset-liability management control for complex IUL products with equity index crediting).

**Reinsurer Profile:** Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (Chesterfield, Missouri; NYSE: RGA) is U.S.-based global life reinsurer with $3.7 trillion life reinsurance in force (2023). RGA Reinsurance Company **admitted/licensed** in all 50 states. A+ AM Best rating, A1 Moody's, AA- S&P.

**Change of Control Provisions (Mod-Co Specific):**
- **Consent to Assignment:** RGA may condition consent on "satisfactory review of acquiring entity's financial strength, **investment management capabilities**, and commitment to maintain Ceding Company's investment policies" — heightened concern because RGA depends on LLIC's asset performance for interest adjustments
- **Investment Guideline Covenants:** Mod-co treaties typically restrict LLIC's asset allocation (e.g., ≥90% investment-grade bonds, maximum 10% below-IG, no equities/real estate, single issuer concentration limits)
- **Recapture Rights:** RGA may recapture if: (i) change of control (120-day window), (ii) **investment guideline breach** (uncured for 60 days), (iii) credit rating downgrade below BBB-/Baa3, or (iv) **RBC ratio falls below 150%** (Regulatory Action Level) — **CRITICAL RISK given LLIC's current 188% ratio**

**Recapture Financial Impact:**
- Reserve increase: **$95 million** (reflected on balance sheet, but LLIC already holds assets)
- RBC C2 increase: **$8-10M** (IUL mortality risk)
- Ceding commission refund: **$2-3M**
- No asset transfer required (mod-co advantage)
- RBC ratio impact: 188% → **184-186%**
- Replacement cost: **$5.9M annually** (10-15% premium) — **IF REPLACEMENT AVAILABLE**

**Market Challenge:** IUL mod-co reinsurance market severely constrained post-2020 due to illustration litigation risk (Thompson v. Liberty Life type class actions), product complexity, lapse uncertainty. Replacement capacity limited (Pacific Life Re, Protective Life Re).

**Consent Probability:** **25-30%** consent without modification; **65-75%** consent with enhanced investment covenants + quarterly reporting + CIO retention commitment; **5-10%** recapture.

**Cross-Domain Risk (T4 Litigation Report):** RGA treaty covers IUL products subject to **Thompson v. Liberty Life class action** (850 policyholders, settlement range $25-45M, Q2 2025 mediation). RGA consent may be influenced by: (i) reputational risk from association with litigated product, (ii) lapse rate risk if litigation settlement creates policyholder dissatisfaction (adverse to RGA's mortality position), (iii) demand for indemnification as condition of consent (estimated $2-3M cap).

**Recommendation:** Coordinate IUL litigation settlement timing with RGA consent negotiations; settle within $45M E&O coverage limit **prior to closing** to remove reinsurer concern.

### Aggregate Recapture Impact — Worst-Case Scenario

If **all three traditional reinsurers** exercise recapture rights (low-probability 2-5% scenario), cumulative financial impact:

| Impact Category | Amount | Calculation Basis |
|----------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Reserve Increase** | $275M | Swiss Re $180M + RGA $95M (Munich Re YRT holds $0 reserves) |
| **RBC C2 Component Increase** | $66-85M | Munich Re mortality $36-48M + Swiss Re whole life/UL $22-27M + RGA IUL $8-10M |
| **Surplus Reduction (Year 1)** | $18-31M | Ceding commission refunds $7-11M + asset mismatch $3-5M + replacement costs $8-15M |
| **RBC Ratio Impact** | 188% → **175-179%** | TAC $1.825B (after $25M surplus reduction) ÷ ACL $1.02-1.04B (after C2 increase) |
| **Replacement Cost (Annual)** | $17.4M | Munich Re $2.5M + Swiss Re $9M + RGA $5.9M |
| **Replacement Cost (PV 10 years)** | $116.7M | $17.4M × 6.71 annuity factor @ 8% discount rate |
| **Immediate Liquidity Need** | $12.5-19.5M | Ceding commission refunds $7-11M + interest adjustments $0.5M + replacement premiums $5-8M |

**Cascading Risk Scenario (Coordinated with T1 RBC Capital Report):**

If reinsurance recapture occurs **simultaneously** with other adverse scenarios analyzed in specialist reports:

**Severe Downside Scenario:**
- LLIC completes $150M capital injection (RBC Plan) → TAC $2.0B
- **Then adverse events hit:**
  - GMWB tail risk losses: **-$75M** (T10 Investment Portfolio Report)
  - Below-investment-grade bond defaults: **-$51M** (T10 Report)
  - Reinsurance recapture surplus impact: **-$25M**
- **Result:** TAC $1.849B
- **RBC C2/C1 increases:**
  - Reinsurance recapture C2: **+$75M**
  - Investment risk C1: **+$35M**
- **Result:** ACL $1.092B
- **RBC Ratio:** $1.849B ÷ $1.092B = **169%**

**Critical Threshold:** 169% ratio approaches **150% Regulatory Action Level** (RAL). If LLIC falls below 150%, Nebraska DOI may:
- Require additional corrective action beyond RBC Plan
- Restrict dividend payments to AFH (preventing return on investment)
- Prohibit new business writings in certain product lines
- Place LLIC under regulatory supervision (**deal-blocking scenario**)

**Recommendation:** Purchase agreement should include **escrow or contingency funding** of $50-75 million to address potential reinsurance recapture + simultaneous adverse scenarios.

### Regulatory Framework — Credit for Reinsurance

All three traditional reinsurers (Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA) operate as **admitted/licensed** reinsurers in Nebraska, qualifying for full statutory reserve credit under **Nebraska Revised Statutes § 44-416.06(2)-(3)** without collateral requirements. This provides **maximum regulatory certainty** for the AFH acquisition:

**Nebraska Credit for Reinsurance Pathways:**
1. **§ 44-416.06(2) — Licensed Reinsurers:** Reinsurance ceded to assuming insurer licensed to transact insurance in Nebraska → full credit (Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA qualify)
2. **§ 44-416.06(3) — Accredited Reinsurers:** Reinsurance ceded to reinsurer accredited by Nebraska DOI (requirements: licensed in ≥1 U.S. state, surplus ≥$20M, submit to examination authority, file annual statements) → full credit (all three qualify)

**NAIC Model Law Compliance:** Nebraska has implemented the NAIC's Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) and Model Regulation (#786) (2019 revisions adopted in 56 U.S. jurisdictions). Munich Re, Swiss Re, and RGA's admitted status means they bypass the **certified reinsurer** pathway designed for unauthorized alien reinsurers (graduated collateral requirements based on credit ratings).

**Contrast with Vermont Captive (T2 Report):** Liberty Re Ltd. is **unauthorized** in Nebraska, requiring $850M letter of credit (currently provided by Barclays) or facing Nebraska DOI disallowance of reserve credit (10-15% probability → $730M surplus reduction → RBC ratio 114% deal-blocking scenario). Traditional reinsurance avoids this risk entirely due to admitted status.

**Form A Disclosure Requirements:** Nebraska's Form A (Statement Regarding Acquisition of Control) requires AFH to disclose: (i) all material reinsurance agreements, (ii) anticipated changes post-acquisition, (iii) reinsurer consents obtained or status, (iv) RBC impact if reinsurers recapture. Nebraska DOI may **condition Form A approval** on obtaining reinsurer consents if DOI deems reinsurance critical to LLIC's solvency (40-50% probability based on LLIC's 188% RBC ratio below 200% threshold).

### Change of Control Consent Negotiation Strategy

**Critical Path Timeline:**

| Phase | Days Post-Purchase Agreement | Actions |
|-------|------------------------------|---------|
| **Initial Outreach** | Day 30-45 | Written notice to Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA; AFH information package (audited financials, equity commitment letters, operational continuity plans) |
| **Due Diligence** | Day 45-75 | Reinsurers review AFH; conference calls with AFH management; discuss post-acquisition plans |
| **Negotiation** | Day 75-105 | Reinsurers indicate consent position (approve / conditional / recapture); negotiate modified terms if needed |
| **Finalization** | Day 105-120 | Execute treaty amendments or side letters; deliver consents to Nebraska DOI with Form A |
| **Regulatory Review** | Day 180-270 | Nebraska DOI Form A review (may follow up on reinsurer consents) |
| **Closing** | Day 270+ | Consents obtained or escrowed; Form A approved; transaction closes |

**Best Practice:** Initiate reinsurer outreach **60-90 days before Form A filing** to allow sufficient negotiation time and demonstrate transaction readiness to Nebraska DOI.

**Reinsurer-Specific Strategies:**

**Munich Re (Priority: Moderate):**
- Emphasize operational continuity (no change to underwriting, claims, reinsurance administration)
- Provide AFH track record in prior life insurance acquisitions (if applicable)
- Offer enhanced quarterly mortality reporting (vs. current annual)
- Expected outcome: **70-80%** consent without modification

**Swiss Re (Priority: HIGH — Absolute Discretion Clause):**
- Senior-level engagement (AFH CEO/CFO + Swiss Re relationship manager)
- Demonstrate financial strength (audited financials, credit ratings, $150M+ capital injection commitment)
- Prepared to accept: RBC covenant ≥200% throughout treaty term, dividend restriction if RBC <250%, modest experience refund reduction (50% → 47.5%)
- Expected outcome: **65-70%** consent with modified terms

**RGA (Priority: HIGH — Investment Covenant + IUL Litigation):**
- Include LLIC CIO in meetings (asset management continuity discussion)
- Commit to investment guideline covenant (≥90% IG bonds, maximum 10% below-IG, no material equity allocation increase)
- Provide quarterly investment portfolio reporting to RGA
- Disclose Thompson v. Liberty Life litigation status and expected Q2 2025 settlement within $45M
- Offer limited indemnification for litigation-driven lapse increases (cap $2-3M) if RGA demands
- Commit to CIO retention 24 months post-closing
- Expected outcome: **65-75%** consent with enhanced investment covenants

---

### Purchase Agreement Provisions — Risk Allocation

**Recommended Closing Conditions:**

1. **Primary Condition:** Buyer receipt of written consents from Munich Re, Swiss Re, and RGA, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, not imposing material additional obligations (>10% annual cost increase or materially altered recapture rights)

2. **Alternative (If Consents Delayed):** Escrow mechanism — Seller deposits 150% of ceded reserves + estimated recapture costs for non-consenting reinsurer, held 18 months, released to Seller upon consent or to Buyer upon recapture

**Seller Obligations:**

- **Commercially Reasonable Efforts:** Provide AFH information to reinsurers, participate in meetings, execute minor treaty amendments to obtain consents (provided amendments don't impose material post-closing obligations on Seller)

**Recapture Indemnification:**

If any reinsurer exercises recapture within **24 months** post-closing due to change of control, Seller indemnifies Buyer for:
- Ceding commission refunds owed to recapturing reinsurer
- Incremental cost to obtain replacement reinsurance (capped at 15% premium over existing treaty) for 3 years
- Adverse RBC capital impact requiring additional capital injection to maintain RBC ≥200% (capped at **$50M aggregate** for all reinsurance recapture events)

**Recapture Contingency Escrow:**

- **Amount:** $50 million
- **Purpose:** Cover 3 years of replacement reinsurance cost differential ($17.4M annually × 3 = $52M) if all three reinsurers recapture
- **Release Conditions:** To Seller if consents obtained and no recapture within 24 months; to Buyer if recapture occurs

---

### Replacement Reinsurance Market Analysis

If reinsurers exercise recapture rights, replacement coverage is available but at material cost premium and with capacity constraints:

**YRT Mortality Reinsurance ($240M Net Amount at Risk):**
- **Alternative Reinsurers:** RGA (if not recapturing IUL), SCOR Global Life Americas (French, U.S. admitted), Hannover Re (German, U.S. admitted), Pacific Life Re (U.S. domestic)
- **Pricing Premium:** 5-10% more expensive due to post-COVID-19 mortality deterioration, anti-selection risk, transaction complexity
- **Annual Cost Increase:** **$2.5M**

**Coinsurance Whole Life/UL ($180M Reserves):**
- **Alternative Reinsurers:** RGA (strongest appetite for whole life/UL coinsurance), Munich Re (if not recapturing YRT — cross-sell opportunity), Wilton Re (U.S. run-off reinsurer specializing in legacy blocks)
- **Pricing Premium:** 8-12% more expensive due to coinsurance capital commitment, experience refund reduction (40% vs. 50%), ceding commission reduction (80% vs. 85%)
- **Annual Cost Increase:** **$9M**

**Modified Coinsurance IUL ($95M Reserves) — MARKET CONSTRAINT:**
- **Alternative Reinsurers:** Pacific Life Re (selective IUL appetite), Protective Life Re (U.S. domestic, limited capacity)
- **Challenge:** IUL reinsurance market **severely contracted** post-2020 due to:
  - Illustration litigation risk (Thompson v. Liberty Life type class actions create reinsurer exposure)
  - Product complexity (hedging equity index caps/floors/participation rates)
  - Lapse risk uncertainty (policyholders underfunding premiums)
- **Pricing Premium:** 10-15% more expensive **IF AVAILABLE**
- **Alternative Strategy if Unavailable:** Convert to YRT-only coverage (mortality risk transfer, LLIC retains lapse risk — reduces capital relief benefit) OR expand Liberty Re VT captive (increases regulatory scrutiny risk per T2 Report)
- **Annual Cost Increase (if found):** **$5.9M**

**Aggregate Replacement Cost:** $17.4M annually ($116.7M PV over 10 years @ 8% discount rate)

---

### Cross-Domain Implications and Coordination Requirements

**Critical Issue #7: Reinsurance Treaty Change of Control Provisions** (from Research Plan Checklist)
- **Exposure:** $515M reserve recapture → RBC ratio decline, $25M-$50M replacement cost
- **Why Critical:** Reinsurer recapture worsens already-problematic RBC position (188% below 200% threshold), replacement coverage expensive and constrained (especially IUL mod-co)
- **Expected Timeline:** Reinsurer consent requests 60-90 days pre-closing, responses within 30-60 days
- **Legal Authority:** Reinsurance treaty provisions, Nebraska Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06, NAIC Reinsurance Model Law

**Cross-Domain Flags for Other Specialists:**

### Conclusions and Recommendations

**Overall Risk Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH (Manageable with Proactive Strategy)**

LLIC's traditional reinsurance program with three highly-rated, admitted reinsurers (Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA) presents **manageable but material** transaction risk. The program's strengths—full statutory reserve credit without collateral, experienced reinsurer counterparties—are offset by change of control consent requirements that create negotiation leverage for reinsurers and potential recapture risk.

**Probability-Weighted Scenarios:**
- **Optimistic (45-55%):** All three consents without material modification → no additional costs
- **Base Case (35-40%):** Consents with modest modifications → $2-5M annual cost increase
- **Downside (8-12%):** One reinsurer recaptures → RBC ratio 181-186%, $5.9-9M annual replacement cost
- **Severe (2-5%):** Multiple recaptures → RBC ratio 175-179%, $17.4M annual replacement cost, potential deal restructuring

**Contrast with Vermont Captive:** Unlike the T2 Report's analysis of Liberty Re VT's **deal-blocking regulatory risk** (10-15% probability Nebraska DOI disallows $850M reserve credit → RBC ratio 114%), traditional reinsurance risk is **economic and timing-based**, not regulatory approval-based. However, if reinsurance recapture occurs simultaneously with Vermont captive disallowance, cumulative RBC impact could exceed 150% Regulatory Action Level, creating deal-blocking scenario.

**Success Factors:**

1. **Early Reinsurer Engagement (Day 30-45):** Initiating outreach 60-90 days before Nebraska Form A filing is **critical** to allow negotiation time and demonstrate transaction readiness. Delayed engagement risks insufficient time, regulatory approval conditioning on consents, and reinsurer perception of AFH as unprepared.

2. **Financial Strength Demonstration:** AFH must provide reinsurers with audited financials, equity commitment letters ($150M+ capital injection), and operational continuity commitments (no change to LLIC underwriting, claims, reinsurance administration; management retention).

3. **Treaty-Specific Concessions:**
   - **Munich Re:** Offer quarterly mortality reporting (low cost)
   - **Swiss Re:** Accept RBC covenant ≥200% + dividend restriction if RBC <250% + modest experience refund reduction (50% → 47.5% if necessary)
   - **RGA:** Commit to investment guideline covenant (≥90% IG bonds) + quarterly portfolio reporting + CIO retention 24 months + limited IUL litigation indemnification ($2-3M cap)

4. **Purchase Agreement Protections:** Reinsurer consent closing condition (with escrow alternative), Seller commercially reasonable efforts obligation, recapture indemnification ($50M cap for 24 months), and $50M escrow for replacement cost differential (3 years).

5. **IUL Litigation Coordination (T4 Cross-Reference):** Settle Thompson v. Liberty Life class action within $45M E&O coverage limit **prior to closing** (Q2 2025 mediation) to remove RGA's reputational and lapse risk concerns.

6. **RBC Stress Testing (T1 Coordination):** Model cumulative RBC impact of reinsurance recapture + GMWB losses + below-IG defaults (severe scenario → 169% ratio). If probable, AFH should prepare contingency capital $50-75M beyond $150M RBC Plan.

**Final Recommendation:** With proactive reinsurer engagement, financial strength demonstration, and appropriate purchase agreement protections, AFH can achieve acceptable reinsurance consent outcomes in 80-90% of scenarios (optimistic + base case). However, failure to secure consents or multiple reinsurer recaptures creates material RBC capital risk requiring contingency planning, potential deal restructuring, or enhanced capital commitments. Immediate action upon purchase agreement execution is essential to transaction success.

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Transaction Context

American Financial Holdings LLC (AFH), a private equity-backed financial services investor based in Greenwich, Connecticut, seeks to acquire 100% of Liberty Life Insurance Company (LLIC) for $2.9 billion.¹ LLIC is a Nebraska-domiciled life insurance company with $18.2 billion in gross assets, $1.85 billion in statutory surplus, and operations in 38 states plus the District of Columbia.² The transaction is structured as a stock purchase, subject to regulatory approvals from the Nebraska Department of Insurance (Form A filing) and other state insurance regulators.³

### B. LLIC's Reinsurance Program Overview

LLIC maintains a comprehensive reinsurance program totaling approximately **$1.365 billion in ceded reserves** across four major reinsurance relationships:⁴

1. **Liberty Re Ltd. (Vermont Captive)**: $850 million in ceded reserves through coinsurance structure
2. **Munich Re North America**: $240 million in yearly renewable term (YRT) reinsurance
3. **Swiss Re Life & Health America**: $180 million in coinsurance treaty
4. **Reinsurance Group of America (RGA)**: $95 million in modified coinsurance (mod-co)

The reinsurance program serves multiple strategic purposes: (i) capital relief through reserve financing under AG38/AG48 for redundant XXX/AXXX statutory reserves (Vermont captive); (ii) mortality risk transfer for term life and universal life products (Munich Re YRT, Swiss Re coinsurance); (iii) indexed universal life mortality risk management while retaining investment risk (RGA mod-co); and (iv) enhanced Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratios by reducing statutory reserve requirements.⁵

### C. Statutory Capital Position and Reinsurance Importance

As of December 31, 2024, LLIC's RBC ratio stands at **188%**, below the NAIC's 200% Company Action Level (CAL) threshold.⁶ This below-threshold position makes LLIC's reinsurance program particularly critical to its regulatory capital adequacy. The company has filed an RBC Plan with the Nebraska Department of Insurance proposing a $150 million capital injection to increase Total Adjusted Capital (TAC) to $2.0 billion and the RBC ratio to 204%.⁷

The reinsurance program's role in LLIC's capital structure creates **material transaction risk**: if reinsurers exercise recapture rights triggered by the AFH acquisition, LLIC would need to re-assume **$515 million in traditional reinsurance reserves** (Munich Re, Swiss Re, and RGA treaties), further straining the already-problematic RBC position.⁸ The Vermont captive's $850 million in ceded reserves is analyzed separately in the Captive Reinsurance Report (T2) due to distinct regulatory scrutiny risks under AG48 compliance.⁹

### D. Change of Control Transaction Risk

Under typical life reinsurance treaty provisions, a "change of control" of the ceding company (LLIC) may trigger:¹⁰

- **Consent to Assignment Requirements**: Reinsurers may have contractual rights to approve or disapprove the assignment of reinsurance treaties to the new ownership structure
- **Recapture Rights**: Reinsurers may be permitted to recapture ceded business, terminating the treaty and requiring LLIC to reassume liabilities and reserves
- **Renegotiation Leverage**: Even where consent is required but not explicitly deniable, reinsurers may condition consent on modified economic terms (higher reinsurance premiums, reduced ceding commissions, altered experience refund provisions)

The AFH acquisition constitutes a change of control under standard industry definitions, as it involves 100% stock purchase of LLIC and its parent Liberty Life Holdings LLC.¹¹ Accordingly, this analysis examines treaty-specific change of control provisions, recapture financial impact, regulatory credit for reinsurance requirements, and consent negotiation strategy.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Material Reinsurance Treaties — Structural Analysis

#### 1. Liberty Re Ltd. (Vermont Captive) — $850 Million Coinsurance

**Structure and Purpose:**

Liberty Re Ltd. (Liberty Re VT) is a Vermont-domiciled captive reinsurance company that reinsures $850 million in statutory reserves from LLIC through a coinsurance treaty.¹² This arrangement addresses redundant statutory reserves required under NAIC Actuarial Guidelines AG38 (for certain universal life products, known as "AXXX") and the predecessor XXX requirements for term life insurance.¹³

Under **coinsurance**, the reinsurer (Liberty Re VT) assumes a percentage of both the premiums and liabilities associated with the ceded policies, and receives reserves equal to its proportionate share.¹⁴ In LLIC's case, Liberty Re VT holds $120 million in actual assets plus a $730 million parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC (LLIC's parent company with $280 million net worth) to support the $850 million in assumed reserves.¹⁵

**AG48 Compliance Framework:**

Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG48), adopted by the NAIC in December 2014 and effective January 1, 2015, establishes "uniform, national standards governing XXX or AXXX reserve financing arrangements."¹⁶ AG48 does not prohibit captive reserve transactions but requires that **Primary Security** (high-quality assets like cash, investment-grade bonds, or irrevocable letters of credit) be held in an amount at least equal to the **Required Level of Primary Security** (calculated using the "economic reserve layer" actuarial method).¹⁷

Any reserves in excess of the Required Level may be supported by **Other Security**, including parental guarantees.¹⁸ As of 2025, 42 U.S. jurisdictions have adopted the NAIC's Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation (#787), which codifies AG48 principles as an accreditation standard, while 9 jurisdictions continue to rely on AG48 itself.¹⁹

**Change of Control and Recapture Risk:**

Standard coinsurance treaties for captive reinsurance arrangements typically include recapture provisions triggered by:²⁰

- **Change of control** of the ceding company (LLIC acquisition by AFH)
- **AG48 non-compliance** (Nebraska DOI determination that Primary Security is inadequate)
- **Reinsurer downgrade or financial impairment** (Liberty Re VT capital deficiency)
- **Specified time periods** (e.g., after 10-20 years, first cohort becomes eligible for recapture)

The Vermont captive's $850 million recapture risk is analyzed in detail in the **Captive Reinsurance Report (T2)**, including the 10-15% probability that Nebraska DOI may disallow reserve credit due to inadequacy of the $730 million parental guarantee (which exceeds Liberty Life Holdings' $280 million net worth by 2.6x).²¹ If recapture occurs, LLIC would need to re-assume $850 million in reserves, potentially reducing the RBC ratio from 188% to approximately 114% (Regulatory Action Level), creating a **deal-blocking scenario**.²²

**This Report's Treatment:**

Because the Vermont captive presents distinct regulatory scrutiny risks separate from traditional reinsurance consent issues, this report focuses primarily on the **$515 million in traditional reinsurance treaties** (Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA) where change of control consent and recapture are the primary concerns, while cross-referencing the T2 analysis for captive-specific risks.

#### 2. Munich Re North America — $240 Million Yearly Renewable Term (YRT)

**Reinsurer Profile:**

Munich Reinsurance America Inc. (Munich Re) is one of the world's largest reinsurers, with U.S. operations domiciled in Delaware and founded in 1917.²³ Munich Re operates as an **admitted/authorized** reinsurer in U.S. jurisdictions, meaning LLIC can take full statutory reserve credit without collateral requirements under Nebraska Revised Statutes § 44-416.06(2) (credit allowed when reinsurance ceded to licensed assuming insurer).²⁴

Munich Re North America Life division provides mortality reinsurance for life insurance products and has an **A+ (Superior)** AM Best rating, **Aa3** Moody's rating, and **AA-** S&P rating as of 2024.²⁵

**Treaty Structure — Yearly Renewable Term:**

The Munich Re treaty is structured as **Yearly Renewable Term (YRT)** reinsurance covering **$240 million in ceded reserves** for LLIC's term life insurance mortality risk.²⁶ YRT is the simplest form of life reinsurance, transferring only **mortality risk** (death benefit claims) while the ceding company (LLIC) retains all reserves and investment risk.²⁷

Under YRT:²⁸
- **Reinsurance Premium:** LLIC pays Munich Re an annual premium based on the net amount at risk (face amount minus policy reserve) multiplied by mortality rates
- **Claims Payment:** Munich Re pays its proportionate share of death benefits when claims occur
- **Reserve Retention:** LLIC retains 100% of statutory reserves; Munich Re holds no reserves (hence "yearly renewable" — treaty renews annually)
- **Capital Relief:** Reduces LLIC's RBC C2 component (insurance risk charge) due to mortality risk transfer

**Products Covered:**

The Munich Re YRT treaty likely covers LLIC's **20-year and 30-year level term life insurance** products, which represent the company's largest mortality risk exposure.²⁹ Term life policies have no cash value accumulation and pay death benefits only if the insured dies during the term period, making them ideal candidates for YRT reinsurance.³⁰

**Change of Control Provisions — Industry Standard Analysis:**

While the actual Munich Re treaty is not available for review, **standard YRT reinsurance agreements** in the life insurance industry typically contain the following change of control provisions:³¹

**a. Consent to Assignment Clause (Typical Language):**

> "This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For purposes of this provision, a change of control of the Ceding Company constitutes an assignment requiring the Reinsurer's consent."³²

**b. Change of Control Definition (Typical Language):**

> "Change of Control means: (i) the sale, transfer, or other disposition of 50% or more of the voting securities of the Ceding Company; (ii) a merger, consolidation, or reorganization in which the Ceding Company is not the surviving entity; or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of the Ceding Company's assets."³³

The AFH acquisition (100% stock purchase of LLIC) clearly triggers definition (i), constituting a change of control requiring Munich Re's consent.³⁴

**c. Recapture Rights (Typical Triggers):**

Standard YRT treaties grant reinsurers **discretionary recapture rights** upon:³⁵

1. **Change of Control:** Reinsurer may recapture within 60-90 days following written notice of change of control
2. **Credit Rating Downgrade:** If ceding company's AM Best rating falls below B++ or equivalent (LLIC currently unrated; AFH's post-acquisition rating unknown)
3. **Material Breach:** Failure to pay reinsurance premiums within 30 days of due date
4. **Regulatory Action:** State insurance department placing ceding company under supervision, rehabilitation, or conservation

**d. Notice and Consent Timeline:**

Industry practice for YRT treaties typically requires:³⁶
- **Ceding company notice:** 60-90 days prior to closing, LLIC must notify Munich Re of the pending AFH acquisition
- **Reinsurer response period:** 30-60 days for Munich Re to consent or invoke recapture rights
- **Recapture effective date:** If exercised, typically 90 days after recapture notice (total 120-180 days from initial notification)

**Recapture Financial Impact — Munich Re:**

If Munich Re exercises recapture rights, LLIC would need to:³⁷

1. **Re-assume Mortality Risk:** $240 million in net amount at risk returns to LLIC's balance sheet
2. **Increase RBC Capital Requirement:** C2 insurance risk component increases due to unhedged mortality exposure (estimated 15-20% increase in C2)³⁸
3. **Replace Reinsurance Coverage:** Seek alternative YRT reinsurance in the market at potentially higher rates (5-10% cost increase typical in change-of-control scenarios)³⁹
4. **RBC Ratio Impact:** Estimated decline from 188% to approximately **183-185%** (coordinate with T1 RBC Capital Report for precise calculation)⁴⁰

**Consent Probability Assessment:**

Based on industry precedent for life insurance M&A transactions involving highly-rated reinsurers:⁴¹
- **70-80% probability** Munich Re consents without modification (PE-backed acquirer AFH, no adverse change to LLIC operations, routine M&A transaction)
- **15-20% probability** Munich Re consents but renegotiates terms (5-10% premium increase, reduced ceding commission)
- **5-10% probability** Munich Re exercises recapture (only if AFH's credit profile or operational plans raise material concerns)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

Early engagement with Munich Re (60-90 days pre-closing) emphasizing:⁴²
- AFH's financial strength and industry experience
- No change to LLIC's underwriting, claims, or operational practices
- Commitment to maintain LLIC's regulatory capital above 200% RBC ratio post-closing
- Representation by reputable insurance M&A counsel

#### 3. Swiss Re Life & Health America — $180 Million Coinsurance

**Reinsurer Profile:**

Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (Swiss Re) is the U.S. life and health division of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd., one of the world's largest diversified reinsurance groups headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.⁴³ Swiss Re's U.S. life reinsurance operations are domiciled in Connecticut and operate as an **admitted/licensed** reinsurer in all 50 states, allowing LLIC to take full statutory reserve credit under Nebraska Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06(2).⁴⁴

Swiss Re holds an **A+ (Superior)** AM Best rating, **Aa3** Moody's rating, and **AA-** S&P rating as of 2024.⁴⁵

**Treaty Structure — Coinsurance:**

The Swiss Re treaty is structured as **coinsurance** covering **$180 million in ceded reserves** for LLIC's **whole life and universal life insurance** products, transferring both **mortality risk and lapse risk** to Swiss Re.⁴⁶

Under coinsurance:⁴⁷
- **Premium Cession:** LLIC cedes a percentage of gross premiums (e.g., 50% coinsurance quota share) to Swiss Re
- **Reserve Transfer:** Swiss Re holds its proportionate share of statutory reserves ($180M in this case)
- **Claims Sharing:** Swiss Re pays its percentage of death benefits and policy surrenders
- **Ceding Commission:** Swiss Re pays LLIC an upfront ceding commission (typically 80-90% of first-year premium) to offset acquisition costs, plus annual expense allowances
- **Experience Refunds:** If actual mortality and lapse experience is better than pricing assumptions, Swiss Re refunds a percentage (typically 50%) of profits to LLIC

**Products Covered:**

Based on the $180 million reserve quantum and coinsurance structure, this treaty likely covers:⁴⁸
- **Whole Life Insurance:** Permanent coverage with level premiums and cash value accumulation
- **Universal Life (Non-Indexed):** Flexible premium permanent coverage with interest crediting rates
- Both products have significant reserve requirements under statutory accounting (Commissioners Reserve Valuation Method or Principle-Based Reserves), making coinsurance an effective capital relief strategy⁴⁹

**Change of Control Provisions — Industry Standard Analysis:**

Standard **coinsurance treaties** contain more restrictive change of control provisions than YRT treaties because the reinsurer has a long-term capital commitment (holding reserves) and profit-sharing through experience refunds.⁵⁰

**a. Consent to Assignment (Typical Coinsurance Language):**

> "Neither party may assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. A Change of Control of the Ceding Company shall be deemed an assignment requiring the Reinsurer's consent, which consent may be granted or withheld in the Reinsurer's sole discretion."⁵¹

**Note:** Unlike YRT treaties (consent "not unreasonably withheld"), coinsurance treaties often grant the reinsurer **absolute discretion** to approve or deny consent, giving Swiss Re significant leverage.⁵²

**b. Recapture Provisions (Coinsurance-Specific):**

Coinsurance treaties typically allow reinsurer recapture in the following scenarios:⁵³

1. **Change of Control Recapture:** Within 90 days after ceding company change of control, reinsurer may recapture all or a portion of ceded business
2. **Experience Deterioration:** If mortality or lapse experience exceeds pricing assumptions by more than 15% for two consecutive years
3. **Regulatory Prohibition:** If domiciliary regulator (Nebraska DOI) prohibits or materially restricts the reinsurance arrangement
4. **Reinsurer Option:** After a specified period (typically 10-15 years), reinsurer may recapture business with 180 days' notice

**c. Recapture Financial Settlement:**

When coinsurance is recaptured, the financial settlement is more complex than YRT:⁵⁴

- **Reserve Transfer:** Swiss Re returns $180 million in statutory reserves to LLIC (LLIC must increase balance sheet reserves correspondingly)
- **Ceding Commission Refund:** LLIC may owe Swiss Re a portion of unearned ceding commission (typically pro-rated over 10-15 years; if treaty in place 8 years, ~20-30% refund obligation = $5-8M estimated)⁵⁵
- **Experience Refund Settlement:** Final true-up of profit-sharing based on actual vs. expected experience through recapture date
- **Asset Transfer:** LLIC assumes Swiss Re's assets backing the $180M reserves (typically investment-grade bonds, which may create asset-liability mismatch if duration differs from LLIC's existing portfolio)⁵⁶

**Recapture Financial Impact — Swiss Re:**

If Swiss Re exercises recapture rights:⁵⁷

1. **Reserve Increase:** LLIC's statutory reserves increase by $180 million
2. **RBC Capital Requirement Increase:** C2 component increases due to unhedged mortality and lapse risk (estimated 12-15% C2 increase)⁵⁸
3. **Ceding Commission Refund:** Estimated $5-8 million cash outflow
4. **Replacement Reinsurance Cost:** Market pricing for $180M coinsurance likely 8-12% more expensive than existing treaty due to deteriorated underwriting environment 2022-2024⁵⁹
5. **RBC Ratio Impact:** Estimated decline from 188% to approximately **181-183%** (factoring in reserve increase and C2 increase)⁶⁰

**Consent Probability Assessment:**

Swiss Re coinsurance consent analysis:⁶¹
- **60-70% probability** Swiss Re consents without modification (established reinsurer relationship, LLIC profitability, AFH reputable acquirer)
- **20-25% probability** Swiss Re consents with renegotiated terms (experience refund percentage reduced from 50% to 40%, or modest premium increase)
- **10-15% probability** Swiss Re exercises recapture (if AFH's operational plans raise concerns about policyholder retention or claims management quality)

**Key Risk Factor:**

Swiss Re's absolute discretion to withhold consent (unlike Munich Re's "reasonableness" standard) creates higher renegotiation risk.⁶² AFH may need to provide detailed operational transition plans, management retention commitments, and regulatory capital commitments to secure Swiss Re's consent without modification.⁶³

#### 4. Reinsurance Group of America (RGA) — $95 Million Modified Coinsurance

**Reinsurer Profile:**

Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA) is a U.S.-based global life and health reinsurer headquartered in Chesterfield, Missouri (suburban St. Louis).⁶⁴ RGA is publicly traded (NYSE: RGA) and is among the largest life reinsurers globally, with operations in 26 countries and approximately $3.7 trillion of life reinsurance in force as of 2023.⁶⁵

RGA Reinsurance Company (the U.S. operating subsidiary) is **admitted/licensed** in all 50 states and holds an **A+ (Superior)** AM Best rating, **A1** Moody's rating, and **AA-** S&P rating.⁶⁶ RGA is NAIC-accredited, allowing LLIC full statutory reserve credit under Nebraska Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06(3).⁶⁷

**Treaty Structure — Modified Coinsurance:**

The RGA treaty is structured as **modified coinsurance (mod-co)** covering **$95 million in ceded reserves** for LLIC's **indexed universal life (IUL)** mortality risk.⁶⁸

**Modified coinsurance** is a hybrid structure:⁶⁹

- **Risk Transfer:** RGA assumes **mortality risk** (death benefits) on the IUL policies
- **Reserve Retention:** Unlike traditional coinsurance, LLIC **retains the reserves** ($95M) and the underlying assets backing those reserves
- **Interest Adjustment:** Because LLIC retains the assets, LLIC pays RGA an **"experience refund" or "interest adjustment"** equal to the investment earnings RGA would have earned had it held the reserves directly (typically credited annually based on LLIC's actual portfolio yield)
- **Capital Relief:** LLIC obtains RBC capital relief (reduced C2 mortality risk component) without transferring assets, preserving LLIC's asset-liability management control⁷⁰

**Why Modified Coinsurance for IUL Products:**

Indexed universal life products present unique challenges for traditional coinsurance:⁷¹

1. **Complex Crediting Mechanisms:** IUL policies credit interest based on equity index performance (e.g., S&P 500) subject to caps, floors, and participation rates
2. **Policyholder Behavior Sensitivity:** IUL policyholders may increase or decrease premium payments based on market performance, creating cash flow volatility
3. **Asset-Liability Matching:** LLIC uses derivatives (equity index options) to hedge IUL crediting obligations; transferring assets to a reinsurer under traditional coinsurance would disrupt hedging strategies
4. **Regulatory Treatment:** Modified coinsurance allows LLIC to maintain full control over invested assets while transferring biometric risk, optimizing both regulatory capital and economic risk management⁷²

**Products Covered:**

The $95 million mod-co treaty likely covers LLIC's **indexed universal life (IUL)** block written since 2015-2020, during the IUL sales boom (note: this is the same product class subject to the Thompson v. Liberty Life class action analyzed in T4 Litigation Report, creating potential cross-domain risk if policyholders' litigation proceeds affect persistency/lapse rates).⁷³

**Change of Control Provisions — Mod-Co Specific Analysis:**

Modified coinsurance treaties contain distinctive change of control provisions because **asset retention by the ceding company creates ongoing financial interdependence**:⁷⁴

**a. Consent to Assignment:**

> "This Agreement may not be assigned without the prior written consent of both parties. A Change of Control of the Ceding Company constitutes an assignment. The Reinsurer may condition its consent on satisfactory review of the acquiring entity's financial strength, investment management capabilities, and commitment to maintain the Ceding Company's investment policies."⁷⁵

**Mod-Co Unique Consideration:** Because LLIC retains assets and pays RGA interest adjustments based on investment performance, RGA has **heightened concern** about AFH's asset management practices post-acquisition.⁷⁶ If AFH implements an aggressive investment strategy (e.g., increasing below-investment-grade bond allocation beyond LLIC's current 7%), RGA's interest adjustments could be jeopardized by credit losses.⁷⁷

**b. Investment Guideline Covenants:**

Mod-co treaties typically include **investment guidelines** that restrict the ceding company's asset allocation:⁷⁸

- Minimum credit quality requirements (e.g., ≥90% investment-grade bonds)
- Maximum concentration limits (e.g., no single issuer >3% of mod-co reserves)
- Prohibited assets (e.g., no equities, real estate, or derivatives except for hedge purposes)
- Annual compliance certification by ceding company CFO

If AFH's post-acquisition investment strategy violates these covenants, RGA may have the right to:⁷⁹
- **Demand increased collateral** (letter of credit or trust account)
- **Recapture the treaty** with 90-180 days' notice
- **Convert to traditional coinsurance** (requiring LLIC to transfer assets to RGA, which could disrupt LLIC's IUL hedging program)

**c. Recapture Provisions — Mod-Co Specific:**

RGA may recapture the mod-co treaty upon:⁸⁰

1. **Change of Control:** Within 120 days of LLIC ownership change
2. **Investment Guideline Breach:** If LLIC's asset allocation violates covenants and remains uncured for 60 days
3. **Credit Rating Downgrade:** If LLIC or its parent (AFH post-acquisition) falls below BBB-/Baa3 rated
4. **Regulatory Capital Deterioration:** If LLIC's RBC ratio falls below 150% (Regulatory Action Level) — **CRITICAL RISK given LLIC's current 188% ratio**⁸¹

**d. Recapture Financial Settlement — Mod-Co Complexity:**

Mod-co recapture settlement is simpler than traditional coinsurance because **no asset transfer occurs** (LLIC already holds the assets):⁸²

- **Reserve Increase:** LLIC's statutory reserves increase by $95 million (reflected on balance sheet)
- **Ceding Commission Refund:** Estimated $2-3 million unearned commission refund to RGA⁸³
- **Interest Adjustment True-Up:** Final settlement of interest adjustments through recapture date (typically ±$500K)
- **No Asset Transfer Required:** LLIC retains all invested assets (a significant advantage vs. traditional coinsurance recapture)

**Recapture Financial Impact — RGA:**

If RGA exercises recapture rights:⁸⁴

1. **Reserve Increase:** $95 million statutory reserves reassumed by LLIC
2. **RBC Capital Requirement Increase:** C2 component increases due to IUL mortality risk (estimated 8-10% C2 increase)⁸⁵
3. **Ceding Commission Refund:** $2-3 million cash outflow
4. **Replacement Reinsurance Cost:** IUL mortality reinsurance challenging to replace due to product complexity; estimated 10-15% cost premium if alternative reinsurer found⁸⁶
5. **RBC Ratio Impact:** Estimated decline from 188% to approximately **184-186%**⁸⁷

**Consent Probability Assessment:**

RGA mod-co consent analysis:⁸⁸
- **65-75% probability** RGA consents without modification (strong incumbent reinsurer relationship, IUL business profitability)
- **20-25% probability** RGA consents with enhanced investment covenants (e.g., requiring AFH to maintain LLIC's current asset allocation, or providing quarterly investment portfolio reports to RGA)
- **5-10% probability** RGA exercises recapture (if AFH plans material changes to investment strategy or LLIC's IUL product features)

**Key Risk Factor — Cross-Domain:**

RGA's consent may be influenced by the **Thompson v. Liberty Life IUL class action** (T4 Litigation Report).⁸⁹ If RGA perceives reputational risk from being associated with a reinsured product subject to class action litigation, or if the litigation settlement creates policyholder dissatisfaction leading to increased lapse rates (adverse to RGA's mortality risk position), RGA may demand **indemnification for litigation-related losses** as a condition of consent.⁹⁰

### B. Aggregate Recapture Financial Impact — Worst-Case Scenario Analysis

This section models the aggregate financial impact if **all three traditional reinsurers** (Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA) simultaneously exercise recapture rights following the AFH acquisition — a **low-probability but high-impact** scenario requiring contingency planning.

#### 1. Reserve Reassumption Impact

**Statutory Balance Sheet Effect:**

If all three treaties are recaptured, LLIC must increase statutory reserves by the total ceded amount:⁹¹

| Reinsurer | Ceded Reserves | Reserve Increase |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Munich Re YRT | $240M | $0M (YRT holds no reserves) |
| Swiss Re Coinsurance | $180M | $180M |
| RGA Mod-Co | $95M | $95M |
| **Total** | **$515M** | **$275M** |

**Note:** YRT reinsurance does not involve reserve transfer, so Munich Re recapture does not increase LLIC's statutory reserves. However, it increases RBC capital requirements (C2 component) due to reassumed mortality risk.⁹²

**Surplus Impact:**

The $275 million reserve increase **does not directly reduce surplus** under statutory accounting principles because reserves are matched by corresponding increases in liabilities (policy reserves) and assets (if transferred from reinsurer in coinsurance cases).⁹³ However, the reserve increase triggers **indirect surplus impacts**:⁹⁴

1. **Ceding Commission Refunds:** LLIC owes Swiss Re and RGA unearned ceding commission refunds totaling estimated **$7-11 million**, which reduces surplus directly⁹⁵
2. **Asset-Liability Mismatch:** If Swiss Re's transferred assets have different duration or credit quality than LLIC's existing portfolio, potential unrealized losses or hedging costs of **$3-5 million**⁹⁶
3. **Replacement Reinsurance Costs:** If LLIC seeks replacement coverage, higher market pricing creates ongoing expense drag on earnings (estimated **$8-15 million annually**)⁹⁷

**Net Surplus Reduction (Direct + Indirect):** Estimated **$18-31 million** in Year 1 post-recapture.⁹⁸

---

#### 2. RBC Capital Requirement Increase

**RBC Formula Impact:**

The NAIC Risk-Based Capital formula for life insurers consists of four components (C0, C1, C2, C3, C4), with C2 (insurance risk) directly affected by reinsurance recapture:⁹⁹

**C2 Component Breakdown:**
- **C2 Mortality Risk:** Increases when mortality risk is reassumed from reinsurers
- **C2 Lapse Risk:** Increases when coinsurance lapse risk is reassumed (Swiss Re treaty)
- **C2 Morbidity Risk:** Not applicable to LLIC's reinsurance program (no health insurance ceded)

**Recapture Impact on C2:**

| Treaty | Risk Reassumed | C2 Increase (Estimated) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Munich Re YRT | $240M NAR mortality risk | +$36M to $48M¹⁰⁰ |
| Swiss Re Coinsurance | $180M whole life/UL mortality + lapse | +$22M to $27M¹⁰¹ |
| RGA Mod-Co | $95M IUL mortality risk | +$8M to $10M¹⁰² |
| **Total C2 Increase** | | **+$66M to $85M** |

**Authorized Control Level (ACL) Recalculation:**

ACL = 0.50 × Authorized Control Level RBC = 0.50 × √(C0² + C1² + C2² + C3² + C4²)¹⁰³

**Current State (Pre-Recapture):**¹⁰⁴
- TAC: $1.85 billion
- ACL: $982 million (implied from 188% RBC ratio)
- RBC Ratio: 188%

**Post-Recapture State (Worst Case):**¹⁰⁵

Assuming C2 increases by $66-85M midpoint **$75M**, and C2 represents approximately 40% of total RBC:¹⁰⁶
- New ACL: $982M + ($75M × 0.50 adjustment factor) ≈ **$1.02 billion**
- New TAC: $1.85B - $25M surplus reduction (net of ceding commission refunds + costs) ≈ **$1.825 billion**
- **New RBC Ratio: 179%** (vs. current 188%)

**Alternative Scenario (High Impact):**¹⁰⁷
- C2 increase $85M
- New ACL: **$1.04 billion**
- New TAC: $1.82 billion
- **New RBC Ratio: 175%** (approaching 150% Regulatory Action Level)

---

#### 3. Cash Flow and Liquidity Impact

**Immediate Cash Outflows:**¹⁰⁸

1. **Ceding Commission Refunds:** $7-11 million due within 60-90 days of recapture effective date
2. **Interest Adjustment Settlement (RGA Mod-Co):** ±$500K true-up payment
3. **Replacement Reinsurance Premiums:** If AFH elects to secure alternative coverage, upfront premiums of **$5-8 million** (estimated 5-10% of ceded reserves × annual premium rate)

**Total Immediate Liquidity Need:** **$12.5-19.5 million**

**Ongoing Cash Flow Impact:**

Annual reinsurance premium savings (LLIC no longer pays reinsurers) partially offset by:¹⁰⁹
- **Increased mortality claims paid directly** by LLIC (no reinsurance recoveries)
- **Replacement reinsurance premiums** if alternative coverage secured (10-15% more expensive than existing treaties)

**Net Annual Cash Flow Impact:** Estimated **negative $8-15 million** if replacement coverage obtained; neutral if LLIC retains all risk (but increases RBC capital requirements further).¹¹⁰

---

#### 4. Coordinated RBC Impact Analysis — Cross-Reference to T1 Report

**Critical Coordination Requirement:**

The precise RBC ratio impact of reinsurance recapture must be calculated in coordination with the **State Insurance Regulation & RBC Capital Report (T1)**, which models:¹¹¹

1. **Current RBC Position:** TAC $1.85B, ACL $982M, ratio 188%
2. **Proposed RBC Plan:** $150M capital injection → TAC $2.0B, ratio 204%
3. **Other Risk Scenarios:** GMWB tail risk, below-IG bond defaults, duration mismatch, market conduct fines

**Cascading Risk Scenario:**¹¹²

If reinsurance recapture occurs **simultaneously** with other adverse scenarios (e.g., GMWB hedge losses $45-75M + below-IG defaults $31-51M), the cumulative RBC impact could be severe:

**Severe Downside Scenario:**¹¹³
- TAC: $2.0B (post-capital injection) - $75M (GMWB losses) - $51M (credit losses) - $25M (recapture surplus impact) = **$1.849B**
- ACL: $982M + $75M (reinsurance recapture C2 increase) + $35M (investment risk C1 increase) = **$1.092B**
- **RBC Ratio: 169%** (still above 150% Regulatory Action Level, but materially deteriorated from planned 204%)

**Deal-Blocking Threshold:**

If RBC ratio falls below **150%** (Regulatory Action Level), Nebraska DOI has authority to:¹¹⁴
- Require additional corrective action beyond RBC Plan
- Restrict dividend payments to AFH (preventing return on investment)
- Prohibit new business writings in certain product lines
- Place LLIC under regulatory supervision (deal-blocking scenario)

**Recommendation:** Purchase agreement should include **escrow or contingency funding** of $50-75 million to address potential reinsurance recapture + simultaneous adverse scenarios.¹¹⁵

---

### C. Regulatory Framework — Credit for Reinsurance

#### 1. Nebraska Credit for Reinsurance Statute — NRS § 44-416.06

**Statutory Framework:**

Nebraska Revised Statutes § 44-416.06 governs when a domestic ceding insurer (LLIC) may take statutory **credit for reinsurance** as either an asset or a reduction from liability:¹¹⁶

**Credit Allowed When:**¹¹⁷

1. **§ 44-416.06(2) — Licensed Reinsurers:** Reinsurance ceded to assuming insurer **licensed to transact insurance in Nebraska**
   - **Application:** Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA all operate as admitted/licensed reinsurers in Nebraska → **full credit allowed** without collateral

2. **§ 44-416.06(3) — Accredited Reinsurers:** Reinsurance ceded to assuming insurer **accredited as a reinsurer in Nebraska**
   - **Requirements for Accreditation:**
     - Licensed to transact insurance in at least one U.S. state
     - Maintains surplus as regards policyholders ≥ $20 million
     - Submits to Nebraska DOI authority to examine books and records
     - Files annual financial statements with Nebraska DOI
   - **Application:** All three reinsurers meet accreditation criteria → **full credit allowed**

3. **§ 44-416.06(5) — Trust Fund Arrangements (Unauthorized Reinsurers):** Reinsurance ceded to **unauthorized** (non-admitted) reinsurer if reinsurer maintains trust fund in qualified U.S. financial institution
   - **Not Applicable:** Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA are admitted/authorized → trust not required
   - **Vermont Captive Note:** Liberty Re VT is unauthorized in Nebraska, requires letter of credit or trust (analyzed in T2 Captive Report)¹¹⁸

**Impact of Reinsurer Status Loss:**

If a reinsurer loses licensed or accredited status **post-closing**, Nebraska DOI may:¹¹⁹
- **Disallow reserve credit** retroactively (LLIC must increase reserves and reduce surplus)
- **Require collateral** from reinsurer (trust fund or letter of credit equal to ceded reserves)
- **Mandate novation** (transfer reinsurance to alternative reinsurer within 180 days)

**Change of Control Risk — Reinsurer Regulatory Status:**

The AFH acquisition does **not directly affect** Munich Re, Swiss Re, or RGA's licensed/accredited status (reinsurers are independent third parties).¹²⁰ However, if AFH's ownership raises concerns among state regulators about LLIC's financial stability, regulators may:¹²¹
- **Increase scrutiny** of reinsurance relationships (annual examinations of treaty compliance)
- **Require enhanced disclosures** of reinsurer financial strength and collateral adequacy
- **Condition Form A approval** on reinsurer consents being obtained pre-closing

**Recommendation:** Purchase agreement should include **representation** that all reinsurers maintain licensed/accredited status in Nebraska, with covenant to notify AFH within 10 days if any reinsurer loses such status.¹²²

---

#### 2. NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law & Certified Reinsurers

**NAIC Model Law Framework:**

The NAIC's **Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785)** and **Credit for Reinsurance Model Regulation (#786)**, adopted in 2019 revisions and implemented in 56 U.S. jurisdictions, establish three pathways for credit for reinsurance:¹²³

1. **Accredited Reinsurers** (discussed above under Nebraska § 44-416.06(3))
2. **Certified Reinsurers** (alien/non-U.S. reinsurers with reduced collateral requirements)
3. **Reciprocal Jurisdiction Reinsurers** (reinsurers domiciled in qualified foreign jurisdictions)

**Certified Reinsurers — Reduced Collateral:**¹²⁴

For **unauthorized** (non-admitted) alien reinsurers, NAIC Model Law allows states to certify reinsurers based on financial strength ratings, reducing required collateral from 100% of ceded reserves to a graduated scale:¹²⁵

| Credit Rating | Collateral Requirement |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Secure - 1 (AAA equivalent) | 0% |
| Secure - 2 (AA equivalent) | 10% |
| Secure - 3 (A equivalent) | 20% |
| Secure - 4 (BBB equivalent) | 50% |
| Secure - 5 (BB equivalent) | 75% |
| Vulnerable - 6 (B or below) | 100% |

**Application to LLIC's Reinsurers:**

- **Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA:** All are **admitted** U.S. reinsurers → certified reinsurer pathway **not applicable** (full credit without collateral under licensed/accredited pathway)
- **Vermont Captive (Liberty Re VT):** Unauthorized reinsurer → would need certification or full collateral (analyzed in T2 Report)¹²⁶

**NAIC Passported Reinsurers:**

As of October 2024, the NAIC's Reinsurance Financial Analysis Working Group (ReFAWG) has approved **93 reciprocal jurisdiction reinsurers** and **41 certified reinsurers** for passporting (automatic recognition across states).¹²⁷ While Munich Re Group, Swiss Re Group, and RGA have global operations, their **U.S. subsidiaries** operate as admitted entities and do not require certification/passporting.¹²⁸

**Key Regulatory Takeaway:**

LLIC's traditional reinsurance program with Munich Re, Swiss Re, and RGA benefits from **maximum regulatory certainty** under Nebraska and NAIC credit for reinsurance frameworks due to admitted/licensed status, minimizing collateral and regulatory approval complexities in the AFH acquisition.¹²⁹

---

#### 3. Reinsurance Regulatory Compliance Post-Acquisition

**Form A Filing — Reinsurance Disclosure Requirements:**

Nebraska's **Form A** (Statement Regarding the Acquisition of Control of a Domestic Insurer) requires AFH to disclose:¹³⁰

1. **All reinsurance agreements** LLIC has entered into (treaty names, effective dates, ceded reserves)
2. **Material changes anticipated** in reinsurance relationships post-acquisition
3. **Reinsurer consents obtained** or consent status as of Form A filing date
4. **Impact on statutory capital** if any reinsurer exercises recapture rights

**Nebraska DOI Review Process:**¹³¹

Nebraska Department of Insurance will:
- **Verify reinsurer financial strength** (AM Best ratings, statutory surplus, NAIC accreditation status)
- **Assess recapture risk** probability and RBC impact if treaties terminate
- **Condition approval** on obtaining reinsurer consents if DOI deems reinsurance critical to LLIC's solvency
- **Require contingency plan** for alternative reinsurance if consents not obtained pre-closing

**NAIC Coordinated Examination:**

If LLIC is subject to NAIC-coordinated multi-state examination (likely given 38-state licensing footprint), regulators may:¹³²
- **Share reinsurance findings** across state insurance departments participating in Form A review
- **Request reinsurer interviews** to assess willingness to continue relationships post-AFH acquisition
- **Coordinate approval conditions** across states (e.g., all states require reinsurer consents as closing condition)

**Recommendation:** AFH should initiate **pre-filing outreach** to Nebraska DOI (60 days before Form A submission) to discuss reinsurance program, demonstrate reinsurer relationship management plan, and gauge regulatory concerns regarding recapture risk.¹³³

---

### D. Change of Control Consent Negotiation Strategy

#### 1. Timeline and Process Management

**Critical Path Timeline:**¹³⁴

```
Day 0:         AFH-LLIC Purchase Agreement Execution
  ↓
Day 30-45:    Initial Reinsurer Notification (Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA)
              - Written notice of pending acquisition
              - Request for consent meeting
              - Provide AFH background materials (financial strength, M&A experience)
  ↓
Day 45-75:    Reinsurer Due Diligence Phase
              - Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA review AFH financials
              - Conference calls with AFH management
              - Discussion of post-acquisition operational plans
  ↓
Day 75-105:   Consent Negotiation Period
              - Reinsurers indicate consent position (approve / conditional / recapture)
              - If conditional: negotiate modified terms (premium, experience refunds, covenants)
              - Document consent amendments to treaties
  ↓
Day 105-120:  Consent Finalization
              - Execute treaty amendments or side letters
              - Deliver executed consents to Nebraska DOI with Form A filing
  ↓
Day 180-270:  Nebraska DOI Form A Review
              - Regulatory review of reinsurer consents
              - Potential follow-up questions
  ↓
Day 270+:     Transaction Closing
              - All reinsurer consents obtained (or escrowed)
              - Form A approval received
              - AFH closes acquisition
```

**Best Practice:** Initiate reinsurer outreach **60-90 days before Form A filing** to allow sufficient negotiation time.¹³⁵

---

#### 2. Reinsurer-Specific Negotiation Strategies

**Munich Re (YRT $240M) — Moderate Leverage:**

**Reinsurer Priorities:**¹³⁶
- Continuity of LLIC's underwriting quality (mortality experience)
- AFH commitment to maintain LLIC's claims administration processes
- Assurance that AFH will not materially change LLIC's risk appetite (e.g., entering new product lines with higher mortality risk)

**AFH Negotiation Strategy:**
1. **Emphasize operational continuity:** No change to LLIC underwriting team, claims staff, or reinsurance administration
2. **Provide AFH credentials:** Share AFH's track record in prior life insurance acquisitions (if applicable), demonstrating policyholder and reinsurer relationship stability
3. **Offer enhanced reporting:** Quarterly mortality experience reports to Munich Re (vs. current annual reporting)
4. **Consent timeline:** 30-45 days response period

**Expected Outcome:** **75% probability** consent without modification; **20% probability** consent with enhanced reporting/covenant; **5% probability** recapture.¹³⁷

---

**Swiss Re (Coinsurance $180M) — Higher Leverage (Absolute Discretion Clause):**

**Reinsurer Priorities:**¹³⁸
- AFH's financial strength and ability to support LLIC's regulatory capital commitments
- Assurance that experience refund provisions remain economically viable (mortality and lapse experience)
- Protection against AFH dividend policies that drain LLIC surplus (affecting Swiss Re's counterparty credit risk)

**AFH Negotiation Strategy:**
1. **Demonstrate financial strength:** Provide audited financials, credit ratings, equity commitment letters demonstrating $150M+ capital injection capability
2. **Covenant to maintain RBC:** Agree to maintain LLIC's RBC ratio ≥200% throughout treaty term (vs. current plan 204% post-capital injection)
3. **Limit dividend restrictions:** Agree not to extract dividends from LLIC if RBC ratio falls below 250% (providing Swiss Re additional cushion)
4. **Consider modest concession:** If Swiss Re requests, accept 5% reduction in experience refund percentage (from 50% to 47.5%) to secure consent without recapture

**Expected Outcome:** **65% probability** consent without modification; **25% probability** consent with modified experience refund or dividend covenant; **10% probability** recapture.¹³⁹

---

**RGA (Mod-Co $95M) — Heightened Investment Risk Concerns:**

**Reinsurer Priorities:**¹⁴⁰
- AFH's investment management philosophy (mod-co creates dependency on LLIC's asset performance for RGA's interest adjustments)
- Commitment to maintain LLIC's current investment guidelines (≥90% investment-grade bonds)
- IUL litigation resolution (Thompson v. Liberty Life class action — reputational and lapse risk)

**AFH Negotiation Strategy:**
1. **Investment guideline covenant:** Agree to maintain LLIC's current asset allocation policy for duration of RGA treaty (or until treaty renewal in [X] years)
   - ≥90% investment-grade bonds
   - Maximum 10% below-investment-grade exposure (current 7%)
   - No material increase in equity allocation
2. **Quarterly investment reporting:** Provide RGA with quarterly portfolio reports showing compliance with investment guidelines
3. **IUL litigation indemnification (if demanded):** Consider limited indemnification for lapse rate increases attributable to Thompson v. Liberty Life settlement (capped at $2-3M)
4. **Management continuity:** Commit to retaining LLIC's Chief Investment Officer for minimum 24 months post-closing

**Expected Outcome:** **70% probability** consent with enhanced investment covenants; **25% probability** consent without modification; **5% probability** recapture.¹⁴¹

---

#### 3. Purchase Agreement Provisions — Consent Risk Allocation

**Recommended Purchase Agreement Terms:**¹⁴²

**a. Reinsurer Consent as Closing Condition:**

> "The Closing shall be conditioned upon the Buyer (AFH) receiving written consent to the assignment of the Reinsurance Agreements from [Munich Re / Swiss Re / RGA], which consents shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and shall not impose material additional obligations or costs upon the Company (LLIC) or Buyer."

**Alternative (If Consents Delayed):**

> "If any Reinsurer Consent has not been obtained as of the Closing Date, Seller shall deposit into escrow an amount equal to [150% of ceded reserves + estimated recapture costs] for the applicable Reinsurance Agreement, to be held for [18 months] and released to Seller upon obtaining consent or to Buyer upon recapture."

**b. Seller Obligation to Obtain Consents:**

> "Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Reinsurer Consents, including: (i) providing reinsurers with information reasonably requested about Buyer's financial condition and operational plans; (ii) participating in meetings with reinsurers as reasonably requested by Buyer; and (iii) executing treaty amendments or side letters reasonably necessary to obtain consents, provided such amendments do not impose material additional obligations on Seller post-Closing."

**c. Recapture Escrow/Indemnification:**

> "If any Reinsurer exercises recapture rights within [24 months] following Closing as a result of the change of control, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for: (i) ceding commission refunds owed to the Reinsurer; (ii) costs to obtain replacement reinsurance (not to exceed 15% premium over recaptured treaty pricing); and (iii) adverse RBC capital impact requiring additional capital injection (capped at $50M aggregate for all Reinsurance Agreements)."

**d. Consent Modification Approval Rights:**

> "Buyer shall have the right to approve any modifications to Reinsurance Agreement economic terms (including premium rates, ceding commissions, experience refund percentages, or recapture provisions) proposed by Reinsurers as a condition of consent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld if modifications do not increase annual costs by more than 10% or materially alter recapture rights."

---

#### 4. Alternative Reinsurance Market Analysis — Replacement Cost

**If Recapture Occurs — Replacement Reinsurance Options:**¹⁴³

**YRT Mortality Reinsurance ($240M Net Amount at Risk):**

Alternative reinsurers capable of providing $240M YRT coverage:¹⁴⁴
- **RGA** (if not already recapturing IUL treaty — capacity conflict)
- **SCOR Global Life Americas** (French reinsurer, U.S. admitted)
- **Hannover Re** (German reinsurer, U.S. admitted)
- **Pacific Life Re** (U.S. domestic reinsurer)

**Estimated Pricing Premium:** 5-10% more expensive than existing Munich Re treaty due to:¹⁴⁵
- **Mortality deterioration 2022-2024:** Post-COVID-19 mortality trends increase reinsurer pricing
- **Anti-selection risk:** Reinsurers assume LLIC's existing Munich Re relationship was competitively priced; new entrant requires premium for adverse selection
- **Transaction complexity:** Change-of-control context signals potential operational disruption

**Annual Cost Increase:** $240M NAR × 0.15% YRT rate × 7% premium increase ≈ **$2.5M annually**

---

**Coinsurance Whole Life/UL ($180M Reserves):**

Alternative reinsurers capable of $180M coinsurance treaty:¹⁴⁶
- **RGA** (strongest appetite for whole life/UL coinsurance)
- **Munich Re** (if not recapturing YRT — cross-sell opportunity)
- **Wilton Re** (U.S. run-off reinsurer specializing in legacy blocks)

**Estimated Pricing Premium:** 8-12% more expensive than existing Swiss Re treaty due to:¹⁴⁷
- **Coinsurance capital commitment:** Replacement reinsurer requires higher return on capital for long-duration liability
- **Experience refund reduction:** Alternative reinsurers may offer lower profit-sharing (40% vs. Swiss Re's 50%)
- **Ceding commission reduction:** New treaty may offer 80% upfront commission vs. 85% (hurts LLIC's DAC amortization)

**Annual Cost Increase:** $180M reserves × 5% annual premium rate × 10% cost increase ≈ **$9M annually**

---

**Modified Coinsurance IUL ($95M Reserves):**

Alternative reinsurers for IUL mod-co (limited market):¹⁴⁸
- **Pacific Life Re** (selective IUL appetite)
- **Protective Life Re** (U.S. domestic, limited capacity)

**Challenge:** IUL reinsurance market has **contracted significantly** post-2020 due to:¹⁴⁹
- **Illustration litigation risk** (Thompson v. Liberty Life type class actions)
- **Product complexity** (hedging caps/floors/participation rates)
- **Lapse risk uncertainty** (policyholders underfunding premiums)

**Estimated Pricing Premium:** 10-15% more expensive than existing RGA treaty, **if available**.¹⁵⁰

**Alternative Strategy:** If replacement mod-co unavailable, LLIC could convert to:¹⁵¹
- **YRT coverage only** (mortality risk transfer, LLIC retains lapse risk) — reduces capital relief benefit
- **Captive reinsurance** (establish new captive or expand Liberty Re VT) — increases regulatory scrutiny risk

**Annual Cost Increase (if replacement found):** $95M reserves × 5% annual premium × 12.5% cost increase ≈ **$5.9M annually**

---

**Aggregate Replacement Cost:**

If all three treaties recaptured and replacement coverage secured:¹⁵²
- YRT replacement: $2.5M annually
- Coinsurance replacement: $9M annually
- Mod-co replacement: $5.9M annually
- **Total:** **$17.4M annual cost increase**

**Present Value Impact (10-year horizon, 8% discount rate):**¹⁵³
- PV = $17.4M × 6.71 (PV annuity factor 10 years @ 8%) ≈ **$116.7M**

**Recommendation:** Purchase agreement should include **escrow of $50M** to cover 3 years of replacement reinsurance cost increase ($17.4M × 3 years ≈ $52M) if recapture occurs.¹⁵⁴

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. High-Severity Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------------|------------|
| **All three traditional reinsurers exercise recapture rights** | HIGH | 5-10% | RBC ratio decline 188% → 175-179%; $18-31M surplus reduction; $17.4M annual replacement cost | Escrow $50M for recapture contingency; early reinsurer engagement; AFH demonstrate financial strength and operational continuity |
| **Swiss Re withholds consent (absolute discretion clause)** | MEDIUM-HIGH | 10-15% | $180M reserve reassumption; RBC ratio → 181-183%; $5-8M ceding commission refund | AFH provide detailed capital commitment; RBC covenant ≥200%; dividend restriction covenant |
| **RGA recapture due to IUL litigation concerns** (cross-domain with T4) | MEDIUM | 5-10% | $95M reserve reassumption; IUL mod-co replacement difficult to source; potential captive expansion | Thompson v. Liberty Life settlement within $45M; limited indemnification offer to RGA; litigation resolution timeline disclosure |
| **Cascading RBC deterioration** (reinsurance recapture + GMWB losses + credit defaults) | HIGH | 3-5% | RBC ratio → 169% (approaching 150% RAL); deal-blocking if regulators intervene | Coordinate with T1 RBC Report; contingency capital plan $50-75M; stress-test all scenarios |

### B. Medium-Severity Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------------|------------|
| **Reinsurer consent conditioned on modified economic terms** | MEDIUM | 20-30% | Annual cost increase $2-5M (5-10% premium increase or reduced experience refunds) | Budget for modest concessions; AFH approval rights for modifications >10% cost |
| **AFH investment strategy violates RGA mod-co investment covenants** | MEDIUM | 10-15% | RGA recapture trigger; collateral demand; $95M reserve reassumption | Commit to maintain current asset allocation; quarterly reporting to RGA; CIO retention 24 months |
| **Nebraska DOI conditions Form A approval on reinsurer consents** | MEDIUM | 40-50% | Closing delay 60-120 days if consents not obtained; potential deal termination if reinsurers refuse | Initiate reinsurer outreach Day 30-45; Nebraska DOI pre-filing consultation; consent as closing condition in purchase agreement |
| **Replacement reinsurance market capacity constraints** (especially IUL mod-co) | MEDIUM | 30-40% (if recapture occurs) | Limited alternatives; 10-15% cost premium; capital relief reduction if YRT-only replacement | Pre-identify alternative reinsurers; market sounding 90 days pre-closing; captive expansion as fallback |

### C. Cross-Domain Risks Flagged for Other Specialists

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Reinsurance recapture increases RBC C2 component $66-85M** | RBC Capital (T1) | regulatory-rulemaking-analyst | How does $75M C2 increase affect LLIC's $150M capital injection plan and post-closing RBC ratio? Does AFH need larger capital injection if recapture probable? | HIGH |
| **Vermont captive $850M separate from traditional reinsurance** | Captive Reinsurance (T2) | regulatory-rulemaking-analyst | If Vermont captive recaptured PLUS traditional reinsurance recaptured, what is cumulative RBC impact? ($850M + $275M reserves = $1.125B total reassumption?) | CRITICAL |
| **RGA consent influenced by Thompson v. Liberty Life IUL litigation** | Litigation (T4) | case-law-analyst | Does IUL class action settlement timing affect RGA consent probability? Should settlement occur pre-closing to remove reinsurer concern? | MEDIUM |
| **Mod-co investment covenants restrict AFH's asset allocation flexibility** | Investment Portfolio (T10) | financial-analyst | Do RGA's ≥90% investment-grade requirements conflict with AFH's planned investment strategy? Does this limit LLIC's ability to optimize yield? | MEDIUM |
| **Recapture replacement cost $17.4M annually reduces profitability** | Financial Modeling (T11) | financial-analyst | How does $17.4M annual reinsurance cost increase affect LLIC's statutory net income and ROE projections? Impact on AFH's IRR? | MEDIUM |

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Key Conclusions

**1. Reinsurance Program Structure — Generally Strong with Admitted Reinsurers:**

LLIC's $1.365 billion reinsurance program (excluding Vermont captive's $850M analyzed in T2 Report) consists of **$515 million in traditional reinsurance** with three highly-rated, admitted reinsurers:
- Munich Re North America ($240M YRT) — A+ AM Best, admitted
- Swiss Re Life & Health America ($180M coinsurance) — A+ AM Best, admitted
- RGA ($95M mod-co) — A+ AM Best, admitted

All three reinsurers qualify for **full statutory reserve credit** under Nebraska Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06(2)-(3) without collateral requirements, providing maximum regulatory certainty for the AFH acquisition. This contrasts favorably with the Vermont captive ($850M), which faces regulatory scrutiny as an unauthorized reinsurer (T2 Report cross-reference).

**2. Change of Control Consent Probability — Moderately Favorable:**

Based on industry precedent for life insurance M&A transactions involving PE-backed acquirers, the **aggregate probability of obtaining all three reinsurer consents without material modification is approximately 45-55%**:

| Reinsurer | Consent Probability (No Modification) | Conditional Consent Probability | Recapture Probability |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Munich Re (YRT) | 70-80% | 15-20% | 5-10% |
| Swiss Re (Coinsurance) | 60-70% | 20-25% | 10-15% |
| RGA (Mod-Co) | 25-30% (without covenant) / 65-75% (with investment covenant) | 65-70% | 5-10% |

**Combined Scenario Analysis:**
- **Optimistic (45-55% probability):** All three reinsurers consent without material modifications → no recapture, no additional costs
- **Base Case (35-40% probability):** One or two reinsurers consent with modest modifications (enhanced reporting, investment covenants, 5% cost increase) → annual cost increase $2-5M
- **Downside (8-12% probability):** One reinsurer exercises recapture (most likely Swiss Re or RGA) → $95-180M reserve reassumption, RBC ratio decline to 181-186%, replacement cost $5.9-9M annually
- **Severe Downside (2-5% probability):** Multiple reinsurers exercise recapture → $275M reserve reassumption, RBC ratio → 175-179%, replacement cost $17.4M annually

**3. RBC Capital Impact — Material if Recapture Occurs:**

If all three traditional reinsurers exercise recapture rights (low-probability scenario), LLIC's RBC position deteriorates materially:
- **Reserve Increase:** $275 million (Swiss Re $180M + RGA $95M; Munich Re YRT holds no reserves)
- **C2 Component Increase:** $66-85 million (mortality and lapse risk reassumption)
- **Surplus Reduction (Direct + Indirect):** $18-31 million (ceding commission refunds $7-11M + asset mismatch $3-5M + replacement costs $8-15M)
- **RBC Ratio Impact:** 188% → **175-179%** (vs. planned 204% post-$150M capital injection)

**Critical Coordination with T1 RBC Report:** If reinsurance recapture occurs simultaneously with other adverse scenarios (GMWB losses $45-75M, below-IG bond defaults $31-51M), cumulative RBC ratio could decline to **169%**, approaching 150% Regulatory Action Level (deal-blocking threshold).

**4. Replacement Reinsurance Market — Challenging for IUL Mod-Co:**

If recapture occurs, replacement reinsurance is available but at material cost premium:
- **YRT Mortality:** 5-10% more expensive (alternative reinsurers: RGA, SCOR, Hannover Re, Pacific Life Re)
- **Coinsurance Whole Life/UL:** 8-12% more expensive (RGA, Munich Re, Wilton Re)
- **Mod-Co IUL:** 10-15% more expensive **if available** — market severely constrained due to illustration litigation risk (Thompson v. Liberty Life), product complexity, lapse uncertainty

**Total Replacement Cost:** $17.4 million annually ($116.7M present value over 10 years @ 8% discount rate)

**5. Cross-Domain Risks — IUL Litigation Affects RGA Consent:**

The RGA mod-co treaty covers LLIC's **indexed universal life (IUL) products** written 2015-2020 — the same product line subject to the **Thompson v. Liberty Life class action** (T4 Report: 850 policyholders, settlement range $25-45M). RGA's consent decision may be influenced by:
- **Reputational risk** from association with litigated product
- **Lapse rate risk** if litigation settlement creates policyholder dissatisfaction, increasing surrenders (adverse to RGA's mortality position)
- **Demand for indemnification** as condition of consent (estimated $2-3M cap)

**Recommendation:** Coordinate IUL litigation settlement timing (Q2 2025 mediation) with reinsurer consent process to resolve RGA's concerns pre-closing.

---

### B. Recommended Actions

**Immediate Actions (Day 0-45 Post-Purchase Agreement Execution):**

**1. Establish Reinsurance Consent Task Force**
- **Lead:** AFH M&A counsel + LLIC Chief Reinsurance Officer
- **Participants:** AFH CFO, LLIC CFO, external reinsurance advisors
- **Objective:** Coordinate consent strategy across all three reinsurers; develop AFH positioning materials

**2. Prepare AFH Information Package for Reinsurers**
- **Financial strength materials:** Audited financials, equity commitment letters ($150M+ capital injection), credit ratings (if applicable)
- **Operational continuity plans:** No change to LLIC underwriting, claims, reinsurance administration; management retention commitments
- **Regulatory capital commitment:** Covenant to maintain RBC ≥200% (vs. 204% planned)
- **Investment management philosophy:** For RGA mod-co, emphasize asset allocation continuity (≥90% IG bonds, current 7% below-IG maintained)

**3. Initiate Pre-Filing Nebraska DOI Outreach (Day 30-45)**
- **Objective:** Gauge Nebraska DOI's view on reinsurance program criticality to LLIC solvency
- **Topics:** Disclose reinsurance consent strategy; demonstrate reinsurer relationship management; assess whether DOI will condition Form A approval on consents
- **Outcome:** Inform purchase agreement closing conditions based on regulatory feedback

---

**Reinsurer Engagement Phase (Day 45-105):**

**4. Munich Re Consent Strategy (YRT $240M) — Priority: Moderate**
- **Day 45-60:** Written notice of acquisition + consent request; AFH information package delivery
- **Day 60-75:** Conference call with Munich Re reinsurance treaty team + AFH management
- **Day 75-90:** Negotiate consent; offer enhanced quarterly mortality reporting if requested
- **Expected Outcome:** Consent without modification (70-80% probability)

**5. Swiss Re Consent Strategy (Coinsurance $180M) — Priority: HIGH (Absolute Discretion Clause)**
- **Day 45-60:** Written notice + AFH package emphasizing financial strength and capital commitment
- **Day 60-75:** Senior-level meeting (AFH CEO/CFO + Swiss Re relationship manager)
- **Day 75-95:** Negotiate consent terms; prepared to accept:
  - RBC covenant ≥200% throughout treaty term
  - Dividend restriction if RBC <250%
  - Modest experience refund reduction (50% → 47.5%) if necessary
- **Expected Outcome:** Consent with modified terms (65-70% probability)

**6. RGA Consent Strategy (Mod-Co $95M) — Priority: HIGH (Investment Covenant + IUL Litigation Risk)**
- **Day 45-60:** Written notice + AFH package + **Thompson v. Liberty Life litigation update** (settlement status, expected resolution Q2 2025)
- **Day 60-75:** Meeting with RGA including LLIC CIO (asset management continuity discussion)
- **Day 75-105:** Negotiate consent with expected concessions:
  - Investment guideline covenant (≥90% IG bonds, maximum 10% below-IG)
  - Quarterly investment portfolio reporting
  - Limited indemnification for litigation-driven lapse increases (cap $2-3M)
  - CIO retention commitment 24 months
- **Expected Outcome:** Consent with enhanced investment covenants (65-75% probability)

---

**Purchase Agreement Provisions (Concurrent with Reinsurer Engagement):**

**7. Reinsurer Consent Closing Conditions**
- **Primary Condition:** "Buyer receipt of written consents from Munich Re, Swiss Re, and RGA, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and not imposing material additional obligations (>10% annual cost increase)"
- **Alternative (if consents delayed):** Escrow mechanism — Seller deposits 150% of ceded reserves + estimated recapture costs for non-consenting reinsurer, held 18 months

**8. Seller Obligations and Indemnification**
- **Seller commercially reasonable efforts** to obtain consents (provide AFH information, participate in meetings, execute minor treaty amendments)
- **Recapture indemnification:** If reinsurer exercises recapture within 24 months post-closing due to change of control:
  - Seller indemnifies Buyer for: ceding commission refunds, replacement reinsurance cost premium (capped at 15%), adverse RBC capital impact (capped at $50M aggregate)

**9. Recapture Contingency Escrow**
- **Amount:** $50 million
- **Purpose:** Cover 3 years of replacement reinsurance cost differential ($17.4M annually) if all three reinsurers recapture
- **Release:** To Seller if consents obtained and reinsurers do not recapture within 24 months; to Buyer if recapture occurs

---

**Regulatory Filing Phase (Day 105-120):**

**10. Nebraska Form A Filing — Reinsurance Disclosure**
- **Attachment:** Executed reinsurer consents (or status update if negotiations ongoing)
- **Disclosure:** Material reinsurance agreements, ceded reserves, reinsurer financial strength, recapture risk analysis, contingency plan for replacement reinsurance
- **Coordination:** Deliver consents to Nebraska DOI with Form A (demonstrates transaction readiness)

---

**Contingency Planning (Throughout Process):**

**11. Alternative Reinsurance Market Sounding (Day 60-90)**
- **Objective:** Identify replacement reinsurers for YRT, coinsurance, mod-co if incumbent reinsurers recapture
- **Targets:** RGA (if not recapturing), SCOR, Hannover Re, Pacific Life Re, Protective Life Re
- **Outcome:** Confirmed replacement capacity; indicative pricing (budget 10-15% premium over existing treaties)

**12. RBC Stress Testing — Coordinated with T1 Report**
- **Scenarios:**
  - Base case: All reinsurers consent, no recapture → RBC ratio 204% (per RBC Plan)
  - Downside: One reinsurer recaptures → RBC ratio 181-186%
  - Severe: All reinsurers recapture → RBC ratio 175-179%
  - Severe + GMWB losses + credit defaults → RBC ratio 169%
- **Contingency Capital:** If severe scenarios probable, AFH prepare additional $50-75M capital injection beyond $150M RBC Plan

### C. Recommended Purchase Agreement Language

**Section 6.5 — Reinsurance Consents**

> **(a) Reinsurer Consent Obligations.** Seller shall, and shall cause the Company (LLIC) to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to Closing, the written consent of each of Munich Reinsurance America Inc., Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc., and Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (collectively, the "**Material Reinsurers**") to the assignment of the Reinsurance Agreements (as defined below) to Buyer or its designee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (each, a "**Reinsurer Consent**"). Such efforts shall include: (i) providing the Material Reinsurers with information reasonably requested concerning Buyer's financial condition, ownership structure, and operational plans for the Company; (ii) participating in meetings, conference calls, or other communications with the Material Reinsurers as reasonably requested by Buyer; and (iii) executing amendments, side letters, or other modifications to the Reinsurance Agreements reasonably necessary to obtain Reinsurer Consents, provided that such modifications do not impose material additional obligations on Seller after Closing.
>
> **(b) Consent Modification Approval.** Buyer shall have the right to approve any modifications to the economic terms of the Reinsurance Agreements (including, without limitation, reinsurance premium rates, ceding commission percentages, experience refund provisions, or recapture rights) proposed by any Material Reinsurer as a condition to granting its Reinsurer Consent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed if such modifications (i) do not increase the Company's annual reinsurance costs by more than ten percent (10%) compared to the existing Reinsurance Agreements, and (ii) do not materially accelerate or broaden recapture rights.
>
> **(c) Closing Condition.** The obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing is conditioned upon Buyer having received Reinsurer Consents from all Material Reinsurers, or, in the alternative, upon the Seller depositing into the Escrow Account (as defined in Section 2.6) an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the ceded reserves under the applicable Reinsurance Agreement plus the estimated costs to obtain replacement reinsurance for a period of three (3) years, as calculated in good faith by Buyer, for each Material Reinsurer that has not delivered a Reinsurer Consent by the Closing Date.
>
> **(d) Recapture Indemnification.** If any Material Reinsurer exercises recapture rights under its Reinsurance Agreement within twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date as a result of the change of control of the Company, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for: (i) any ceding commission refunds or similar amounts owed by the Company to the recapturing Material Reinsurer; (ii) the incremental cost to obtain replacement reinsurance providing substantially equivalent coverage, calculated as the excess (if any) of the annual premiums for replacement reinsurance over the annual premiums that would have been payable under the recaptured Reinsurance Agreement, for a period of three (3) years (provided that such incremental cost shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the annual premiums under the recaptured Reinsurance Agreement); and (iii) any adverse impact on the Company's Risk-Based Capital ratio requiring Buyer to make additional capital contributions beyond those contemplated in Section 5.8 to maintain the Company's RBC ratio at or above two hundred percent (200%), up to a maximum aggregate indemnification obligation of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) for all recapture events under this Section 6.5(d).

---

**Section 6.6 — Reinsurance Agreement Disclosure**

> For purposes of Section 6.5, "**Reinsurance Agreements**" means: (i) that certain Yearly Renewable Term Reinsurance Agreement between the Company and Munich Reinsurance America Inc., effective [Date], pursuant to which the Company has ceded approximately Two Hundred Forty Million Dollars ($240,000,000) in net amount at risk as of [Date]; (ii) that certain Coinsurance Agreement between the Company and Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc., effective [Date], pursuant to which the Company has ceded approximately One Hundred Eighty Million Dollars ($180,000,000) in statutory reserves as of [Date]; and (iii) that certain Modified Coinsurance Agreement between the Company and Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated, effective [Date], pursuant to which the Company has ceded approximately Ninety-Five Million Dollars ($95,000,000) in statutory reserves as of [Date].

| **RBC Ratio Post-Closing (if recapture occurs)** | ≥185% | <180% |

**Escalation Triggers:**

- **Day 75:** If any Material Reinsurer has not responded to consent request → AFH CEO/Seller CEO escalation to reinsurer C-suite
- **Day 90:** If any Material Reinsurer indicates likely recapture → Activate alternative reinsurance market sounding; revise RBC stress test; consider purchase price adjustment negotiation
- **Day 105:** If <3 of 3 consents obtained → Assess (i) escrow mechanism activation, (ii) waiver of closing condition (if AFH willing to assume recapture risk), or (iii) deal restructuring/termination

### E. Final Recommendation Summary

**1. Reinsurance Program Risk Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The traditional reinsurance program ($515M Munich Re, Swiss Re, RGA) presents **manageable but material** transaction risk. Unlike the Vermont captive's **deal-blocking regulatory risk** (T2 Report), traditional reinsurance consent risk is primarily **economic and timing-based**:
- 45-55% probability all three reinsurers consent without material modification
- 35-40% probability consents obtained with modest cost increases ($2-5M annually)
- 8-12% probability one reinsurer recaptures → RBC impact mitigable
- 2-5% probability multiple recapture → severe RBC deterioration requiring contingency capital

**2. Critical Path: Early Reinsurer Engagement Essential**

Success depends on **initiating reinsurer outreach by Day 30-45** post-purchase agreement execution, allowing 60-90 days for consent negotiation prior to Nebraska Form A filing. Delayed engagement risks:
- Insufficient time to negotiate consent modifications
- Nebraska DOI conditioning Form A approval on consents not yet obtained (closing delay 60-120 days)
- Reinsurer perception of AFH as unprepared or operationally risky

**3. Purchase Agreement Protections Required**

The purchase agreement must include:
- **Reinsurer consent closing condition** (with escrow alternative)
- **Seller commercially reasonable efforts obligation** to obtain consents
- **Recapture indemnification** ($50M cap) for 24-month tail period
- **$50M escrow** for replacement reinsurance cost differential (3 years)

**4. Coordinate with T1 RBC Capital Report — Cascading Risk**

Reinsurance recapture risk must be modeled in coordination with T1 RBC Report's analysis of:
- $150M capital injection adequacy if recapture occurs (may need $200-225M total)
- Cumulative RBC impact of recapture + GMWB losses + credit defaults (severe scenario → 169% ratio)
- Deal-blocking threshold (150% Regulatory Action Level)

**5. IUL Litigation Settlement Timing Coordination (T4 Cross-Reference)**

The **Thompson v. Liberty Life class action** (Q2 2025 mediation) affects RGA mod-co consent probability. AFH should:
- Coordinate with Seller to settle litigation within $45M E&O coverage limit **prior to Closing**
- Disclose settlement terms to RGA during consent negotiations
- Offer limited indemnification ($2-3M cap) for litigation-driven lapse increases if RGA demands

**Conclusion:** With proactive reinsurer engagement, financial strength demonstration, and appropriate purchase agreement protections, AFH can achieve acceptable reinsurance consent outcomes. However, failure to secure consents creates material RBC capital risk requiring contingency planning and potential deal restructuring.
