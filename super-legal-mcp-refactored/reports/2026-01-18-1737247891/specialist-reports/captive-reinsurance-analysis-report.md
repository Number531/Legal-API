## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. Critical Issue Overview — Deal-Blocking Potential

Liberty Life Insurance Company's (LLIC) captive reinsurance arrangement with Liberty Re Ltd. (Vermont captive) presents **CRITICAL** deal-blocking risk to the $2.9B acquisition by American Financial Holdings. LLIC has ceded $850M in AXXX/XXX term life and universal life redundant reserves to Liberty Re, supported by only $120M in captive assets and a $730M parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC (net worth: $280M). This structure's compliance with NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG48) and Nebraska Department of Insurance (DOI) reserve credit requirements is uncertain, creating 25-35% probability of forced recapture within the transaction timeline.

**Deal Impact:** If Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit due to AG48 non-compliance or inadequate collateralization, LLIC must recapture $850M in reserves, reducing statutory surplus by $120M-$180M and declining RBC ratio from 188% to 152-157%—dangerously close to the 150% Regulatory Action Level. Combined with LLIC's existing RBC deficiency requiring a $150M capital injection, total capital needs could reach $420M, potentially making the acquisition economically unviable.

**Regulatory Context:** The captive reinsurance structure emerged during the 2010-2014 period when life insurers used Vermont captives to finance "redundant" XXX and AXXX statutory reserves. Following the 2013 "shadow insurance" controversy highlighted by New York DFS and Federal Reserve research documenting $364B in captive liabilities, NAIC adopted AG48 (effective Jan. 1, 2015) to require "Primary Security" (high-quality assets) and limit reliance on "Other Security" (parental guarantees, surplus notes). Liberty Re's current structure—14% Primary Security ($120M ÷ $850M) and 86% parental guarantee from an entity with 2.6x leverage—raises substantial compliance questions.

### B. Regulatory Framework Analysis

#### 1. AG48 and Model #787 Requirements

**NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG48)**, adopted December 2014 and effective January 1, 2015, establishes requirements for XXX/AXXX reserve financing transactions. AG48 defines two security categories:

- **Primary Security:** High-quality assets restricted to cash and Securities Valuation Office (SVO)-listed securities, excluding synthetic letters of credit. The "Actuarial Method" calculates the "Required Level of Primary Security" (economic reserve plus margin for conservatism).

- **Other Security:** Surplus notes, parental guarantees, and other credit support that do not meet Primary Security standards.

**NAIC Model #787** (Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation, adopted December 2016) codified AG48 into a model regulation for state adoption. As of 2024:
- **42 jurisdictions adopted Model #787**, including **Vermont** (Liberty Re domicile)
- **9 jurisdictions rely on AG48**, including **Nebraska** (LLIC domicile)

**Critical Compliance Gap:** Liberty Re holds $120M in assets (14% of $850M ceded reserves), with the remaining $730M (86%) covered by a parental guarantee. Research did not identify Liberty Re's AG48 actuarial calculations to determine whether $120M meets the Required Level of Primary Security. Industry experience suggests Primary Security requirements typically range from 30-60% of ceded reserves for XXX/AXXX business, implying Liberty Re may need $255M-$510M in Primary Security—substantially exceeding the current $120M.

**Grandfathering Analysis:** AG48 applies to transactions "executed after January 1, 2015." Liberty Re was established in 2010 (pre-AG48), but the captive's $850M in current ceded reserves likely includes policies written or reserves increased after January 1, 2015, triggering AG48 compliance. Even if original treaties pre-date AG48, material amendments post-2015 may eliminate grandfathering protection. **Probability assessment:** 75-85% of Liberty Re's reserves are subject to AG48 based on policy issue dates (term/UL policies have 10-30 year terms; a 2010 captive would have added substantial new business 2015-2024).

#### 2. Nebraska Credit for Reinsurance Authority

**Nebraska Revised Statutes § 44-416.06** conditions reserve credit on reinsurer compliance with requirements "which relate to the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and form of security supporting reinsurance arrangements, or circumstances under which credit will be reduced or eliminated." This grants Nebraska DOI broad discretion to disallow reserve credit if Liberty Re's structure is deemed inadequate.

**Unauthorized Reinsurer Status:** Liberty Re is Vermont-domiciled and not licensed in Nebraska, making it an "unauthorized reinsurer" subject to collateral requirements. Nebraska offers three pathways for unauthorized reinsurers:
1. **Certified Reinsurer:** May post reduced collateral (10-75% depending on rating)
2. **Trust Fund:** NAIC Appendix A-785 compliant trust in U.S. financial institution
3. **Reciprocal Jurisdiction:** Eliminates collateral (typically EU/UK reinsurers under covered agreements)

Research did not establish which pathway Liberty Re uses or whether the $120M assets constitute an A-785 compliant trust. The $730M parental guarantee's acceptability as collateral under Nebraska regulations is uncertain.

**Form D Prior Notification:** LLIC's $850M ceded reserves represent 46% of statutory surplus ($1.85B), far exceeding Nebraska's 5% materiality threshold requiring Form D prior notification to Nebraska DOI. LLIC would have filed Form D when establishing or materially amending Liberty Re treaties, giving Nebraska DOI advance notice. However, prior approval does not preclude subsequent determination of inadequacy, particularly as AG48 compliance standards evolved 2015-2020.

#### 3. Vermont Captive Insurance Regulation

**Vermont Statutes Title 8, Chapter 141** governs captive insurance companies. **Vermont Regulation C-2006-02** specifically addresses captives reinsuring life insurance policies, requiring reserves that are "actuarially sufficient to support the liabilities incurred."

**Capital Requirements:** Vermont § 6004 sets minimum capital ($250K for pure captives to $1M for risk retention groups), but the Commissioner may prescribe additional capital based on business volume. For a life insurance captive reinsuring $850M in reserves, Vermont DFR would likely require capital substantially exceeding statutory minimums.

**Asset Composition:** Vermont permits capital in the form of cash, marketable securities (complying with 8 V.S.A. §§ 3461-3472), Commissioner-approved trust, or irrevocable letter of credit. Research did not verify Liberty Re's $120M asset composition or whether it meets Vermont's quality standards.

**Vermont NAIC Accreditation:** Vermont is NAIC-accredited (reaccredited at Fall 2025 National Meeting), which is critical for Nebraska DOI's willingness to recognize Vermont captive reinsurance. If Vermont DFR were to determine Liberty Re's reserves inadequate or lose accreditation, Nebraska DOI could disallow reserve credit.

#### 4. Statutory Accounting Principles (SSAP 61R)

**SSAP No. 61R** governs life reinsurance statutory accounting, requiring **sufficient insurance risk transfer** for reserve credit. Contracts lacking risk transfer must use deposit accounting (no reserve credit).

**2024 NAIC Revisions:** In November 2024, NAIC Statutory Accounting Principles Working Group adopted revisions to SSAP 61R addressing **combination reinsurance contracts** (e.g., coinsurance + YRT with aggregate experience refund). Key principle: **When treaties involve interdependent types of reinsurance, risk transfer must be evaluated in the aggregate**, not separately.

**Liberty Re Implication:** If Liberty Re's treaties include experience refunds or profit-sharing tied to aggregate performance, SSAP 61R's 2024 revisions require aggregate risk transfer analysis, potentially affecting whether reserve credit is appropriate.

**Collateral and Admissibility:** SSAP 61R provides that reinsurance recoverables secured by **A-785 compliant trust** collateral are admitted assets. Recoverables not secured by A-785 compliant trust or that are in dispute must be **nonadmitted**, reducing statutory surplus. If Liberty Re's $730M parental guarantee does not qualify as A-785 compliant trust collateral, LLIC may be required to nonadmit a portion of reinsurance recoverables.

### C. Parental Guarantee Structural Weakness

**Liberty Life Holdings LLC Guarantee Adequacy:** The $730M parental guarantee represents **2.6x Liberty Life Holdings' $280M net worth**. This leverage ratio substantially exceeds typical regulatory comfort levels for parental guarantees in captive structures.

**Regulatory Concerns:**
1. **Enforceability:** If Liberty Re needed to draw on the guarantee to pay claims, Liberty Life Holdings' ability to fund $730M (2.6x net worth) is questionable
2. **Adequacy Under AG48:** Parental guarantees qualify as "Other Security," not "Primary Security," under AG48, and regulators increasingly scrutinize Other Security adequacy when guarantor net worth is substantially less than guarantee amount
3. **NAIC AG55 (2025):** NAIC adopted AG55 in 2025, strengthening asset adequacy testing requirements for life reinsurance treaties involving captive insurers and affiliated reinsurers, with focus on "asset-intensive reinsurance arrangements"

**Precedent:** The 2013-2014 "shadow insurance" regulatory wave resulted in multiple life insurers voluntarily increasing collateral or converting parental guarantees to letters of credit following state insurance department scrutiny. While no recent Vermont captive enforcement actions were identified (2020-2024), the regulatory framework has permanently shifted toward greater scrutiny.

### D. Recapture Risk Quantification and Financial Impact

#### 1. Recapture Probability Matrix

| Scenario | Trigger | Probability | Timeline |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **No Recapture (Status Quo)** | Nebraska DOI and Vermont DFR accept current structure | 55-60% | — |
| **AG48 Non-Compliance Forced Recapture** | Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit due to inadequate Primary Security | 10-15% | Q1-Q2 2025 (during due diligence) |
| **Parental Guarantee Inadequacy** | Nebraska DOI determines $730M guarantee insufficient given $280M guarantor net worth | 15-20% | Q1-Q2 2025 |
| **Vermont DFR Capital Requirement** | Vermont DFR requires Liberty Re capital increase, LLIC recaptures to avoid cost | 5-10% | 2026-2027 |
| **Voluntary Recapture (Long-Term)** | LLIC exercises contractual recapture right (post-2030, assuming 20-year initial term from 2010) | 30-40% | 2030-2035 |

**Near-Term Deal Risk:** Aggregate probability of forced recapture within transaction timeline (2025-2026): **25-35%**

**Long-Term Risk:** Including voluntary recapture scenarios, total exposure probability: **40-60%**

#### 2. Financial Impact on LLIC Statutory Surplus and RBC Ratio

**Recapture Accounting Mechanics:** When LLIC ceded $850M in reserves to Liberty Re, the transaction provided statutory surplus relief through a ceding commission (typically 12-18% of ceded reserves net after expenses). Upon recapture, LLIC must:
1. Re-establish $850M in reserves on statutory balance sheet (liability increase)
2. Return ceding commission previously received (asset decrease/surplus reduction)
3. Lose reserve credit (no longer reducing liabilities)

**Surplus Impact:** $120M-$180M reduction (15% of $850M ceded reserves, based on industry-standard ceding commission structures)

**RBC Ratio Impact:**

**Current LLIC Position:**
- Total Adjusted Capital (TAC): $1.85B
- Authorized Control Level (ACL): $982M
- RBC Ratio: 188% (TAC ÷ ACL)
- Status: Below 200% Company Action Level (CAL), RBC Plan required

**Scenario 1: Minimum Recapture Impact ($120M surplus reduction)**
- New TAC: $1.73B ($1.85B - $120M)
- New ACL: $1.10B ($982M + 12% increase for $850M reserves on balance sheet)
- **New RBC Ratio: 157%**
- Status: Below CAL, approaching 150% Regulatory Action Level (RAL)

**Scenario 2: Maximum Recapture Impact ($180M surplus reduction)**
- New TAC: $1.67B ($1.85B - $180M)
- New ACL: $1.10B
- **New RBC Ratio: 152%**
- Status: Dangerously close to 150% RAL (regulator may take control)

**NAIC RBC Action Levels:**
- 200%+ = Company Action Level — no regulatory action
- 150-200% = Company Action Level — requires RBC Plan
- 100-150% = Regulatory Action Level — regulator may take control
- 70-100% = Authorized Control Level — mandatory regulatory control

**Critical Finding:** Recapture would push LLIC to 152-157% RBC ratio, just 2-7 percentage points above the 150% RAL threshold where Nebraska DOI may seize control. This creates existential risk to the transaction.

#### 3. Combined Impact with Capital Deficiency (Deal-Blocking Analysis)

**Capital Injection Plan (from research-plan.md, T1):** LLIC requires $150M capital injection to raise RBC ratio from 188% to 204% (above 200% CAL threshold). This is a **condition precedent to closing**.

**Combined Recapture + Capital Injection Scenario:**

| Event Sequence | TAC | ACL | RBC Ratio | Status |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----------|--------|
| **Current State** | $1.85B | $982M | 188% | Below CAL, RBC Plan required |
| **After $150M Injection (Plan)** | $2.00B | $982M | 204% | Above CAL, RBC Plan approved ✓ |
| **If Recapture Pre-Injection** | $1.73B | $1.10B | 157% | Below CAL, approaching RAL ⚠ |
| **After Injection + Recapture** | $1.88B | $1.10B | 171% | Still below CAL, inadequate ✗ |
| **Required Total Injection** | $2.30B | $1.10B | 209% | Need **$420M** total (vs. $150M planned) |

**Deal Economics Impact:**

If recapture is forced during due diligence:
1. **Capital Injection Increase:** $150M planned → $420M required ($270M increase)
2. **Purchase Price Adjustment:** American Financial Holdings likely demands $120M-$180M reduction to offset surplus lost to recapture
3. **Deal Termination Risk:** Combined capital increase ($270M) + purchase price adjustment ($150M midpoint) = $420M negative impact may exceed acquirer's financing capacity or acceptable returns

**Probability-Weighted Exposure:**

| Scenario | Probability | Surplus Impact | Weighted Exposure |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| No Recapture | 55-60% | $0 | $0 |
| AG48 Forced Recapture | 10-15% | $120M-$180M | $15M-$27M |
| Guarantee Inadequacy | 15-20% | $120M-$180M | $21M-$36M |
| Vermont DFR Action | 5-10% | $120M-$180M | $6M-$18M |
| Voluntary (post-2030) | 30-40% | $120M-$180M | $36M-$72M |
| **Total Weighted** | — | — | **$78M-$153M** |

[METHODOLOGY: Expected value calculation = Σ(Probability × Impact) for each scenario]

### E. Compliance Remediation Options

#### Option 1: Enhanced Collateral via Letter of Credit (Preferred)

**Structure:**
- American Financial Holdings (post-acquisition parent) or Liberty Life Holdings posts $200M-$300M irrevocable letter of credit from investment-grade bank (e.g., JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo)
- LOC supplements existing $120M assets + $730M parental guarantee
- Total high-quality collateral: $320M-$420M
- Demonstrates enhanced Primary Security to Nebraska DOI and Vermont DFR

**Cost:** 1-2% annual LOC fees = $2M-$6M per year (present value: $20M-$60M over 10 years @ 6% discount rate)

**Benefits:**
- Maintains captive structure and associated tax benefits
- Preserves surplus relief from ceding commission
- Addresses AG48 Primary Security concerns
- Nebraska DOI comfort with bank-backed collateral

**Negotiation Point:** Seller indemnification vs. purchase price adjustment for LOC costs

#### Option 2: Novation to Traditional Authorized Reinsurer

**Structure:**
- Negotiate with Global Re Bermuda, Swiss Re, or Munich Re to assume Liberty Re's $850M ceded reserves
- Traditional reinsurer (rated A+ or better, authorized in Nebraska) eliminates unauthorized reinsurer collateral issues
- LLIC obtains full reserve credit without Primary Security requirements (authorized reinsurer benefits under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06)

**Cost:**
- Traditional reinsurers charge 10-15% higher premiums than captives (economic impact: $8.5M-$12.75M annually on $850M reserves)
- One-time novation fee: $5M-$10M
- Total present value: $85M-$140M over 10 years

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates all AG48 compliance risk
- Nebraska DOI comfort with rated authorized reinsurer
- No ongoing collateral management burden

**Drawbacks:**
- Loses captive tax benefits (Section 831(b) or consolidated return treatment)
- Higher ongoing reinsurance costs reduce LLIC profitability

#### Option 3: Partial Recapture with PBR Transition

**Structure:**
- Recapture policies eligible for VM-20 (issued post-January 1, 2020) where reserves under PBR < XXX/AXXX reserves
- Retain Liberty Re captive only for pre-2020 policies with significant reserve redundancy
- Reduces ceded reserves from $850M to $400M-$600M, lowering AG48 compliance burden

**Impact:**
- Moderate surplus impact: $50M-$80M (partial recapture of post-2020 business)
- Manageable with enhanced capital injection ($150M base + $50M-$80M = $200M-$230M total)
- Reduces ongoing compliance and regulatory scrutiny

**Strategic Benefit:**
- Aligns with industry future: PBR (mandatory since Jan. 1, 2020 for accredited states) eliminates need for captive reinsurance for new business
- Wind-down path for Liberty Re over 10-15 years as pre-2020 policies mature/lapse

Does Nebraska DOI defer to Vermont DFR as domiciliary regulator, or independently assess adequacy? | **MEDIUM** |

### G. Recommendations for Transaction Structuring

#### Pre-Closing Due Diligence (30-45 days)

**1. Regulatory Engagement**
- Schedule confidential consultations with Nebraska DOI Director of Insurance and Vermont DFR Captive Insurance Division
- Present Liberty Re structure and request preliminary assessment of AG48 compliance and parental guarantee adequacy
- Offer supplemental Form D filing with enhanced disclosures

**2. AG48 Actuarial Opinion**
- Retain independent qualified actuary to calculate Required Level of Primary Security
- Assess whether $120M qualifies as Primary Security (asset composition analysis)
- Evaluate sufficiency of $730M parental guarantee as Other Security
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks | **Cost:** $75K-$150K

**3. Treaty Documentation Review**
- Obtain and review all Liberty Re reinsurance treaties
- Map provisions to AG48 and Model #787 requirements
- Identify SSAP 61R risk transfer concerns (experience refunds, aggregate loss limits)
- Review Liberty Life Holdings' $730M guarantee terms and enforceability

#### Purchase Agreement Provisions

**1. Seller Representations and Warranties**
- All Liberty Re treaties comply with AG48 and Model #787
- Liberty Re holds adequate capital and collateral under AG48 Primary Security + Other Security requirements
- $730M parental guarantee is legally enforceable and sufficient
- No regulatory examination findings or concerns regarding Liberty Re in past 5 years

**2. Regulatory Approval Condition Precedent**
- Closing conditioned on Nebraska DOI written confirmation that reserve credit will not be disallowed post-closing
- If concerns expressed, seller must remediate (enhanced collateral, novation, or recapture) at seller's expense pre-closing

**3. Indemnification and Escrow**
- Seller indemnifies buyer for loss of reserve credit or forced recapture within 36 months post-closing
- Cap: $200M (covers surplus reduction + remediation costs)
- Survival: 36 months
- Escrow: $50M held for 36 months to secure captive-specific indemnity

**4. Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanism**
- Tier 1 (Enhanced collateral required): $10M-$15M reduction (present value of LOC costs)
- Tier 2 (Partial reserve credit disallowance): $100M-$150M reduction
- Tier 3 (Full recapture required): Walk-away right or $300M+ reduction

#### Risk-Adjusted Transaction Economics

**Base Case Purchase Price:** $2.9B

**Probability-Weighted Adjustment:** ($29M) based on:
- 55-60% probability: No captive issues ($0 adjustment)
- 25-30% probability: Enhanced collateral required (($12.5M) adjustment)
- 10-15% probability: Partial reserve credit disallowance (($125M) adjustment)
- 5-10% probability: Full recapture / deal termination

**Risk-Adjusted Price:** **$2.871B**

**Recommendation:** Negotiate $29M purchase price reduction or escrow reflecting probability-weighted risk, or secure seller agreement to remediate any captive issues at seller's expense prior to closing.

### H. Finding Confidence Levels

| No Vermont captive enforcement actions identified 2020-2024 | **MEDIUM** | Absence of evidence in WebSearch results; limited to publicly available information |

### I. Conclusion — Deal-Blocking Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Rating:** **CRITICAL — Potential Deal-Blocker**

**Key Determinant:** The Liberty Re captive structure's compliance with AG48 and Nebraska DOI reserve credit requirements cannot be verified without access to:
1. Liberty Re financial statements (asset composition, capital adequacy)
2. AG48 actuarial calculations (Required Level of Primary Security)
3. Reinsurance treaty terms (recapture provisions, experience refunds)
4. Liberty Life Holdings guarantee documentation (enforceability, security)

**Deal Viability Scenarios:**

| Outcome | Probability | Impact | Deal Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Status Quo Maintained** | 55-60% | No adjustment | ✓ Proceed |
| **Enhanced Collateral Required** | 25-30% | ($10M-$15M) | ✓ Proceed with adjustment |
| **Partial Reserve Disallowance** | 10-15% | ($100M-$150M) | ⚠ Major renegotiation |
| **Full Recapture Required** | 5-10% | ($300M+) or deal termination | ✗ Likely termination |

**Recommended Immediate Action:** Execute comprehensive regulatory due diligence within 30-45 days to assess AG48 compliance and regulatory acceptance. Depending on findings, implement remediation (enhanced collateral, novation, or partial recapture) or negotiate substantial purchase price adjustment/walk-away rights.

**Long-Term Strategic Consideration:** Even if Liberty Re structure is acceptable at closing, PBR (VM-20) has eliminated the economic rationale for captive reinsurance for post-2020 policies. American Financial Holdings should develop a 10-15 year wind-down plan for Liberty Re, transitioning to direct reserving under VM-20 as pre-2020 policies mature. This reduces long-term regulatory risk and aligns with industry transition away from captive financing structures.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. NAIC Actuarial Guidelines AG38 & AG48 Regulatory Framework

#### 1. Historical Context: The "Shadow Insurance" Controversy (2013-2014)

The regulatory framework governing Liberty Re Ltd.'s captive reinsurance arrangement emerged from a period of intense regulatory scrutiny beginning in 2013. The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) published a report in June 2013 titled *Shining a Light on Shadow Insurance: A Little-known Loophole That Puts Insurance Policyholders and Taxpayers at Greater Risk*, which characterized captive reinsurance transactions as involving "shell" corporations engaged in financial "alchemy" with little public disclosure to hide financial weakness and inflate capital ratios. [VERIFIED: NY DFS Report, June 2013]

**Scale of Shadow Insurance:** Research by Koijen and Yogo (2014) published through the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis documented that liabilities moved to "shadow reinsurers" (a subset of captives that are the least regulated and unrated by A.M. Best Company) grew from $11 billion in 2002 to $364 billion in 2012. Companies using shadow insurance moved 25 cents of every dollar insured to shadow reinsurers in 2012, up from 2 cents in 2002. [VERIFIED: Koijen & Yogo, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Economic Policy Paper 14-2, March 2014]

**NAIC Response:** Rather than imposing the "national moratorium" called for by DFS, the NAIC published *Captives and Special Purpose Vehicles: An NAIC White Paper* (June 6, 2013) and adopted a system of determining reserves known as "principle based reserving" (PBR), along with interim guidelines through AG38 and AG48. [VERIFIED: NAIC White Paper, June 2013]

#### 2. Actuarial Guideline 38 (AG38) - AXXX Reserves for Universal Life

**Adoption and Scope:** AG38, formally titled "The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation," became effective for new business dated January 1, 2013 and after. AG38 relates to universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees and increased reserve requirements significantly. [VERIFIED: NAIC AG38, effective Jan. 1, 2013]

**XXX vs. AXXX Terminology:**
- **XXX** denotes reserves prescribed by Regulation 147 (Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation, NAIC Model #830) for term life insurance
- **AXXX** denotes reserves prescribed by Section 7 of Model #830 and by AG38 for universal life insurance with secondary guarantees

**Redundant Reserve Concept:** AG38 reserves have been categorized as "redundant" based on their magnitude compared to reserves based on current economic assumptions. The new AG38 rules stipulated higher reserves for both new secondary guarantee UL policies and for in-force policies issued after July 1, 2005, creating a regulatory capital burden that life insurers increasingly addressed through captive reinsurance arrangements. [VERIFIED: American Academy of Actuaries, AG38 analysis]

**Liberty Re Context:** Liberty Re Ltd. was established in 2010 in Vermont, predating the 2013 AG38 effective date. The captive's $850M in ceded reserves includes AXXX reserves for universal life policies, likely written during the 2013-2024 period under AG38 requirements.

#### 3. Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG48) - Primary Security Requirements

**Adoption Timeline:**
- **December 2014:** AG48 adopted by NAIC Executive Committee and Plenary
- **January 1, 2015:** AG48 effective date for new XXX/AXXX reserve financing transactions
- **February 20, 2020:** AG48 revised by Life Actuarial (A) Task Force
- **July 10, 2020:** Revisions adopted by Life Insurance and Annuities (A) Committee (minor edits to align with Model #787)

[VERIFIED: NAIC AG48 adoption history, multiple sources]

**Purpose:** AG48 defines rules for new XXX and AXXX reserve financing transactions executed after January 1, 2015, establishing a consistent method for calculating the economic reserve (plus a margin for conservatism) and the level of "primary security" (higher quality assets), even when held at a captive reinsurer. [VERIFIED: NAIC Captive Insurance White Paper]

**Primary Security Definition and Requirements:**

AG48 introduced two critical security categories:

1. **Primary Security:** Higher-quality assets restricted to cash and Securities Valuation Office (SVO)-listed securities, excluding synthetic letters of credit. AG48 specifies the "Actuarial Method" used to calculate the "Required Level of Primary Security" (also called the "economic reserve layer").

2. **Other Security:** Includes surplus notes, parental guarantees, and other forms of credit support that do not meet Primary Security standards.

**Key Provisions:**
- Reserves in the primary layer are restricted to cash and SVO-listed securities
- Synthetic letters of credit are excluded from Primary Security
- Actuarial Method calculates Required Level of Primary Security (economic reserve + margin)
- Additional requirements for actuarial opinion and memorandum
- Prohibited practices identified to trigger regulatory scrutiny

[VERIFIED: NAIC AG48 text, actuary.org summary]

**Liberty Re Compliance Risk:** Liberty Re holds $120M in assets against $850M in ceded reserves, with the remaining $730M covered by a parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC (net worth $280M). This structure raises critical questions:

- Does the $120M qualify as "Primary Security" under AG48's restricted asset definition?
- Is the Required Level of Primary Security for $850M in AXXX/XXX reserves substantially higher than $120M?
- Does the $730M parental guarantee qualify as "Other Security," and is it adequate given Liberty Life Holdings' $280M net worth (guarantee is 2.6x net worth)?

#### 4. NAIC Model 787: Codification of AG48 into Model Regulation

**Adoption:** The Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation (#787) was adopted by the NAIC at the Summer National Meeting on August 27, 2016, then by the Financial Condition Committee on September 30, 2016, and finally by the Executive Committee and Plenary on December 13, 2016. Model #787 codifies AG48 into a model regulation for state adoption. [VERIFIED: NAIC Model #787 adoption timeline]

**Purpose:** Model #787 establishes uniform, national standards governing reserve financing arrangements pertaining to life insurance policies containing guaranteed nonlevel gross premiums, guaranteed nonlevel benefits, and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. It ensures that funds consisting of primary security and other security are held in the forms and amounts required. [VERIFIED: NAIC Model #787 Brief, December 2020]

**State Adoption Status (Critical for Liberty Re Compliance):**

As of latest NAIC data, **42 jurisdictions have implemented Model #787:** AL, AK, AZ, AR, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, FL, GA, HI, IN, IA, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MS, MO, MT, NV, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TX, USVI, UT, **VT**, VA, WA, WV, and WI.

**Nine (9) jurisdictions are relying on Actuarial Guideline 48:** ID, IL, KY, MN, **NE**, NH, NY, OH, and TN.

[VERIFIED: NAIC Model #787 State Adoption List, current as of 2024]

**Critical Finding for Liberty Re:**
- **Vermont (captive domicile):** Adopted Model #787
- **Nebraska (LLIC domicile, cedent):** Relying on AG48 (not Model #787)

This creates a **bifurcated regulatory framework** where:
1. Vermont DFR regulates Liberty Re under Model #787 requirements
2. Nebraska DOI evaluates LLIC's reserve credit under AG48 requirements
3. Both frameworks have similar substantive requirements but potentially different enforcement mechanisms

#### 5. Grandfathering Provisions and Pre-2015 Treaties

**AG48 Effective Date:** AG48 applies to "new XXX and AXXX reserve financing transactions executed after the effective date" of January 1, 2015. [VERIFIED: NAIC AG48 text]

**Liberty Re Timeline Analysis:**
- Liberty Re established: **2010** (pre-AG48)
- AG48 effective: **January 1, 2015**
- Question: Were Liberty Re's treaties executed pre-2015 and thus grandfathered, or were new treaties/amendments executed post-2015 subject to AG48?

**Grandfathering Limitation:** Even if original treaties were executed pre-2015, subsequent material amendments, novations, or increases in ceded reserves after January 1, 2015 may trigger AG48 compliance requirements. The research does not identify explicit "grandfathering exemption" language in AG48 or Model #787 that would permanently exempt pre-2015 treaties from compliance if materially modified.

**Risk Assessment:** [METHODOLOGY: Regulatory interpretation based on AG48 text and standard administrative law principles]
- If Liberty Re's current $850M in ceded reserves includes policies written or reserves increased after January 1, 2015, AG48 compliance is required
- If treaties were materially amended post-2015, grandfathering may not apply
- Probability that some portion of $850M is subject to AG48: **75-85%** (most term/UL policies have 10-30 year terms; a 2010 captive likely added new policies 2015-2024)

### B. Vermont Captive Insurance Regulatory Framework

#### 1. Vermont Statutes Title 8, Chapter 141 - Captive Insurance Companies

Vermont is the largest captive insurance domicile in the United States, with specialized legislation designed to facilitate captive operations while maintaining regulatory oversight. Liberty Re Ltd. operates under this framework as a Vermont-domiciled captive reinsurer.

**Statutory Authority:** Vermont Statutes Annotated Title 8, Chapter 141 (Captive Insurance Companies) and Chapter 142 provide the comprehensive regulatory framework. [VERIFIED: 8 V.S.A. §§ 6000-6092]

#### 2. Minimum Capital and Surplus Requirements (8 V.S.A. § 6004)

Vermont captive insurance companies must possess and maintain unimpaired paid-in capital and surplus as follows:

| Captive Type | Minimum Capital & Surplus |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Pure captive insurance company | $250,000 |
| Association captive insurance company | $500,000 |
| Industrial insured captive insurance company | $500,000 |
| Agency captive insurance company | $250,000 |
| Risk retention group | $1,000,000 |
| Sponsored captive insurance company | $100,000 |

[VERIFIED: 8 V.S.A. § 6004, Vermont DFR]

**Commissioner Discretion:** The Commissioner may prescribe additional capital and surplus based upon the type, volume, and nature of insurance business transacted. For life insurance captives reinsuring $850M in reserves (like Liberty Re), the Commissioner would likely require capital substantially exceeding statutory minimums.

**Form of Capital:** Capital and surplus may be in the form of:
1. Cash
2. Marketable securities (any investment or portfolio complying with investment restrictions applicable to traditional insurance companies under 8 V.S.A. §§ 3461-3472)
3. A trust approved by the Commissioner (Commissioner as sole beneficiary)
4. An irrevocable letter of credit issued by a Commissioner-approved bank

[VERIFIED: 8 V.S.A. § 6004, Vermont DFR guidance]

**Liberty Re Capital Assessment:** Liberty Re holds $120M in assets. Without access to Liberty Re's financial statements, we cannot confirm:
- What portion of $120M constitutes regulatory capital vs. reserves
- Whether capital meets Vermont minimum requirements (likely a higher threshold than $250K for a life reinsurance captive)
- Whether the $120M includes letters of credit or consists entirely of cash/marketable securities

#### 3. Regulation C-2006-02: Captive Insurance Companies Reinsuring Life Insurance Policies

**Purpose:** Vermont Regulation C-2006-02 establishes reserve requirements and annual reporting for captive insurance companies that reinsure life insurance policies, including term, universal, and variable life policies, and related guarantees and riders. [VERIFIED: Vermont Code of Regulations 21-020-057]

**Reserve Adequacy Standard:** A captive insurance company that reinsures life insurance policies must maintain reserves that are **actuarially sufficient to support the liabilities incurred** by the captive insurance company in reinsuring life insurance policies. [VERIFIED: Regulation C-2006-02]

**Application to Liberty Re:** The $850M in ceded reserves must be supported by actuarially sufficient assets and capital at Liberty Re. The current structure ($120M assets + $730M parental guarantee) raises the question: Does Vermont DFR consider the parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings ($280M net worth) as "actuarially sufficient" to support a $730M guarantee (2.6x net worth ratio)?

**Annual Reporting:** Regulation C-2006-02 mandates annual financial reporting to Vermont DFR for fiscal years ending on and after December 31, 2005. Liberty Re must file annual statements demonstrating reserve adequacy.

#### 4. Special Purpose Financial Captive (SPFC) Classification

Vermont established requirements for special purpose financial insurance companies (SPFCs) to facilitate securitization transactions and other risk financing structures, including financing XXX and AXXX reserve requirements. [VERIFIED: Vermont DFR guidance]

**SPFC vs. Traditional Captive:** Research does not definitively establish whether Liberty Re is classified as an SPFC or traditional captive. Key differences:

| Feature | Traditional Captive | Special Purpose Financial Captive |
|---------|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Purpose | General captive insurance | Securitization/structured finance |
| Minimum Capital | $250K-$1M (type-dependent) | Potentially different standards |
| Regulation | Chapter 141 | Chapter 141 with SPFC provisions |
| Tax Treatment | Potentially consolidated | Often separate treatment |

**Tax Implications:** Special purpose financial captives under common ownership and control are taxed as though they were a single captive insurance company, but may not be consolidated with other captives that are not SPFCs for premium tax purposes. [VERIFIED: Vermont captive tax guidance]

**Liberty Re Classification Risk:** If Liberty Re is classified as an SPFC, additional regulatory scrutiny may apply to the adequacy of the $730M parental guarantee, particularly given the guarantee-to-net-worth ratio of 2.6x.

#### 5. Vermont DFR Examination Authority

Vermont DFR has authority to examine captive insurance companies to ensure compliance with Chapter 141 and related regulations. While no recent enforcement actions against life insurance captives were identified in this research, Vermont DFR has general authority to:
- Require additional capital if existing capital/surplus is inadequate
- Disapprove reinsurance arrangements that do not meet actuarial sufficiency standards
- Coordinate with other state insurance departments (including Nebraska DOI) on captive oversight

[VERIFIED: 8 V.S.A. Chapter 141 examination provisions]

#### 6. NAIC Accreditation and Interstate Recognition

**Vermont NAIC Accreditation Status:** Vermont is an NAIC-accredited jurisdiction, which is critical for interstate recognition of Vermont captive reinsurance. NAIC accreditation requires states to meet financial solvency standards, including examination procedures and reserve adequacy requirements. [VERIFIED: NAIC accreditation list]

**Implications for Liberty Re:** Nebraska DOI's willingness to grant LLIC statutory reserve credit for reinsurance ceded to Liberty Re depends in part on Vermont's NAIC accreditation status. If Vermont were to lose accreditation or if Vermont DFR were to determine Liberty Re's reserves inadequate, Nebraska DOI could disallow reserve credit.

### C. Nebraska Credit for Reinsurance Requirements

#### 1. Nebraska Revised Statutes § 44-416.06 - Credit for Reinsurance

**Statutory Framework:** Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed to a domestic ceding insurer (LLIC) as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded **only when the reinsurer meets specific requirements** and any additional requirements in rules and regulations adopted by the Director of Insurance. [VERIFIED: Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06]

**Critical Language:** The statute conditions reserve credit on the reinsurer meeting requirements "which relate to the valuation of assets or reserve credits, the amount and form of security supporting reinsurance arrangements, or circumstances under which credit will be reduced or eliminated."

This provides Nebraska DOI with broad discretion to evaluate Liberty Re's adequacy and potentially disallow or reduce reserve credit if the $730M parental guarantee is deemed insufficient.

#### 2. Unauthorized Reinsurer Collateral Requirements

Liberty Re Ltd. is a Vermont-domiciled captive, not licensed in Nebraska, making it an **unauthorized reinsurer** for purposes of Nebraska law. For unauthorized reinsurers, Nebraska offers several pathways to obtain reserve credit:

**Pathway 1: Certified Reinsurer**
- Any unauthorized assuming insurer may qualify as a Certified Reinsurer under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06 and Title 210 Nebraska Admin. Code, Chapter 65 § 008
- Depending on financial strength rating granted by the Director, a Certified Reinsurer may be allowed to post **less than 100% collateral** and still enable LLIC to qualify for full reserve credit
- Typical collateral reduction: 10% for "Secure-1" rating up to 75% for "Secure-5" rating

[VERIFIED: Nebraska DOI Reinsurance Information guidance]

**Pathway 2: Trust Fund**
- Credit allowed when reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a **trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution** for payment of valid claims of its U.S. cedents
- Trust must comply with NAIC Appendix A-785 requirements (referenced in statutory accounting guidance)

[VERIFIED: Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06, SSAP 61R Appendix A-785]

**Pathway 3: Reciprocal Jurisdiction Reinsurer**
- Eliminates reinsurance collateral requirements for reinsurers meeting Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06(7) reciprocal jurisdiction requirements
- Vermont captives may not qualify for reciprocal jurisdiction status (typically applies to EU/UK reinsurers under covered agreements)

**Liberty Re Current Structure:** Research does not establish which pathway Liberty Re uses to obtain Nebraska reserve credit. Key questions:
- Is Liberty Re a Certified Reinsurer in Nebraska? (No public information found)
- Does the $120M in Liberty Re assets constitute an A-785 compliant trust?
- Is the $730M parental guarantee acceptable collateral under Nebraska regulations?

#### 3. Form D Prior Notification Requirements

**Nebraska Holding Company Act:** Nebraska Admin. Code Title 210, Chapter 24, Form D requires prior notification of material transactions involving a domestic insurer (LLIC) and any person in its insurance holding company system. [VERIFIED: Neb. Admin. Code 210, Ch. 24, Form D]

**Reinsurance Agreement Thresholds:**
- No notice required for reinsurance agreements or modifications if the reinsurance premium or change in insurer's liabilities in any of the next three years is **less than 5% of the insurer's surplus**
- However, notice **shall be given for all reinsurance pooling agreements** including modifications

**Liberty Re Materiality:** LLIC's statutory surplus is $1.85B. The $850M in ceded reserves represents **46% of surplus**, far exceeding the 5% threshold. LLIC would have been required to file Form D when establishing or materially amending treaties with Liberty Re.

**Significance:** Nebraska DOI had advance notice of the Liberty Re captive arrangement and opportunity to review the structure. However, this does not preclude Nebraska DOI from subsequently determining the arrangement inadequate, particularly if AG48 compliance issues arise.

#### 4. Nebraska DOI Authority to Disallow Reserve Credit

**Regulatory Discretion:** Under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06, the Director of Insurance may adopt rules and regulations relating to "circumstances under which credit will be reduced or eliminated." This grants Nebraska DOI authority to disallow reserve credit if:
- Vermont DFR determines Liberty Re's reserves inadequate
- AG48 compliance gaps are identified
- The $730M parental guarantee is deemed insufficient given Liberty Life Holdings' $280M net worth
- NAIC guidance or model law changes recommend stricter captive oversight

**Precedent for Disallowance:** The "shadow insurance" controversy of 2013-2014 and adoption of AG48 demonstrate that state insurance departments have reasserted oversight of captive reinsurance arrangements previously approved. Nebraska DOI could revisit the Liberty Re arrangement even if initially approved.

**Market Conduct Exam Context:** The research plan indicates Nebraska DOI is conducting a 2024 market conduct exam of LLIC. If the exam includes review of reinsurance arrangements (as comprehensive exams often do), Nebraska DOI may scrutinize the Liberty Re captive structure as part of the exam.

[METHODOLOGY: Regulatory authority analysis based on statute text and administrative law principles]

### D. Statutory Accounting Principles (SSAP 61R) and Reserve Credit

#### 1. SSAP No. 61R - Life, Deposit-Type and Accident and Health Reinsurance

**Purpose:** SSAP No. 61R provides statutory accounting guidance for life and health reinsurance agreements, including when a ceding insurer (LLIC) may take reserve credit for ceded reserves. [VERIFIED: NAIC Accounting Practices Manual, SSAP 61R]

**Risk Transfer Requirement:** SSAP No. 61R, supported by Appendix A-791, establishes criteria for when a reinsurance contract qualifies for reserve credit vs. deposit accounting. **Sufficient insurance risk must be transferred** before reserve credit can be recognized. Contracts lacking sufficient risk transfer must use deposit accounting (no reserve credit).

**2024 Revisions - Combination Reinsurance Contracts:** NAIC Statutory Accounting Principles Working Group (SAPWG) adopted revisions to SSAP No. 61R in 2024 addressing combination reinsurance contracts (e.g., coinsurance + YRT with aggregate experience refund). Key principle: **When treaties involve interdependent types of reinsurance, risk transfer must be evaluated in the aggregate**, not separately. [VERIFIED: NAIC SAPWG adoptions, November 17, 2024]

**Liberty Re Implication:** If Liberty Re's treaties include experience refunds or profit-sharing provisions tied to aggregate performance across multiple policy types (term + UL), SSAP 61R's 2024 revisions require aggregate risk transfer analysis. This could affect whether LLIC's reserve credit is appropriate under statutory accounting principles.

#### 2. Collateral and Admissibility Requirements

**A-785 Compliant Trusts:** SSAP No. 61R provides that reinsurance recoverables secured by collateral in an A-785 compliant trust are admitted assets. Reinsurance recoverable for unpaid claims collateralized by assets held in a trust complying with Appendix A-785 requirements would be admitted **to the extent amounts are not in dispute**. [VERIFIED: SSAP 61R, paragraph guidance]

**Impairment Requirements:** SSAP No. 61R paragraph 42 requires impairment of uncollectible reinsurance in accordance with SSAP No. 5R. All other reinsurance recoverable amounts must be **nonadmitted until payment has been received**, including amounts that are either:
- In dispute, or
- Not secured by assets held in an A-785 compliant trust

**Liberty Re Risk:** If the $730M parental guarantee does not qualify as A-785 compliant trust collateral, LLIC may be required to nonadmit a portion of the reinsurance recoverable, reducing admitted assets and statutory surplus.

#### 3. Primary Security vs. Other Security Distinction

SSAP 61R, when read in conjunction with AG48 and Model #787, recognizes the distinction between:
- **Primary Security:** High-quality assets (cash, SVO-listed securities) up to the Required Level of Primary Security
- **Other Security:** Surplus notes, parental guarantees, letters of credit beyond the primary layer

**Accounting Treatment:** While both Primary Security and Other Security support reserve credit, regulators increasingly scrutinize Other Security (like parental guarantees) for adequacy, particularly when the guarantor's net worth is substantially less than the guarantee amount.

**Liberty Life Holdings Guarantee Adequacy:** The $730M guarantee represents **2.6x Liberty Life Holdings' $280M net worth**. This ratio raises questions about enforceability and sufficiency if Liberty Re needed to draw on the guarantee to pay claims.

---

### E. Recapture Risk Quantification and Financial Impact

#### 1. Recapture Mechanics and Triggers

**Recapture Definition:** Recapture is a bargained-for right in a life reinsurance treaty where the cedent (LLIC) can take back from the reinsurer (Liberty Re) all like risks after a specified length of time has elapsed. Recapture refers to the process by which a ceding company takes back a risk or risks that previously were ceded to a reinsurer. [VERIFIED: ARIAS Mastering Life Reinsurance Guide]

**Voluntary vs. Forced Recapture:**

An important regulatory distinction exists:

- **Voluntary Recapture:** Cedent exercises contractual recapture provisions at its discretion (typically after 10-20 years)
- **Forced Recapture:** Regulatory or contractual triggers require recapture

**Critical Rule:** Recapture must be **voluntary** on the part of the cedent; otherwise, reinsurance treatment—rather than deposit accounting—will not be allowed as to the cedent's financial statements. Forced or mandatory recapture is prohibited by the terms of the NAIC Model Life and Health Reinsurance. [VERIFIED: PwC SAP for Reinsurance, NAIC Model Law]

**Regulatory Triggers for Forced Recapture:**

While technically prohibited, regulators can achieve the same practical effect through other mechanisms:
1. **Disallowing reserve credit** under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-416.06 (Nebraska DOI determines collateral inadequate)
2. **Requiring deposit accounting** under SSAP 61R (insufficient risk transfer)
3. **Mandating capital injection** to offset disallowed reserve credit (effectively negating the benefit of ceding reserves)

**Liberty Re Recapture Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Trigger | Probability | Timeline |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Voluntary Recapture** | LLIC exercises contractual right (post-2030 assuming 20-year initial term from 2010) | 30-40% | 2030-2035 |
| **AG48 Non-Compliance Forced Recapture** | Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit due to inadequate Primary Security | 10-15% | 2025-2026 (within transaction due diligence) |
| **Parental Guarantee Inadequacy** | Nebraska DOI determines $730M guarantee from $280M net worth entity insufficient | 15-20% | 2025-2026 |
| **Vermont DFR Action** | Vermont DFR requires Liberty Re to increase capital/collateral, LLIC recaptures to avoid cost | 5-10% | 2026-2027 |

[METHODOLOGY: Probability estimates based on regulatory framework analysis, historical "shadow insurance" enforcement patterns 2013-2015, and adequacy of Liberty Life Holdings guarantee]

#### 2. Financial Impact of Recapture on LLIC Statutory Surplus

**Accounting Mechanics:** When LLIC originally ceded $850M in reserves to Liberty Re, the transaction provided statutory surplus relief:
- LLIC removed $850M in XXX/AXXX reserves from its statutory balance sheet
- Liberty Re paid a ceding commission (typically 85-95% of reserves for coinsurance)
- LLIC's statutory surplus increased by the ceding commission amount
- LLIC recognized reserve credit (reduction in liabilities) of $850M

**Recapture Reversal:** If LLIC recaptures the $850M in reserves, the transaction reverses:
1. LLIC must **re-establish $850M in reserves** on its statutory balance sheet (liability increase)
2. LLIC must **return the ceding commission** previously received (asset decrease or surplus reduction)
3. LLIC loses the **reserve credit** (no longer reducing liabilities)

**Surplus Impact Calculation:**

From research, a surplus relief transaction typically increases statutory surplus by 12-18% of ceded reserves (the ceding commission minus expenses). For $850M in ceded reserves:

| Component | Amount | Basis |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Ceded Reserves | $850M | Given in research plan |
| Estimated Ceding Commission (15% net) | $127.5M | Industry standard 85-95% gross, ~15% net surplus benefit |
| Statutory Surplus Reduction (Recapture) | **($120M - $180M)** | Range reflects uncertainty in actual ceding commission structure |

[VERIFIED: SOA Reinsurance Section News, industry standards; METHODOLOGY: Ceding commission estimate based on typical coinsurance structures]

**RBC Ratio Impact:**

Current LLIC position (from research plan):
- Total Adjusted Capital (TAC): $1.85B statutory surplus
- Authorized Control Level (ACL): $982M
- RBC Ratio: 188% (TAC ÷ ACL)

**Scenario 1: Minimum Recapture Impact ($120M surplus reduction)**
- New TAC: $1.85B - $120M = $1.73B
- New ACL: $982M + increased RBC charges for $850M reserves on balance sheet ≈ $1.10B (12% increase)
- **New RBC Ratio: 157%** (down from 188%)

**Scenario 2: Maximum Recapture Impact ($180M surplus reduction)**
- New TAC: $1.85B - $180M = $1.67B
- New ACL: $982M + $118M ≈ $1.10B
- **New RBC Ratio: 152%** (down from 188%)

**Regulatory Action Thresholds:**
- 200%+ = Company Action Level (CAL) - no regulatory action
- 150-200% = Company Action Level - requires RBC Plan
- 100-150% = Regulatory Action Level (RAL) - regulator may take control
- 70-100% = Authorized Control Level (ACL) - mandatory regulatory control

[VERIFIED: NAIC RBC Model Act action levels]

**Critical Finding:** Recapture would push LLIC's RBC ratio dangerously close to the 150% Regulatory Action Level, potentially triggering Nebraska DOI control. Combined with the existing $150M capital injection requirement (which increases RBC ratio to 204%), recapture would **negate the planned capital raise** and potentially require an additional $300M-$400M capital injection.

#### 3. Combined Impact with Existing Capital Deficiency

**Capital Injection Plan (T1 Research):** Research plan indicates LLIC requires a $150M capital injection to raise RBC ratio from 188% to 204% (above the 200% Company Action Level).

**Combined Recapture + Capital Injection Scenario:**

| Event Sequence | TAC | ACL | RBC Ratio | Regulatory Status |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----------|-------------------|
| **Current State** | $1.85B | $982M | 188% | Below CAL (200%), RBC Plan required |
| **After $150M Capital Injection (Plan)** | $2.00B | $982M | 204% | Above CAL, RBC Plan approved |
| **If Recapture Occurs Pre-Injection** | $1.73B (min) | $1.10B | 157% | Below CAL, approaching RAL |
| **After Injection + Recapture** | $1.88B | $1.10B | 171% | Below CAL, inadequate capital |
| **Required Additional Injection** | $2.30B+ | $1.10B | 209% | Need $420M total injection |

[METHODOLOGY: RBC calculation modeling based on NAIC formulas, estimated ACL increase from reserve recapture]

**Deal-Blocking Analysis:**

If Nebraska DOI disallows Liberty Re reserve credit during the acquisition due diligence period (Q1-Q2 2025), the financial impact becomes:

1. **Immediate Capital Need:** $150M (planned) + $270M (recapture offset) = **$420M total capital injection**
2. **Purchase Price Adjustment:** American Financial Holdings would likely demand purchase price reduction of $120M-$180M to offset surplus lost to recapture
3. **Deal Termination Risk:** If combined capital requirement exceeds acquirer's financing capacity or deal economics become unattractive

**Probability-Weighted Exposure:**

| Scenario | Probability | Surplus Impact | Weighted Exposure |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| No Recapture (status quo maintained) | 55-60% | $0 | $0 |
| AG48 Compliance Forced Recapture | 10-15% | $120M-$180M | $15M-$27M |
| Parental Guarantee Inadequacy Recapture | 15-20% | $120M-$180M | $21M-$36M |
| Voluntary Recapture (post-2030) | 30-40% | $120M-$180M | $36M-$72M |
| **Total Weighted Exposure** | — | — | **$72M-$135M** |

[METHODOLOGY: Probability-weighted expected value calculation]

#### 4. Precedent Transactions and Regulatory Enforcement

**Shadow Insurance Enforcement Wave (2013-2015):**

Following the New York DFS "Shining a Light on Shadow Insurance" report (June 2013), several state insurance departments increased scrutiny of captive reinsurance arrangements:

- Multiple life insurers negotiated consent orders with state regulators
- Some insurers voluntarily increased collateral or converted parental guarantees to letters of credit
- NAIC adopted AG48 (effective Jan. 1, 2015) to standardize Primary Security requirements

[VERIFIED: NY DFS Report June 2013, NAIC AG48 adoption history]

**Recent Regulatory Trends:**

No specific enforcement actions against Vermont life insurance captives were identified in 2020-2024 research. However:

- NAIC adopted AG55 in 2025, strengthening asset adequacy testing requirements for life reinsurance treaties involving captive insurers
- Continued focus on "asset-intensive reinsurance arrangements" and transparency requirements
- Vermont DFR maintains active examination program for captive insurers

[VERIFIED: NAIC AG55 adoption 2025, Vermont DFR regulatory guidance]

**Implications for Liberty Re:** While no recent enforcement wave is evident, the regulatory framework has permanently shifted toward greater scrutiny of captive arrangements. Nebraska DOI has authority and precedent to require enhanced collateral or disallow reserve credit if Liberty Re's structure is deemed non-compliant with AG48 or inadequately collateralized.

### F. Principle-Based Reserving (PBR) and Future of Captive Reinsurance

#### 1. VM-20 Implementation and Impact

**Background:** The NAIC adopted Principle-Based Reserving (PBR) through the Valuation Manual (VM-20) to address the reserve redundancies that created the incentive for XXX/AXXX captive reinsurance arrangements. PBR became **mandatory for NAIC-accredited states as of January 1, 2020**. [VERIFIED: NAIC PBR implementation timeline]

**Purpose:** PBR replaces formulaic reserve calculations (XXX/AXXX) with principle-based calculations using company-specific assumptions and stress testing. Studies suggest that PBR would likely **significantly reduce reported reserves** for certain products for which current requirements exceed economic reserves. [VERIFIED: SOA VM-20 Practice Note]

**Impact on Captive Reinsurance Incentive:**

The implementation of PBR has **substantially reduced the incentive for captive reserve financing transactions**. For new policies issued after January 1, 2020, PBR eliminates the "redundant reserve" problem that captive arrangements were designed to address. [VERIFIED: Harrington Economics and Regulation of Captive Reinsurance 2015, NAIC guidance]

**Liberty Re Implications:**

| Policy Issue Period | Reserve Methodology | Captive Reinsurance Need |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Pre-2020 (XXX/AXXX applies) | Formulaic high reserves | High incentive for captive |
| Post-2020 (VM-20 applies) | Principle-based economic reserves | Low/no incentive for captive |

Liberty Re's $850M in ceded reserves likely consists primarily of **pre-2020 policies** subject to XXX/AXXX requirements. As these policies mature or lapse, and as new business is written under PBR (VM-20), the economic rationale for maintaining Liberty Re as a captive reinsurer diminishes.

**Strategic Question for Acquirer:** Does American Financial Holdings intend to continue the Liberty Re captive structure post-acquisition, or transition to traditional reinsurance/no reinsurance for new business under PBR? This affects long-term transaction economics.

#### 2. AG48 and VM-20 Interaction

**AG48 Calculations Under VM-20:** Under AG48, term and universal life writers that utilize XXX or AXXX captive reinsurance arrangements have been required to perform **PBR calculations to determine the amount of Primary Security** to be held. After VM-20 became effective, AG48 calculations must **include reinsurance**. [VERIFIED: SOA Reinsurance Considerations in PBR]

**Implication:** Even for pre-2020 policies, LLIC may be required to perform VM-20 calculations to determine the Required Level of Primary Security under AG48. This could reveal that Liberty Re's $120M in assets is insufficient Primary Security, triggering compliance issues.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Critical Risk Summary

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Potential Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **AG48 Primary Security Deficiency** | **CRITICAL** | 25-35% | $120M-$180M surplus reduction + $270M-$420M additional capital | Enhanced collateral/LOC, AG48 compliance certification |
| **Parental Guarantee Inadequacy (2.6x net worth)** | **HIGH** | 30-40% | $730M guarantee enforceability questions, potential reserve credit disallowance | Strengthen guarantee, third-party LOC, novate to traditional reinsurer |
| **Nebraska DOI Reserve Credit Disallowance** | **CRITICAL** | 10-15% (near-term) | $850M reserve recapture, RBC ratio decline to 152-157% (approaching RAL 150%) | Proactive regulatory engagement, Form D supplemental filing, AG48 remediation |
| **Vermont DFR Capital Adequacy Review** | **MEDIUM** | 15-20% | Vermont DFR requires Liberty Re capital increase, indirectly triggering LLIC costs | Vermont DFR pre-transaction consultation, demonstrate actuarial sufficiency |
| **SSAP 61R Risk Transfer Analysis (2024 revisions)** | **MEDIUM** | 20-25% | If treaties lack sufficient risk transfer, deposit accounting required (no reserve credit) | Actuarial analysis of risk transfer under 2024 SSAP 61R combination contract rules |
| **Voluntary Recapture (Post-2030)** | **MEDIUM** | 30-40% (long-term) | $120M-$180M surplus impact when recapture exercised | Financial planning for recapture, transition strategy to traditional reinsurance |
| **Multi-State Regulatory Coordination** | **LOW** | 10-15% | Vermont-Nebraska disagreement on adequacy standards, conflicting directives | Unified regulatory strategy, engage both DOIs simultaneously |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Immediate Investigation

1. **Liberty Re Financial Statements:** Obtain Liberty Re's 2022-2024 annual financial statements filed with Vermont DFR to determine:
   - Actual capital and surplus (vs. $120M assets figure)
   - Composition of $120M assets (cash, SVO-listed securities, or other)
   - Whether $120M qualifies as AG48 "Primary Security"
   - Asset Valuation Reserve (AVR) and other statutory accounting details

2. **Reinsurance Treaty Terms:** Review Liberty Re reinsurance treaties with LLIC for:
   - Recapture provisions (timing, conditions, notice requirements)
   - Experience refund provisions (does aggregate experience refund trigger SSAP 61R 2024 combination contract analysis?)
   - Collateral requirements and parental guarantee terms
   - AG48 compliance certifications or actuarial opinions

3. **Nebraska DOI Form D Filings:** Obtain LLIC's Form D prior notification filings to Nebraska DOI for Liberty Re transactions:
   - When were treaties established or materially amended?
   - Did Nebraska DOI approve the $730M parental guarantee structure?
   - Any conditions or concerns expressed by Nebraska DOI in approval letters?

4. **Parental Guarantee Documentation:** Review Liberty Life Holdings LLC's $730M guarantee:
   - Terms and conditions of guarantee
   - Triggers for calling the guarantee
   - Subordination provisions
   - Whether guarantee is secured by specific assets or unsecured
   - Financial covenant requirements

5. **AG48 Actuarial Opinion:** Determine whether LLIC has obtained an AG48 actuarial opinion certifying:
   - Required Level of Primary Security calculation
   - Adequacy of $120M Primary Security
   - Sufficiency of $730M Other Security (parental guarantee)

### C. Potential Deal Impact Scenarios

**Scenario A: Best Case (55-60% Probability)**
- Nebraska DOI and Vermont DFR accept current Liberty Re structure
- No immediate AG48 compliance issues identified
- $150M capital injection proceeds as planned, RBC ratio reaches 204%
- Deal closes without captive-related purchase price adjustment
- **Action:** Monitor post-closing for future PBR transition, voluntary recapture planning

**Scenario B: Enhanced Collateral Required (25-30% Probability)**
- Nebraska DOI requires enhanced collateral (e.g., LOC) to supplement parental guarantee
- Liberty Life Holdings or American Financial Holdings posts additional $200M-$300M LOC
- $150M capital injection proceeds, augmented by collateral requirement
- **Purchase Price Impact:** $10M-$15M (cost of LOC arrangement, legal fees)
- **Action:** Negotiate which party bears LOC cost (seller indemnification vs. purchase price adjustment)

**Scenario C: Partial Reserve Credit Disallowance (10-15% Probability)**
- Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit for portion of $850M not supported by adequate Primary Security
- LLIC must establish additional $300M-$500M reserves on balance sheet
- RBC ratio declines to 165-175% even with $150M injection
- Requires additional capital injection or restructuring
- **Purchase Price Impact:** $100M-$150M reduction or deal termination
- **Action:** Pre-closing remediation (enhance collateral, novate to traditional reinsurer) or walk-away rights

**Scenario D: Full Recapture Required (5-10% Probability) - DEAL-BLOCKING**
- Nebraska DOI or Vermont DFR determines Liberty Re structure fundamentally non-compliant with AG48
- Full $850M reserve recapture required
- LLIC statutory surplus reduced by $120M-$180M
- RBC ratio declines to 152-157% (approaching Regulatory Action Level)
- Total capital injection requirement: $420M (far exceeds planned $150M)
- **Deal Outcome:** Likely termination or major restructuring ($300M+ purchase price reduction)
- **Action:** Immediate regulatory engagement to assess feasibility of remediation vs. deal termination

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Key Findings

1. **Bifurcated Regulatory Framework:** Liberty Re operates under a complex dual regulatory structure with Vermont DFR (captive domicile, Model #787) and Nebraska DOI (cedent domicile, AG48). Both jurisdictions have authority to scrutinize the arrangement.

2. **AG48 Compliance Uncertainty:** Liberty Re's $120M in assets supporting $850M in ceded reserves raises questions about whether the Required Level of Primary Security under AG48 is met. Without access to AG48 actuarial calculations, compliance cannot be verified.

3. **Parental Guarantee Structural Weakness:** The $730M parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC (net worth $280M) represents a 2.6x leverage ratio, substantially exceeding typical regulatory comfort levels. This "Other Security" may be deemed inadequate by Nebraska DOI.

4. **Material Financial Impact:** If recapture is forced during the transaction, LLIC's statutory surplus would decline by $120M-$180M, and RBC ratio would fall to 152-157%, dangerously close to the 150% Regulatory Action Level. Combined with the existing RBC deficiency, total capital injection requirements could reach $420M (vs. planned $150M).

5. **Probability-Weighted Risk:** The aggregate probability of forced or required recapture within the transaction timeline (2025-2026) is 25-35%, with weighted financial exposure of $72M-$135M. Including longer-term voluntary recapture scenarios, total exposure probability rises to 40-60%.

6. **No Recent Enforcement Precedent, But Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny:** While Vermont DFR enforcement actions against life insurance captives were not identified in 2020-2024, NAIC's adoption of AG55 (2025) and continued focus on asset-intensive reinsurance indicate ongoing regulatory attention.

### B. Recommended Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing Due Diligence)

#### 1. Regulatory Due Diligence (Timeline: 30-45 days)

**Action 1.1 - Nebraska DOI Proactive Engagement**
- Schedule confidential consultation with Nebraska DOI Director of Insurance
- Present Liberty Re structure and request preliminary assessment of:
  - AG48 compliance adequacy
  - Acceptability of parental guarantee structure
  - Whether reserve credit could be disallowed pre-closing or post-acquisition
- Offer to provide supplemental Form D filing with enhanced disclosures

**Action 1.2 - Vermont DFR Coordination**
- Engage Vermont DFR Captive Insurance Division for consultation
- Request confirmation that Liberty Re's capital and collateral meet Vermont standards
- Inquire whether Vermont DFR has concerns about adequacy of Liberty Life Holdings guarantee
- Coordinate timing with Nebraska DOI engagement (present unified regulatory strategy)

**Action 1.3 - Obtain AG48 Actuarial Opinion**
- Retain qualified independent actuary to perform AG48 compliance analysis:
  - Calculate Required Level of Primary Security for $850M ceded reserves
  - Assess whether $120M qualifies as Primary Security (asset composition analysis)
  - Evaluate sufficiency of $730M parental guarantee as Other Security
  - Provide written opinion for presentation to Nebraska DOI and Vermont DFR
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for actuarial analysis
- **Cost:** $75K-$150K for independent actuarial opinion

#### 2. Treaty and Collateral Documentation Review (Timeline: 15-30 days)

**Action 2.1 - Reinsurance Treaty Terms Audit**
- Obtain and review all Liberty Re reinsurance treaties with LLIC
- Map treaty provisions to AG48 and Model #787 requirements
- Identify any provisions that could trigger SSAP 61R risk transfer concerns (e.g., experience refunds, aggregate loss limits)
- Determine recapture provisions and timing

**Action 2.2 - Parental Guarantee Legal Review**
- Engage insurance regulatory counsel to review Liberty Life Holdings' $730M guarantee
- Assess enforceability under Nebraska and Vermont law
- Determine whether guarantee meets regulatory standards for "Other Security"
- Evaluate strengthening options (pledge of specific assets, junior subordinated notes, etc.)

**Action 2.3 - Liberty Re Financial Statement Analysis**
- Obtain Liberty Re's annual statements (2022-2024) from Vermont DFR public records
- Analyze asset composition, capital adequacy, and reserve adequacy
- Compare to AG48 and Model #787 requirements

#### 3. Transaction Structure Alternatives (Timeline: 30-60 days to execute)

**Option A: Enhanced Collateral (Preferred if moderate compliance gap)**
- American Financial Holdings (post-acquisition parent) issues $200M-$300M irrevocable letter of credit from investment-grade bank
- LOC supplements Liberty Life Holdings guarantee, bringing total high-quality collateral to $320M-$420M
- Demonstrates enhanced Primary Security to Nebraska DOI and Vermont DFR
- **Cost:** 1-2% annual LOC fees = $2M-$6M per year
- **Benefit:** Maintains captive structure, preserves tax benefits, addresses regulatory concerns

**Option B: Novation to Traditional Reinsurer (if significant compliance gap)**
- Negotiate with Global Re Bermuda, Swiss Re, or Munich Re to assume Liberty Re's $850M ceded reserves
- Traditional reinsurer (rated A+ or better, authorized) eliminates unauthorized reinsurer collateral issues
- LLIC obtains full reserve credit without Primary Security requirements
- **Cost:** Higher reinsurance premiums (traditional reinsurers charge 10-15% more than captives), one-time novation fee $5M-$10M
- **Benefit:** Eliminates all AG48 compliance risk, Nebraska DOI comfort with rated authorized reinsurer
- **Drawback:** Loses captive tax benefits and surplus relief structure

**Option C: Partial Recapture with PBR Transition (strategic long-term option)**
- Recapture policies eligible for VM-20 (post-January 1, 2020 issue date) where reserves under PBR < XXX/AXXX reserves
- Retain captive only for pre-2020 policies with significant reserve redundancy
- Reduces ceded reserves to $400M-$600M, lowering AG48 compliance burden
- **Impact:** Moderate surplus impact ($50M-$80M), manageable with enhanced capital injection
- **Benefit:** Aligns with future of industry (PBR eliminates captive need), reduces long-term regulatory risk

#### 4. Purchase Agreement Provisions (Legal Due Diligence)

**Recommendation 4.1 - Seller Representations and Warranties**

Add specific representations regarding Liberty Re:
- All reinsurance treaties with Liberty Re comply with AG48 and Model #787
- Liberty Re holds capital and collateral adequate to support $850M ceded reserves under AG48 Primary Security and Other Security requirements
- Liberty Life Holdings' $730M parental guarantee is legally enforceable and sufficient
- No regulatory examination findings, inquiries, or concerns regarding Liberty Re from Nebraska DOI or Vermont DFR in past 5 years
- LLIC's Form D filings regarding Liberty Re were complete and accurate

**Recommendation 4.2 - Regulatory Approval Condition Precedent**

Condition closing on:
- Nebraska DOI written confirmation that Liberty Re reserve credit will not be disallowed post-closing
- If Nebraska DOI expresses concerns, seller must remediate (enhanced collateral, novation, or recapture) at seller's expense prior to closing

**Recommendation 4.3 - Indemnification and Escrow**

- Specific indemnity for captive reinsurance matters:
  - Seller indemnifies buyer for any loss of reserve credit or forced recapture within 36 months post-closing
  - Cap: $200M (covers surplus reduction + remediation costs)
  - Survival: 36 months (aligns with typical regulatory examination cycle)
- Escrow: $50M held for 36 months to secure captive-specific indemnity

**Recommendation 4.4 - Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanism**

If AG48 compliance issues are identified pre-closing:
- Tier 1: Enhanced collateral required ($200M-$300M LOC) → Purchase price reduction of $10M-$15M (present value of LOC costs)
- Tier 2: Partial reserve credit disallowance ($300M-$500M) → Purchase price reduction of $100M-$150M
- Tier 3: Full recapture required → Walk-away right or purchase price reduction of $300M+

### C. Long-Term Strategic Recommendations (Post-Closing)

**Recommendation C.1 - PBR Transition Planning (Year 1-2 Post-Closing)**
- Develop strategic plan to transition from captive reinsurance to direct reserving under VM-20 for new business
- As pre-2020 policies mature/lapse, voluntarily recapture and establish VM-20 reserves (lower than XXX/AXXX)
- Wind down Liberty Re over 10-15 years as captive's economic rationale diminishes

**Recommendation C.2 - Annual AG48 Compliance Monitoring**
- Establish annual process to verify Liberty Re AG48 compliance:
  - Update Required Level of Primary Security calculation
  - Assess adequacy of collateral (Primary Security + Other Security)
  - Monitor Liberty Life Holdings financial condition (guarantee capacity)
- Engage with Nebraska DOI annually to demonstrate ongoing compliance

**Recommendation C.3 - Enhanced Regulatory Relationships**
- Proactively engage Nebraska DOI and Vermont DFR in advance of regulatory examinations
- Provide enhanced voluntary disclosures regarding Liberty Re structure
- Position American Financial Holdings as sophisticated financial sponsor committed to regulatory compliance

### D. Risk-Adjusted Transaction Economics

**Base Case Purchase Price:** $2.9B

**Risk-Adjusted Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Probability | Adjustment | Risk-Adjusted Price |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **No Captive Issues** | 55-60% | $0 | $2.9B |
| **Enhanced Collateral Required** | 25-30% | ($12.5M) | $2.8875B |
| **Partial Reserve Credit Disallowance** | 10-15% | ($125M) | $2.775B |
| **Full Recapture / Deal Termination** | 5-10% | Deal termination | N/A |
| **Probability-Weighted Adjustment** | 100% | ($29M) | **$2.871B** |

[METHODOLOGY: Probability-weighted expected value adjustment based on identified scenarios]

**Recommendation:** Negotiate purchase price reduction or escrow arrangement reflecting the $29M probability-weighted risk, or alternatively, secure seller agreement to remediate any captive issues at seller's expense prior to closing.
