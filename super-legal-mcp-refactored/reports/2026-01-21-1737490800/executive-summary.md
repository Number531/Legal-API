# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Project Chronos - American Financial Holdings LLC Acquisition of Liberty Life Insurance Company
**Prepared for**: American Financial Holdings LLC Board of Directors and Investment Committee
**Date**: January 21, 2026
**Transaction Value**: $2.9 Billion (Stock Purchase)

---

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Overall Risk Level**: HIGH (mitigable with conditions)

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

American Financial Holdings LLC should proceed with the $2.9 billion acquisition of Liberty Life Insurance Company, subject to six critical conditions detailed below. Total quantified risk exposure of $335.17M (correlation-adjusted) represents 11.6% of purchase price, within acceptable M&A tolerance for insurance acquisitions. With recommended mitigations implemented, the blended IRR of 12.35% exceeds the 10% hurdle rate, making this transaction attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.

### Rationale

The acquisition presents compelling strategic value: Liberty Life's $17.8 billion investment portfolio, 650 captive agents generating $882M annual premium, and established Nebraska-domiciled insurance platform provide a strong foundation for American Financial's expansion into life insurance. However, material risks require active mitigation before closing.

The single largest risk is Vermont captive recapture ($730M exposure, 12.5% probability), which if triggered would reduce RBC from 188% to 129%, placing Liberty Life in Regulatory Action Level territory where Nebraska DOI could take control. This risk is mitigable through a $300M letter of credit backstop at annual cost of $2.55M-$3.45M, reducing probability to 5-8%.

The combined capital pressure scenario (captive recapture plus GMWB 95th percentile stress) has 0.625% joint probability but would drive RBC to 101%, constituting a deal-blocking tail risk. Dual mitigation (captive LOC plus GMWB reinsurance) reduces this joint probability to below 0.3%, an acceptable level for Board fiduciary standards.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **Vermont Captive LOC Backstop** - $300M letter of credit pre-closing OR $150M purchase price reduction - See **Section IV.B** for details
2. **Nebraska DOI Examination Clearance** - Final report (Q1 2025) must NOT order captive recapture or collateral exceeding $500M - See **Section IV.A** for details
3. **Purchase Price Adjustment or Escrow** - $400M escrow for 24 months OR $200M-$250M purchase price reduction - See **Section II** for details
4. **Global Re LOC Renewal** - Confirmation of $850M LOC renewal through 2030 or alternative reinsurer secured - See **Section IV.E** for details
5. **IUL Class Action Resolution** - Mediation accelerated to Q1-Q2 2025 with settlement target of $35M or less - See **Section IV.D** for details
6. **Agent Retention Program** - $20M retention bonus pool funded at closing (50/50 vesting at Months 12/24) - See **Section IV.J** for details

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question (Abbreviated) | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Does Liberty Life's RBC ratio require regulatory intervention? | **Yes** | Current RBC 188% is below 200% Company Action Level, requiring $150M capital injection via surplus notes to reach 204% target | IV.A |
| 2 | Does the Vermont captive structure create material recapture risk? | **Probably Yes** | 2.6x parental guarantee leverage ($730M on $280M net worth) raises Nebraska DOI concerns; 10-15% recapture probability | IV.B |
| 3 | Are Liberty Life's variable product operations compliant? | **Probably Yes** | SEC prospectus deficiency (2022) and FINRA violations (2023) remediated; net exposure $5.4M-$7.15M within E&O SIR | IV.C |
| 4 | Is the IUL class action a material transaction risk? | **Probably No** | $35M reserve adequate for recommended $30M-$35M settlement; E&O coverage ($50M policy) absorbs exposure above $5M SIR | IV.D |
| 5 | Do reinsurance counterparties pose concentration risk? | **Probably Yes** | Global Re ($850M LOC expiring 2027) and Vermont captive ($730M parental guarantee) create correlated exposure of $115.6M weighted | IV.E |
| 6 | Will market conduct examination impact closing? | **Probably No** | Total exposure $1.49M-$1.66M (0.05% of purchase price) is immaterial; consent order negotiation mitigates | IV.F |
| 7 | Do FINRA arbitrations indicate systemic compliance failures? | **Probably No** | Three pending VA suitability arbitrations ($555K-$788K) within industry norms; no pattern suggesting systemic deficiency | IV.G |
| 8 | Does investment portfolio create material RBC stress? | **Probably Yes** | 7% below-investment-grade concentration (vs. 4.8% industry average) and 35% office CRE exposure create $59.65M weighted stress exposure | IV.H |
| 9 | Does GMWB tail risk threaten capital adequacy? | **Probably Yes** | 99th percentile GMWB loss ($243M) combined with captive recapture drives RBC to 79% (MCL territory); mitigation required | IV.I |
| 10 | Will agent attrition materially impact production? | **Yes** | 20-30% attrition without retention bonuses translates to $176M-$265M annual lost production; $20M bonus program (ROI 450%) recommended | IV.J |
| 11 | Is surplus notes the optimal capital structure? | **Yes** | 100% TAC credit, 5.14% after-tax cost, $39.71M NPV advantage versus equity injection; 90-95% Nebraska DOI approval probability | IV.K |

- **Probability-Weighted Exposure**: $381.17M (expected value before correlation adjustment)
- **Correlation-Adjusted Exposure**: $335.17M (11.6% of $2.9B purchase price)
- **Recommended Purchase Price Adjustment**: $200M-$250M (70% of expected loss per industry M&A standard)
- **Recommended Escrow/Holdback**: $400M for 24 months (covers 75th percentile exposure)

### Methodology Summary

| Methodology | Count | Application | Weighted Total |
|-------------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Expected Value (Contingent) | 9 | One-time probabilistic events (recapture, settlement, default) | $189.79M |
| NPV (Perpetual/Multi-Year) | 3 | Recurring impacts (attrition, compliance costs) | $127.4M |

| **P10 (Optimistic)** | $280M | 195% | No captive recapture, median GMWB, mild stress | Best-case planning |
| **P50 (Base Case)** | $434M | 179% | No recapture, $54M GMWB, 20% attrition | Primary planning basis |
| **P75 (Bear Case)** | $771M | 162% | No recapture, 75th GMWB, Global Re fails, 30% attrition | Stress planning |
| **P95 (Severe)** | $1,614M | 79% | Captive recaptures, 95th GMWB, deep recession | Maximum reserve (ACL territory) |

**Sensitivity Summary:**
- **Largest Single Driver**: Captive recapture - swing of $730M between P10 and P95
- **Most Volatile**: GMWB tail risk - probability range 50th to 99th percentile creates $207M variance
- **Correlated Risks**: Captive recapture and GMWB stress compound if both occur (0.625% joint probability drives RBC to 101%)

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Capital Adequacy Cascade

The RBC ratio of 188% (below 200% Company Action Level) creates interconnected pressures across multiple domains that amplify individual risk impacts.

**Primary Finding**: Liberty Life's statutory surplus of $1.85B supports current RBC of 188%, but this provides minimal cushion against stress events. The planned $150M surplus notes injection achieves only 204% post-injection, leaving just 4 points above the 200% CAL threshold.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Captive Reinsurance (Section IV.B)**: If Nebraska DOI orders captive recapture, $730M surplus reduction drives RBC to 129%, triggering Regulatory Action Level where DOI is authorized to take control
- **GMWB Tail Risk (Section IV.I)**: 95th percentile GMWB loss ($127M) in isolation reduces RBC to 175% (manageable), but combined with captive recapture produces RBC 101% (deal-blocking)
- **Investment Portfolio (Section IV.H)**: Cumulative stress scenario ($166M-$221M) pushes post-injection RBC to 166-172%, dangerously close to 150% RAL threshold
- **Agent Retention (Section IV.J)**: RBC decline triggers rating downgrade risk (A.M. Best A- to BBB+), which accelerates agent attrition above baseline 20-30%

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $857M-$973M in tail scenarios (0.625% probability for combined captive + GMWB 95th)

### B. Distribution Channel Vulnerability

Agent retention risk compounds with capital adequacy concerns to create a potential spiral of production loss and earnings impairment.

**Primary Finding**: Liberty Life's 650 captive agents generate $882M annual premium (42% of total $2.1B). PE acquisition history suggests 20-30% attrition without retention measures, translating to $176M-$265M annual lost production.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **RBC Impact (Section IV.A)**: Earnings decline from agent attrition reduces ability to accumulate surplus organically, extending timeline to reach 300% dividend-free threshold
- **Reinsurance (Section IV.E)**: Production decline may trigger Global Re treaty volume thresholds, accelerating LOC renewal negotiations
- **Variable Products (Section IV.C)**: Departing agents may trigger customer follow-on that accelerates separate account surrenders, creating liquidity pressure on Separate Account B ($800M VA assets)

**Mitigation Synergy**: $20M retention bonus program (ROI 450%) simultaneously addresses attrition risk, rating stability, and reinsurance covenant compliance.

### C. Reinsurance Concentration Risk

Three reinsurance relationships create correlated exposure totaling $157.5M-$260.3M unmitigated.

**Primary Finding**: Global Reassurance Ltd. (Cayman) and Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC together cede $1.7B in reserves with combined parental/LOC collateral of $1.58B. Both structures face 2025-2027 renewal or examination pressure.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Capital Adequacy (Section IV.A)**: Global Re LOC failure ($765M) or captive recapture ($730M) individually drive RBC below 150% RAL
- **Regulatory Relations (Section IV.F)**: Nebraska DOI 2024 examination raised preliminary concerns on captive structure; adverse finding cascades to Global Re scrutiny
- **Transaction Timeline (Section VI)**: Both reinsurance issues require resolution pre-closing (Q3 2025); LOC renewal negotiations must complete by Q2 2025

**Aggregate Reinsurance Exposure**: $115.6M probability-weighted (excluding captive, which is captured separately at $100.6M)

### D. Litigation and Regulatory Intersection

IUL class action resolution intersects with market conduct examination findings and FINRA arbitration patterns.

**Primary Finding**: Thompson v. Liberty Life ($85M-$125M alleged damages, $30M-$35M settlement target) shares factual overlap with Nebraska DOI illustration violations and FINRA VA suitability claims.

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Market Conduct (Section IV.F)**: Nebraska DOI examination identified 5 sales illustration violations that plaintiffs' counsel may cite as evidence of systemic practice
- **FINRA (Section IV.G)**: Three pending VA suitability arbitrations involve similar senior policyholder demographics (ages 68-82) and illustration-related claims
- **E&O Insurance**: $50M Chubb policy with $5M SIR covers IUL settlement, FINRA awards, and potentially SEC/state regulatory defense costs, but concurrent claims may exhaust coverage

**Combined Litigation/Regulatory Exposure**: $16.6M net (IUL $8.3M + Variable Products $6.28M + FINRA $1.78M + Market Conduct $1.5M minus overlap), but with 0.75 correlation coefficient driving $12.5M correlation-adjusted total.

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section Reference |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Purchase Price Reduction | $250M | $225M | $175M | Section II |
| Escrow Amount | $450M | $400M | $300M | Section II |
| Escrow Duration | 30 months | 24 months | 18 months | Section II |
| Captive LOC Pre-Closing | Required | Required | Price reduction $150M if not | Section IV.B |
| IUL Settlement Cap | $30M | $35M | $45M (with escrow) | Section IV.D |
| Retention Bonus Pool | $25M | $20M | $15M | Section IV.J |
| Agent Attrition Cap (Escrow Release) | 20% | 25% | 30% | Section IV.J |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **Nebraska DOI Examination Pending**: Final report (Q1 2025) creates uncertainty that justifies conservative escrow structure. Seller cannot demonstrate clean bill of health until report issued.
2. **RBC Below 200% CAL**: Regulatory deficiency is objective fact requiring capital injection regardless of acquirer. Buyer can require seller to contribute to injection or reduce price accordingly.
3. **IUL Class Action Timing**: Q2 2025 mediation scheduled after expected Q3 2025 closing creates execution risk. Seller should bear settlement risk via escrow or indemnity.

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| # | Expected Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence Basis |
|---|--------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Captive has operated since 2010 without recapture | HIGH | AG48 grandfather protection does not bind Nebraska DOI exam discretion; 2024 preliminary concerns documented | Section IV.B, Nebraska DOI exit conference notes |
| 2 | $400M escrow is excessive (14% of price) | HIGH | 75th percentile exposure is $771M; escrow covers 52% which is at low end of market range (40-60%) | Section II scenario analysis |
| 3 | Agent attrition projections overstated | MEDIUM | PE acquirer pattern (65-75% implement workforce reductions) documented; 20-30% baseline is conservative | Section IV.J industry benchmarks |
| 4 | IUL settlement should be seller responsibility | HIGH | Agree - seek full indemnity or pre-closing settlement; E&O policy assignment provides backstop | Section IV.D |

**Negotiation Playbook:**

| Scenario | If Seller Says... | We Respond... | Fallback Position |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Escrow Amount | "$400M is 14% of price, market is 10%" | Cite $771M 75th percentile exposure; $400M is only 52% coverage | Accept $350M with longer survival (30 months) |
| Captive LOC | "Nebraska will accept current structure" | Require LOC or price reduction; 12.5% recapture probability is unacceptable | Accept $150M price reduction in lieu of LOC |
| Agent Retention | "Buyer's operational decision" | Agent attrition risk exists regardless of buyer plans; seller benefits from continuation of policies | Split cost 50/50 ($10M each) |
| IUL Settlement | "Covered by E&O, no escrow needed" | E&O has $5M SIR; settlement above $35M reserve creates surplus hit | Seller indemnity for settlement above $40M |

---

## VI. TIMELINE & CRITICAL PATH

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Risk Level | Section Reference |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Nebraska DOI Final Exam Report | Q1 2025 | Captive structure acceptance | HIGH | Section IV.A, IV.B |
| Nebraska DOI RBC Plan Approval | Feb-Mar 2025 | $150M surplus notes structure | MEDIUM | Section IV.A, IV.K |
| IUL Class Action Mediation | Q1-Q2 2025 | Accelerated from scheduled Q2 | MEDIUM | Section IV.D |
| Global Re LOC Renewal Confirmation | Q2 2025 | Barclays Bank commitment | HIGH | Section IV.E |
| Captive LOC Implementation | Pre-Closing | JPMorgan/BofA/Wells engagement | HIGH | Section IV.B |
| Definitive Agreement Execution | Q2 2025 | All due diligence complete | MEDIUM | All Sections |
| HSR Clearance (if required) | Q2 2025 | Filing within 30 days of signing | LOW | N/A |
| State Insurance Approvals | Q2-Q3 2025 | Nebraska DOI Form A | MEDIUM | Section IV.A |
| **Closing** | **Q3 2025** | **All conditions precedent** | **MEDIUM** | All Sections |

### Critical Path Risks

- **Nebraska DOI Examination (Q1 2025)**: Adverse captive findings could delay closing 6-12 months while collateral negotiations proceed. Probability: 30-40%.
- **IUL Mediation Failure**: If mediation does not achieve settlement within $40M, trial scheduling (Q4 2025 or later) extends resolution beyond closing. Probability: 20-30%.
- **Global Re LOC Non-Renewal**: If Barclays declines renewal, alternative reinsurer sourcing adds 3-6 months to timeline. Probability: 10-15%.

Option A: PROCEED WITH FULL CONDITIONS
- Implement all six conditions precedent (LOC, escrow, retention, etc.)
- Purchase price: $2.9B with $400M escrow for 24 months
- Total capital deployment: $2.845B (price + $150M injection + $20M bonuses - escrow)
- Expected IRR: 12.35%
- Status: RECOMMENDED

Option B: PROCEED WITH PRICE REDUCTION
- Negotiate $225M purchase price reduction in lieu of conditions
- Purchase price: $2.675B with standard $150M escrow
- Total capital deployment: $2.645B
- Expected IRR: 13.8% (improved basis)
- Status: ACCEPTABLE IF SELLER AGREES

Option C: DO NOT PROCEED
- Decline transaction due to risk concentration
- Preserve capital for alternative opportunities
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED unless Conditions 1-2 cannot be satisfied

RECOMMENDED: Option A (Proceed with Full Conditions)

Rationale: Transaction economics justify risk at $2.9B price with appropriate
protections. $400M escrow preserves optionality while allowing value capture.
Blended IRR 12.35% exceeds 10% hurdle rate. Deal-blocking risks are MITIGABLE.
