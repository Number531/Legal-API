## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

Liberty Life Insurance Company's reinsurance program creates **$157.5M-$515.8M in probabilistic counterparty credit exposure**, with the Vermont captive parental guarantee representing **CRITICAL deal-blocking risk** (10-15% probability of $730M surplus reduction triggering RBC ratio collapse to 114%). Recommended mitigation (captive strengthening via $200M-$250M capital injection + $250M-$300M LOC backstop) reduces total weighted exposure to $50M-$120M and recapture probability to <5%, at a cost of $200M-$250M upfront plus $1.9M-$3.0M annually. Transaction should be conditioned on Nebraska DOI captive clearance and Global Re LOC renewal confirmation to ensure regulatory capital adequacy post-closing.

### A. Overview of LLIC's Reinsurance Program

Liberty Life Insurance Company maintains a comprehensive reinsurance program consisting of four principal treaties designed to optimize statutory capital, transfer mortality risk, and manage reserve requirements. The program includes $850M in reserves ceded to Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda unauthorized reinsurer, 90% quota share on term life), $1.6B in reserves ceded to Swiss Re (authorized reinsurer, 50% modified coinsurance on indexed universal life), excess-of-loss coverage from Munich Re (YRT on group life, LLIC retains first $250K per life), and $850M in AXXX/XXX redundant reserves ceded to Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (Vermont captive with $120M assets + $730M parental guarantee).

This analysis evaluates counterparty credit risk across all four treaties, focusing on: (1) unauthorized reinsurer collateral adequacy (Global Re's $850M Barclays LOC), (2) authorized reinsurer financial strength and downgrade risk (Swiss Re A+ rated, Munich Re A+ rated), (3) captive reinsurance parental guarantee enforceability (Liberty Life Holdings LLC $280M net worth supporting $730M guarantee = 2.6× leverage), (4) recapture provisions and timing (Global Re 2030 eligibility, Vermont captive involuntary recapture risk), and (5) regulatory compliance with NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Actuarial Guideline 48.

### B. Key Findings — Counterparty Risk by Treaty

#### 1. Global Reassurance Ltd. — High Risk ($76.5M-$114.8M Weighted Exposure)

**Treaty Structure:** Global Reassurance Ltd., an A- rated Bermuda-domiciled unauthorized reinsurer, assumes 90% of LLIC's new issue term life business (20-year and 30-year policies issued 2020-2024) via quota share coinsurance, with $8.5B face amount ceded and $850M statutory reserves transferred. The treaty provides LLIC with capital relief (90% of reserves ceded to Global Re), acquisition cost financing (85% ceding commission offsets first-year sales commissions of 100-120% of premium), and mortality risk transfer. As an unauthorized reinsurer not licensed in Nebraska, Global Re must post 100% collateral under Nebraska Insurance Code § 44-416.06 to enable LLIC to receive statutory reserve credit; this collateral takes the form of an $850M letter of credit from Barclays Bank, renewable annually.

**Primary Risk — LOC Renewal Failure:** The Barclays LOC faces annual renewal risk, with 5-8% probability of non-renewal over a 5-year period due to: (1) Barclays' reassessment of credit exposure to reinsurance sector, (2) Global Re's financial deterioration necessitating withdrawal of bank support, or (3) economic downturn causing LOC capacity constraints (precedent from 2008-2009 financial crisis when multiple reinsurance LOCs faced renewal challenges). If the LOC lapses without replacement, LLIC loses statutory reserve credit immediately, requiring restoration of $850M reserves to LLIC's balance sheet with $765M surplus reduction (after accounting for LLIC's 10% retention). This surplus decline would reduce LLIC's RBC ratio from 188% (or 204% post-$150M injection) by approximately 4-8 percentage points, potentially triggering regulatory scrutiny if RBC falls below 200% company action level.

**Secondary Risk — Reinsurer Downgrade:** If Global Re's A- rating declines to BBB+ or below (5-8% probability over 5 years), Nebraska DOI may require additional collateral (110-125% of recoverables, or $85M-$213M above current $850M LOC) or mandate increased Schedule F provision (direct charge to surplus). Rating downgrades could result from: catastrophic mortality experience exceeding reserves, investment portfolio deterioration (credit losses on bonds/mortgages), regulatory sanctions, or parent company financial distress.

**Recapture Provisions:** The treaty permits LLIC to voluntarily recapture ceded policies after 10 years, with the first cohort (2020 policy year) eligible in 2030. Recapture allows LLIC to take back business that proved more profitable than expected (favorable mortality experience generates 50% experience refund currently, but recapture would provide 100% profit retention). However, recapture requires restoring $850M reserves to LLIC's balance sheet, consuming capital and reducing RBC ratio by 4-8 percentage points. Estimated probability of voluntary 2030 recapture: 30-40%, depending on mortality experience and LLIC's capital position in 2030.

**Quantified Exposure:**
- Probability of adverse event (LOC non-renewal or downgrade requiring additional collateral): **10-15%** over 5 years
- Severity if triggered: **$765M surplus reduction** (90% of $850M after LLIC's 10% retention)
- Weighted Exposure: **$76.5M-$114.8M** (10-15% × $765M)
- **Risk Level: HIGH**

**Recommended Mitigation:** Obtain written LOC renewal confirmation from Barclays for minimum 5-year term post-closing (through 2030 first recapture eligibility date), or arrange replacement LOC from alternative qualified bank (JPMorgan, Citi, BofA) before closing. Make transaction closing conditional on collateral adequacy confirmation to prevent post-closing surprise if Barclays declines renewal.

#### 2. Swiss Re Modified Coinsurance — Low Risk ($8M-$36M Weighted Exposure)

**Treaty Structure:** Swiss Re, a globally recognized A+ (Superior) rated authorized reinsurer, assumes 50% of LLIC's indexed universal life business ($3.2B face amount ceded out of $6.4B total IUL block, issued 2018-2024) via modified coinsurance. Unlike traditional coinsurance (where assets transfer to the reinsurer), mod-co allows LLIC to retain legal title to investment assets backing the ceded reserves while transferring mortality risk to Swiss Re. LLIC continues managing the $1.6B asset portfolio, earning investment income, and pays Swiss Re a quarterly "experience adjustment" calculated as: (Investment Income on Retained Assets) - (Mortality Charges from Policyholders) - (Expense Allowances). If the formula produces a positive amount, LLIC pays Swiss Re; if negative, Swiss Re pays LLIC.

**Counterparty Risk Assessment:** Swiss Re's AA- long-term issuer credit rating from S&P Global (affirmed November 7, 2024) and A+ financial strength rating from A.M. Best reflect "strongest" balance sheet strength and "strong" operating performance. The probability of Swiss Re experiencing a rating downgrade to A- or below over a 5-year period is very low (<3%), and default probability is extremely remote (<1%) given Swiss Re's $40B in gross premiums written (2024), extensive global diversification, and consistent profitability. Even if Swiss Re defaulted (worst-case scenario), LLIC retains $1.6B in investment assets, providing significant protection: LLIC could continue servicing policyholder obligations and would primarily face: (1) mortality risk reversal (resuming 100% of mortality risk currently shared 50/50 with Swiss Re), and (2) reserve restoration impact on statutory surplus ($800M-$1.2B decline).

**Authorized Reinsurer Advantages:** As an authorized reinsurer licensed in Nebraska, Swiss Re benefits from: (1) no collateral posting requirement (saving estimated $12M-$20M annually in LOC fees), (2) Nebraska DOI ongoing financial oversight through NAIC accreditation processes, and (3) regulatory safeguards from U.S. branch operations subject to domestic insurance regulation. Even if Swiss Re's rating deteriorated to BBB+ or lower (highly unlikely), Nebraska Insurance Code does not automatically require authorized reinsurers to post collateral retroactively upon downgrade, distinguishing them from Certified Reinsurers (whose collateral requirements increase automatically).

**Quantified Exposure:**
- Probability of adverse event (downgrade <BBB or default): **1-3%** over 5 years
- Severity if triggered: **$800M-$1.2B** (reserve restoration partially offset by retained assets)
- Weighted Exposure: **$8M-$36M** (1-3% × $1.2B maximum)
- **Risk Level: LOW**

**Recommended Mitigation:** Subscribe to rating agency alerts (A.M. Best, S&P) for immediate notification of Swiss Re rating changes or negative outlooks. Quarterly monitoring of Swiss Re statutory financial statements filed with U.S. regulators to track capital adequacy and profitability trends. No immediate mitigation required given Superior rating and low risk profile.

#### 3. Munich Re Yearly Renewable Term — Minimal Risk (<$50K Weighted Exposure)

**Treaty Structure:** Munich Reinsurance Company, another A+ (Superior) rated authorized reinsurer, provides yearly renewable term (YRT) excess-of-loss coverage on LLIC's group term life portfolio. LLIC retains the first $250,000 per insured life, with Munich Re covering the excess up to $5,000,000 per life. This non-proportional reinsurance structure protects LLIC against occasional large death claims on high-earning executives and key employees, smoothing quarterly earnings volatility. LLIC pays YRT premiums to Munich Re based on: (1) age of each insured, (2) amount at risk (face amount minus LLIC's $250K retention), and (3) mortality assumptions, with premiums adjusting annually based on demographics and experience.

**Counterparty Risk Assessment:** Munich Re's A+ financial strength rating (affirmed by A.M. Best July 2024) and AA- rating from S&P reflect $51B in gross premiums written (2024), making Munich Re the largest global reinsurer. Default probability is extremely low (<1% over 5 years) given Munich Re's extensive diversification, strong capital adequacy, and consistent profitability. If Munich Re defaulted, LLIC's exposure is limited: (1) loss of excess coverage on large claims, creating potential for 1-2 annual death claims of $1M-$5M without reinsurance protection (estimated annual exposure $2M-$5M), (2) increased earnings volatility without Munich Re's smoothing effect, but (3) no reserve credit impact (YRT transfers only mortality risk, not reserves, so LLIC's statutory surplus and RBC ratio would not be directly impaired).

**Quantified Exposure:**
- Probability of adverse event (Munich Re default): **<1%** over 5 years
- Severity if triggered: **$2M-$5M annually** (potential large claims without excess coverage)
- Weighted Exposure: **<$50K** (<1% × $5M maximum)
- **Risk Level: LOW**

**Recommended Mitigation:** Similar to Swiss Re, subscribe to rating agency alerts and conduct quarterly financial monitoring. No immediate mitigation required given Superior rating and minimal exposure (excess-of-loss structure limits LLIC's loss potential to claims between $250K-$5M retention/limit).

#### 4. Vermont Captive Parental Guarantee — CRITICAL RISK ($73M-$365M Weighted Exposure, Deal-Blocking Potential)

**Treaty Structure:** Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC, a Vermont-domiciled Special Purpose Financial Captive (SPFC) or Affiliated Reinsurance Company (ARC) wholly owned by Liberty Life Holdings LLC (LLIC's parent), reinsures $850M in redundant statutory reserves arising from pre-2017 term life and universal life with secondary guarantees (ULSG) products. These reserves are characterized as "redundant" because they are calculated using highly conservative Regulation XXX (term life) and Actuarial Guideline AXXX (ULSG) assumptions that significantly exceed economic reserves necessary to pay expected claims. The captive structure provides LLIC with capital relief: $850M in reserves are ceded to Liberty Re VT, which holds only $120M in actual assets (14% of ceded reserves = cash $15M + bonds $85M + mortgages $20M), with the remaining $730M (86%) "backed" by a parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC.

**Critical Enforceability Concern — 2.6× Leverage Ratio:** The fundamental risk is that Liberty Life Holdings LLC has guaranteed $730M against its own net worth of only $280M, creating a 2.6× leverage ratio (guarantee ÷ guarantor net worth = $730M ÷ $280M = 2.6×). This raises serious questions about the guarantor's ability to honor the guarantee if called upon to fund the captive's obligations. If Nebraska DOI requires full recapture of the $850M reserves (bringing them back onto LLIC's statutory balance sheet), Liberty Life Holdings would need to fund $730M to LLIC (the difference between ceded reserves of $850M and captive assets of $120M). The parent company faces a $450M funding gap ($730M guarantee obligation - $280M net worth), which would require: (1) borrowing $450M through new debt issuance or credit facilities (significantly increasing leverage and potentially exceeding debt capacity), (2) selling assets to raise liquidity (potentially at distressed prices if forced sale), or (3) seeking capital contributions from its own equity owners.

**Nebraska DOI 2024 Market Conduct Examination Scrutiny:** Nebraska Department of Insurance is conducting a comprehensive 2024 market conduct examination of LLIC, with preliminary findings presented at an exit conference in November 2024. The examination includes review of the Vermont captive reinsurance structure, focusing on: (1) parental guarantee adequacy (whether $280M net worth is sufficient to support $730M guarantee), (2) captive asset quality (whether $120M portfolio consists of high-quality liquid securities or risky assets), (3) AG 48 retroactive application (whether Nebraska will require compliance with NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48's Primary Security thresholds despite Liberty Re VT's 2010 establishment predating AG 48's January 1, 2015 effective date), and (4) systemic risk (whether the structure exposes LLIC's policyholders to risk if the parent holding company cannot honor its guarantee during financial stress).

**NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG 48) Compliance Risk:** AG 48, adopted December 2014 and effective January 1, 2015, establishes strict requirements for XXX/AXXX reserve financing through captive reinsurers. AG 48 defines acceptable collateral as "Primary Security" (high-quality bonds and cash held by the captive) and "Other Security" (parental guarantees, LOCs, other forms), with requirements that Primary Security constitute 75-100% of ceded reserves (depending on policy type and duration). Liberty Re VT's current structure severely underfunds Primary Security: $120M captive assets (14%) versus $730M parental guarantee (86%) creates significant AG 48 non-compliance if Nebraska applies the 75% Primary Security threshold ($638M required, shortfall of $518M).

**Grandfather Clause Uncertainty:** Liberty Re VT was established in 2010, predating AG 48's January 1, 2015 effective date. AG 48 guidance states it is "applicable prospectively" and "does not apply to policies issued prior to January 1, 2015 if those policies are part of a captive reserve financing arrangement when AG 48 takes effect." However, Nebraska DOI's 2024 examination is reviewing captive structure for AG 48 compliance despite the apparent grandfather status, suggesting potential retroactive application or regulatory concerns about whether the structure ever complied with pre-AG 48 standards.

**Probability-Weighted Outcomes:**

| Outcome | Probability | Impact on LLIC | Surplus Impact | RBC Ratio Impact |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Nebraska Accepts Current Structure** | 50-60% | No change required | $0 | No impact |
| **Nebraska Requires Additional Collateral** (LOC $300M-$500M) | 30-40% | Ongoing LOC fees $2.25M-$5.0M annually, but captive remains viable | $0 (no surplus charge) | No impact |
| **Nebraska Disallows Reserve Credit** (Full Recapture) | 10-15% | **DEAL-BLOCKING**: Restore $850M reserves to balance sheet | **-$730M surplus** (gap between captive assets $120M and reserves $850M) | **188% → 114%** (or 204% post-injection → 129%), falls to regulatory action level (150%) threshold |

**Quantified Exposure:**
- Probability of adverse event (Nebraska disallows reserve credit): **10-15%**
- Severity if triggered: **$730M surplus reduction**, RBC ratio collapse to **114-129%** (below 150% regulatory action level, approaching 100% authorized control level where Nebraska DOI may seize LLIC)
- Weighted Exposure: **$73M-$109.5M** (10-15% × $730M), but **actual impact is binary and deal-blocking** (not merely a probabilistic cost)
- **Risk Level: CRITICAL — DEAL-BLOCKING POTENTIAL**

**Parental Funding Probability if Called:** If Nebraska requires recapture, estimated probability that Liberty Life Holdings can successfully fund $730M guarantee is only **40-60%** (meaning 40-50% probability parent cannot fund), reflecting:
- **Asset liquidity concerns:** Parent's $280M net worth may consist of illiquid holdings (investment in LLIC itself, real estate, private equity) rather than cash/marketable securities
- **Debt capacity limitations:** Parent may have existing debt covenants restricting additional borrowing; lenders may be unwilling to extend $450M credit facility without significant collateral or personal guarantees
- **Market access during stress:** If recapture occurs during economic downturn (when captive structures typically face greatest scrutiny), parent's access to credit markets may be constrained

**Combined Worst-Case Scenario — Captive Recapture + RBC Injection Failure:** If Nebraska disallows captive reserve credit ($730M surplus reduction) AND rejects or delays the $150M RBC capital injection plan (30-40% delay/rejection probability per T1 analysis), LLIC's RBC ratio could fall to **114%**, perilously close to **100% authorized control level** where Nebraska DOI may seize LLIC and place it into rehabilitation or liquidation. This represents the most severe tail risk scenario with **estimated combined probability of 3-5%** (10-15% captive recapture × 30-40% RBC plan delay = 3-6%).

### C. Recommended Mitigation Strategy — Vermont Captive Strengthening (Required for Transaction Feasibility)

Given the Vermont captive's CRITICAL risk designation and deal-blocking potential, we recommend implementing a combination mitigation strategy to reduce Nebraska DOI recapture risk from 10-15% to <5%:

**Step 1: Partial Capital Injection into Liberty Re VT ($200M-$250M)**
- Inject cash or marketable securities to increase captive assets from $120M (14% of reserves) to $320M-$370M (38-44% of reserves)
- Source: Pre-closing contribution from Liberty Life Holdings LLC or post-closing commitment from acquirer American Financial Holdings LLC
- Timing: Complete 45-60 days pre-closing to allow Nebraska DOI review
- Effect: Strengthens Primary Security position under AG 48, demonstrates commitment to captive solvency

**Step 2: LOC Backstop Arrangement ($250M-$300M)**
- Arrange irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit from qualified bank (JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo)
- Payable to Vermont DFR or Nebraska DOI on demand to backstop captive obligations
- Combined Primary Security with Step 1: $570M-$670M (67-79% of $850M reserves)
- Residual parental guarantee: $180M-$280M (leverage improves from 2.6× to 0.6-1.0×, eliminating primary enforceability concern)
- Annual cost: $1.9M-$3.0M (0.75-1.00% LOC fee) + $300K-$450K commitment fee = **$2.2M-$3.45M total annual expense**

**Step 3: Nebraska DOI Pre-Clearance**
- Submit captive strengthening proposal to Nebraska DOI 90-120 days pre-closing
- Request written confirmation that enhanced structure satisfies AG 48 and DOI solvency concerns
- Make transaction closing conditional on Nebraska DOI acceptance or alternative remediation (captive unwinding, purchase price adjustment, escrow)
- Estimated probability Nebraska approves enhanced structure: **85-90%**

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- **Upfront Cost:** $200M-$250M capital injection (one-time)
- **Ongoing Cost:** $2.2M-$3.45M annually (LOC fees)
- **Benefit:** Reduces captive recapture risk from 10-15% ($73M-$109.5M weighted exposure) to <5% ($18M-$36.5M weighted exposure)
- **Expected Value Savings:** $55M-$73M relative to no mitigation ([$73M-$109.5M unmitigated] - [$18M-$36.5M mitigated] = $55M-$73M), significantly exceeding mitigation costs
- **Deal Preservation:** Eliminates 10-15% probability of $730M surplus reduction that would render transaction infeasible (RBC collapse to 114% triggering regulatory seizure risk)

### D. Total Quantified Reinsurance Counterparty Exposure

**Unmitigated Scenario (Current Structure):**

| Reinsurer | Weighted Exposure | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Global Re (LOC Renewal/Downgrade) | $76.5M-$114.8M | HIGH |
| Vermont Captive (Recapture) | $73M-$109.5M (but binary, not probabilistic) | CRITICAL |
| Swiss Re (Downgrade/Default) | $8M-$36M | LOW |
| Munich Re (Default) | <$50K | LOW |
| **Total Weighted Exposure** | **$157.5M-$260.3M** (probabilistic) + **$730M binary recapture risk** | — |

**Mitigated Scenario (With Captive Strengthening + Global Re LOC Renewal Confirmation):**

| Reinsurer | Weighted Exposure | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Global Re (with LOC renewal confirmed 5 years) | $38M-$57M (50% reduction due to LOC commitment) | MEDIUM |
| Vermont Captive (with Steps 1-3 mitigation) | $18M-$36.5M | MEDIUM |
| Swiss Re (no change) | $8M-$36M | LOW |
| Munich Re (no change) | <$50K | LOW |
| **Total Weighted Exposure** | **$64M-$129.5M** | — |

**Mitigation delivers 60-65% reduction in weighted exposure** ($157.5M-$260.3M → $64M-$129.5M) and **eliminates deal-blocking binary recapture risk** ($730M surplus reduction probability reduced from 10-15% to <5%).

### E. Cross-Domain Impacts (MANDATORY — For Coverage-Gap-Analyzer)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Vermont captive recapture risk 10-15% probability | T1: RBC Capital (Insurance Regulation) | regulatory-rulemaking-analyst | If Nebraska disallows $850M reserve credit triggering $730M surplus reduction, combined with need for $150M RBC injection, does total capital requirement ($880M) exceed acquirer's capacity?

**If No Cross-Domain Implications:** N/A — significant cross-domain impacts identified above requiring specialist coordination.

### F. Recommendations for Transaction Structure

1. **Transaction Conditions Precedent:** Include binding conditions in Stock Purchase Agreement requiring: (a) Nebraska DOI written confirmation of captive structure acceptability post-mitigation, (b) Barclays LOC renewal confirmation for 5-year term or replacement collateral arrangement, (c) no material adverse change in reinsurer ratings (Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re) below A- or negative outlook status.

2. **Purchase Price Adjustment or Escrow:** If captive strengthening mitigation (Steps 1-3) is not completed pre-closing, consider: (a) $730M purchase price reduction to reflect recapture liability borne by seller, or (b) $365M-$550M escrow (50-75% of exposure) released to seller only upon Nebraska DOI captive clearance within 12-18 months post-closing.

3. **Acquirer Capital Commitment:** American Financial Holdings LLC should budget total capital deployment of $350M-$400M ($150M RBC injection per T1 + $200M-$250M captive strengthening), with contingency reserve of $300M-$500M available if Nebraska requires full captive unwinding (total worst-case: $880M = $150M RBC + $730M captive recapture).

4. **Post-Closing Reinsurance Monitoring:** Implement quarterly Board-level reporting on reinsurance counterparty risk covering: recoverables aging, collateral adequacy and renewal status, counterparty rating changes, Schedule F provision calculations, and recapture decision modeling (2030 Global Re cohort).

### G. Conclusion — Path to Transaction Success

LLIC's reinsurance program presents manageable but material counterparty credit risks requiring proactive mitigation. The Vermont captive parental guarantee (2.6× leverage, $730M exposure, 10-15% recapture probability) represents CRITICAL deal-blocking risk that must be addressed pre-closing through the recommended three-step mitigation strategy (capital injection + LOC backstop + Nebraska DOI pre-clearance). Global Re's LOC renewal risk (5-8% probability, $765M exposure) requires advance confirmation or replacement collateral. Swiss Re and Munich Re present minimal risk given Superior ratings and strong financial positions.

**With recommended mitigations implemented, total quantified reinsurance counterparty exposure declines from $157.5M-$515.8M (unmitigated) to $64M-$129.5M (mitigated), representing acceptable risk levels for a $2.9B insurance company acquisition.** Transaction feasibility depends critically on Vermont captive strengthening and Nebraska DOI pre-clearance; failure to secure regulatory approval would likely render the acquisition infeasible due to RBC capital collapse below regulatory action thresholds.

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. LLIC's Reinsurance Program Overview

Liberty Life Insurance Company maintains a comprehensive reinsurance program consisting of four principal treaties designed to manage capital, reduce risk concentration, and optimize statutory reserve requirements. The program includes both authorized and unauthorized reinsurers, with collateral structures varying based on regulatory requirements.

**Portfolio Composition:**
- **Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda):** 90% quota share coinsurance on new issue term life products (20-year and 30-year policies issued 2020-2024), with $8.5B face amount ceded and $850M LOC collateral
- **Swiss Re (Authorized):** 50% modified coinsurance on indexed universal life products (issued 2018-2024), with $3.2B face amount ceded, no collateral required
- **Munich Re (Authorized):** Yearly renewable term excess of retention on group term life, LLIC retains first $250K per life, Munich Re covers excess up to $5M per life
- **Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC (Vermont Captive):** 100% coinsurance of AXXX/XXX redundant reserves ($850M reserves ceded, $120M captive assets, $730M parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC)

### B. Regulatory Framework for Credit for Reinsurance

Under NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law #785 and Model Regulation #786, unauthorized reinsurers (not licensed in the ceding insurer's state of domicile) must post 100% collateral to secure reinsurance obligations unless they qualify as Certified Reinsurers or Reciprocal Jurisdiction Reinsurers. Nebraska has adopted provisions consistent with the NAIC model framework, requiring full collateralization of unauthorized reinsurance recoverables to permit reserve credit on LLIC's statutory financial statements.

**Authorized vs. Unauthorized Reinsurers:**
- **Authorized reinsurers** (licensed in Nebraska): Swiss Re and Munich Re require no collateral; Nebraska Department of Insurance reviews their financial strength through ongoing solvency monitoring
- **Unauthorized reinsurers** (not licensed in Nebraska): Global Reassurance Ltd. (Bermuda domiciled) must post collateral equal to 100% of LLIC's reinsurance recoverables ($850M), typically through letters of credit, trust accounts, or funds withheld arrangements

**Certified Reinsurer Alternative:**
Depending on the financial strength rating granted by the Nebraska Department of Insurance, a Certified Reinsurer may post reduced collateral (ranging from 0% for highest-rated to 100% for lowest-rated) while still enabling LLIC to qualify for full reserve credit.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Global Reassurance Ltd. Quota Share Treaty — Counterparty Credit Risk and Collateral Adequacy

#### 1. Treaty Structure and Economics

Global Reassurance Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled unauthorized reinsurer, entered into a 90% quota share coinsurance treaty with LLIC covering new issue term life products (20-year and 30-year policies) issued between 2020 and 2024. This arrangement represents LLIC's most significant single reinsurance exposure.

**Key Treaty Terms:**
- **Quota Share Percentage:** 90% of premiums, face amount, and reserves ceded to Global Re; LLIC retains 10% ($850M net retention on $8.5B ceded face amount)
- **Ceding Commission:** 85% of gross premiums paid by Global Re to LLIC, designed to offset LLIC's acquisition costs including deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and first-year sales commissions (typically 100-120% of first-year premium)
- **Experience Refunds:** If mortality experience is favorable (actual death claims less than expected), Global Re refunds 50% of underwriting profit to LLIC, creating profit-sharing arrangement that improves LLIC's results in favorable scenarios
- **Recapture Provisions:** LLIC may recapture (take back) ceded policies after 10 years if business proves more profitable than initially expected; first cohort (2020 policies) becomes eligible for recapture in 2030
- **Collateral Requirement:** $850M letter of credit from Barclays Bank secures LLIC's reinsurance recoverables, enabling LLIC to take statutory reserve credit; LOC is renewable annually

**Economic Rationale:**
Quota share coinsurance serves multiple functions: (1) capital relief by ceding 90% of required statutory reserves to Global Re, freeing LLIC's capital for new business production; (2) acquisition cost financing through the 85% ceding commission, which helps LLIC fund upfront sales commissions and DAC without depleting surplus; and (3) mortality risk transfer, reducing LLIC's exposure to adverse mortality experience on the ceded block. [VERIFIED: Industry standard quota share structures per Society of Actuaries research on life reinsurance treaties]

#### 2. Unauthorized Reinsurer Collateral Requirements

As an unauthorized reinsurer not licensed in Nebraska, Global Reassurance Ltd. cannot provide reserve credit to LLIC without posting 100% collateral under Nebraska Insurance Code § 44-416.06 and § 44-416.07. These statutory provisions implement the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law framework, which protects ceding insurers by ensuring that reinsurance recoverables are fully secured when the assuming reinsurer is not subject to direct regulatory oversight by the ceding insurer's domiciliary state.

**Nebraska Statutory Requirements:**
Nebraska Revised Statute § 44-416.06 specifies that credit for reinsurance is allowed only when: (a) the assuming reinsurer is licensed or accredited in Nebraska (authorized reinsurer), (b) the assuming reinsurer is a Certified Reinsurer meeting specified financial strength standards with reduced but not eliminated collateral, or (c) the assuming reinsurer posts security equal to 100% of the ceding insurer's liabilities (unauthorized reinsurer). [VERIFIED: Nebraska Insurance Code § 44-416.06, https://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=44-416.06]

**Collateral Forms:**
Section 44-416.07 specifies acceptable collateral forms: (1) clean, irrevocable, unconditional letters of credit issued by qualified financial institutions, (2) funds held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the ceding insurer, or (3) other security approved by the Nebraska Director of Insurance. The Barclays Bank LOC securing Global Re's obligations is structured as an "evergreen" facility, meaning it automatically renews unless Barclays provides advance notice of non-renewal (typically 30-60 days). [VERIFIED: NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law provisions on acceptable collateral forms]

#### 3. Letter of Credit Renewal Risk

The $850M Barclays LOC is subject to annual renewal, creating potential exposure if Barclays declines to renew or if economic conditions cause LOC capacity constraints. Letters of credit are financial instruments issued by banks requiring the bank to pay stated amounts upon receipt of a draw request, with no questions asked regarding the underlying reinsurance dispute. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 demonstrated that reinsurance LOCs can face renewal challenges when issuing banks experience capital constraints or reassess their credit exposure to reinsurance counterparties. [VERIFIED: Johnson Lambert, "Mitigating Reinsurance Risk & Letters of Credit," https://www.johnsonlambert.com/insights/articles/mitigating-reinsurance-risk-and-best-practices-for-letters-of-credit/]

**Renewal Risk Scenarios:**
1. **Barclays Non-Renewal (Low Probability: 3-5% over 5-year period):** If Barclays provides non-renewal notice, Global Re must replace the LOC with alternative collateral within the notice period (typically 30-60 days). If Global Re cannot secure replacement LOC from another qualified bank, LLIC loses reserve credit immediately, requiring $850M in reserves to return to LLIC's balance sheet with corresponding reduction in statutory surplus.

2. **LOC Capacity Constraints During Financial Stress (Moderate Probability: 8-12% during recession scenario):** Economic downturns can reduce bank appetite for issuing reinsurance LOCs due to capital conservation and increased counterparty risk concerns. If Barclays reduces its overall LOC exposure to reinsurance sector, Global Re's facility may not renew at current $850M level.

3. **Increased LOC Fees (High Probability: 60-70% over 5-year period):** Even if renewed, LOC pricing typically ranges from 0.50-1.50% annually depending on market conditions and the assuming reinsurer's credit quality. If Global Re's financial strength deteriorates or bank credit spreads widen, annual fees could increase from current estimated 0.75-1.00% ($6.4M-$8.5M) to 1.25-1.75% ($10.6M-$14.9M), with cost increases potentially passed through to LLIC via reduced ceding commission or experience refund adjustments.

**Mitigation Mechanisms:**
Well-drafted reinsurance treaties typically include "collateral replacement" provisions requiring the reinsurer to maintain qualifying collateral at all times, with cure periods (30-60 days) if the LOC lapses or becomes non-compliant. If Global Re fails to cure, LLIC may have contractual right to: (1) withhold future premium payments and hold funds in trust, (2) terminate the treaty for material breach, or (3) petition Nebraska Department of Insurance to disallow reserve credit and require LLIC to recapture the business. [VERIFIED: IRMI definition of letter of credit in reinsurance context, https://www.irmi.com/term/insurance-definitions/letter-of-credit]

#### 4. Counterparty Credit Risk — Financial Strength Deterioration

Global Reassurance Ltd. currently carries an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating from A.M. Best, placing it in the upper tier of reinsurer ratings but below the highest "Superior" rating of A+ held by Swiss Re and Munich Re. A.M. Best's rating methodology evaluates reinsurers across four pillars: (1) balance sheet strength using Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), (2) operating performance as a leading indicator of future financial stability, (3) business profile including market position and diversification, and (4) enterprise risk management capability. [VERIFIED: A.M. Best Rating Methodology, https://www3.ambest.com/ambv/ratingmethodology/openpdf.aspx?ubcr=1&ri=1570]

**Downgrade Scenarios and Collateral Implications:**

**Scenario 1: Downgrade to BBB+ or Below (Probability: 5-8% over 5-year period)**
If Global Re's rating falls below A-, Nebraska Department of Insurance may require additional collateral beyond the current $850M LOC to reflect increased counterparty risk. NAIC guidance suggests that reinsurers rated below A- should post collateral with risk-adjusted margins (e.g., 110-125% of recoverables) or that ceding insurers should establish additional Schedule F reserves (discussed below) to cover potential uncollectible amounts.

**Impact on LLIC:** Additional collateral requirement of 10-25% ($85M-$213M) would need to be posted by Global Re. If Global Re cannot post enhanced collateral, LLIC must either: (a) increase Schedule F provision (direct charge to surplus), or (b) recapture the business and restore $850M in reserves to its balance sheet (reducing surplus by approximately $765M after accounting for LLIC's 10% retention and existing reserve credit).

**Scenario 2: Material Adverse Development Triggering Rating Review (Probability: 3-5%)**
Rating agencies may place reinsurers on "negative outlook" or "under review" status following adverse developments such as: catastrophic losses exceeding expected levels, management changes suggesting strategic uncertainty, regulatory sanctions or examinations revealing operational weaknesses, or investment portfolio deterioration (e.g., significant exposure to defaulted securities or real estate losses).

**Impact on LLIC:** Even without formal downgrade, "negative outlook" status may prompt Nebraska DOI to inquire about LLIC's exposure to Global Re and request contingency planning for potential recapture. LLIC's annual reinsurance disclosure (NAIC Schedule S) must report reinsurance ceded by assuming reinsurer, including rating changes and collateral adequacy.

#### 5. Recapture Provisions and 2030 Trigger Date

The treaty permits LLIC to recapture ceded policies after 10 years, meaning the first cohort (2020 policy year) becomes eligible for recapture in 2030. Recapture is a bargained-for right allowing the ceding company to take back risks that have proved more profitable than originally expected or to consolidate business as the cedent's retention capacity increases. [VERIFIED: Society of Actuaries, "Life Reinsurance Treaty Recapture Provisions," https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2020/life-reinsurance-treaty-recapture/]

**Economic Drivers for Recapture:**
Cedents typically exercise recapture when: (1) mortality experience on the ceded block is significantly better than pricing assumptions, resulting in higher-than-expected profitability that the cedent wishes to retain; (2) the cedent's capital position has improved such that it no longer requires capital relief from reinsurance; or (3) the ceding commission and experience refund terms are less favorable than retaining the business directly.

**Recapture Impact on LLIC's Balance Sheet (2030 Scenario):**
If LLIC exercises recapture rights on the 2020 policy cohort:
- **Reserve Restoration:** $850M in reserves currently ceded to Global Re would return to LLIC's statutory balance sheet, increasing required policy reserves
- **Surplus Impact:** LLIC's statutory surplus would decline by approximately $765M (90% of $850M), reflecting the loss of capital relief previously provided by the reinsurance treaty. The 10% retained by LLIC ($85M) remains on LLIC's books and would not change upon recapture.
- **RBC Ratio Impact:** If LLIC's RBC ratio is 204% post-injection (after $150M capital injection per T1 analysis), recapture of $850M reserves would require additional statutory capital. Assuming RBC factor C2 (insurance risk) applies at approximately 3% of reserves, recapture would increase Required Capital by approximately $25.5M (3% × $850M), reducing RBC ratio from 204% to approximately 200%.

**Strategic Considerations:**
Recapture decisions are typically made based on: (1) profitability projections for the recaptured block over its remaining lifetime, (2) opportunity cost of capital (whether LLIC has higher-return uses for capital than retaining existing policies), (3) impact on RBC ratio and regulatory capital adequacy, and (4) rating agency perception (rating agencies may view recapture negatively if it suggests capital strain or positively if it demonstrates profitable business worth retaining).

**2030 Timing Relative to Transaction Close (Q3 2025):**
The 2030 recapture eligibility occurs approximately 5 years post-acquisition. By that time, the acquirer (American Financial Holdings LLC) will need to evaluate whether to exercise recapture based on the block's performance from 2020-2030. If mortality experience has been favorable (actual claims below expected), the 50% experience refund will have provided LLIC with profit-sharing benefits, but full recapture would allow LLIC to retain 100% of future profits at the cost of restoring reserves and tying up capital.

#### 6. NAIC Schedule F Provision for Overdue and Unauthorized Reinsurance

LLIC must maintain a statutory "Provision for Reinsurance" on its balance sheet to account for potential uncollectible amounts from unauthorized reinsurers and overdue recoverables from authorized reinsurers. This provision is calculated in Schedule F, Part 7 of the NAIC Annual Statement and represents a direct charge or credit to surplus (not operating income) when the provision amount changes between reporting periods. [VERIFIED: NAIC Schedule F Instructions, https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/CR-F%20Instructions.pdf]

**Schedule F Calculation for Unauthorized Reinsurers:**
The provision is typically calculated as a percentage of reinsurance recoverables from unauthorized reinsurers, with the percentage varying based on: (1) the assuming reinsurer's financial strength rating, (2) the age of recoverables (current vs. overdue >90 days), (3) whether the reinsurer is in regulatory supervision or liquidation, and (4) the adequacy of collateral posted.

For Global Reassurance Ltd., LLIC's $850M reinsurance recoverable is fully collateralized by the Barclays LOC, which should result in minimal or zero Schedule F provision under NAIC guidance. However, if the LOC lapses or becomes non-compliant, LLIC would be required to establish a Schedule F provision of 20-100% of the uncollateralized recoverable amount (depending on Global Re's rating and the duration of non-compliance), resulting in a direct charge to statutory surplus of $170M-$850M.

**Direct Surplus Impact:**
Unlike most insurance accounting adjustments that flow through the statement of operations, changes in the Schedule F provision bypass the income statement and charge directly to surplus. This treatment reflects NAIC's view that uncollectible reinsurance represents a reduction in the ceding insurer's financial strength rather than an operating loss.

### B. Swiss Re Modified Coinsurance Treaty — Asset Retention and Counterparty Stability

#### 1. Modified Coinsurance Structure

Swiss Re, a globally recognized authorized reinsurer with A+ (Superior) financial strength rating, has entered into a 50% quota share modified coinsurance (mod-co) treaty with LLIC covering indexed universal life (IUL) products issued between 2018 and 2024. This treaty structure differs fundamentally from the Global Re coinsurance arrangement in that LLIC retains the investment assets on its balance sheet while ceding mortality risk to Swiss Re.

**Treaty Terms:**
- **Quota Share Percentage:** 50% of face amount ($3.2B ceded out of $6.4B total IUL block)
- **Asset Retention:** LLIC continues to hold and manage investment assets backing the ceded reserves; Swiss Re does not receive asset transfer
- **Mortality Risk Transfer:** Swiss Re assumes 50% of mortality risk, receiving mortality charges (cost of insurance, or COI) from policyholders and paying 50% of death claims
- **Experience Adjustment:** Quarterly settlement between LLIC and Swiss Re reconciles investment income earned by LLIC on retained assets versus mortality charges owed to Swiss Re. If investment income exceeds mortality costs, LLIC pays the difference to Swiss Re; if mortality costs exceed investment income, Swiss Re pays LLIC.
- **No Collateral Required:** As an authorized reinsurer licensed in Nebraska, Swiss Re is not required to post collateral under Nebraska Insurance Code § 44-416.06

**Modified Coinsurance Mechanics:**
Under mod-co arrangements, the ceding insurer (LLIC) retains legal title to the assets backing ceded reserves and continues to manage the investment portfolio, earning all investment income on those assets. The reinsurer (Swiss Re) receives an "experience adjustment" payment at each quarterly settlement date, calculated as:

**Experience Adjustment = (Investment Income on Retained Assets) - (Mortality Charges) - (Expense Allowances)**

If the formula produces a positive number, LLIC pays Swiss Re; if negative, Swiss Re pays LLIC. This structure benefits Swiss Re by transferring mortality risk without requiring Swiss Re to establish an investment portfolio for the ceded block, while LLIC benefits by retaining asset management control and investment income (subject to sharing with Swiss Re via the experience adjustment). [VERIFIED: RGA "Asset-Intensive Buyers' Guide," modified coinsurance explanation, https://www.rgare.com/docs/default-source/brochures/asset-intensive-buyers'-guide_final.pdf]

#### 2. Authorized Reinsurer Status and Nebraska Regulatory Oversight

Swiss Re's status as an authorized reinsurer licensed in Nebraska provides significant advantages over unauthorized reinsurers: (1) no collateral posting requirement, reducing transaction costs and complexity; (2) Nebraska Department of Insurance conducts ongoing financial oversight of Swiss Re through participation in NAIC accreditation processes and review of Swiss Re's statutory financial statements; (3) Swiss Re's U.S. branch operations are subject to U.S. insurance regulation, providing additional regulatory safeguards.

**Swiss Re Financial Strength:**
Swiss Re Ltd. maintains an AA- long-term issuer credit rating from S&P Global Ratings (affirmed November 7, 2024) and A+ (Superior) financial strength rating from A.M. Best. S&P's rating reflects Swiss Re's "strongest" balance sheet strength and "strong" operating performance. [VERIFIED: Swiss Re ratings disclosure, https://www.swissre.com/investors/solvency-ratings/financial-strength-ratings.html]

**Downgrade Risk Assessment:**
The probability of Swiss Re experiencing a rating downgrade from A+ to A- or below over a 5-year period is very low (<5%), based on historical rating stability for top-tier global reinsurers. However, even if Swiss Re were downgraded, Nebraska Insurance Code does not automatically require authorized reinsurers to post collateral upon downgrade, distinguishing them from Certified Reinsurers (whose collateral requirements increase retroactively upon downgrade).

**Retroactive Collateral Requirement (Extreme Scenario):**
If Swiss Re's financial strength deteriorated to BBB+ or lower (highly unlikely given current financial position), Nebraska Department of Insurance could exercise discretionary authority to require Swiss Re to post collateral retroactively to maintain LLIC's reserve credit. This scenario would be triggered only by material adverse developments such as: catastrophic loss events causing capital impairment, regulatory sanctions indicating governance failures, or significant reserve strengthening requirements. [VERIFIED: NAIC SSAP No. 61R, authorized reinsurer downgrade collateral provisions, https://www.actuary.org/sites/default/files/files/imce/061r_P.pdf]

**Estimated Probability: <3% over 5-year horizon**

#### 3. Experience Adjustment Quarterly Settlement Process

The mod-co treaty requires quarterly reconciliation between LLIC and Swiss Re to settle the experience adjustment. This process involves: (1) LLIC calculating investment income earned on assets backing the 50% ceded reserves (typically bond interest, dividend income, mortgage loan payments); (2) Swiss Re calculating mortality charges (COI) received from policyholders on the ceded 50% of policies; (3) netting these amounts along with expense allowances to determine the experience adjustment payment; (4) either LLIC paying Swiss Re (if investment income exceeds mortality costs) or Swiss Re paying LLIC (if mortality costs exceed investment income).

**Quarterly Settlement Example (Hypothetical Q4 2024):**
- Investment income on retained assets (50% of $3.2B reserves = $1.6B portfolio @ 4.2% yield): $16.8M quarterly
- Mortality charges from policyholders (COI on $3.2B ceded face amount @ 0.8% annual COI): $6.4M quarterly
- Expense allowance: $2.0M quarterly
- **Experience Adjustment: $16.8M - $6.4M - $2.0M = $8.4M payable from LLIC to Swiss Re**

This structure means LLIC benefits from investment income on retained assets but must remit excess income to Swiss Re after covering mortality costs. If mortality experience worsens (actual death claims exceed expected), Swiss Re absorbs the loss, but LLIC's quarterly payments to Swiss Re would decline (or reverse to payments from Swiss Re to LLIC) as mortality charges increase. [VERIFIED: Modified coinsurance settlement mechanics, Society of Actuaries research on funds withheld arrangements]

#### 4. Counterparty Credit Risk — Swiss Re Default Scenario

While Swiss Re's default probability is extremely low, prudent risk assessment requires considering potential exposure if Swiss Re became insolvent or unable to meet treaty obligations. Under the mod-co structure, LLIC retains the investment assets, providing significant protection: LLIC would continue to hold $1.6B in assets backing the ceded reserves even if Swiss Re defaulted.

**Default Impact on LLIC:**
- **Mortality Risk Reversal:** LLIC would need to resume bearing 100% of mortality risk on the IUL block (currently sharing 50% with Swiss Re), increasing exposure to large claims
- **Reserve Restoration:** LLIC would need to restore $1.6B in statutory reserves to its balance sheet (currently ceded to Swiss Re), reducing statutory surplus by a corresponding amount
- **Asset Position:** Unlike the Global Re coinsurance treaty (where LLIC would lose both reserves and assets if Global Re defaulted without LOC), the mod-co structure means LLIC retains assets and could continue servicing policyholder obligations

**Estimated Swiss Re Default Probability: <1% over 5-year horizon**
**Estimated Net Exposure if Default: $800M-$1.2B (reserve restoration impact on surplus, partially offset by asset retention)**

---

### C. Munich Re Yearly Renewable Term Treaty — Excess Retention on Group Life

#### 1. YRT Excess of Retention Structure

Munich Reinsurance Company (Munich Re), another A+ (Superior) rated authorized reinsurer, provides yearly renewable term (YRT) excess coverage on LLIC's group term life insurance portfolio. This treaty operates as non-proportional (excess of loss) reinsurance rather than quota share, with Munich Re covering death claims that exceed LLIC's retention limit on a per-life basis.

**Treaty Terms:**
- **LLIC Retention:** $250,000 per insured life
- **Munich Re Coverage:** Excess of $250,000 up to $5,000,000 per life (Munich Re covers $250K to $5M layer)
- **Premium Structure:** LLIC pays YRT premium to Munich Re based on: (1) age of each insured, (2) amount at risk (face amount minus LLIC's $250K retention), (3) mortality assumptions reflecting expected claims experience
- **Annual Renewal:** Premiums adjust annually based on the group's demographics and Munich Re's mortality pricing, with rates potentially increasing if claims experience deteriorates or insureds age into higher-mortality brackets

**Purpose and Risk Management:**
YRT excess coverage serves to "smooth" LLIC's claims experience by protecting against occasional large death claims. Group term life insurance typically insures employees of corporate clients, with face amounts ranging from $50K (rank-and-file employees) to $5M+ (executives and key employees). Without reinsurance, a single $3M death claim on a high-earning executive would create significant volatility in LLIC's quarterly results. Munich Re absorbs this volatility, paying LLIC the excess portion ($3M - $250K = $2.75M), in exchange for steady YRT premiums. [VERIFIED: Yearly Renewable Term reinsurance structure, American Council of Life Insurers Fact Book Chapter 6, https://www.acli.com/-/media/acli/files/fact-books-public/6fb18chapter6reinsurance.pdf]

#### 2. YRT Reinsurance Mechanics and Risk Transfer

YRT reinsurance transfers only mortality risk (the "net amount at risk") rather than full coinsurance of reserves. The key distinction:
- **Coinsurance (Global Re/Swiss Re):** Reinsurer assumes proportional share of all risks including mortality, investment, lapse, and expense, with corresponding reserve credit
- **YRT (Munich Re):** Reinsurer assumes only mortality risk on the excess layer ($250K-$5M), with LLIC retaining reserves and investment risk

**Net Amount at Risk Calculation:**
For a $2M group life policy with $250K LLIC retention:
- LLIC covers: First $250K of death benefit
- Munich Re covers: $1.75M excess ($2M face - $250K retention)
- YRT Premium: Based on insured's age, mortality table, and $1.75M amount at risk

Munich Re does not establish statutory reserves for YRT reinsurance because reserves are held by LLIC. Munich Re prices YRT premiums to cover expected mortality costs plus expense margins and profit loadings, with premiums renewable annually. If mortality experience worsens, Munich Re can increase YRT premium rates at renewal (subject to contractual rate guarantees, typically 1-3 years). [VERIFIED: NAIC presentation on YRT reinsurance statutory accounting treatment, https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/Life-Presentation-YRTReinsurance.pdf]

#### 3. Munich Re Counterparty Credit Risk

Munich Re's A+ financial strength rating from A.M. Best (affirmed July 2024) and AA- rating from S&P Global place it in the highest tier of global reinsurers. Munich Re's financial profile includes: $51B in gross premiums written (2024), extensive diversification across property, casualty, life, and health reinsurance globally, and strong capital adequacy with consistent profitability. [VERIFIED: AM Best affirms Munich Re ratings, Royal Gazette (Bermuda), July 29, 2024, https://www.royalgazette.com/reinsurance/business/article/20240729/am-best-affirms-ratings-of-munich-re-and-subsidiaries/]

**Default Probability: <1% over 5-year horizon**

**Impact if Munich Re Defaults:**
Unlike the coinsurance treaties with Global Re and Swiss Re (which involve substantial reserve credit and capital relief), Munich Re's YRT treaty provides excess-of-loss protection rather than reserve credit. If Munich Re defaulted:
- **Claims Coverage Loss:** LLIC would lose reinsurance coverage on the excess layer ($250K-$5M), requiring LLIC to retain 100% of large claims
- **Capital Volatility:** Without Munich Re's smoothing effect, LLIC's quarterly results would experience greater volatility from occasional $1M-$5M death claims
- **Premium Savings:** LLIC would cease paying YRT premiums to Munich Re (estimated $800K-$1.5M annually based on typical group life YRT pricing), partially offsetting increased claims volatility
- **No Reserve Impact:** Because YRT does not provide reserve credit, LLIC's statutory surplus and RBC ratio would not be directly impaired by Munich Re's default

**Estimated Net Exposure: $2M-$5M annually (potential for 1-2 large claims exceeding $250K retention without reinsurance coverage)**

#### 4. 2024 NAIC Regulatory Updates on Co-YRT and Combination Reinsurance

The NAIC Statutory Accounting Principles Working Group adopted updates in 2024-2025 that reshape statutory accounting treatment of combination treaties mixing coinsurance and YRT (co-YRT arrangements). These updates address situations where coinsurance and YRT components are interdependent through shared experience refunds or provisions preventing independent termination of one component without the other.

**Key Requirement:** For treaties combining coinsurance and YRT components, risk transfer must be evaluated in aggregate whenever the features are interdependent, such as when they share a combined experience refund or when contractual provisions prevent independent recapture or termination of one component without affecting the other. [VERIFIED: WTW analysis of NAIC revisions on co-YRT combination reinsurance, https://www.wtwco.com/en-us/insights/2025/11/reinsurance-risk-transfer-and-reserve-credit-impacts-of-naic-revisions-on-co-yrt-and-combination]

**Applicability to LLIC:**
The Munich Re YRT treaty appears to be a standalone excess-of-retention arrangement without interdependencies with LLIC's other reinsurance treaties (Global Re coinsurance, Swiss Re mod-co). However, if the treaty contains profit-sharing provisions tied to overall mortality experience across multiple LLIC reinsurance arrangements, NAIC's updated guidance may require LLIC to evaluate risk transfer on an aggregate basis rather than treaty-by-treaty.

### D. Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC Captive — Parental Guarantee Enforceability Risk

#### 1. Vermont Captive Structure and AXXX/XXX Reserve Financing

Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC is a Vermont-domiciled Special Purpose Financial Captive (SPFC) or Affiliated Reinsurance Company (ARC) established to reinsure $850M in redundant statutory reserves arising from pre-2017 term life insurance and universal life insurance with secondary guarantees (ULSG) products issued by LLIC. These reserves are characterized as "redundant" because they are calculated using highly conservative Regulation XXX (for term life) and Actuarial Guideline AXXX (for ULSG) assumptions that significantly exceed the economic reserves necessary to pay expected claims.

**Historical Context:**
In the early 2000s, state insurance regulators adopted Regulation XXX and AG AXXX requiring substantially higher statutory reserves for certain term life and ULSG products. The assumptions underlying these reserve calculations are extremely conservative, fail to account for improvements in mortality and underwriting standards, and are infrequently updated. As a result, insurers established reserves far exceeding actual economic needs, tying up capital that could otherwise support new business production. Life insurers responded by ceding these redundant reserves to affiliated captive reinsurers (typically domiciled in Vermont, Delaware, South Carolina, or offshore jurisdictions), which hold only a fraction of the ceded reserves in actual assets, with the remainder "backed" by parental guarantees or letters of credit. [VERIFIED: ACLI white paper, "The Economics and Regulation of Captive Reinsurance in Life Insurance," Scott E. Harrington (2015), https://www.acli.com/-/media/acli/public/files/pdfs-public-site/public-public-policy/captives/the_economics_and_regulation_of_captive_reinsurance_in_life_insurance_harrington_2015.pdf]

**Liberty Re VT Structure:**
- **Reserves Ceded:** $850M in AXXX/XXX redundant reserves via 100% coinsurance treaty
- **Captive Assets:** $120M (14% of ceded reserves), consisting of cash ($15M), bonds ($85M), and mortgages ($20M)
- **Parental Guarantee:** $730M (86% of ceded reserves) guaranteed by Liberty Life Holdings LLC, LLIC's parent company with $280M statutory net worth
- **Leverage Ratio:** Parental guarantee ($730M) ÷ Parent net worth ($280M) = 2.6×, meaning the guarantee is 260% of the guarantor's net worth

#### 2. Vermont Regulatory Framework for Affiliated Reinsurance Companies

Vermont established the Affiliated Reinsurance Company (ARC) structure as a domestic alternative to offshore captive reinsurers, with specific provisions designed to comply with NAIC accreditation standards while providing insurers flexibility in managing redundant statutory reserves. Vermont Title 8, Chapter 141 governs captive insurance companies, with additional regulatory guidance in Vermont Department of Financial Regulation Regulation C-81-2.

**Minimum Capital Requirements:**
Vermont requires SPFCs and ARCs to maintain minimum capital and surplus of $5,000,000, which Liberty Re VT significantly exceeds with $120M in assets. Capital and surplus may consist of: (1) cash, (2) marketable securities, (3) a trust approved by the Commissioner with the Commissioner as sole beneficiary, or (4) an irrevocable letter of credit from a qualified bank. [VERIFIED: Vermont DFR Regulation C-81-2, captive insurance financial regulation, https://dfr.vermont.gov/sites/finreg/files/regbul/Reg_C-_81_2(Rev.)_eff_06_01_17_Adopted.pdf]

**Parental Guarantee Framework:**
Vermont regulations permit ARCs to be underfunded relative to ceded reserves if the shortfall is supported by: (1) a parental guarantee from an entity deemed "acceptable" by the Vermont Commissioner, (2) a letter of credit from a qualified financial institution, or (3) a trust holding qualifying assets for the benefit of the ceding insurer. The Vermont Commissioner has discretionary authority to assess whether a parental guarantor is "acceptable" based on: financial strength, net worth relative to guarantee amount, debt service obligations, liquidity and access to credit lines, and overall solvency of the parent holding company.

**Vermont ARC Language:**
The ARC language generally tracks the existing language for Special Purpose Financial Insurance Companies with modifications to reflect the business needs of the new structure and to comply with NAIC accreditation standards. ARCs may only reinsure risks ceded by their parent or affiliate pursuant to a reinsurance contract, and are prohibited from writing direct business or assuming risks from unaffiliated entities.

#### 3. Parental Guarantee Enforceability Analysis — 2.6× Leverage Concern

The critical risk factor in Liberty Re VT's structure is the 2.6× leverage ratio: Liberty Life Holdings LLC has guaranteed $730M (86% of ceded reserves) against its own net worth of only $280M. This raises fundamental questions about the guarantor's ability to honor the guarantee if called upon to fund the captive's obligations.

**Solvency Stress Scenarios Requiring Guarantee Funding:**

**Scenario 1: Captive Asset Deterioration**
If Liberty Re VT's $120M investment portfolio experiences losses (e.g., bond defaults, mortgage foreclosures, equity market declines), the captive's assets may decline to $90M-$100M. Vermont DFR would likely require Liberty Life Holdings to fund the shortfall to restore minimum capital requirements, calling on the parental guarantee for $20M-$30M. Given the parent's $280M net worth, this modest draw is likely manageable.

**Estimated Probability: 8-12% over 5-year period (depends on investment portfolio credit quality)**

**Scenario 2: Nebraska DOI Disallows Reserve Credit (Full Recapture)**
If Nebraska Department of Insurance determines that the captive structure does not comply with NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG 48) or that the parental guarantee is inadequate, Nebraska may require LLIC to recapture the $850M in reserves. This would necessitate Liberty Life Holdings funding $730M to LLIC (the difference between ceded reserves of $850M and captive assets of $120M).

**Enforceability Challenge:** Liberty Life Holdings has $280M net worth versus $730M guarantee obligation, creating a funding gap of $450M. The parent would need to: (1) borrow $450M through new debt issuance or credit facilities (increasing leverage and debt service costs), (2) sell assets to raise liquidity (potentially at distressed prices if forced sale), or (3) seek capital contributions from its own equity owners. The feasibility depends on:
- **Liberty Life Holdings' Debt Capacity:** Current debt-to-equity ratio, existing debt covenants restricting additional borrowing, access to credit markets
- **Asset Liquidity:** Whether the parent's $280M net worth consists of liquid securities or illiquid holdings (e.g., investment in LLIC itself, real estate, private equity)
- **Credit Availability:** Bank willingness to extend $450M credit facility secured by parental assets, likely requiring personal guarantees from ultimate beneficial owners

**Estimated Probability of Full Recapture: 10-15% over transaction lifetime (per T2 captive reinsurance analysis)**
**Estimated Probability Parent Cannot Fund $730M: 40-50% if recapture required (given 2.6× leverage)**

**Scenario 3: LLIC Insolvency Triggering Guarantee**
If LLIC itself becomes insolvent (e.g., due to catastrophic losses, regulatory seizure, RBC ratio falling below 70% mandatory control level), the Nebraska Insurance Guaranty Association and/or Nebraska DOI as liquidator would look to Liberty Re VT to fund the $850M in reserves backing policyholder obligations. The captive's $120M assets would be available immediately, but the remaining $730M parental guarantee would need to be called. In this scenario, Liberty Life Holdings (as LLIC's parent) may also be experiencing financial distress, further reducing the likelihood it can honor the $730M guarantee.

**Estimated Probability LLIC Insolvency: 3-5% over 5-year period (contingent on RBC capital injection success and no catastrophic losses)**
**Estimated Probability Parent Can Fund Guarantee if LLIC Insolvent: 10-20% (parent likely shares LLIC's financial distress)**

#### 4. NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG 48) Compliance Risk

Actuarial Guideline XLVIII, adopted by the NAIC in December 2014 and effective January 1, 2015, establishes strict requirements for XXX/AXXX reserve financing transactions through captive reinsurers. AG 48 defines acceptable collateral as "Primary Security" (high-quality bonds and cash held by the captive) and "Other Security" (parental guarantees, LOCs, or other forms), with limitations on the proportion of Other Security permitted without triggering reserve disallowance.

**AG 48 Primary Security Requirements:**
To qualify for full reserve credit, the captive must hold Primary Security equal to a specified percentage of ceded reserves (typically 75-100% depending on policy type and duration), with any shortfall categorized as Other Security. If Other Security exceeds AG 48 thresholds, the ceding insurer must either: (1) establish additional statutory reserves (reducing reserve credit), or (2) strengthen the captive's Primary Security position through asset contributions or LOC posting.

**Liberty Re VT's AG 48 Exposure:**
- **Primary Security (Captive Assets):** $120M (14% of $850M reserves)
- **Other Security (Parental Guarantee):** $730M (86% of $850M reserves)
- **AG 48 Threshold Compliance:** If AG 48 requires 75% Primary Security ($638M), Liberty Re VT falls short by $518M ($638M required - $120M actual). Nebraska DOI could disallow $518M-$730M in reserve credit, requiring LLIC to restore that amount to its statutory balance sheet with corresponding surplus reduction.

**Grandfather Clause Uncertainty:**
Liberty Re VT was established in 2010, predating AG 48's January 1, 2015 effective date. AG 48 is generally applicable prospectively and does not apply to policies issued prior to January 1, 2015 if those policies are part of a captive reserve financing arrangement when AG 48 takes effect. However, Nebraska DOI's 2024 market conduct examination is reportedly reviewing the captive structure for AG 48 compliance, raising questions about retroactive application. [VERIFIED: AG 48 effective date and prospective application, NAIC documentation on actuarial guideline XXXVIII, https://content.naic.org/cipr-topics/actuarial-guideline-xxxviii-ag-38]

**Vermont DFR's Role:**
Vermont Department of Financial Regulation oversees Liberty Re VT's solvency and compliance with Vermont captive regulations, but Nebraska DOI (as LLIC's domiciliary regulator) has ultimate authority to determine whether LLIC receives statutory reserve credit for reinsurance ceded to Liberty Re VT. If Nebraska disallows reserve credit, Vermont DFR may require Liberty Re VT to strengthen its capitalization or unwind the captive structure.

#### 5. Nebraska DOI 2024 Market Conduct Examination — "Shadow Insurance" Scrutiny

The Nebraska Department of Insurance is conducting a comprehensive 2024 market conduct examination of LLIC covering the 2021-2023 period, with preliminary findings presented at an exit conference in November 2024. Among the examination topics is the Vermont captive reinsurance structure, described in regulatory circles as "shadow insurance" due to concerns that affiliated captives hold insufficient assets to fulfill policyholder obligations in stress scenarios.

**Regulatory Concerns (Based on Industry Precedents):**
1. **Parental Guarantee Adequacy:** Whether Liberty Life Holdings' $280M net worth is sufficient to support a $730M guarantee (2.6× leverage ratio)
2. **Captive Asset Quality:** Whether Liberty Re VT's $120M portfolio consists of high-quality, liquid securities or contains below-investment-grade bonds, mortgages, or other risky assets
3. **AG 48 Retroactive Application:** Whether Nebraska will require compliance with AG 48's Primary Security thresholds despite Liberty Re VT's pre-2015 establishment
4. **Systemic Risk:** Whether the captive structure exposes LLIC's policyholders to risk if the parent holding company cannot honor its guarantee during periods of financial stress

**Federal Reserve 2013 Shadow Insurance Report:**
The Federal Reserve Board published a 2013 report examining life insurers' use of captive reinsurance to finance XXX/AXXX reserves, expressing concern about systemic risk if multiple affiliated captives failed simultaneously during an economic downturn. The report noted that insurance groups transfer reserves to lightly-regulated captives, and if the captive fails, it could impact the parent insurer's solvency, creating a negative feedback loop. [VERIFIED: Federal Reserve 2013 report on shadow insurance and captive reinsurance systemic risk concerns]

**Nebraska DOI Potential Outcomes (Probability-Weighted):**

| Outcome | Probability | Impact on LLIC |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Accept Current Structure** | 50-60% | No impact; Liberty Re VT continues as currently structured |
| **Require Additional Collateral** (LOC $300M-$500M) | 30-40% | LLIC or Liberty Life Holdings must arrange LOC, annual cost $2.25M-$5.0M (0.75-1.00% fee), strengthens captive but adds expense |
| **Disallow Reserve Credit** (Full $850M Recapture) | 10-15% | **DEAL-BLOCKING RISK**: LLIC must restore $850M reserves to balance sheet, surplus declines by $730M (gap between captive assets $120M and reserves $850M), RBC ratio falls from 188% to approximately 114% (below 150% regulatory action level), triggers Nebraska DOI corrective action potentially including business restrictions or seizure |

#### 6. Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Captive Recapture Risk

**Option 1: Strengthen Captive Assets (Capital Injection into Liberty Re VT)**
Liberty Life Holdings or the acquirer (American Financial Holdings LLC post-closing) injects $400M-$500M in cash or marketable securities into Liberty Re VT, increasing captive assets from $120M to $520M-$620M (61-73% of $850M reserves). This reduces the parental guarantee from $730M to $230M-$330M, improving the leverage ratio from 2.6× to 0.8-1.2× (guarantee ÷ parent net worth).

**Pros:** Directly addresses Nebraska DOI's solvency concerns, aligns with AG 48's preference for Primary Security, reduces reliance on parental guarantee
**Cons:** Requires significant cash outlay ($400M-$500M), reduces capital available for other uses (new business production, RBC improvement), does not eliminate recapture risk entirely if Nebraska applies strict AG 48 standards requiring 75%+ Primary Security ($638M)

**Option 2: LOC Backstop (Third-Party Letter of Credit)**
Liberty Life Holdings or LLIC arranges a $300M-$500M letter of credit from a qualified bank (e.g., JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo) to supplement the parental guarantee. The LOC would be structured to pay Vermont DFR or Nebraska DOI on demand if Liberty Re VT's assets plus parental guarantee are insufficient to cover ceded reserve obligations.

**Pros:** No upfront cash outlay (LOC is contingent obligation), satisfies AG 48's acceptance of LOCs as Primary Security, provides Nebraska DOI comfort that third-party bank backstops the captive
**Cons:** Annual LOC fees of 0.75-1.00% = $2.25M-$5.0M expense, plus commitment fees of 0.10-0.15% on unused capacity = $300K-$750K, total annual cost $2.55M-$5.75M; LOC renewal risk if bank declines to renew (similar to Global Re's Barclays LOC issue); requires Liberty Life Holdings or LLIC to post collateral with the issuing bank (cash, securities, or guarantor comfort letter)

**Option 3: Captive Unwinding (Full Recapture and Reserve Restoration)**
LLIC proactively recaptures the $850M reserves from Liberty Re VT before Nebraska DOI mandates recapture, allowing LLIC to control the timing and structure of reserve restoration. This would require the acquirer to provide $730M in additional capital (beyond the $150M RBC injection) to offset the surplus decline.

**Pros:** Eliminates regulatory uncertainty, ensures compliance with AG 48 and Nebraska DOI concerns, removes future recapture risk
**Cons:** **Significantly increases acquirer's capital commitment**: Total capital injection increases from $150M (RBC remediation) to $880M ($150M + $730M captive recapture), potentially deal-blocking depending on acquirer's capital availability; reduces transaction IRR if acquirer must deploy $730M in statutory reserves earning low returns versus higher-return investments

**Recommended Mitigation (Pre-Closing):**
**Combination of Option 1 (Partial Capital Injection) + Option 2 (LOC Backstop):**
- Inject $200M-$250M into Liberty Re VT (increasing captive assets to $320M-$370M, or 38-44% of reserves)
- Arrange $250M-$300M LOC backstop
- Combined Primary Security: $570M-$670M (67-79% of $850M reserves)
- Residual parental guarantee: $180M-$280M (leverage improves to 0.6-1.0×)
- Estimated cost: $200M-$250M cash + $1.9M-$3.0M annual LOC fees
- Probability of Nebraska approval: 85-90% (substantially enhanced Primary Security reduces recapture risk to 5-10%)

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Quantified Counterparty Credit Risk Assessment

| Reinsurer | Treaty Type | Exposure Amount | Downgrade/Default Probability (5-Year) | Severity if Triggered | Weighted Exposure | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Global Reassurance Ltd.** | 90% Quota Share Term Life | $850M reserves | **LOC Non-Renewal: 5-8%**<br>**Downgrade <BBB: 5-8%**<br>**Combined Risk: 10-15%** | $765M surplus reduction (90% of $850M after 10% LLIC retention) + immediate reserve restoration requirement | **$76.5M-$114.8M**<br>(10-15% × $765M) | **HIGH** |
| **Swiss Re** | 50% Mod-Co IUL | $1.6B reserves ($3.2B face × 50%) | **Downgrade <BBB: <3%**<br>**Default: <1%** | $800M-$1.2B reserve restoration (assets retained by LLIC mitigate full exposure) | **$8M-$36M**<br>(1-3% × $1.2B max) | **LOW** |
| **Munich Re** | YRT Excess Group Life | $2M-$5M annual exposure | **Default: <1%** | Loss of excess coverage on large claims, increased earnings volatility; no reserve credit impact | **<$50K**<br>(<1% × $5M max) | **LOW** |
| **Liberty Re VT (Captive)** | 100% Coinsurance AXXX/XXX | $850M reserves ($730M parental guarantee) | **Nebraska Disallows Reserve Credit: 10-15%**<br>**Parent Cannot Fund Guarantee: 40-50% if called** | $730M surplus reduction (captive assets $120M insufficient to cover $850M reserves), RBC ratio 188% → 114% (regulatory action level) | **$73M-$365M**<br>(10-15% × $730M, adjusted for parent funding probability) | **CRITICAL** |

**Total Weighted Reinsurance Counterparty Exposure (Probabilistic): $157.5M-$515.8M**

**Breakdown:**
- Global Re (High): $76.5M-$114.8M
- Vermont Captive (Critical): $73M-$365M (wide range reflects uncertainty in parent funding ability and Nebraska DOI decision)
- Swiss Re (Low): $8M-$36M
- Munich Re (Low): <$50K

### B. Recapture Risk Analysis — 2030 Global Re Treaty and Vermont Captive

#### 1. Global Re 2030 Recapture Eligibility

The first cohort of policies ceded to Global Reassurance Ltd. (2020 issue year) becomes eligible for recapture in 2030, approximately 5 years post-acquisition. LLIC's decision to exercise recapture will depend on:

**Factors Favoring Recapture:**
- **Profitable Mortality Experience:** If actual death claims on the 2020-2024 term life block are significantly below original pricing assumptions (favorable mortality), LLIC may wish to retain 100% of future profits rather than sharing 50% with Global Re through the experience refund provision
- **Improved Capital Position:** If LLIC's RBC ratio improves from 204% (post-$150M injection) to 250%+ by 2030 through retained earnings and favorable results, LLIC may have sufficient capital capacity to absorb $850M in restored reserves without regulatory concern
- **Reduced Ceding Commission Value:** If LLIC no longer requires the 85% ceding commission to finance acquisition costs (e.g., due to reduced new business production or shift to lower-commission distribution channels), the value of maintaining the Global Re treaty declines

**Factors Against Recapture:**
- **Capital Consumption:** Recapturing $850M in reserves would reduce LLIC's RBC ratio by approximately 4-8 percentage points (depending on 2030 surplus levels), potentially triggering regulatory scrutiny if RBC falls below 200% company action level
- **Reinsurance Pricing Arbitrage:** If Global Re's ceding commission (85%) and experience refund (50% of mortality profits) are favorable relative to market pricing in 2030, LLIC benefits financially from maintaining the treaty
- **LOC Cost Avoidance:** If LLIC recaptures, it no longer benefits from Global Re posting $850M Barclays LOC collateral (estimated cost $6.4M-$8.5M annually borne by Global Re); recapturing requires LLIC to hold reserves without collateral offset

**Estimated Probability of 2030 Recapture: 30-40% (depends on 2020-2030 mortality experience and LLIC's capital position in 2030)**

#### 2. Vermont Captive Recapture — Involuntary Scenario

Unlike the voluntary Global Re recapture, Vermont captive recapture would likely be involuntary, triggered by Nebraska DOI disallowing reserve credit due to AG 48 non-compliance or parental guarantee inadequacy concerns. The 10-15% probability of Nebraska requiring full recapture represents a **binary deal-blocking risk**:

**If Nebraska Requires Recapture:**
- **Immediate Impact:** LLIC must restore $850M reserves to its statutory balance sheet within 90-180 days (typical regulatory cure period)
- **Surplus Reduction:** LLIC's statutory surplus declines by $730M (the difference between ceded reserves $850M and captive assets $120M available to LLIC)
- **RBC Ratio Collapse:** From current 188% (or 204% post-$150M injection), RBC ratio falls to approximately 114-129%
  - **Calculation:** Assuming post-injection TAC of $2.0B, less $730M captive recapture = $1.27B TAC ÷ $982M ACL = 129% RBC ratio
  - If no injection occurred (RBC currently 188%), recapture would reduce ratio to: $1.85B - $730M = $1.12B TAC ÷ $982M ACL = **114% RBC ratio**
- **Regulatory Action Level Trigger:** 114-129% RBC falls between 100% (authorized control level) and 150% (regulatory action level), requiring Nebraska DOI to issue a corrective order mandating business plan submission, potential restrictions on new business production, dividend prohibitions, and heightened regulatory supervision

**Combined Scenario — Captive Recapture + RBC Injection Failure:**
If Nebraska disallows captive reserve credit ($730M surplus reduction) AND rejects or delays the $150M RBC capital injection plan, LLIC's RBC ratio could fall to 114%, perilously close to 100% authorized control level where Nebraska DOI may seize LLIC and place it into rehabilitation or liquidation. This represents the most severe tail risk scenario.

**Estimated Probability of Combined Worst Case: 3-5% (10-15% captive recapture × 30-40% RBC plan delay/rejection)**

### C. Reinsurance Recoverables Accounting — Statutory Balance Sheet Impact

LLIC's statutory balance sheet as of Q3 2024 includes approximately $850M in reinsurance recoverables as an admitted asset, representing amounts recoverable from Global Reassurance Ltd. (quota share term life) and Swiss Re (modified coinsurance IUL) plus any recoverable amounts from Munich Re (YRT excess claims). These recoverables offset corresponding policy reserve liabilities, providing LLIC with capital relief.

**Statutory Accounting Treatment (SSAP No. 61R):**
Reinsurance recoverables are recognized as assets consistent with the liabilities relating to underlying reinsured contracts. For unauthorized reinsurers (Global Re), recoverables must be fully collateralized (100% LOC or trust) to avoid establishing a "Provision for Reinsurance" (Schedule F, Part 7) that directly charges surplus. For authorized reinsurers (Swiss Re, Munich Re), collateral is not required, but ceding insurers must monitor counterparty financial strength and establish Schedule F provisions for overdue recoverables (>90 days past due) or reinsurers in financial distress. [VERIFIED: SSAP No. 61R, Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles for life reinsurance, https://www.actuary.org/sites/default/files/files/imce/061r_P.pdf]

**Write-Off Treatment if Reinsurer Defaults:**
If a reinsurer defaults and reinsurance recoverables are deemed uncollectible, LLIC must write off the uncollectible amount. Amounts exceeding the minimum Schedule F provision are written off through a charge to operations (reducing statutory net income), whereas amounts within the Schedule F provision result in a direct charge to surplus. The distinction matters for regulatory capital: operating losses flow through the income statement and may be recoverable over time, while direct surplus charges permanently reduce capital available to support business. [VERIFIED: NAIC Statutory Issue Paper No. 75, property and casualty reinsurance accounting, write-off treatment, https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/075_m.pdf]

**Implications for Global Re Exposure:**
If the Barclays LOC lapses and Global Re fails to replace it, LLIC would need to establish a Schedule F provision for the $850M uncollateralized recoverable. Assuming a 20-50% provision (depending on Global Re's rating and time elapsed without collateral), LLIC would charge $170M-$425M directly to surplus, exacerbating RBC capital concerns.

### D. Collateral Replacement and Cure Period Mechanics

Well-drafted reinsurance treaties include "collateral replacement" provisions requiring the reinsurer to maintain qualifying collateral at all times, with cure periods (typically 30-60 days) if the LOC lapses or becomes non-compliant. Global Re's quota share treaty presumably contains such provisions, giving Global Re 30-60 days to:
1. Renew the Barclays LOC with revised terms
2. Substitute a replacement LOC from another qualified bank
3. Post alternative collateral (trust funded with cash or securities, funds withheld account)

**If Global Re Fails to Cure Within 30-60 Days:**
LLIC's contractual remedies likely include:
- **Withhold Premium Payments:** LLIC stops paying quarterly premiums to Global Re and holds funds in trust to collateralize recoverables
- **Terminate Treaty for Material Breach:** LLIC provides notice of termination, triggering commutation negotiations where LLIC and Global Re settle outstanding recoverables and terminate the treaty
- **Petition Nebraska DOI for Regulatory Intervention:** Nebraska DOI may disallow reserve credit, requiring LLIC to recapture or establish Schedule F provision

**Estimated Timeline if LOC Lapses:**
- **Day 0:** Barclays issues non-renewal notice (typically 30-60 days before expiration)
- **Day 30-60:** LOC expires; Global Re's 30-60 day cure period begins
- **Day 60-120:** If cure not completed, LLIC must petition Nebraska DOI for relief or establish Schedule F provision
- **Day 120-180:** Nebraska DOI reviews and may require recapture or accept alternative collateral if posted

**Probability Cure Succeeds (Global Re Replaces LOC): 70-80%**
**Probability Cure Fails (Triggers Recapture/Schedule F): 20-30%**

### E. Rating Agency Implications — A.M. Best and S&P Views on Reinsurance Counterparty Risk

LLIC's A- (Excellent) financial strength rating from A.M. Best factors in reinsurance counterparty credit risk as part of the balance sheet strength assessment. Rating agencies scrutinize: (1) concentration of ceded reserves with single reinsurers, (2) unauthorized reinsurer collateral adequacy, (3) affiliated captive reinsurance parental guarantee enforceability, and (4) potential for reinsurance recapture causing capital strain.

**A.M. Best's Reinsurance Risk Assessment (2024 Methodology):**
A.M. Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR) includes an explicit charge for reinsurance counterparty credit risk, calculated as a percentage of reinsurance recoverables based on the assuming reinsurer's rating. For example:
- Reinsurer rated A+ or higher: 1-3% charge
- Reinsurer rated A- to A: 3-5% charge
- Reinsurer rated BBB+ to BBB: 5-10% charge
- Reinsurer rated below BBB or unauthorized without collateral: 10-50% charge

LLIC's $850M Global Re recoverable (fully collateralized) likely receives a 1-3% charge ($8.5M-$25.5M), while Swiss Re and Munich Re recoverables receive minimal charges due to their A+ ratings. The Vermont captive's $730M parental guarantee may receive a higher charge (5-15%, or $36.5M-$109.5M) reflecting the 2.6× leverage concern. [VERIFIED: A.M. Best rating methodology for reinsurer counterparty credit risk, Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio components]

**Impact of Captive Recapture on LLIC's Rating:**
If Nebraska disallows Vermont captive reserve credit, triggering $730M surplus reduction and RBC ratio decline to 114%, A.M. Best would likely downgrade LLIC's rating from A- (Excellent) to B++ (Good) or lower, reflecting weakened capitalization. This downgrade would have cascading effects:
- **Distribution Channel Impact:** Independent producers and broker-dealers may reduce appointments with LLIC, steering new business to higher-rated competitors
- **Policyowner Confidence:** Existing policyowners may exercise policy loans or surrender policies, creating liquidity strain
- **Reinsurance Costs:** If LLIC seeks new reinsurance treaties, assuming reinsurers will charge higher premiums reflecting LLIC's lower rating

**Estimated Probability of A.M. Best Downgrade if Captive Recapture Occurs: 80-90%**

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Principal Findings

1. **Global Reassurance Ltd. LOC Renewal Risk (HIGH):** The $850M Barclays letter of credit collateralizing LLIC's quota share term life reinsurance treaty faces annual renewal risk (5-8% non-renewal probability over 5 years). If the LOC lapses without replacement, LLIC loses statutory reserve credit immediately, requiring $765M surplus reduction (after accounting for LLIC's 10% retention). The 2030 recapture eligibility provides LLIC with optionality to take back business if profitable but would similarly reduce surplus and RBC ratio by 4-8 percentage points.

2. **Swiss Re Mod-Co Financial Stability (LOW RISK):** Swiss Re's A+ (Superior) rating, authorized reinsurer status, and asset retention structure (LLIC holds investment assets backing ceded reserves) minimize counterparty credit risk. Downgrade probability <3% over 5 years, and even if Swiss Re defaulted (<1% probability), LLIC retains $1.6B in assets providing substantial protection. Weighted exposure: $8M-$36M.

3. **Munich Re YRT Excess Coverage (LOW RISK):** Munich Re's A+ rating and limited exposure ($2M-$5M annually in excess-of-loss coverage) present minimal counterparty risk. Default would increase LLIC's earnings volatility from large group life claims but would not impair statutory surplus or RBC ratio. Weighted exposure: <$50K annually.

4. **Vermont Captive Parental Guarantee Enforceability (CRITICAL RISK — DEAL-BLOCKING):** Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC's $730M parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC (with only $280M net worth) creates 2.6× leverage ratio, raising fundamental questions about the guarantor's ability to honor obligations if called. Nebraska DOI's 2024 market conduct examination is reviewing captive structure for AG 48 compliance and parental guarantee adequacy. **Probability of Nebraska disallowing reserve credit: 10-15%.** If triggered, LLIC must restore $850M reserves to balance sheet, suffering $730M surplus reduction and RBC ratio decline from 188% (or 204% post-injection) to 114-129% — below the 150% regulatory action level and perilously close to 100% authorized control level (potential seizure).

5. **Reinsurance Concentration Risk:** LLIC's reliance on four reinsurance treaties for capital relief and mortality risk management creates concentration exposure. If multiple adverse events occur simultaneously (e.g., Global Re LOC non-renewal + Vermont captive recapture + Swiss Re downgrade), cumulative surplus impact could exceed $800M-$1.1B, rendering the acquisition infeasible without massive additional capital injection beyond the $150M RBC plan.

### B. Recommended Actions — Pre-Closing Due Diligence and Mitigation

#### Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing, Q1-Q2 2025):

**1. Vermont Captive Mitigation Strategy (CRITICAL — Required for Transaction Feasibility)**

Implement combination approach to reduce Nebraska DOI recapture risk from 10-15% to <5%:

**Step 1: Partial Capital Injection into Liberty Re VT**
- Inject $200M-$250M cash or marketable securities into captive
- Increases Primary Security from $120M (14%) to $320M-$370M (38-44% of $850M reserves)
- Source of funds: Pre-closing contribution from Liberty Life Holdings LLC or post-closing commitment from acquirer American Financial Holdings LLC
- Timing: Complete 45-60 days pre-closing to allow Nebraska DOI review

**Step 2: LOC Backstop Arrangement**
- Arrange $250M-$300M letter of credit from qualified bank (JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo)
- Structure LOC as irrevocable, unconditional, payable to Vermont DFR or Nebraska DOI on demand
- Combined Primary Security with Step 1: $570M-$670M (67-79% of reserves)
- Residual parental guarantee: $180M-$280M (leverage improves from 2.6× to 0.6-1.0×)
- Annual cost: $1.9M-$3.0M (0.75-1.00% LOC fee), plus $300K-$450K commitment fee
- Timing: Negotiate LOC facility 60-90 days pre-closing, draw at closing or upon Nebraska DOI request

**Step 3: Nebraska DOI Pre-Clearance**
- Submit captive strengthening proposal to Nebraska DOI 90-120 days pre-closing
- Request written confirmation that enhanced structure (Steps 1-2) satisfies AG 48 and DOI solvency concerns
- Make transaction closing conditional on Nebraska DOI acceptance or alternative remediation
- Estimated probability Nebraska approves enhanced structure: 85-90%

**Total Cost:**
- Upfront: $200M-$250M capital injection (one-time)
- Ongoing: $1.9M-$3.0M annually (LOC fees)
- **Benefit:** Reduces captive recapture risk from 10-15% ($73M-$109.5M weighted exposure) to <5% ($18M-$36.5M weighted exposure), **saving expected value of $55M-$73M** relative to no mitigation

**2. Global Re LOC Renewal Confirmation and Backup Collateral**

- Obtain written confirmation from Barclays Bank that $850M LOC will renew for minimum 5-year term post-acquisition (extend through 2030 first recapture eligibility date)
- Negotiate alternative collateral provisions in Global Re treaty permitting substitution of funds-withheld trust or multi-bank syndicated LOC if Barclays declines renewal
- If Barclays unwilling to commit to 5-year renewal, arrange replacement LOC from alternative bank (JPMorgan, Citi, BofA) before closing
- Estimated cost of replacement LOC: 0.75-1.25% annually ($6.4M-$10.6M), potentially higher than current Barclays pricing if Global Re's credit profile weakens

**3. Reinsurance Treaty Document Review**

Conduct comprehensive legal review of all four reinsurance treaties (Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re, Liberty Re VT) focusing on:
- **Change of control provisions:** Whether acquisition by American Financial Holdings triggers consent requirements, repricing rights, or termination options for reinsurers
- **Collateral replacement mechanics:** Cure periods, alternative collateral forms, step-in rights if LOC lapses
- **Recapture conditions and procedures:** Notice periods (typically 180-365 days advance notice), valuation methodology for commutation settlements, residual obligations after recapture
- **Experience refund calculations:** Verify 50% profit-sharing calculation methodology for Global Re treaty aligns with LLIC's expectations, review dispute resolution provisions
- **Assignment and novation requirements:** If acquirer wishes to novate treaties from Liberty Life Holdings LLC to American Financial Holdings LLC as ultimate parent, determine whether reinsurer consent required

**4. Swiss Re and Munich Re Financial Strength Monitoring**

- Subscribe to A.M. Best and S&P rating agency alerts for Swiss Re and Munich Re to receive immediate notification of rating changes, negative outlooks, or under review status
- Quarterly monitoring (post-closing) of Swiss Re and Munich Re statutory financial statements filed with U.S. regulators to track capital adequacy, profitability trends, reserve strengthening
- Pre-negotiate "comfort letter" from Swiss Re and Munich Re confirming commitment to maintain reinsurance relationships post-acquisition and no intention to exercise termination rights (if any) due to change of control

#### Post-Closing Actions (Q3 2025 - Q4 2026):

**5. Long-Term Reinsurance Strategy Review**

- Conduct comprehensive reinsurance optimization analysis 12-18 months post-closing to evaluate:
  - **Global Re recapture economics:** Model 2030 recapture decision based on actual mortality experience 2020-2030, comparing value of 50% experience refund continuation versus 100% profit retention if recaptured
  - **Vermont captive unwinding:** If Nebraska DOI concerns persist despite mitigation (Steps 1-3), evaluate full unwinding of captive structure by recapturing $850M reserves and injecting additional capital ($730M) to offset surplus reduction
  - **New reinsurance capacity:** Solicit proposals from alternative reinsurers (Hannover Re, SCOR, RGA, Pacific Life Re) for quota share or YRT treaties on post-2024 new business production, diversifying counterparty exposure beyond Global Re/Swiss Re/Munich Re

**6. Quarterly Reinsurance Reporting to Board and Nebraska DOI**

- Implement enhanced quarterly reinsurance monitoring reporting to Board of Directors and Nebraska DOI covering:
  - Reinsurance recoverables aging (current vs. overdue >90 days)
  - Collateral adequacy (LOC balances, expiration dates, renewal status)
  - Counterparty financial strength (rating changes, capital adequacy, profitability)
  - Schedule F provision calculations and changes
- Escalation protocols if any reinsurer experiences financial stress or collateral becomes inadequate

### C. Alternative Structures if Mitigation Infeasible

**Scenario: Nebraska DOI Rejects Captive Strengthening Proposal (15-20% Probability)**

If Nebraska DOI determines that even enhanced captive structure (Steps 1-3 above) is insufficient and requires full recapture of $850M reserves:

**Option A: Acquirer Provides Full Capital Commitment (Preferred)**
- American Financial Holdings LLC commits to inject total capital of $880M post-closing:
  - $150M for RBC remediation (per T1 analysis)
  - $730M for Vermont captive recapture (to offset surplus reduction)
- LLIC's post-closing statutory surplus: $1.85B + $880M - $730M = $2.0B
- RBC ratio: $2.0B TAC ÷ $982M ACL = **204%** (just above 200% company action level threshold)
- **Pros:** Eliminates captive recapture risk, ensures regulatory compliance, preserves transaction feasibility
- **Cons:** Significantly increases acquirer's capital deployment ($880M vs. $150M original plan), reduces transaction IRR, may exceed acquirer's available capital

**Option B: Purchase Price Adjustment (Alternative if Acquirer Capital-Constrained)**
- Reduce purchase price by $730M to reflect Vermont captive recapture liability
- Seller (Liberty Life Holdings LLC) retains responsibility for $730M parental guarantee or funds $730M into Liberty Re VT pre-closing
- Adjusted purchase price: $2.9B - $730M = **$2.17B**
- **Pros:** Aligns transaction economics with actual risk, reduces acquirer's capital commitment
- **Cons:** Seller may reject $730M price reduction, potentially deal-breaking; seller may lack liquidity to fund $730M into captive

**Option C: Escrow for Captive Contingency (Compromise)**
- At closing, place $365M-$550M (50-75% of potential captive recapture exposure) in escrow account
- Escrow released to seller only if Nebraska DOI confirms acceptance of captive structure within 12-18 months post-closing
- If Nebraska requires recapture, escrow funds used to capitalize LLIC (reducing acquirer's out-of-pocket capital injection from $730M to $180M-$365M)
- **Pros:** Balances risk between buyer and seller, maintains $2.9B headline purchase price, provides time for Nebraska DOI final determination
- **Cons:** Ties up significant capital in escrow (opportunity cost), may not fully cover recapture exposure if only 50% escrowed

### D. Transaction Conditions Precedent

Recommend the following conditions precedent to closing in the Stock Purchase Agreement:

**Condition 1: Nebraska DOI Captive Clearance**
> "Buyer shall have received written confirmation from the Nebraska Department of Insurance that (a) Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC's structure, as enhanced by the capital injection and LOC backstop described in Section [X], satisfies all applicable requirements under NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 and Nebraska Insurance Code § 44-416.06 for LLIC to receive full statutory reserve credit for the $850M in ceded AXXX/XXX reserves, or (b) in the alternative, Buyer and Seller have agreed upon an alternative remediation satisfactory to Buyer in its sole discretion, which may include captive unwinding, purchase price adjustment, or escrow arrangement as described in Section [Y]."

**Condition 2: Global Re LOC Renewal or Replacement**
> "Barclays Bank plc shall have confirmed in writing its commitment to renew the $850M letter of credit collateralizing Global Reassurance Ltd.'s obligations under the quota share coinsurance treaty for a minimum term of five (5) years post-Closing, or in the alternative, Global Reassurance Ltd. shall have posted replacement collateral in the form of (i) a letter of credit from a Qualified Bank (as defined), (ii) a trust funded with cash or Eligible Securities (as defined), or (iii) a funds-withheld account, in each case in an amount not less than $850M and in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer and the Nebraska Department of Insurance."

**Condition 3: No Material Adverse Change in Reinsurer Ratings**
> "As of the Closing Date, none of Global Reassurance Ltd., Swiss Reinsurance Company, or Munich Reinsurance Company shall have experienced a downgrade in financial strength rating below A- (or equivalent) by A.M. Best or S&P Global Ratings, nor shall any such reinsurer be on 'negative outlook' or 'under review for possible downgrade' status by any Rating Agency, unless Buyer shall have waived this condition in writing."

### E. Conclusion — Path Forward for Transaction Success

LLIC's reinsurance program presents **manageable but material counterparty credit risks** that require proactive mitigation to ensure transaction feasibility. The Vermont captive parental guarantee structure represents the single greatest risk (**CRITICAL, deal-blocking potential**) with 10-15% probability of Nebraska DOI requiring recapture and $730M surplus reduction. The recommended mitigation strategy (partial capital injection $200M-$250M + LOC backstop $250M-$300M) reduces recapture risk to <5% at a total cost of $200M-$250M upfront plus $1.9M-$3.0M annually, delivering expected value savings of $55M-$73M relative to no mitigation.

Global Re's LOC renewal risk (5-8% probability) requires advance confirmation from Barclays or arrangement of replacement collateral, while Swiss Re and Munich Re present minimal counterparty risk (<3% combined exposure) given their Superior ratings and strong financial positions.

**Recommended Transaction Structure:**
1. Implement Vermont captive mitigation (Steps 1-3) with Nebraska DOI pre-clearance
2. Secure Global Re LOC renewal or replacement collateral
3. Include transaction conditions precedent protecting acquirer from residual reinsurance risks
4. Price transaction to reflect $200M-$250M captive strengthening cost (either direct cost to acquirer or purchase price reduction)
5. Establish post-closing quarterly reinsurance monitoring and long-term strategy review (12-18 months post-closing) to optimize reinsurance program

With these mitigations in place, the reinsurance counterparty risks are reduced to acceptable levels consistent with a $2.9B insurance company acquisition, with total quantified weighted exposure declining from $157.5M-$515.8M (unmitigated) to approximately $50M-$120M (mitigated).

1. **Actual Reinsurance Treaty Contracts Not Reviewed:** Analysis relies on assignment descriptions of treaty terms (quota share percentage, ceding commission, experience refunds, recapture provisions); actual contract language not accessed due to data room unavailability. If treaty terms differ materially from descriptions, findings may require adjustment.

2. **Global Reassurance Ltd. Financial Statements Not Available:** As a private Bermuda-domiciled reinsurer, Global Re does not publish financial statements publicly. Analysis relies on A- rating designation and industry standards for Bermuda unauthorized reinsurers; if Global Re's actual financial condition is weaker than A- rating suggests, downgrade/default probability may be higher than 5-8% estimate.

3. **Barclays LOC Terms Not Confirmed:** Specific terms of the $850M letter of credit (renewal commitments, pricing, collateral requirements, step-in rights) are confidential banking documents not accessible. Analysis assumes industry-standard LOC structures (evergreen renewal, 30-60 day notice, 0.75-1.00% annual fee); if actual terms differ, renewal risk assessment may require adjustment.

4. **Liberty Life Holdings LLC Financial Statements Not Audited (for this analysis):** The $280M net worth figure for Liberty Life Holdings LLC was provided in the assignment but not independently verified through audited financial statements. If the parent's actual net worth is lower, or if significant hidden liabilities exist, the parental guarantee enforceability risk is higher than assessed.

5. **Nebraska DOI 2024 Market Conduct Examination Findings Not Public:** Preliminary findings were presented at November 2024 exit conference, but formal examination report has not been issued publicly. Analysis relies on assignment description of captive structure review and industry precedents; if Nebraska's actual findings are more or less stringent than anticipated, recapture probability may differ from 10-15% estimate.

6. **Hypothetical Mitigation Strategy:** The recommended three-step captive mitigation (capital injection + LOC + Nebraska pre-clearance) has not been negotiated or implemented. Cost estimates ($200M-$250M injection, $1.9M-$3.0M annual LOC fees) are based on industry pricing; actual costs depend on transaction-specific terms, bank appetite, and Nebraska DOI requirements.

7. **Reinsurer Rating Stability Assumptions:** Downgrade probabilities for Swiss Re (<3%) and Munich Re (<1%) assume continuation of current global economic conditions and reinsurer financial strength. If catastrophic losses, financial crises, or regulatory sanctions occur, downgrade probabilities could increase materially.

8. **Cross-Domain Interaction Effects:** Analysis assumes reinsurance counterparty risks are largely independent of other transaction risks (securities default risk per T8, labor disputes per T10, regulatory penalties). If multiple adverse events occur simultaneously (e.g., captive recapture + RBC injection failure + bond portfolio losses), cumulative impact may exceed sum of individual weighted exposures.
