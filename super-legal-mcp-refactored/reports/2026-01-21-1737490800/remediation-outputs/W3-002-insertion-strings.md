### E. Tax Structure Benefit Summary

**Note**: Section IV.K analyzes a structural BENEFIT, not a risk. The following table summarizes the NPV advantage of the surplus notes structure over equity capital injection.

| Structure Element | Value Driver | Benefit | Calculation Basis |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Surplus Notes 100% TAC Credit | Capital efficiency | $150M full RBC credit vs. $120M equity credit (20% improvement) | NAIC SSAP No. 41 statutory accounting; surplus notes receive 100% TAC credit while equity subject to affiliate deduction |
| Tax Deductibility of Interest | After-tax cost advantage | 5.14% effective cost vs. 7.5% equity cost = **$39.71M NPV advantage over 10 years** | IRC § 163(a) interest deduction at 32% corporate rate; 7.5% stated rate × (1-32%) = 5.14% after-tax |
| IRC § 382 NOL Utilization | Preserved tax assets | $105.3M annual NOL cap accommodates $7.5M annual interest ($150M × 5%) with no deduction bunching risk | IRC § 382(b)(1) limitation; $3.51B value × 3% AFR = $105.3M cap |
| No Dividend Restrictions | Operational flexibility | Surplus notes subordinated (interest payments discretionary if RBC < 200%) vs. equity dividend restrictions at RBC < 300% | Nebraska DOI surplus notes approval terms; regulatory capital flexibility |

**Data Source**: Section IV.K detailed analysis and financial-impact-analysis.md

**Domain Coverage**: Tax structure optimization, surplus notes vs. equity, IRC § 382 compliance, regulatory capital treatment

**Net Advantage**: $39.71M NPV over 10-year term, with full RBC credit and NOL preservation benefits
