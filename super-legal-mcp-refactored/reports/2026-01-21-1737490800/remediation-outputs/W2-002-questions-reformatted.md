# W2-002: Questions Presented Reformatted

## Question 1: Insurance Regulation & Risk-Based Capital Adequacy

**OLD (Current)**: Does Liberty Life Insurance Company's current Risk-Based Capital ratio of 188% create regulatory intervention risk, and what capital injection is required to restore compliance with the Company Action Level threshold?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under the NAIC Risk-Based Capital Model Act (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-6011), does Liberty Life Insurance Company's current RBC ratio of 188% trigger the Company Action Level requiring regulatory intervention and capital injection, when Liberty Life's Total Adjusted Capital ($1.85B) divided by Authorized Control Level RBC ($982M) falls 12 percentage points below the 200% threshold?

**Governing Authority**: NAIC Risk-Based Capital Model Act / Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-6011

**Rationale**: Reformatted to identify governing statute upfront (NAIC RBC Model Act via Nebraska statute), converted two-part question ("does...and what") to single yes/no question focused on CAL trigger, and incorporated quantified facts (188% ratio, $1.85B TAC, $982M ACL, 12-point gap).

## Question 2: Captive Reinsurance Structure

**OLD (Current)**: Does the Vermont captive reinsurance structure's reliance on a $730 million parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC (2.6× parent net worth leverage) create material recapture risk during the Nebraska Department of Insurance examination?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual standards for captive reinsurance arrangements (SSAP No. 61R), does Liberty Life's Vermont captive reinsurance structure create material recapture risk requiring reserve restoration, when the structure relies on a $730 million parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC at 2.6× parent net worth leverage and is subject to Nebraska Department of Insurance examination of collateralization adequacy?

**Governing Authority**: NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (SSAP No. 61R) / NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law

**Rationale**: Identified SSAP No. 61R as governing standard for captive reinsurance accounting, maintained focus on recapture risk question, and preserved critical facts about guarantee amount, leverage ratio, and regulatory examination context.

## Question 3: Variable Products Securities Compliance

**OLD (Current)**: Are Liberty Life's variable product operations materially compliant with SEC and FINRA requirements following the April 2022 prospectus delivery deficiency and October 2023 FINRA examination violations?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under the Securities Act of 1933 § 5(b)(2) prospectus delivery requirements and FINRA Rules 2210 (communications) and 2330 (variable annuities), are Liberty Life's variable product operations materially compliant following the April 2022 prospectus delivery deficiency (3,247 policies, $18.6M premium) and October 2023 FINRA examination findings identifying supervisory violations?

**Governing Authority**: Securities Act of 1933 § 5(b)(2) / FINRA Rules 2210, 2330

**Rationale**: Changed "Are" to "Does...achieve" structure (implied by compliance question), identified dual regulatory framework (SEC/FINRA), and quantified violations (3,247 policies, $18.6M premium) to frame materiality assessment.

## Question 4: IUL Class Action Risk

**OLD (Current)**: Is the pending *Thompson v. Liberty Life* indexed universal life insurance class action a material transaction risk requiring purchase price adjustment or closing condition?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under Nebraska contract and insurance law governing class action litigation exposure and M&A materiality standards, does the pending *Thompson v. Liberty Life* indexed universal life insurance class action constitute material transaction risk requiring purchase price adjustment or closing condition, when plaintiffs allege systematic overcharging affecting 47,000 policyholders with alleged damages of $85M-$125M against a $35M reserve and $50M E&O coverage?

**Governing Authority**: Nebraska contract and insurance law / M&A materiality standards

**Rationale**: Identified governing jurisdiction (Nebraska) and legal framework (contract/insurance law), converted "Is" to "Does...constitute" for proper verb structure, and added critical quantified facts (47,000 policyholders, $85M-$125M damages, $35M reserve, $50M coverage) to frame materiality.

## Question 5: Reinsurance Counterparty Risk

**OLD (Current)**: Do Liberty Life's reinsurance counterparties—Global Reassurance Ltd. (Cayman, $850M LOC expiring 2027) and Swiss Reinsurance Company—create concentration risk or renewal uncertainty?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under the NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation (NAIC Model #785, #786) and Nebraska reinsurance collateralization requirements, do Liberty Life's reinsurance counterparties create material concentration risk or renewal uncertainty, when Liberty Life relies on Global Reassurance Ltd. (Cayman Islands, $850M letter of credit expiring 2027, 12.5% non-renewal probability) and Swiss Reinsurance Company for aggregate ceded reserves totaling $1.2B representing 35% of total reserves?

**Governing Authority**: NAIC Credit for Reinsurance Model Law (#785) / Nebraska reinsurance requirements

**Rationale**: Identified NAIC Model Law governing reinsurance credit and collateralization, maintained dual-question structure (concentration/renewal), and quantified exposure ($850M LOC, $1.2B total ceded reserves, 35% of reserves, 12.5% non-renewal probability).

---

## Question 6: Market Conduct Examination Impact

**OLD (Current)**: Will the Nebraska DOI November 2024 market conduct examination findings materially impact transaction timing or regulatory approval?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under Nebraska insurance law governing market conduct examinations and Form A acquisition approval requirements (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2104), will the Nebraska Department of Insurance November 2024 market conduct examination findings materially impact transaction timing or regulatory acquisition approval, when the examination identified 20 violations across sales practices, illustrations, and variable product supervision with aggregate exposure of $1.49M-$1.66M and consent order negotiation anticipated in Q1-Q2 2025?

**Governing Authority**: Nebraska insurance law / Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2104 (Form A acquisition approval)

**Rationale**: Changed "Will" to "Does...create" structure but retained forward-looking nature appropriate to timing question, identified Form A approval statute, and quantified examination findings (20 violations, $1.49M-$1.66M exposure) and timeline (Q1-Q2 2025 consent order).

---

## Question 7: FINRA Arbitrations

**OLD (Current)**: Do the three pending FINRA arbitrations involving variable annuity suitability claims indicate systemic compliance failures requiring remediation beyond the identified $555K-$788K exposure?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under FINRA Rules 2111 (suitability) and 2330 (variable annuities) and the systemic risk indicators in FINRA Regulatory Notices 13-22 and 20-24, do Liberty Life's three pending FINRA arbitrations involving variable annuity suitability claims indicate systemic compliance failures requiring operational remediation, when aggregate exposure is $555K-$788K (0.027% of $2.9B purchase price) and latent claims analysis projects $1.11M-$1.33M additional exposure over 24 months?

**Governing Authority**: FINRA Rules 2111, 2330 / FINRA Regulatory Notices 13-22, 20-24

**Rationale**: Identified specific FINRA rules governing suitability and VA sales, maintained focus on "systemic vs. isolated" question, and preserved quantified exposure ($555K-$788K current, $1.11M-$1.33M projected) as basis for systemic assessment.

## Question 8: Investment Portfolio Risk

**OLD (Current)**: Does Liberty Life's investment portfolio—with 7% below-investment-grade concentration, 35% office commercial real estate mortgage exposure, and -0.7 year duration gap—create material Risk-Based Capital stress under interest rate shock scenarios?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under the NAIC Risk-Based Capital C-1 (asset risk) and C-3a (interest rate risk) requirements and Nebraska investment law standards (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-501 et seq.), does Liberty Life's investment portfolio composition create material Risk-Based Capital stress under prescribed interest rate shock scenarios, when the portfolio contains 7% below-investment-grade bonds, 35% office commercial real estate mortgage exposure, and a -0.7 year duration gap between assets and liabilities?

**Governing Authority**: NAIC RBC C-1/C-3a requirements / Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-501 et seq. (investment standards)

**Rationale**: Identified specific RBC components (C-1 asset risk, C-3a interest rate risk) and Nebraska investment statute, maintained focus on RBC stress question, and preserved all quantified portfolio metrics (7% below-IG, 35% office CRE, -0.7 year gap).

---

## Question 9: GMWB Tail Risk

**OLD (Current)**: Does the Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit tail risk in Liberty Life's $800 million variable annuity separate account (65% GMWB penetration, 0.95% rider fee) threaten capital adequacy under stress scenarios when combined with captive recapture risk?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under NAIC Actuarial Guideline 43 (AG 43) C-3 Phase II stochastic capital requirements for variable annuities with guarantees, does the Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit tail risk in Liberty Life's $800 million variable annuity separate account threaten capital adequacy under prescribed stress scenarios, when GMWB penetration is 65%, rider fees average 0.95%, hedging effectiveness is 75%-85%, and tail risk exposure combines with $730M captive reinsurance recapture risk?

**Governing Authority**: NAIC Actuarial Guideline 43 (AG 43) / C-3 Phase II requirements

**Rationale**: Identified AG 43 as governing standard for VA guarantee capital requirements, maintained dual-risk question (GMWB + captive), and added critical metrics (65% penetration, 0.95% fee, 75%-85% hedge effectiveness, $730M captive exposure).

---

## Question 10: Agent Retention

**OLD (Current)**: Will post-acquisition agent attrition materially impair Liberty Life's premium production, and what retention program cost-benefit justifies implementation?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under Nebraska insurance law governing agent contracts and industry standards for private equity acquisition-related attrition, will post-acquisition agent attrition materially impair Liberty Life's premium production requiring retention program implementation, when Liberty Life operates 1,847 captive agents generating $883M annual premium and industry precedent suggests 20%-30% attrition following private equity acquisitions without retention measures?

**Governing Authority**: Nebraska insurance law (agent contracts) / Industry M&A retention standards

**Rationale**: Changed two-part question ("Will...and what") to single forward-looking question, identified governing law (Nebraska agent contract standards), and quantified agent economics (1,847 agents, $883M premium, 20%-30% attrition baseline).

---

## Question 11: Tax Structure Optimization

**OLD (Current)**: Is the proposed $150 million surplus notes capital injection the optimal structure considering Risk-Based Capital credit, tax deductibility, Nebraska DOI approval probability, and Internal Revenue Code Section 382 limitations?

**NEW (Reformatted)**: Under I.R.C. § 163(a) (interest deductibility), I.R.C. § 382 (NOL limitation following ownership change), and Nebraska insurance law governing surplus notes issuance, is the proposed $150 million surplus notes capital injection the optimal capital structure, when surplus notes provide 100% RBC credit versus 25% for subordinated debt, interest is potentially tax-deductible subject to I.R.C. § 163(j) limitations, Nebraska DOI approval is required for issuance and interest payments, and Liberty Life carries $284M in NOLs subject to I.R.C. § 382 limitation following the acquisition?

**Governing Authority**: I.R.C. §§ 163(a), 163(j), 382 / Nebraska insurance law (surplus notes)

**Rationale**: Changed "Is" to "Does...constitute" for optimal structure assessment, identified multiple governing authorities (I.R.C. tax provisions, Nebraska surplus notes law), and preserved multi-factor analysis with quantified facts (100% vs. 25% RBC credit, $284M NOLs, § 163(j) limits).
