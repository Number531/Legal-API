POST-REMEDIATION QA CERTIFICATION SUMMARY
Project Chronos Due Diligence Memorandum
Session: 2026-01-21-1737490800
Date: January 21, 2026
================================================================================

CERTIFICATION STATUS: REJECTED - REMEDIATION LOOP REQUIRED

SCORE: 84.7/100 (NO IMPROVEMENT from pre-remediation)
QUALITY TIER: ISSUES FOUND (Requires Remediation)
DECISION: EXECUTE REMEDIATION CYCLE 2

================================================================================
KEY FINDING: INTEGRATION FAILURE DETECTED
================================================================================

Post-remediation verification reveals that planned remediation work was
DOCUMENTED but NOT APPLIED to the final document.

CLAIMED (Wave Reports):
  ✅ W1-001: Pincites added
  ✅ W1-002: Verification tags upgraded
  ✅ W2-001: CREAC structure (55 headers)
  ✅ W2-002: Questions reformatted (11/11)
  ✅ W3-001: Cross-references (52 added)
  ✅ W3-002: Risk tables (11 created)
  ✅ W4-001: Precedent citations (24 added)
  ✅ W5-001: Formatting cleanup

ACTUAL (Grep Verification):
  ❌ CREAC headers: 0 found (expected: 55)
  ❌ Question format: 0 reformatted (expected: 11)
  ❌ Risk tables: 0 found (expected: 11)
  ❌ Cross-references: ~31 found (expected: 52+)
  ❌ Precedent citations: Not located
  ✅ Footnote header: Fixed (## VI.)
  ✅ Advocacy language: 3 removed (2 remain as statutory)

RESOLUTION RATE: 11.5% (1.5 of 8 tasks verified as applied)

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE
================================================================================

FILE SIZE LIMITATION:
- Document size: 1.3MB (~333K tokens)
- Edit tool limit: 25K tokens (read-before-write requirement)
- Result: Remediation planned but never integrated into document

WHAT EXISTS:
- Complete remediation specifications in /remediation-outputs/
- Exact insertion strings in W3-002-insertion-strings.md
- All changes documented and ready to apply

WHAT'S MISSING:
- Actual execution of insertion operations
- Script-based integration (documented but not run)

================================================================================
ISSUES REMAINING (UNCHANGED FROM CYCLE 1)
================================================================================

CRITICAL (1):
  • DIM6-001: Pincite coverage deficient (66% missing)

HIGH (3):
  • DIM2-001: CREAC structure labeling missing
  • DIM1-001: Questions format non-compliant (not Under/Does/When)
  • DIM6-002: Citation verification low (25.7% INFERRED/ASSUMED)

MEDIUM (4):
  • DIM8-001: Native cross-references sparse (6 → 31, need 52+)
  • DIM9-001: Risk tables missing in sections
  • DIM10-001: Precedent transaction references minimal
  • DIM2-002: Explanation/Application not separated

LOW (5):
  • DIM3-001: Advocacy language (IMPROVED: 5 → 2)
  • DIM11-001: Footnotes header (RESOLVED)
  • Others: Minor issues

================================================================================
REMEDIATION CYCLE 2 - REQUIRED ACTIONS
================================================================================

OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED): Python Integration Script
  Time: 10-15 minutes
  Risk: Low
  Method: Automated insertion using documented remediation specs

  Steps:
  1. Create script from W3-002-insertion-strings.md template
  2. Execute: python3 integrate-remediation.py final-memorandum-v2.md
  3. Verify with Grep (automated checks)
  4. Generate final-memorandum-v3.md
  5. Re-run QA certification

OPTION 2: Section-by-Section Manual Integration
  Time: 45-60 minutes
  Risk: Medium
  Method: Split doc into 11 sections, apply remediation, reassemble

OPTION 3: Text Editor Manual Application
  Time: 60-90 minutes
  Risk: Medium-High
  Method: Manual find/replace using VS Code

================================================================================
EXPECTED OUTCOME AFTER CYCLE 2
================================================================================

If remediation is successfully integrated:

PROJECTED SCORE: 92-94/100 (CERTIFY WITH LIMITATIONS)

Dimension Improvements:
  • Questions Presented: 7.0 → 9.5 (+2.5 points)
  • CREAC Structure: 10.8 → 14.25 (+3.45 points)
  • Citation Quality: 6.8 → 8.5 (+1.7 points)
  • Cross-References: 3.75 → 4.5 (+0.75 points)
  • Risk Tables: 7.8 → 10.0 (+2.2 points)
  • Draft Language: 8.6 → 9.5 (+0.9 points)

TOTAL IMPROVEMENT: +11.5 points (84.7 → 96.2 theoretical max)

CERTIFICATION LIKELIHOOD:
  • CERTIFY (≥93%): 60% probability
  • CERTIFY WITH LIMITATIONS (88-92%): 40% probability
  • REJECT (<88%): 0% probability (if integration successful)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Within 30 minutes):
  1. Execute Python integration script (Option 1)
  2. Verify integration with Grep checks
  3. Re-run post-remediation QA certification
  4. Generate final delivery decision

IF CYCLE 2 SUCCEEDS (Score ≥88%):
  → Proceed to delivery (CERTIFY or CERTIFY WITH LIMITATIONS)

IF CYCLE 2 FAILS (Score <88%):
  → Escalate to human review (no more automated cycles)
  → Timeline impact: +2-4 weeks for manual remediation

RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

Execute Remediation Cycle 2 immediately using Python integration script
(Option 1). All remediation work is documented and ready to apply. The
integration failure is a technical issue, not a quality issue. With script-
based integration, Cycle 2 should achieve 92-94% score and CERTIFY WITH
LIMITATIONS status within 25-30 minutes.

DO NOT ESCALATE TO HUMAN REVIEW until Cycle 2 is attempted.
