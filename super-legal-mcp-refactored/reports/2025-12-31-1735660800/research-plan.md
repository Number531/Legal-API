- Cross-reference with: T4 (TX examination found same AML issues), T6 (Iranian users = OFAC violation but also SAR filing requirement), T11 (AML program failures support BSA criminal charges)

**T6 (cfius-national-security-analyst):**
- Focus areas: OFAC sanctions compliance, Iranian Transactions Sanctions (31 CFR Part 560), voluntary self-disclosure, OFAC penalty guidelines, Tornado Cash sanctions, North Korean hackers (Lazarus Group)

- Key authorities: Breach of contract (Terms of Service "industry-leading security" promise), negligence (duty to safeguard customer assets, breach, causation, damages), fiduciary duty (custodial relationship = trust), punitive damages (gross negligence standard), arbitration clause enforceability (consumer contract unconscionability, class action waiver)
- Critical issues: Claims (breach of contract, negligence, fiduciary duty), damages ($47M actual damages — already reimbursed by CTE, class seeks punitive $50M-$150M for gross negligence + attorneys' fees $10M-$20M), CTE defenses (no damages — customers made whole, reasonable security — industry-standard practices, force majeure — nation-state attack, arbitration clause — individual arbitration + class waiver), class certification motion pending (hearing Q1 2026), settlement range $15M-$30M
- Cross-reference with: T7 (security controls assessment supports/refutes negligence claim), T8 (D&O insurance covers defense costs + settlement), T12 (settlement amount affects purchase price adjustment)

**T10 (tax-structure-analyst):**
- Focus areas: IRS broker reporting (Infrastructure Act, Form 1099-DA), basis tracking requirements, implementation timeline, customer impact
- Key authorities: 26 U.S.C. § 6045 (broker reporting), Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA 2021), IRS proposed regulations (2024, final regulations expected Q1 2026), Form 1099-DA (draft form)
- Critical issues: Effective 1/1/2026 (12-month deadline), CTE must issue Form 1099-DA to 8.4M customers (report gross proceeds, basis if known, backup withholding 24% if TIN missing), CTE readiness gap (collects SSN/TIN but does NOT track basis or holding period — data not collected), implementation costs ($2M-$4M system upgrades + 8-12 tax professionals + customer communication), customer impact (8.4M 1099s → IRS scrutiny, tax enforcement, potential attrition if customers leave for non-reporting platforms)
- Cross-reference with: T11 (IRS John Doe summons signals IRS tax enforcement priorities), T12 (implementation costs $2M-$4M affect deal economics)

**T11 (case-law-analyst - Criminal):**
- Focus areas: Criminal law (unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, BSA violations), FBI grand jury investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation
- Key authorities: 18 U.S.C. § 1960 (unlicensed money transmission, 5 years + $250K fine), 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) (money laundering conspiracy, 20 years), 31 U.S.C. § 5318 (BSA violations, criminal penalties), DOJ charging guidelines (corporate prosecutions)
- Critical issues: FBI grand jury (U.S. Attorney W.D. Texas, Nov 2024, investigating 18 customers romance scam money laundering, CTE producing records), IRS CI John Doe summons (Oct 2024, seeking records for ~12,000 customers >$20,000 transactions 2022-2023 tax evasion), unlicensed money transmission risk (CTE has 47 state licenses = defense, but if DOJ alleges operation before all licenses obtained → potential violation), money laundering conspiracy risk (requires knowledge of customer money laundering — high bar, CTE not charged currently), BSA violations risk (AML program failures — monitoring backlog, SAR delays — could support criminal charges if willful)
- Cross-reference with: T5 (FinCEN AML program deficiencies inform BSA violation risk), T6 (OFAC violations could support money laundering charges if knowing facilitation of sanctioned transactions)

**T12 (financial-analyst):**
- Focus areas: Aggregate all quantified exposures from specialists T1-T11, monte_carlo modeling for probability-weighted scenarios, purchase price adjustment recommendations, escrow/holdback sizing
- Key authorities: N/A (quantitative modeling, not legal research)
- Critical issues: Aggregate exposures (SEC $550M-$570M, CFTC $33M-$43M, hot wallet hack $47M + class action $15M-$30M settlement, OFAC $100K-$500K, NY BitLicense $141M capital + $500K-$2M penalty, IRS implementation $2M-$4M), probability-weighted scenarios (monte_carlo: base case 50% probability, downside 30%, severe downside 20%), purchase price adjustment (reduce $1.8B by aggregate net exposure), escrow/holdback sizing ($100M-$200M recommended based on SEC/CFTC/class action uncertainties), sensitivity analysis (insurance approval $37M vs. denial → $37M swing in CTE net position)
- Cross-reference with: ALL specialists T1-T11 (aggregates quantified findings from all reports)

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Document key assumptions for specialist context:

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| CTE's Wells Response accurately reflects CTE's defenses | User-provided transaction overview | If CTE's actual defenses differ, settlement strategy may need revision |
| $15B customer crypto assets accurately stated | User-provided Q3 2025 figure | If materially misstated, capital requirements (NY BitLicense) and insurance coverage may be affected |
| All 47 state licenses active and current | User-provided statement "licensed in 47 states" | If any licenses suspended/revoked, must halt operations in those states |
| No undisclosed SEC/CFTC/FinCEN enforcement actions | User-provided disclosure of known matters | Material risk if additional enforcement actions exist |
| Insurance policy terms as described | User-provided policy summary | Actual policy language may have additional exclusions/sublimits |
| Class action complaint allegations as stated | User-provided litigation summary | Actual complaints may assert additional claims |
| Hot wallet hack attribution to North Korea accurate | User-provided blockchain forensics | If attribution wrong, OFAC implications may differ |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual SEC Wells Notice document not provided (relying on user summary of allegations)
- Actual CFTC subpoena not provided (relying on user summary)
- Actual insurance policy not provided (relying on user summary of $100M coverage, $10M deductible)
- Actual state examination reports not provided (relying on user summary of TX findings)
- CTE's actual AML program policies/procedures not reviewed
- CTE's actual OFAC compliance program not reviewed
- Blockchain forensics reports (Chainalysis/Elliptic) not provided (relying on user summary of North Korea attribution)

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:** T12 (financial-analyst) depends on T1-T11 completion for aggregation

**Potential Issues:**
- SEC Wells Notice resolution uncertain (Q1 2026 action expected) → Timeline risk for closing
- Insurance claim pending (denial risk 40-50%) → $37M swing in net position
- NY BitLicense capital raise $141M → Acquirer may need to fund OR renegotiate purchase price
- Class action settlement timing uncertain (Q1 2026 class certification hearing) → May not resolve pre-closing

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If any specialist finds >$100M additional exposure beyond known issues → Flag immediately for deal-blocking assessment
- If criminal charges filed against CTE (not just customers) → Deal-blocking event
- If FinCEN/state regulator suspends CTE's licenses → Deal-blocking event

---

**RESEARCH PLAN STATUS:** READY FOR EXECUTION
**NEXT STEP:** Spawn T1-T11 specialists in parallel (Phase P2.1), then T12 sequential (Phase P2.2)
