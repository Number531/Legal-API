## IV.I. CLASS ACTION LITIGATION — JOHNSON V. CRYPTOTRADE EXCHANGE LLC

### A. Legal Framework

Class action litigation arising from cryptocurrency exchange security breaches implicates multiple areas of law: breach of contract (violation of terms of service), negligence (duty to implement reasonable security measures), breach of fiduciary duty (for custodial exchanges), and potential punitive damages for gross negligence. The enforceability of arbitration clauses in consumer agreements provides the most significant procedural defense, with the Federal Arbitration Act preempting state-law challenges to class action waivers.

#### 1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 — Class Certification Standards

To obtain class certification, plaintiffs must satisfy both Rule 23(a) prerequisites and Rule 23(b) requirements.¹

**Rule 23(a) Prerequisites:**

*Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes*, 564 U.S. 338 (2011), clarified the commonality requirement under Rule 23(a)(2): "What matters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common 'questions'—even in droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation."² The Supreme Court held that claims must depend upon a common contention that is capable of classwide resolution—meaning the determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue central to the validity of each claim in one stroke.³

**(1) Numerosity:** The class must be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Courts routinely certify classes with more than 40 members.⁴

**(2) Commonality:** There must be questions of law or fact common to the class. Under *Wal-Mart*, a single common question capable of classwide resolution suffices.⁵

**(3) Typicality:** The claims of the representative parties must be typical of the claims of the class. Lead plaintiff's claims must arise from the same event, practice, or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members.⁶

**(4) Adequacy:** The representative parties must fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, requiring competent counsel and no conflicts of interest between lead plaintiff and class members.⁷

**Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements:**

**(1) Predominance:** Questions of law or fact common to class members must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members. Courts analyze whether common questions can be resolved through common proof or whether individual issues require separate mini-trials for each class member.⁸

**(2) Superiority:** A class action must be superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. Where individual claims are small (economically infeasible to litigate separately), class actions are typically superior.⁹

#### 2. Federal Arbitration Act and Class Action Waivers

The Federal Arbitration Act creates a "liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements."¹⁰ In *AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion*, 563 U.S. 333 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the FAA preempts state-law rules that prohibit enforcement of class action waivers in consumer arbitration agreements.¹¹ The Court reasoned that class arbitration "interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the FAA."¹²

**State-Law Unconscionability Challenges:**

While state unconscionability doctrine remains applicable to arbitration agreements, *Concepcion* dramatically limited its scope. Courts applying unconscionability must show both:

**(1) Procedural unconscionability:** Lack of meaningful choice (adhesion contract), lack of conspicuousness, oppressive circumstances at contract formation.¹³

**(2) Substantive unconscionability:** One-sided terms that unreasonably favor the stronger party, deprivation of substantive rights.¹⁴

Post-*Concepcion*, courts have consistently enforced arbitration clauses with class action waivers in cryptocurrency exchange user agreements, even where the agreements are adhesive.¹⁵

**Ninth Circuit Application:**

*Bielski v. Coinbase*, No. 22-16506 (9th Cir. 2024), exemplifies the modern trend. The Ninth Circuit reversed a district court's denial of Coinbase's motion to compel arbitration, finding that even "low levels of procedural and substantive unconscionability" were insufficient to invalidate an arbitration clause under California law.¹⁶ The court emphasized that arbitration provisions in consumer contracts are routinely adhesive, and adhesion alone does not render a contract unconscionable absent additional oppressive factors.¹⁷

#### 3. Negligence and Duty of Care for Cryptocurrency Custodians

Cryptocurrency exchanges operating custodial wallets owe customers a duty to implement reasonable security measures to protect digital assets.¹⁸ The standard of care analysis considers:

**(1) Foreseeability:** Are cyberattacks foreseeable in the cryptocurrency industry? With over $2.7 billion stolen through crypto hacks in 2024,¹⁹ courts increasingly hold that cyberattacks are foreseeable events requiring reasonable precautions.

**(2) Industry Standards:** Courts evaluate whether the defendant's security measures comported with industry best practices. Multi-signature wallets, multi-factor authentication, cold storage for majority of assets, and employee security training are recognized industry standards.²⁰

**(3) Causation:** Plaintiffs must establish that the defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of their injuries. The superseding cause doctrine may break the chain of causation if an unforeseeable criminal act intervenes, but courts generally hold that inadequate security measures that create opportunities for foreseeable crimes do not break causation.²¹

**Gross Negligence Standard:**

Punitive damages require a showing of gross negligence: conduct exhibiting "want of even scant care" or an "extreme departure from ordinary care."²² Single-credential access to hot wallets containing hundreds of millions of dollars may satisfy this heightened standard, particularly where multi-signature authorization is industry standard practice.²³

#### 4. Collateral Estoppel from Regulatory Settlements

Under *Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore*, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), offensive use of collateral estoppel permits plaintiffs to preclude a defendant from relitigating an issue the defendant previously litigated and lost against another party.²⁴ For collateral estoppel to apply: (1) the issue must be identical to one in the prior action; (2) the issue must have been actually litigated; (3) determination of the issue must have been necessary to the prior judgment; and (4) the party against whom estoppel is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.²⁵

**SEC Settlement Admissions:**

If CTE's SEC settlement (projected Q3 2025) includes admissions regarding inadequate security controls or failure to safeguard customer assets, plaintiffs in the class action may invoke collateral estoppel to establish CTE's negligence or breach of duty. However, most SEC settlements contain "neither admit nor deny" language specifically to avoid creating collateral estoppel exposure.²⁶

### B. Application to Transaction

#### B.1 Johnson v. CryptoTrade Exchange LLC — Case Profile and Claims

**Case Identification:**

*Johnson v. CryptoTrade Exchange LLC*, Case No. [filed W.D. Texas, June 2024] (consolidated from four separate complaints).²⁷ Lead plaintiff Marcus Johnson allegedly lost $127,000 in the September 18, 2024 hot wallet hack.²⁸

**Procedural Posture:**

The case is at the pleading stage. CTE likely filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim) and/or a motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act. A class certification motion would be premature until discovery is completed.²⁹

**Class Definition:**

All U.S. customers who held cryptocurrency on CTE's platform on September 18, 2024, and whose assets were stolen in the hot wallet hack. Class size: 1,842 customers. Average claim value: $25,515 ($47M ÷ 1,842 customers).³⁰

**Claims Asserted:**

**(1) Breach of Contract:**

CTE's Terms of Service likely contain representations regarding security measures such as "industry-leading security," "bank-grade encryption," or "best practices for asset protection." Plaintiffs allege CTE breached these express warranties by implementing single-credential access to hot wallet management systems, failing to require multi-signature authorization, and inadequate employee phishing training.³¹

**(2) Negligence:**

CTE owed customers a duty of care to implement reasonable security measures. The breach consisted of: (a) single-credential access to $1.2 billion hot wallet (8% of $15B total assets under custody), violating industry standard of 2-5% hot wallet allocation;³² (b) failure to implement multi-signature wallets; (c) inadequate employee training (employee clicked phishing link); (d) failure to implement least-privilege access controls. Causation is established through the security vulnerability enabling the theft. Damages are the $47 million stolen.³³

**(3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty:**

Custodial cryptocurrency exchanges arguably hold customer assets "in trust," creating a fiduciary relationship requiring CTE to act with utmost care and loyalty in safeguarding customer funds.³⁴ CTE allegedly breached its fiduciary duty by prioritizing operational convenience (single-credential access) over asset security, demonstrating inadequate care for customer interests.³⁵

**(4) Punitive Damages:**

Plaintiffs seek $50M-$150M in punitive damages, alleging CTE's single-credential access to $1.2 billion constituted gross negligence—an extreme departure from industry standards demonstrating reckless indifference to customer asset safety.³⁶

**Damages Theory:**

Although CTE reimbursed all affected customers for their losses ($47M total), plaintiffs argue they are entitled to consequential damages (loss of use of funds, opportunity costs), emotional distress, and punitive damages as punishment for CTE's gross negligence regardless of whether compensatory damages were remediated.³⁷

#### B.2 Motion to Compel Arbitration — 70-80% Enforcement Probability

**Arbitration Clause Analysis:**

CTE's Terms of Service Section 15.2 (hypothetical provision) likely contains: (1) requirement for binding arbitration; (2) class action waiver (no class arbitrations or class actions permitted); (3) American Arbitration Association ("AAA") Consumer Arbitration Rules; (4) delegation clause (arbitrator decides arbitrability disputes); (5) waiver of jury trial.³⁸

**2024 Cryptocurrency Exchange Arbitration Precedents:**

Federal courts in 2024 overwhelmingly enforced arbitration clauses in cryptocurrency exchange user agreements:

*Bielski v. Coinbase* (9th Cir. 2024): Reversed district court and enforced Coinbase's arbitration clause, rejecting unconscionability challenges based on adhesion, delegation clause unfairness, and lack of mutuality.³⁹

Georgia federal court (Coinbase) (2024): Found only "minimal degree of procedural unconscionability" from adhesive nature; "Nothing in the record suggests Coinbase was the plaintiff's only option for cryptocurrency services."⁴⁰

*Binance* arbitration enforcement (November 2024): District court rejected all unconscionability challenges (adhesiveness, non-mutuality, lack of user sophistication, cost-splitting) and compelled arbitration.⁴¹

Bloomberg Law reported "a sharp decline in active civil suits against cryptocurrency exchanges" in 2024 due to "concerted electronic contracting legal strategies that have updated terms of service provisions and moved such cases to arbitration."⁴²

**CTE's Motion Strategy:**

CTE should file its motion to compel arbitration within 60 days of filing the answer (industry standard practice to avoid waiver).⁴³ The motion should argue: (1) valid arbitration agreement (clickwrap acceptance binds customers); (2) claims fall within arbitration scope (all disputes arising from account use); (3) FAA preempts state-law unconscionability challenges (*Concepcion*); (4) adhesion alone insufficient for unconscionability (*Bielski*); (5) delegation clause requires arbitrator to decide arbitrability.⁴⁴

**Plaintiff Opposition:**

Plaintiffs will argue: (1) procedural unconscionability (buried in lengthy Terms of Service, no meaningful choice, take-it-or-leave-it); (2) substantive unconscionability (one-sided terms, class waiver prevents vindication of federal statutory rights); (3) inadequate notice of arbitration clause; (4) gross negligence claims not arbitrable (public policy exception).⁴⁵

**Court's Probable Ruling:**

Based on 2024 precedent, **70-80% probability** court grants motion to compel arbitration and dismisses class action (or stays pending arbitration).⁴⁶ If granted, 1,842 customers must pursue individual arbitration claims. Given average claim value of $25,515 and arbitration costs ($200-$2,000 AAA filing fee + $10,000-$50,000 attorney fees), most customers will not pursue arbitration, effectively terminating the litigation.⁴⁷

**Strategic Impact on Settlement:**

- **If arbitration compelled (70-80% probability):** Settlement leverage shifts dramatically to CTE. Settlement value: $5M-$15M nuisance value (cost of administering potential individual arbitrations + avoiding reputational harm from protracted arbitration demands).⁴⁸

- **If arbitration denied (20-30% probability):** Class action proceeds. Settlement value: $30M-$50M (15-25% of $107M-$217M claimed damages).⁴⁹ CTE faces risk of $50M-$150M punitive damages verdict if case proceeds to trial.⁵⁰

#### B.3 Class Certification Analysis — 60-70% Certification Probability (If Arbitration Fails)

**NOTE:** This analysis assumes the arbitration clause is unenforceable or does not contain a class action waiver (20-30% probability scenario).

**Rule 23(a) Prerequisites (Easily Satisfied):**

**(1) Numerosity:** 1,842 customers clearly satisfies numerosity (courts certify classes with 40+ members).⁵¹

**(2) Commonality:** Common questions include: Did CTE owe a duty of care to safeguard customer assets? Did CTE's single-credential access breach industry standards? Was the Lazarus Group attack foreseeable? These questions generate common answers driving the litigation (*Wal-Mart* standard).⁵²

**(3) Typicality:** Lead plaintiff's claims (breach of contract, negligence, fiduciary duty based on hot wallet hack) are typical of all 1,842 class members' claims arising from the same September 18, 2024 incident.⁵³

**(4) Adequacy:** Experienced class action counsel and no apparent conflicts between lead plaintiff and class members satisfy adequacy.⁵⁴

**Rule 23(b)(3) Predominance (Key Battleground):**

**CTE's Strongest Defense — Individual Reliance Issues:**

CTE will argue that individual questions predominate: (1) Did each customer read the Terms of Service security representations? (2) Did each customer rely on CTE's specific security promises? (3) Would CTE's alleged security failures have prevented the hack as to each individual customer's specific assets?⁵⁵

**Plaintiffs' Response:**

(1) **Common course of conduct:** CTE uniformly failed to implement multi-signature authorization for all customers. No individual inquiry needed—the security vulnerability affected all customers identically.⁵⁶

(2) **Damages formula:** Each customer's stolen funds are precisely known (CTE has records). No individual damages calculation required—simple formula: stolen amount per customer.⁵⁷

(3) **No reliance required for negligence:** Breach of duty of care does not require individual reliance on representations. If CTE breached its duty to implement reasonable security, all customers were harmed regardless of whether they read Terms of Service.⁵⁸

(4) **Fraud-on-the-market analogy:** While typically applied to securities fraud, courts have extended presumptions of reliance to data breach cases where defendants made uniform misrepresentations to all consumers.⁵⁹

**2024 Data Breach Class Action Trend:**

WilmerHale's 2024 Year in Review reported that courts increasingly certify data breach class actions where the defendant's security failure was uniform across all plaintiffs, rejecting arguments that individual reliance issues defeat predominance.⁶⁰ Multiple 2024 decisions (*In re Accellion, Inc. Data Breach Litig.*, *Baton v. Ledger SAS*) denied motions to dismiss negligence claims and found predominance satisfied where security vulnerabilities uniformly affected all class members.⁶¹

**Predominance Likelihood: 60-70%**

CTE's uniform security failure (single-credential access to hot wallets) likely predominates over individual reliance issues. Damages are mechanically calculable from CTE's records. The critical liability question—whether CTE breached its duty of care—applies uniformly to all class members.⁶²

**Rule 23(b)(3) Superiority (80-90% Likelihood):**

With average claim value of $25,515, individual litigation is economically infeasible. Class action is far superior to 1,842 separate lawsuits. CTE cannot realistically defend 1,842 individual cases.⁶³

**Overall Class Certification Probability: 60-70%** (conditional on reaching certification stage after surviving motion to dismiss and arbitration challenge).

#### B.4 Settlement Valuation — Probability-Weighted Analysis

**Damages Calculation Theories:**

**Plaintiffs' Maximum Claim:**

- Actual damages: $47M (already reimbursed by CTE)
- Consequential damages: $5M-$10M (loss of use, opportunity costs)
- Punitive damages: $50M-$150M (2× to 6× compensatory damages for gross negligence)⁶⁴
- Attorneys' fees: $10M-$20M (25-30% of total recovery)⁶⁵
- **Total Maximum Claim: $112M-$227M**

**CTE's Defense Position:**

- Actual damages: $0 (customers made whole through $47M reimbursement)
- Consequential damages: $0 (platform restored within days, minimal loss of use)
- Punitive damages: $0 (no gross negligence; rapid response, voluntary reimbursement, nation-state attack mitigation)
- Attorneys' fees: Defense should bear own costs
- **CTE Position: $0 liability**

**Comparable Cryptocurrency Class Action Settlements:**

*BlockFi Securities Class Action* (2024): $13.25M settlement for unregistered securities and misleading statements.⁶⁶ Limited comparability (securities fraud rather than security breach), but establishes $13M range for crypto exchange class action.

*Cryptsy Exchange Class Action* (2016-2018): ~35-50% recovery for theft and failure to safeguard assets. $962,500 follow-on settlement with Coinbase increased total recovery to over 50% of losses.⁶⁷ **Directly analogous** (exchange theft, security failure).

*BitConnect* (2022-2023): $17M criminal restitution + $56M asset seizure = $73M total, representing ~10-15% of $2.4B Ponzi scheme losses.⁶⁸ Limited relevance (fraud-based claims rather than negligence).

*Atomic Wallet* (2024): Dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. No recovery despite >$100M stolen by North Korean hackers and negligence/gross negligence allegations.⁶⁹ **Directly analogous** (North Korean hack, negligence), but dismissal on procedural grounds prevents damages precedent.

**Settlement Range Benchmarks:**

- Securities fraud class actions: 5-15% of claimed damages⁷⁰
- Data breach class actions: 2-10% of claimed damages (often nominal $1M-$5M)⁷¹
- Crypto-specific class actions: 5-35% of claimed damages (wide variance)⁷²

**Probability-Weighted Settlement Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Probability | Settlement | Defense Costs | Total Exposure | Weighted Value |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **1: Arbitration Compelled** | 70% | $10M | $2M | $12M | $8.4M |
| **2: Class Certified** | 15% | $40M | $8M | $48M | $7.2M |
| **3: Individual Cases** | 10% | $15M | $5M | $20M | $2.0M |
| **4: MTD Granted** | 5% | $2.5M | $1.5M | $4M | $0.2M |
| **Expected Value** | **100%** | — | — | — | **$17.8M** |

**Expected Exposure: $15M-$30M** (settlement + defense costs)

**Downside (95th percentile):** $45M-$50M (class certified, high settlement to avoid punitive damages trial)

**Upside (5th percentile):** $3M-$5M (motion to dismiss granted or early arbitration enforcement with minimal settlement)

**Research Plan Comparison:**

The research plan estimated $60M-$170M exposure assuming class certification and potential punitive damages verdict at trial.⁷³ Our revised expected exposure of $15M-$30M reflects the **70-80% probability of arbitration enforcement**, which effectively terminates the class action. If arbitration fails (20-30% probability), the settlement range of $30M-$50M aligns with the research plan's low-end estimate.⁷⁴

#### B.5 Litigation Timeline and Settlement Strategy

**Milestone Timeline:**

| Milestone | Date Range | Status | Key Decision Point |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Complaint Filed | June 2024 | Complete | — |
| Answer + Arbitration Motion | August 2024 | Likely Filed | CTE's initial defense strategy |
| MTD Briefing Complete | November 2024 | Likely Complete | — |
| **Arbitration Ruling** | **December 2025 - June 2026** | **PENDING** | **Critical: 70-80% case termination** |
| MTD Ruling (if arbitration denied) | May 2025 - November 2025 | Pending | 60-70% survival probability |
| Discovery | June 2025 - May 2026 | Conditional | If MTD denied and arbitration denied |
| Class Certification Motion | June 2026 | Conditional | If discovery proceeds |
| Class Cert Ruling | January 2027 - June 2027 | Conditional | 60-70% certification if reached |
| **Settlement** | **Q2 2026 - Q3 2027** | **EXPECTED** | **Avoid trial (punitive damages risk)** |

**Probability-Weighted Expected Settlement Date: Q2 2026** (2 years from filing, coinciding with arbitration ruling or shortly thereafter).⁷⁵

**Settlement Negotiation Strategy:**

**If Arbitration Compelled (70% probability by Q2 2026):**

- Offer $5M-$10M global settlement to plaintiffs' counsel to avoid administrative burden of 1,842 individual arbitration demands⁷⁶
- Structure as cy pres settlement (donation to cybersecurity research foundation) to avoid per-customer payments and CAFA notice requirements⁷⁷
- Emphasize CTE's voluntary $47M customer reimbursement as demonstrating good faith⁷⁸
- Target resolution by Q3 2026 (3 months post-arbitration ruling)

**If Class Action Proceeds (30% probability):**

- Engage in early settlement negotiations Q4 2026 - Q1 2027 (post-discovery, pre-trial)⁷⁹
- Target settlement: $30M-$40M (15-20% of $107M-$217M claimed damages)⁸⁰
- **Avoid trial at all costs:** Punitive damages risk $50M-$150M if jury finds gross negligence based on single-credential access to $1.2B hot wallet⁸¹
- Settlement leverage factors:
  - CTE's voluntary $47M reimbursement (no actual damages to customers)⁸²
  - Nation-state attack attribution (Lazarus Group sophisticated adversary)⁸³
  - Rapid incident response (6-minute detection, 15-minute platform shutdown)⁸⁴
  - Security enhancements implemented ($4M-$6M remediation)⁸⁵

### C. Risk Assessment

#### Risk Summary Table

| # | Finding | Severity | Probability | Methodology | Gross Exposure | Valuation | Weighted Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Arbitration clause enforced, class action dismissed | HIGH | 70-80% | 2024 case law precedent (*Bielski*, *Binance*) | $0 (dismissal) | $10M-$12M nuisance settlement | $8.4M | Motion to compel arbitration filed |
| 2 | Arbitration denied, class certification granted | HIGH | 15% (conditional) | Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 predominance analysis | $112M-$227M (max claim) | $40M-$48M settlement | $7.2M | Challenge predominance; emphasize customer reimbursement |
| 3 | Punitive damages verdict at trial | HIGH | 3-5% (if trial) | Gross negligence standard; jury sympathy | $50M-$150M | $50M-$75M after remittitur | $1.5M-$3.75M | Settle before trial; demonstrate rapid response |
| 4 | SEC collateral estoppel applied | MEDIUM | 60-70% (if SEC settles with admissions) | *Parklane Hosiery* offensive use | +$10M-$20M settlement increase | +$15M | +$10.5M | SEC settlement "neither admit nor deny" language |
| 5 | D&O insurance coverage denied for settlement | MEDIUM | 30-40% | Policy fraud exclusion; gross negligence exclusion | $40M-$48M uninsured | $40M-$48M Seller bears | $14.4M | Verify D&O policy covers negligence settlements |
| 6 | Individual arbitrations filed (if compelled) | LOW | 5-10% (of 1,842 customers) | AAA filing costs deter most claimants | $8M-$15M (100-200 arbitrations @ $75K avg) | $8M-$15M | $0.8M | Offer early global settlement $5M-$10M |

#### Aggregate Section Exposure

| Metric | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Gross Exposure (Sum)** | $180M-$422M | Before probability weighting (includes max claims if no arbitration) |
| **Probability-Weighted** | $17.8M | Risk-adjusted total (70% arbitration enforcement dramatically reduces exposure) |
| **Recommended Escrow** | $25M-$50M | Covers downside scenario (class certified, high settlement) |
| **Purchase Price Adjustment** | $15M-$30M | For expected exposure (settlement + defense costs) |

**Key Risk Drivers:**

1. **Arbitration enforcement probability (70-80%):** Single most important variable. If arbitration compelled, exposure drops from $40M-$50M to $10M-$12M.⁸⁶

2. **Punitive damages multiplier:** If case proceeds to trial and jury finds gross negligence (single-credential access to $1.2B), punitive damages could be 2× to 6× compensatory damages ($50M-$150M range).⁸⁷ Trial avoidance is critical.

3. **SEC collateral estoppel risk:** If SEC settlement (expected Q3 2025) includes admissions regarding inadequate security controls, plaintiffs can use offensive collateral estoppel to establish negligence, increasing settlement leverage by $10M-$20M.⁸⁸

4. **D&O insurance coverage:** If D&O policy excludes punitive damages or gross negligence settlements, CTE (and by extension, Seller under indemnification provisions) bears uninsured settlement costs.⁸⁹

### D. Cross-Domain Implications

#### Cross-Section Impact Summary

| Finding | Affects Section | Legal Doctrine | Contract Impact |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Arbitration enforcement (70-80%) | IV.H (Insurance Coverage) | D&O defense costs $2M vs. $8M depending on arbitration outcome | Article 8.2(a)(xiii) indemnification amount varies $6M-$46M |
| Class action settlement $15M-$30M | IV.L (Financial Impact) | Aggregate exposure calculation; escrow sizing | Article 2.3(vi) Class Action Litigation Escrow $25M |
| Gross negligence finding | IV.G (Cybersecurity) | Single-credential access = gross negligence standard | Article 3.23(b) representation on security controls |
| SEC collateral estoppel | IV.A (SEC Enforcement) | *Parklane Hosiery* offensive use in civil litigation | Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(E) settlement adjustment if SEC admits violations |

#### Detailed Cross-References

**Finding 1: Arbitration Enforcement (70-80% Probability)**

This finding directly affects:

- **Section IV.H (Insurance Coverage)** at ¶18-22: D&O insurance defense costs depend on litigation complexity and duration. If arbitration compelled, defense costs are $2M-$3M (motion practice through arbitration ruling). If class action proceeds, defense costs are $8M-$19M (through class certification, discovery, summary judgment).⁹⁰ The $6M-$16M variance affects D&O policy exhaustion risk and triggers Article 8.2(a)(xii)(B) (Insurance Gap Indemnification) if D&O limits are insufficient.⁹¹

- **Contract Provision Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(D)**: The arbitration success reduction clause provides that if CTE's motion to compel arbitration is granted, Seller's indemnification obligations are capped at $5M total (100% of settlement up to $7.5M + 50% of defense costs), recognizing the dramatically reduced exposure when class action is dismissed.⁹²

Legal doctrine: The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 2, creates a federal policy favoring arbitration that preempts state-law barriers.⁹³ *Concepcion*'s holding that class action waivers are enforceable fundamentally alters class action exposure for companies with enforceable arbitration clauses in consumer agreements.⁹⁴

**Finding 2: SEC Collateral Estoppel Application (60-70% Probability if SEC Settles with Admissions)**

This finding directly affects:

- **Section IV.A (SEC Enforcement)** at ¶45-52: The SEC settlement (expected Q3 2025) will determine whether CTE must admit to inadequate security controls or other negligence that plaintiffs can use in the class action.⁹⁵ If SEC settlement includes admission that CTE's security controls were inadequate to protect customer assets, this satisfies the "breach of duty" element of plaintiffs' negligence claim under offensive collateral estoppel doctrine.⁹⁶

- **Contract Provision Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(E)**: The SEC collateral estoppel adjustment clause reduces the Buyer Threshold in the indemnification provision from $10M to $5M if SEC settlement admissions are used for collateral estoppel in the class action, recognizing the increased settlement value created by the regulatory admission.⁹⁷

Legal doctrine: Under *Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore*, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), offensive collateral estoppel permits a plaintiff to prevent a defendant from relitigating an issue the defendant previously litigated and lost (or admitted) in an action with another party.⁹⁸ The doctrine applies when: (1) the issue is identical; (2) actually litigated (or admitted in settlement); (3) necessary to the prior judgment; and (4) defendant had full and fair opportunity to litigate.⁹⁹

**Finding 3: Gross Negligence Standard**

This finding directly affects:

- **Section IV.G (Cybersecurity)** at ¶28-35: The cybersecurity analysis documents CTE's use of single-credential access to hot wallet management systems controlling $1.2B in customer assets (8% of $15B total AUC).¹⁰⁰ Multi-signature wallets are industry standard for cryptocurrency custodians to eliminate single points of failure.¹⁰¹ CTE's failure to implement multi-sig constitutes an "extreme departure from ordinary care" potentially satisfying the gross negligence standard.¹⁰²

- **Contract Provision Article 3.23(b)**: The representation on security controls requires Seller to disclose that CTE operated single-credential access until post-breach remediation in October 2024, and that this security architecture fell below industry standard practice for exchanges of CTE's size.¹⁰³

Legal doctrine: Gross negligence requires conduct exhibiting "want of even scant care" or "extreme departure from ordinary care."¹⁰⁴ Unlike ordinary negligence (which permits only compensatory damages), gross negligence allows punitive damages designed to punish and deter.¹⁰⁵ Tennessee and Connecticut statutory safe harbors (2024 laws) limit cybersecurity liability to gross negligence or willful misconduct, reflecting legislative recognition that ordinary negligence standard is too harsh for cybersecurity breaches.¹⁰⁶

**Finding 4: D&O Insurance Coverage Limitations**

This finding directly affects:

- **Section IV.H (Insurance Coverage)** at ¶55-68: D&O policies typically provide Side C (entity securities coverage) for securities class actions, covering defense costs and settlements.¹⁰⁷ However, punitive damages are often excluded or covered only "where insurable under law."¹⁰⁸ Texas law permits insurance coverage for punitive damages resulting from gross negligence (but not intentional conduct).¹⁰⁹ If plaintiff proves gross negligence, $50M-$150M punitive damages may be uninsured, creating a coverage gap requiring Seller indemnification or Buyer self-funding.¹¹⁰

- **Contract Provision Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(C)**: The D&O tower exhaustion sharing clause provides that if class action settlement or judgment exceeds available D&O coverage (after SEC and CFTC defense costs deplete the tower), the excess is shared 50/50 between Seller and Buyer up to a $25M Seller cap.¹¹¹

Legal doctrine: Texas Insurance Code permits insurance coverage for punitive damages arising from gross negligence but not intentional wrongdoing.¹¹² Federal securities class actions routinely incur covered defense costs under D&O policies,¹¹³ but settlement coverage depends on exclusions for fraud, willful misconduct, or punitive damages.¹¹⁴

#### E.2 Draft Contract Language

The following five complete contract provisions are ready for insertion into the Stock Purchase Agreement (or Asset Purchase Agreement):

##### Provision 1: Class Action Litigation Representation

**Article 3.23: Class Action Litigation Representation**

```
Seller represents and warrants that:

(a) Pending Class Action. Johnson v. CryptoTrade Exchange LLC, Case No. [●] (W.D. Texas),
filed in or around June 2024, is the only pending or threatened class action litigation against
the Company arising from the September 18, 2024 hot wallet security breach (the "September 2024
Incident"). Schedule 3.23 sets forth:
    (i) the consolidated complaint;
    (ii) the class definition (all U.S. customers holding assets on September 18, 2024 whose
        funds were stolen) and estimated class size (1,842 customers);
    (iii) the five causes of action asserted (breach of contract, negligence, breach of
         fiduciary duty, and punitive damages);
    (iv) defense counsel's litigation assessment dated [●], including:
        (A) Probability of arbitration clause enforcement: 70-80%
        (B) Probability of class certification (if arbitration denied): 60-70%
        (C) Settlement range: $5M-$15M (if arbitration enforced); $30M-$50M (if class certified)
        (D) Expected settlement date: Q2 2026 - Q3 2027
    (v) the arbitration clause contained in the Company's Terms of Service (Section 15.2),
        including class action waiver and American Arbitration Association rules; and
    (vi) the Company's motion to compel arbitration filed on or about August 2024 (or to be
         filed if not yet filed), including status of briefing and anticipated ruling date.

(b) No Customer Actual Damages. The Company reimbursed all 1,842 affected customers the full
amount of their stolen cryptocurrency ($47 million total) within 30 days of the September 2024
Incident. No affected customer suffered unreimbursed actual damages from the Incident. Plaintiffs
in the class action seek consequential damages (loss of use), emotional distress, and punitive
damages for alleged gross negligence, but do not claim unreimbursed actual damages.

(c) Arbitration Clause Enforceability. The Company's Terms of Service Section 15.2, as in
effect for all customers who created accounts on or after January 1, 2019, contains a binding
arbitration clause with class action waiver requiring individual arbitration under AAA Consumer
Arbitration Rules. Defense counsel has advised that the arbitration clause has a 70-80%
probability of enforcement under controlling Ninth Circuit and Fifth Circuit precedent (Bielski
v. Coinbase, 9th Cir. 2024; AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333 (2011)), which would
result in dismissal or stay of the class action and require individual arbitration for any
customer claims.

(d) Settlement Range. Based on defense counsel's assessment:
    (i) If arbitration enforced (70-80% probability): Expected settlement $5M-$15M (nuisance
        value to avoid administrative burden of individual arbitration demands from subset of
        1,842 customers);
    (ii) If arbitration denied and class action proceeds (20-30% probability): Expected
         settlement $30M-$50M (15-25% of plaintiffs' claimed damages of $112M-$227M, including
         $50M-$150M punitive damages);
    (iii) Probability-weighted expected settlement: $17.8M ($15M-$30M range);
    (iv) Defense costs: $2M-$3M (if arbitration enforced) or $8M-$19M (if class action
         proceeds through class certification and settlement).

(e) D&O Coverage Availability. The Company's directors and officers liability insurance
policy provides coverage for:
    (i) Defense costs incurred in defending the class action (Side C entity securities
        coverage), subject to policy limits, retentions, and exclusions;
    (ii) Settlement amounts, subject to policy limits and exclusions (including potential
         exclusion for punitive damages or gross negligence settlements, depending on policy
         language—policy to be provided to Buyer for review);
    (iii) Available D&O capacity for the class action: $[●] million (after deducting SEC
          and CFTC defense costs as estimated in Section IV.A and Section IV.C).

(f) No Other Class Actions. To Seller's Knowledge, no other class action complaints have been
filed or threatened against the Company arising from the September 2024 Incident or any other
matter, and no facts or circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
additional class action litigation arising from events occurring prior to the Closing Date.

(g) Security Controls Representation. Seller acknowledges that the Company operated single-
credential access to hot wallet management systems from January 1, 2019 through October 15, 2024
(post-breach remediation date). Seller further acknowledges that industry best practice for
cryptocurrency exchanges of the Company's size ($15 billion assets under custody) is multi-
signature wallet authorization requiring at least 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 signatures to authorize
transactions exceeding $[threshold amount]. The Company implemented multi-signature wallets as
part of its post-breach security enhancements effective October 15, 2024.
```

##### Provision 2: Class Action Indemnification

**Article 8.2(a)(xiii): Class Action Indemnification**

```
Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from and against any
Losses arising from or relating to Johnson v. CryptoTrade Exchange LLC, Case No. [●] (W.D.
Texas), including:

(A) Settlement Amount. Any settlement payment, judgment, or award in the class action, to the
extent such amount exceeds $10 million (the "Buyer Threshold"). For clarity:
    (i) Buyer shall bear the first $10 million of any settlement or judgment;
    (ii) Seller shall indemnify Buyer for amounts exceeding the Buyer Threshold, up to a
         maximum Seller liability of $40 million (the "Seller Cap");
    (iii) If settlement or judgment exceeds $50 million ($10M Buyer Threshold + $40M Seller
          Cap), Buyer bears the excess.

    Calculation Examples:
    Example 1 (Arbitration Enforced): Settlement $12M
        Buyer pays: $10M (threshold)
        Seller pays: $2M (within $40M cap)

    Example 2 (Class Certified, Mid-Range): Settlement $37.5M
        Buyer pays: $10M (threshold)
        Seller pays: $27.5M (within $40M cap)

    Example 3 (Severe, Exceeds Cap): Settlement $60M
        Buyer pays: $20M ($10M threshold + $10M excess over cap)
        Seller pays: $40M (capped)

(B) Defense Costs. 50% of all reasonable and documented defense costs (attorneys' fees,
expert fees, deposition costs, court costs, discovery expenses) incurred in defending the class
action, up to a maximum Seller liability of $10 million. For clarity:
    (i) Buyer bears 50% of all defense costs regardless of amount;
    (ii) Seller bears 50% of defense costs up to the $10 million cap ($5M maximum Seller
         share if total defense costs are $10M; $7.5M maximum Seller share if total defense
         costs are $15M; $10M maximum Seller share if total defense costs are $20M or more).

    Calculation Examples:
    Example 1 (Arbitration Enforced): Total Defense Costs $3M
        Buyer pays: $1.5M (50%)
        Seller pays: $1.5M (50%, within $10M cap)

    Example 2 (Class Certified): Total Defense Costs $14M
        Buyer pays: $7M (50%)
        Seller pays: $7M (50%, within $10M cap)

    Example 3 (Protracted Litigation): Total Defense Costs $24M
        Buyer pays: $12M (50%)
        Seller pays: $10M (capped at $10M, not $12M)

(C) D&O Tower Exhaustion Sharing. If the class action settlement or judgment, together with
defense costs, exceeds the available directors and officers liability insurance coverage (after
accounting for SEC enforcement defense costs per Section 8.2(a)(vii) and CFTC enforcement
defense costs per Section 8.2(a)(ix), and after deducting the $[●] million self-insured
retention), the excess amount above available D&O coverage shall be shared 50/50 between Seller
and Buyer, up to a maximum Seller liability of $25 million as provided in Section 8.2(a)(xii)(B)
(Insurance Gap Indemnification).

    Coordination with Other Indemnification: Amounts paid by Seller under this Section
    8.2(a)(xiii)(C) (D&O exhaustion) shall count toward Seller's aggregate cap under subsection
    (A) (Settlement Amount). Seller's total maximum liability under subsections (A), (B), and
    (C) combined is $50 million ($40M settlement cap + $10M defense cost cap, with D&O
    exhaustion sharing counted within the $40M settlement cap).

(D) Arbitration Success Reduction. If the Company's motion to compel arbitration is granted
and the class action is dismissed or stayed, Seller's indemnification obligations under this
Section shall be reduced as follows:
    (i) Settlement amounts: Seller pays 100% of settlement up to $7.5 million (recognizing
        that arbitration enforcement produces $5M-$15M nuisance settlement range, midpoint
        $10M, with Seller bearing 75% and Buyer bearing remainder for settlements in this
        range);
    (ii) Defense costs: Seller pays 50% of defense costs incurred up to and including the
         arbitration ruling, with a maximum Seller liability of $1.5 million (expected
         defense costs through arbitration ruling: $2M-$3M);
    (iii) Maximum Seller liability if arbitration enforced: $9 million total ($7.5M
          settlement + $1.5M defense costs).

    Rationale: Arbitration enforcement (70-80% probability per Section 3.23(c)) dramatically
    reduces settlement exposure from $30M-$50M range to $5M-$15M range. This provision
    reflects the 67-83% reduction in settlement value when class action is dismissed.

(E) SEC Collateral Estoppel Adjustment. If the SEC settlement described in Section IV.A
includes an admission or finding (whether by consent or after litigation) that the Company's
security controls were inadequate to protect customer assets, or that the Company was negligent
in its security practices, and such admission or finding is used by plaintiffs in the class
action for offensive collateral estoppel pursuant to Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S.
322 (1979), then:
    (i) The Buyer Threshold in subsection (A) shall be reduced from $10 million to $5
        million, recognizing the increased settlement value created by the regulatory
        admission; and
    (ii) Seller's maximum liability under subsection (A) shall increase from $40 million to
         $45 million (Seller Cap increased by $5 million to offset the reduced Buyer
         Threshold).

    Rationale: SEC collateral estoppel eliminates the "breach of duty" element of plaintiffs'
    negligence claim, increasing settlement leverage by an estimated $10M-$20M (40-67%
    increase from $15M-$30M baseline to $25M-$50M range). This provision allocates the
    increased settlement risk to Seller, whose pre-closing conduct is the subject of the SEC
    admission.

(F) No Double Recovery. Amounts indemnified under Section 8.2(a)(xi) (Hot Wallet Incident)
that overlap with class action claims shall not be subject to double indemnification.
Specifically:
    (i) If customers' class action claims include unrecovered losses from the September 2024
        hot wallet incident, and Seller has indemnified Buyer for insurance claim denial
        under Section 8.2(a)(xi)(C), such amounts shall be credited against Seller's
        obligations under this Section 8.2(a)(xiii);
    (ii) If settlement includes a cy pres component (e.g., donation to cybersecurity
         research foundation in lieu of pro rata customer payments), such amounts are covered
         under this Section and not under Section 8.2(a)(xi).

(G) Exclusions from Indemnification. Seller shall have no indemnification obligation for:
    (i) Any new or additional class action lawsuits filed after the Closing Date based on
        conduct, events, or omissions occurring after the Closing Date;
    (ii) Losses arising from Buyer's post-Closing mismanagement of the litigation, including:
        (A) Unreasonable rejection of settlement offers that defense counsel advised Buyer
            to accept;
        (B) Failure to timely file or adequately pursue the Company's motion to compel
            arbitration;
        (C) Waiver of arbitration defense through delay or conduct inconsistent with
            arbitration;
        (D) Failure to assert available defenses (force majeure, no actual damages, customer
            reimbursement);
    (iii) Punitive damages awarded against the Company, unless:
        (A) Such punitive damages are covered by the Company's directors and officers
            liability insurance policy; or
        (B) Seller is found to have committed intentional misconduct or fraud giving rise to
            the punitive damages (in which case Seller's indemnification obligation is
            uncapped for such conduct);
    (iv) Attorneys' fees awarded to plaintiffs' counsel under fee-shifting statutes or court
         orders, except to the extent such fees are included in a negotiated global
         settlement covered by subsection (A).

(H) Defense Control and Consent Rights.
    (i) Buyer shall have sole control of the defense of the class action, including
        selection of defense counsel (subject to Seller's reasonable approval), litigation
        strategy, and settlement negotiations;
    (ii) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense
         at Seller's expense (separate counsel), including attending all hearings,
         depositions, settlement conferences, and receiving copies of all pleadings,
         discovery, and court orders;
    (iii) Buyer shall not settle the class action without Seller's prior written consent
          (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Seller's consent shall
          be deemed reasonable if:
        (A) The settlement amount does not exceed the probability-weighted expected
            settlement range in Section 3.23(d) by more than 25% ($22.25M for arbitration
            scenario; $62.5M for class certification scenario); or
        (B) Defense counsel provides a written opinion that the settlement is reasonable
            under the circumstances given litigation risks, trial risks, and punitive damages
            exposure;
    (iv) If Seller unreasonably withholds consent to a settlement recommended by defense
         counsel, Seller's indemnification obligations under this Section shall include any
         excess judgment or settlement amount above the settlement offer Seller rejected,
         plus post-rejection defense costs;
    (v) Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of all material developments in the
        litigation, including providing copies of all material pleadings, motions, orders,
        discovery disputes, and settlement communications within 3 business days of filing
        or receipt.

(I) Notification Obligations.
    (i) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing within 5 business days of:
        (A) The court's ruling on the Company's motion to compel arbitration;
        (B) The court's ruling on the Company's motion to dismiss;
        (C) Any class certification motion filed by plaintiffs;
        (D) The court's ruling on class certification;
        (E) Any settlement offer or demand exceeding $10 million;
        (F) Any indication that punitive damages claimed exceed $50 million;
        (G) Any expert reports opining that the Company's security controls constituted
            gross negligence;
    (ii) Failure to provide timely notification shall not relieve Seller of indemnification
         obligations unless Seller demonstrates actual prejudice from the delay.

(J) Survival Period. This indemnification obligation shall survive until the earlier of:
    (i) Final resolution of Johnson v. CryptoTrade Exchange LLC, including all appeals, with
        no further right to appeal or collaterally attack the judgment; or
    (ii) December 31, 2029 (five years post-Closing), provided that:
        (A) Any indemnification claims asserted in writing by Buyer to Seller prior to
            December 31, 2029 shall survive until finally resolved;
        (B) If the class action is not resolved by December 31, 2029, this indemnification
            obligation shall survive until resolution;
        (C) For clarity, the survival period does not terminate Seller's obligations for
            pending litigation.

(K) Set-Off Rights. Buyer may set off any amounts owed by Seller under this Section
8.2(a)(xiii) against:
    (i) The Class Action Litigation Escrow established under Article 2.3(vi);
    (ii) The General Indemnification Escrow established under Article 2.3(v);
    (iii) Any other amounts owed by Buyer to Seller under this Agreement or related
          transaction documents.

(L) Insurance Proceeds. To the extent the Company receives insurance proceeds (whether under
the directors and officers liability insurance policy or any other applicable insurance) that
reimburse defense costs or settlement amounts covered by this Section 8.2(a)(xiii), such
insurance proceeds shall:
    (i) First, reimburse Buyer for any amounts Buyer advanced or paid that would have been
        Seller's obligation under subsections (A) or (B);
    (ii) Second, reimburse Buyer for Buyer's share of costs under the cost-sharing provisions;
    (iii) Third, any remaining proceeds shall be retained by the Company (or Buyer as
          successor owner).
```

##### Provision 3: Class Action Litigation Escrow

**Article 2.3(vi): Class Action Litigation Escrow**

```
(a) Escrow Amount and Purpose. At Closing, Buyer shall deposit $25 million of the Purchase
Price into the Class Action Litigation Escrow Account (the "CAL Escrow") with [Escrow Agent]
(the "Escrow Agent"), to be held and administered pursuant to the Class Action Litigation Escrow
Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit F (the "CAL Escrow Agreement"). The CAL Escrow
secures Seller's indemnification obligations under Article 8.2(a)(xiii) (Class Action
Indemnification) for Johnson v. CryptoTrade Exchange LLC.

(b) Release Conditions. The CAL Escrow shall be released to Seller or applied to satisfy
Seller's indemnification obligations as follows:

    (i) Arbitration Success Release. If the Company's motion to compel arbitration in Johnson
        v. CryptoTrade Exchange LLC is granted, and the class action is dismissed or stayed
        (with prejudice or in favor of individual arbitration), within 5 Business Days after
        the arbitration ruling becomes final and non-appealable (following expiration of time
        to appeal or resolution of any appeals):
        (A) Release $17.5 million to Seller (recognizing that arbitration enforcement
            produces expected settlement exposure of $5M-$15M, well below full escrow);
        (B) Retain $7.5 million in CAL Escrow for potential individual arbitration filings
            or nuisance settlement per Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(D).

    (ii) Individual Arbitration Settlement Release. If, following arbitration enforcement per
         subsection (b)(i), the parties reach a global settlement with plaintiffs' counsel
         for individual arbitration claims:
        (A) Apply necessary funds from the retained $7.5 million to satisfy Seller's
            settlement obligations under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(D) (100% up to $7.5M);
        (B) Within 5 Business Days after settlement payment, release remaining CAL Escrow
            balance to Seller.

    (iii) No SEC Collateral Estoppel Release. If the SEC settlement described in Section IV.A
          becomes final (whether by consent decree, settlement agreement, or judgment) and
          such settlement does NOT include any admission or finding that could be used for
          collateral estoppel in the class action (i.e., SEC settlement contains standard
          "neither admit nor deny" language and no findings regarding the Company's security
          controls or negligence), within 5 Business Days after the SEC settlement becomes
          final and non-appealable:
        (A) Release $5 million to Seller (recognizing reduced class action settlement risk
            when SEC admission unavailable for collateral estoppel);
        (B) Retain $20 million in CAL Escrow for class action settlement and defense costs.

    (iv) Class Certification Denial Release. If the class action is not certified under Fed.
         R. Civ. P. 23 (whether due to motion to dismiss being granted, class certification
         motion denied, or plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal), within 5 Business Days after the
         certification ruling becomes final and non-appealable:
        (A) Release $10 million to Seller (recognizing that individual cases or small group
            settlements produce lower exposure than certified class);
        (B) Retain $15 million in CAL Escrow for potential individual plaintiff settlements
            or remaining litigation costs.

    (v) Settlement or Judgment Funding. Upon execution of a binding settlement agreement or
        entry of final judgment in the class action (including any punitive damages award),
        the CAL Escrow shall be applied to satisfy Seller's indemnification obligations under
        Article 8.2(a)(xiii) in the following order of priority:
        (A) First, Buyer's Threshold: The first $10 million (or $5 million if SEC collateral
            estoppel applies per Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(E)) of settlement or judgment shall be
            paid by Buyer (not from CAL Escrow);
        (B) Second, Seller's Share from CAL Escrow: Apply CAL Escrow funds to pay Seller's
            indemnification obligation above the Buyer Threshold, up to $25 million (or the
            then-remaining CAL Escrow balance after any prior releases);
        (C) Third, Seller's Additional Payment: If settlement or judgment exceeds $35 million
            ($10M Buyer Threshold + $25M CAL Escrow), Seller shall pay the excess to Buyer
            within 10 Business Days of settlement execution or judgment entry, up to Seller's
            $40 million cap under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(A);
        (D) Fourth, Buyer's Excess: If settlement or judgment exceeds $50 million ($10M Buyer
            Threshold + $40M Seller Cap), Buyer bears the excess above $50 million.

    Settlement Funding Examples:

    Example 1 (Arbitration Enforced, Nuisance Settlement $10M):
        Buyer pays: $10M (threshold) = $10M
        Seller obligation: $0 (below threshold)
        CAL Escrow applied: $0
        Remaining CAL Escrow released to Seller: $25M (full escrow)

    Example 2 (Class Certified, Mid-Range Settlement $37.5M):
        Buyer pays: $10M (threshold) = $10M
        Seller obligation: $27.5M (above threshold, within cap)
        CAL Escrow applied: $25M (partial satisfaction of Seller obligation)
        Seller additional payment: $2.5M (to Buyer within 10 days)
        Remaining CAL Escrow: $0 (fully applied)

    Example 3 (Severe, Settlement $60M Exceeding Cap):
        Buyer pays: $10M (threshold) + $10M (excess over $50M cap) = $20M
        Seller obligation: $40M (capped)
        CAL Escrow applied: $25M (partial satisfaction)
        Seller additional payment: $15M (to reach $40M cap)
        Remaining CAL Escrow: $0 (fully applied)

    (vi) Defense Cost Funding During Litigation. The CAL Escrow may be used to fund Seller's
         50% share of defense costs as they are incurred (rather than waiting for final
         resolution), provided that:
        (A) Buyer provides Escrow Agent with:
            (1) Invoices from defense counsel and expert witnesses showing costs incurred;
            (2) Evidence of Buyer's payment of its 50% share of such costs; and
            (3) Written certification that the costs are reasonable and necessary defense
                costs under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(B);
        (B) Maximum cumulative draw for defense costs: $10 million (reflecting Seller's
            maximum defense cost obligation under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(B));
        (C) Defense cost draws reduce the CAL Escrow available for settlement funding under
            subsection (b)(v);
        (D) If Seller's ultimate defense cost obligation under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(B) is
            less than amounts drawn for defense costs, excess amounts shall be credited
            toward Seller's settlement obligations or released to Seller if no settlement
            obligation remains.

    (vii) Final Release Date. On December 31, 2029 (five years post-Closing), if Johnson v.
          CryptoTrade Exchange LLC has not been fully and finally resolved (including all
          appeals), the CAL Escrow shall be released as follows:
        (A) If settlement negotiations are ongoing or settlement is pending court approval,
            retain in escrow an amount equal to 150% of the estimated settlement amount per
            then-current defense counsel assessment, and release remainder to Seller;
        (B) If litigation is ongoing with no settlement negotiations, retain in escrow an
            amount equal to Seller's estimated maximum exposure per then-current defense
            counsel assessment (capped at remaining escrow balance), and release remainder
            to Seller;
        (C) If no claims have been asserted by Buyer under Article 8.2(a)(xiii) and the
            litigation has been dormant (no activity for 12+ consecutive months), release
            entire remaining CAL Escrow balance to Seller.

(c) Interest on CAL Escrow. All interest or other investment income earned on the CAL Escrow
shall be:
    (i) Allocated 50/50 between Buyer and Seller;
    (ii) Distributed annually on each anniversary of the Closing Date while escrow remains
         open;
    (iii) Taxable to the party receiving distribution; Escrow Agent shall issue IRS Forms
          1099 to Buyer and Seller for their respective shares.

(d) Coordination with Other Escrows and Indemnification Provisions.

    (i) Coordination with D&O Exhaustion Sub-Account (Article 2.3(v)(a)(ii)). The CAL Escrow
        ($25 million) is separate from and in addition to the D&O Exhaustion Sub-Account
        ($20 million established under Article 2.3(v)(a)(ii)). Application priority:
        (A) First: Directors and officers liability insurance policy pays covered defense
            costs and settlement amounts up to available policy limits;
        (B) Second: If D&O policy limits are exhausted, the D&O Exhaustion Sub-Account
            ($20M) funds Seller's 50% share of excess amounts per Article 8.2(a)(xii)(B);
        (C) Third: After D&O Exhaustion Sub-Account is depleted, the CAL Escrow funds
            Seller's remaining indemnification obligations under Article 8.2(a)(xiii).

    (ii) Coordination with Hot Wallet Incident Indemnification (Article 8.2(a)(xi)). If
         customers' class action claims overlap with hot wallet incident losses covered by
         Article 8.2(a)(xi), and Seller has made payment to Buyer under Article 8.2(a)(xi)(C)
         (insurance claim denial indemnification), such payments shall be credited against
         amounts owed under Article 8.2(a)(xiii) to prevent double payment. The CAL Escrow
         shall not be applied to the same losses twice.

    (iii) Coordination with General Indemnification Escrow (Article 2.3(v)). The CAL Escrow
          is a special-purpose escrow dedicated solely to class action indemnification under
          Article 8.2(a)(xiii). Buyer may not seek payment from the CAL Escrow for other
          indemnification claims under Article 8.2. Seller may not seek reduction of the CAL
          Escrow based on indemnification claims asserted under other Article 8.2 provisions.

    (iv) Set-Off Rights. Buyer's set-off rights under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(K) apply to the
         CAL Escrow. If Seller fails to make any required additional payment under subsection
         (b)(v)(C) within 10 Business Days of demand, Buyer may: (A) draw additional funds
         from any other escrow or holdback under this Agreement; (B) offset against any
         amounts owed to Seller; or (C) pursue legal action for breach.

(e) Escrow Agent Provisions.

    (i) Escrow Agent shall be [Escrow Agent Name], a [state] trust company, or such other
        third-party escrow agent as Buyer and Seller mutually agree in writing. Escrow Agent's
        rights, duties, compensation, and liability shall be governed by the CAL Escrow
        Agreement (Exhibit F), which shall be consistent with this Article 2.3(vi).

    (ii) Escrow Agent fees and costs shall be shared 50/50 between Buyer and Seller and paid
         from CAL Escrow interest earnings to the extent available, with any shortfall paid
         50/50 by Buyer and Seller within 10 Business Days of Escrow Agent's invoice.

    (iii) Escrow Agent may rely upon any written certification or instruction signed by Buyer
          and Seller jointly. In the event of any dispute between Buyer and Seller regarding
          release of CAL Escrow funds, Escrow Agent may: (A) interplead the funds into court
          and seek discharge; (B) hold the funds until receiving a final, non-appealable
          court order directing disbursement; or (C) follow any other procedure set forth in
          the CAL Escrow Agreement.

    (iv) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall be liable to Escrow Agent for Escrow Agent's fees,
         costs, or expenses beyond the 50/50 sharing provided in subsection (e)(ii), except
         that the party seeking wrongful release of escrow funds (as determined by a court of
         competent jurisdiction) shall reimburse Escrow Agent for all fees, costs, and
         expenses incurred in defending against such party's wrongful claim.

##### Provision 4: Closing Condition — Class Action Defense Status

**Article 7.1(xvii): Class Action Defense Status Closing Condition**

```
The obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction (or
waiver by Buyer in writing) of the following condition:

(a) No Adverse Ruling on Arbitration Motion. The Company's motion to compel arbitration in
Johnson v. CryptoTrade Exchange LLC, Case No. [●] (W.D. Texas) (the "Class Action"), shall not
have been denied by the court prior to the scheduled Closing Date. For clarity:

    (i) If the arbitration motion has been filed but not yet ruled upon as of the scheduled
        Closing Date, this condition is deemed satisfied, and Closing shall proceed as
        scheduled (subject to satisfaction of all other closing conditions);

    (ii) If the arbitration motion is denied prior to the scheduled Closing Date, Buyer may,
         in its sole discretion:
        (A) Terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10.1(d)(iii) (Closing Condition
            Failure) and receive return of the Deposit ($[●] million) with interest at the
            Agreed Rate; OR
        (B) Waive this condition and proceed to Closing, in which case:
            (1) The Buyer Threshold under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(A) (Class Action
                Indemnification) shall be reduced from $10 million to $5 million to reflect
                the increased class action settlement risk when the class action is not
                dismissed via arbitration;
            (2) The Class Action Litigation Escrow under Article 2.3(vi) shall be increased
                from $25 million to $35 million to reflect the increased settlement exposure;
            (3) Buyer may reduce the Purchase Price by $10 million to reflect the present
                value of increased litigation risk; such reduction shall be allocated
                proportionally across all components of the Purchase Price (cash, stock,
                earnout).

    (iii) For purposes of this Section, "denied" means any of the following:
        (A) Court order denying the Company's motion to compel arbitration in whole or in
            part (including partial denial allowing some claims to proceed in court while
            compelling arbitration of others);
        (B) Court order finding the arbitration clause unconscionable, unenforceable, or
            inapplicable to the Class Action;
        (C) Court order granting plaintiffs' motion to avoid arbitration or invalidate the
            class action waiver;
        (D) Indication by the court (whether oral from bench, tentative ruling, or draft
            order) that the court is inclined to deny the arbitration motion, if such
            indication occurs within 10 Business Days before the scheduled Closing Date and
            provides Buyer reasonable basis to anticipate denial.

    (iv) For purposes of this Section, "filed" means the Company filed a motion to compel
         arbitration and dismiss or stay the Class Action within 60 days of the date the
         Company filed its answer to the consolidated class action complaint. If the Company
         failed to timely file a motion to compel arbitration, Buyer may treat this condition
         as unsatisfied and exercise the termination or waiver rights in subsection (a)(ii).

(b) No Class Certification Prior to Closing. The court in the Class Action shall not have
granted a motion for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 prior to the scheduled Closing
Date. For clarity:

    (i) If no motion for class certification has been filed as of the scheduled Closing Date,
        this condition is deemed satisfied;

    (ii) If a motion for class certification has been filed but not yet ruled upon as of the
         scheduled Closing Date, this condition is deemed satisfied;

    (iii) If the court grants class certification prior to the scheduled Closing Date (whether
          full certification under Rule 23(b)(3) or limited certification of a liability
          class, settlement class, or issue class), Buyer may, in its sole discretion:
        (A) Terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10.1(d)(iii) and receive return of
            the Deposit with interest; OR
        (B) Waive this condition and proceed to Closing, in which case:
            (1) The Buyer Threshold under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(A) shall be reduced from $10
                million to $5 million;
            (2) The Class Action Litigation Escrow under Article 2.3(vi) shall be increased
                from $25 million to $40 million;
            (3) Buyer may reduce the Purchase Price by $15 million;
            (4) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute a
                settlement agreement with class counsel within 90 days after Closing, with
                settlement amount not to exceed $40 million without Buyer's prior written
                consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld if defense counsel
                advises settlement is reasonable under the circumstances).

(c) No Settlement Pending Buyer Approval. No binding settlement agreement shall have been
executed in the Class Action prior to Closing that:
    (i) Requires total payment (settlement amount plus attorneys' fees) exceeding $15 million
        (the "Settlement Threshold"); OR
    (ii) Includes terms materially adverse to the Company's business, reputation, or operations
         (including admissions of gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct; injunctive
         relief requiring business practice changes beyond security enhancements already
         implemented; or court appointment of a monitor or special master);

    UNLESS:

    (iii) Seller has obtained Buyer's prior written consent to the settlement terms, which
          consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Buyer's consent
          shall be deemed reasonable if:
        (A) The settlement amount does not exceed $15 million and contains standard release
            and "no admission" language; OR
        (B) Defense counsel provides written opinion that settlement is advisable to avoid
            substantially higher settlement or judgment risk; OR
        (C) Settlement includes arbitration enforcement (i.e., parties agree to dismiss class
            action and allow individual arbitrations) with payment ≤$10 million.

(d) Litigation Status Certificate. At Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate
executed by the Company's outside defense counsel in the Class Action (letterhead and signature
of partner leading the defense), dated no more than 5 Business Days prior to Closing, certifying
the following (the "Litigation Status Certificate"):

    (i) Current Procedural Posture. The current procedural status of the Class Action,
        including:
        (A) Date complaint(s) filed and whether consolidated;

        (G) Explanation of any material changes from the settlement range and probability
            assessment in Section 3.23(d) of this Agreement.

    (iv) No Adverse Changes Representation. Certification that, to defense counsel's

            litigation risk beyond the ranges disclosed in Section 3.23(d);
        (B) No facts or circumstances have come to defense counsel's attention that would
            support a finding of intentional fraud or willful misconduct (as opposed to

        (C) The Company has cooperated fully with defense counsel, provided all requested

(e) Buyer's Waiver Rights and Closing Adjustments.

    (i) Buyer's Right to Waive. Buyer may waive any or all of the conditions in subsections
        (a), (b), and (c) by written notice to Seller at any time prior to the scheduled
        Closing Date. Any waiver by Buyer shall be effective only if: (A) in writing signed
        by an authorized officer of Buyer; (B) specifically identify the condition(s) being
        waived; and (C) specify any closing adjustments (Purchase Price reduction, escrow
        increase, Buyer Threshold reduction) that will apply as a result of the waiver.

    (ii) Seller's Accommodation of Waiver Terms. If Buyer elects to waive a condition under
         subsection (a)(ii)(B) or (b)(iii)(B) and proceed to Closing with the specified
         adjustments (Purchase Price reduction, escrow increase, Buyer Threshold reduction),
         Seller shall, and shall cause the Company to, execute all amendments to this
         Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and related transaction documents necessary to
         implement such adjustments, within 3 Business Days of Buyer's waiver notice. Failure
         by Seller to accommodate reasonable adjustments related to Buyer's condition waiver
         shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, entitling Buyer to terminate and
         receive return of Deposit with interest plus reimbursement of documented transaction
         costs (legal, accounting, consulting) up to $[●] million.

    (iii) No Seller Waiver Rights. For clarity, Seller has no right to waive the conditions
          in this Article 7.1(xvii). These are Buyer's closing conditions only, and only Buyer
          may waive them. Seller's obligations under this Agreement are not conditioned on the
          litigation status, settlement amount, or any court rulings in the Class Action.

(f) Effect of Condition Failure.

    (i) If any condition in subsections (a), (b), or (c) is not satisfied as of 5:00 PM
        Pacific Time on the Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled Closing Date, and
        Buyer has not waived such condition, then:
        (A) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller delivered on or
            before the scheduled Closing Date;
        (B) Upon such termination, Escrow Agent shall return the Deposit to Buyer, together
            with all interest earned thereon at the Agreed Rate;
        (C) Neither party shall have any further obligations under this Agreement, except for
            obligations that expressly survive termination (confidentiality, expense
            reimbursement, dispute resolution);
        (D) Seller shall reimburse Buyer for 50% of Buyer's documented third-party transaction
            costs (legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees, excluding Buyer's internal
            costs) incurred in connection with this transaction, up to a maximum reimbursement
            of $[●] million, payable within 30 days of Buyer's delivery of invoices.

    (ii) If Buyer does not timely exercise its termination right under subsection (f)(i)(A)
         (i.e., does not deliver termination notice by 5:00 PM Pacific Time on the scheduled
         Closing Date), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived the unsatisfied condition(s), and
         Closing shall proceed on the scheduled Closing Date (or the next Business Day if the
         scheduled Closing Date is not a Business Day) without any adjustments to Purchase
         Price, escrow, or Buyer Threshold unless Buyer and Seller agree otherwise in writing.

            complaint; (7) third-party subpoenas from regulators (SEC, CFTC) or law enforcement
            (FBI, DOJ) related to the Class Action.

    (iii) Settlement Approval Requirement. Not enter into any settlement agreement, consent
          judgment, stipulated dismissal, or other resolution of the Class Action without

        (A) Buyer's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed;
        (B) Buyer's consent shall be deemed reasonable if: (1) the settlement amount does not
            exceed the probability-weighted expected settlement range in Article 3.23(d) by
            more than 25%; (2) defense counsel provides written opinion that settlement is
            reasonable and advisable; (3) settlement contains standard release and "no
            admission" language; (4) settlement does not require business practice changes
            beyond security enhancements already implemented; (5) settlement does not include

            beyond monetary payment;
        (C) Buyer shall respond to any settlement consent request within 5 Business Days of
            receipt, or consent shall be deemed granted;
        (D) If Buyer unreasonably withholds consent to a settlement that defense counsel
            recommends, and the Class Action proceeds to judgment or later settles for a
            higher amount, Seller's indemnification obligations under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)
            shall be capped at the settlement amount Buyer rejected (i.e., Buyer bears
            incremental risk from rejection of reasonable settlement);
        (E) Notwithstanding Buyer's consent right, Seller remains liable for indemnification
            under Article 8.2(a)(xiii) for settlements to which Buyer consents, subject to the
            terms and caps in that Section.

    (iv) Preservation of Arbitration Defense. Not take any action, or permit the Company to
         take any action, that would waive or undermine the Company's arbitration defense,
         including but not limited to:
        (A) Amending the Company's Terms of Service to remove, weaken, or limit the arbitration
            clause or class action waiver;
        (B) Making any stipulations or admissions that individual arbitration is impracticable,

        (C) Failing to timely file the motion to compel arbitration (deadline: 60 days after
            answer filed);
        (D) Engaging in litigation conduct inconsistent with intent to arbitrate (e.g.,
            extensive merits discovery before arbitration motion decided, failing to oppose
            class certification, settling with some plaintiffs in court while arbitration
            motion pending);
        (E) Offering to waive arbitration or class action waiver in settlement negotiations
            without Buyer's prior written consent;
        (F) Making public statements that the Company does not believe arbitration is
            appropriate for customer disputes or that the Company regrets including arbitration
            clauses in its Terms of Service.

    (v) Coordination with SEC and Regulatory Defense. Coordinate with SEC defense counsel (for
        the SEC Wells Notice matter described in Section IV.A) and CFTC defense counsel (for
        the CFTC investigation described in Section IV.C) to:
        (A) Ensure consistency in legal positions, factual representations, and defenses across
            all litigation and regulatory matters;
        (B) Seek to avoid SEC or CFTC settlement language that would create offensive
            collateral estoppel exposure in the Class Action (specifically, avoid admissions
            that the Company's security controls were inadequate, that the Company was
            negligent, or that the Company breached duties to customers);
        (C) If SEC settlement must include findings or admissions regarding security controls,
            seek to limit admissions to SEC-specific statutory violations (e.g., failure to
            register as broker-dealer) rather than common-law negligence or breach of duty;
        (D) Provide Buyer with advance notice (at least 10 Business Days) of any proposed SEC
            or CFTC settlement language that could be used for collateral estoppel in the
            Class Action, and consult with Buyer regarding whether to accept such language or
            negotiate alternative formulations;
        (E) If Buyer objects to proposed SEC/CFTC settlement language on grounds that it would
            materially increase Class Action settlement risk via collateral estoppel, Seller
            shall instruct regulatory counsel to negotiate alternative language, provided that
            Seller's obligation to accept alternative language is subject to whether the SEC/
            CFTC will agree (Seller is not guaranteeing SEC/CFTC will accept alternative
            language, only that Seller will make good-faith efforts).

    (vi) D&O Insurance Carrier Notice and Cooperation. With respect to the Company's directors
         and officers liability insurance policy covering the Class Action:
        (A) Maintain timely and complete notice to the D&O carrier as required by the policy
            (typically within 30 days of claim or suit, with supplemental notices of material
            developments);
        (B) Provide all information and documentation requested by the D&O carrier within
            required timeframes to avoid late notice or non-cooperation defenses;
        (C) Not make any admissions, settlements, or agreements that would prejudice the D&O
            carrier's rights or violate policy conditions without the carrier's (and Buyer's)
            prior consent;
        (D) Cooperate with any coverage counsel retained by the D&O carrier to assess coverage
            for the Class Action;
        (E) Provide Buyer with copies of all correspondence with the D&O carrier regarding the
            Class Action, including claim notices, carrier responses, reservation of rights
            letters, coverage positions, and reimbursement of defense costs;
        (F) Not agree to any carrier-proposed limitations on coverage, exclusions, or
            reservations of rights that would reduce coverage below the amounts described in
            Article 3.23(e) without Buyer's prior written consent.

    (vii) Defense Cost Reporting and Budgeting. Provide Buyer with:
        (A) Monthly defense cost reports showing: (1) defense costs incurred in the prior
            month (by category: attorney fees, expert fees, deposition costs, document review,
            court costs); (2) cumulative defense costs to date; (3) comparison to budget; (4)
            projected defense costs for the following 3 months and through expected settlement
            date;
        (B) Quarterly budgets for defense costs, prepared by defense counsel, showing
            anticipated activities and costs by category, submitted to Buyer at least 15 days
            before the start of each calendar quarter;
        (C) If actual defense costs in any month exceed the budgeted amount for that month by
            more than 20%, written explanation from defense counsel within 10 days after
            month-end, explaining the variance and whether it reflects increased scope of work
            or higher-than-expected rates/fees;
        (D) Annually (and upon Buyer's request, but not more than quarterly), detailed itemized
            invoices from defense counsel and all experts and consultants engaged in the Class
            Action defense, showing dates, descriptions of services, hours (for hourly billing),
            and amounts. Buyer shall treat such invoices as Confidential Information under
            Article 9.1.

(b) Seller's Negative Covenants (Prohibited Actions). Seller shall cause the Company NOT to:

    (i) Settle for Excessive Amount. Settle the Class Action for any amount exceeding $50
        million (the "Settlement Cap") without Buyer's prior written consent, which Buyer may
        withhold in its sole discretion. If Seller causes the Company to settle for an amount
        exceeding the Settlement Cap without Buyer's consent, Seller's indemnification
        obligation under Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(A) shall be uncapped, and Seller shall indemnify
        Buyer for the entire settlement amount, not just the amount above the Buyer Threshold.

    (ii) Admit Gross Negligence or Fraud. Make any admission or stipulation in the Class
         Action (whether in pleadings, discovery responses, settlement agreements, or court
         filings) that the Company committed gross negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct,
         or willful violations of law. Such admissions could: (A) preclude D&O insurance
         coverage; (B) increase punitive damages exposure; (C) create regulatory or criminal
         exposure. Seller may permit the Company to admit ordinary negligence if defense
         counsel advises that such admission is necessary to achieve reasonable settlement,
         provided Buyer consents.

    (iii) Agree to Injunctive Relief. Agree to any injunctive relief, consent decree, or
          court order that would: (A) require the Company to change its business practices
          beyond security enhancements already implemented per Article 6.12 (Cybersecurity
          Remediation Covenant); (B) appoint a monitor, special master, or independent auditor
          to oversee the Company's operations; (C) require periodic reporting to the court or
          plaintiffs' counsel beyond standard settlement compliance reporting; (D) restrict
          the Company's ability to modify its Terms of Service, fee structure, or operational
          practices; or (E) require the Company to establish a claims administration process
          or customer compensation fund beyond payment of the settlement amount.

    (iv) Terminate or Change Defense Counsel. Terminate or replace the Company's defense
         counsel in the Class Action without Buyer's prior written consent, unless: (A) defense
         counsel withdraws due to ethical conflict, malpractice, or firm dissolution; (B)
         defense counsel is demonstrably incompetent or failing to adequately represent the
         Company's interests; or (C) defense counsel's fees are grossly excessive compared to
         market rates for comparable firms. If termination/replacement is necessary, Seller
         shall: (1) consult with Buyer on selection of replacement counsel; (2) ensure seamless
         transition with no loss of attorney-client privilege or work product protection; (3)
         obtain Buyer's approval of replacement counsel (not to be unreasonably withheld).

    (v) Make Public Statements. Make or permit the Company to make any public statements
        (press releases, social media posts, blog posts, investor presentations, conference
        remarks) regarding the Class Action, the September 2024 hot wallet incident, or the
        Company's security practices, without Buyer's prior review and consent, except:
        (A) Statements required by law, court order, or regulatory requirement (e.g., SEC
            filing disclosure, state money transmitter examination response), provided Buyer
            receives advance notice (at least 3 Business Days if practicable, or immediately
            if not) and opportunity to comment;
        (B) Routine customer communications regarding: (1) the Company's reimbursement of
            affected customers; (2) security enhancements implemented; (3) commitment to
            customer asset protection, provided such communications do not admit liability,
            negligence, or wrongdoing;
        (C) Statements to customers in individual customer service interactions (emails, phone
            calls, chat support), provided such statements follow script approved by defense
            counsel and do not admit liability or provide information that could be used
            against the Company in the Class Action.

(c) Buyer's Rights During Covenant Period. Buyer shall have the following rights with respect
to the Class Action during the Covenant Period:

    (i) Observation Rights. Buyer and Buyer's counsel may:
        (A) Attend all hearings, depositions, settlement conferences, and status conferences
            in the Class Action, whether in person or remotely;
        (B) Review all pleadings, motions, discovery, expert reports, and correspondence related
            to the Class Action;
        (C) Participate in strategy discussions with Seller and defense counsel (Buyer's
            participation is advisory; Seller retains control of litigation strategy subject
            to Buyer's consent rights in this Article 6.11).

    (ii) Expert Engagement. Buyer may, at Buyer's expense, retain its own litigation
         consultant, expert, or advisory counsel to:
        (A) Review the Class Action and provide Buyer with independent assessment of settlement
            risk, arbitration probability, and class certification likelihood;
        (B) Advise Buyer regarding whether to consent to proposed settlements or material
            litigation decisions;
        (C) Buyer's experts may not communicate directly with the court, plaintiffs, or
            plaintiffs' counsel without Seller's prior consent, and must maintain
            confidentiality of all attorney-client privileged and work product materials shared
            by Seller or defense counsel.

    (iii) Material Development Notification. Seller shall notify Buyer in writing within 2
          Business Days (or immediately if time-sensitive) of any material development in the
          Class Action, including but not limited to:
        (A) Court ruling on motion to compel arbitration (favorable or unfavorable);
        (B) Court ruling on motion to dismiss (granted in whole or part, denied, or mixed);
        (C) Plaintiffs filing motion for class certification;
        (D) Settlement offer or demand exceeding $10 million;
        (E) Discovery of new facts or evidence that materially increase or decrease settlement
            risk;
        (F) Defense counsel's recommendation to settle or change litigation strategy;
        (G) Third-party subpoena from regulators or law enforcement related to the Class Action;
        (H) Amendment to complaint adding claims, parties, or increasing damages sought;
        (I) Indication from court (oral or written) regarding its views on arbitration, class
            certification, or merits;
        (J) Potential D&O insurance coverage dispute or reservation of rights by carrier;
        (K) Disqualification motion or sanctions motion filed by plaintiffs;
        (L) Any development that could reasonably be expected to increase settlement value by
            more than $5 million or decrease settlement value by more than $5 million compared
            to the ranges in Article 3.23(d).

(d) Post-Closing Cooperation (Survives Closing). After the Closing Date, Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer and the Company in the ongoing defense and resolution of the
Class Action, including:

    (i) Witness Availability. Making former employees, officers, and directors of the Company
        (who were employed/serving during the period relevant to the Class Action, January 1,
        2019 through Closing Date) reasonably available for:
        (A) Depositions in the Class Action (Buyer shall provide at least 15 days' advance
            notice and coordinate scheduling to minimize disruption to witnesses' post-Closing
            employment or activities);
        (B) Trial testimony if the Class Action proceeds to trial (Buyer shall provide at least
            30 days' advance notice);
        (C) Interviews with defense counsel or Buyer's experts to prepare for depositions or
            trial;
        (D) Witness preparation sessions;
        (E) Seller shall reimburse witnesses for reasonable travel expenses (airfare, hotel,
            meals) incurred in connection with their cooperation, and shall compensate former
            employees for time spent at their current hourly rate (or $200/hour if unemployed
            or retired) for time exceeding 4 hours in any calendar month.

    (ii) Document and Information Access. Providing Buyer with reasonable access to:
        (A) Seller's business records, documents, and files related to the Company's operations,
            security practices, employee training, and incident response during the period
            January 1, 2019 through Closing Date;
        (B) Seller's personnel who have knowledge of the Company's pre-Closing operations
            (excluding attorney-client privileged communications or work product unless Seller
            voluntarily waives privilege);
        (C) Seller's IT systems and electronic records related to the Company (e.g., emails,
            Slack messages, documents stored on Seller's servers) to the extent relevant to
            the Class Action and not otherwise available to Buyer;
        (D) Access shall be provided within 10 Business Days of Buyer's written request
            (specifying the documents or information sought and relevance to Class Action), at
            Seller's offices during normal business hours, with Seller's counsel present if
            Seller desires;
        (E) Buyer shall reimburse Seller for reasonable out-of-pocket costs of providing access
            (e.g., document retrieval, copying, IT support), but not Seller's internal personnel
            time or counsel fees.

    (iii) Litigation Strategy Coordination. Consulting with Buyer and Buyer's counsel regarding
          litigation strategy, settlement negotiations, and material decisions, provided that:
        (A) After Closing, Buyer has full control of the Class Action defense and settlement,
            subject to Seller's indemnification obligations under Article 8.2(a)(xiii);
        (B) Seller's consent is required for settlements that would trigger Seller's
            indemnification obligations (per Article 8.2(a)(xiii)(H)(iii));
        (C) Seller shall not unreasonably withhold consent to settlement recommendations from
            defense counsel;
        (D) Seller's post-Closing cooperation obligations under this subsection (d) shall
            terminate upon the earlier of: (1) final resolution of the Class Action (including
            all appeals); or (2) December 31, 2029 (five years post-Closing).

(e) Remedies for Breach of Covenant. If Seller breaches any material obligation under this
Article 6.11:

    (i) Buyer may seek specific performance to compel Seller to perform its obligations,
        including injunctive relief to prevent Seller from taking prohibited actions (subsection
        (b)) or to require Seller to take required actions (subsection (a));

    (ii) If Seller's breach results in increased settlement cost or litigation expenses
         (compared to what would have occurred absent the breach), Seller's indemnification
         obligations under Article 8.2(a)(xiii) shall be increased by such incremental amounts,
         notwithstanding any caps or limitations in that Section;

    (iii) If Seller's breach is material and willful (not a good-faith dispute about
          interpretation), Buyer may terminate this Agreement prior to Closing pursuant to
          Article 10.1(e)(ii) (Material Breach), and Seller shall forfeit the Deposit to Buyer
          as liquidated damages;

    (iv) If Seller's breach occurs after Closing, Buyer's exclusive remedy is indemnification
         under subsection (e)(ii) (increased settlement cost) and/or litigation to compel
         performance under subsection (e)(i) (specific performance).
