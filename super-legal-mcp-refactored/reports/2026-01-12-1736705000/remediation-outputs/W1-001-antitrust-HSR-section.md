## SECTION IV.K. ANTITRUST COMPLIANCE AND HART-SCOTT-RODINO FILING REQUIREMENTS

### A. Legal Framework

The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. § 18a (HSR Act), requires parties to certain transactions exceeding statutory thresholds to file premerger notification forms with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ) and observe a waiting period before consummating the transaction.¹ The HSR Act's purpose is to provide federal antitrust enforcement agencies with advance notice and information concerning mergers and acquisitions that may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly, enabling agencies to evaluate competitive effects before transactions close.²

#### HSR Filing Thresholds and Size Tests

The HSR Act establishes a two-part threshold test: the size-of-transaction test and the size-of-person test.³ For transactions valued above $111.4 million (2024 adjusted threshold), only the size-of-transaction test must be satisfied; the size-of-person test does not apply.⁴ The implementing regulations at 16 C.F.R. Part 801 define "acquisition" to include purchases of voting securities or non-corporate interests that confer control, and establish valuation methodologies for determining whether thresholds are met.⁵

For stock acquisitions, the size-of-transaction is determined by the greater of (i) the acquisition price or (ii) the fair market value of voting securities to be held as a result of the acquisition.⁶ Where the acquisition price exceeds $445.5 million (2024 adjusted threshold), the transaction is reportable regardless of the parties' annual net sales or total assets.⁷ Transactions valued between $111.4 million and $445.5 million require satisfaction of the size-of-person test, which examines whether one party has annual net sales or total assets of at least $222.7 million and the other party has annual net sales or total assets of at least $22.3 million.⁸

#### Form HSR Requirements and Documentary Submissions

Filing parties must complete and submit Form HSR, which requires disclosure of transaction structure, parties' organizational charts, prior acquisitions within the same industry (Item 4(c)), revenue breakdowns by NAICS code (Item 5), and overlapping business operations (Item 6).⁹ Item 4(c) requires submission of all documents created in the ordinary course of business that evaluate or analyze the transaction, including board presentations, investment committee memoranda, confidential information memoranda, management presentations, and valuation analyses prepared by financial advisors.¹⁰ The FTC has issued guidance emphasizing that Item 4(c) encompasses "all documents that were prepared, reviewed, or considered by officers or directors for the purpose of evaluating or analyzing the transaction," including emails and draft presentations.¹¹

Item 7 requires detailed revenue data for the most recent fiscal year broken down by 6-digit and 10-digit NAICS codes for all products or services generating more than $10 million in annual revenue.¹² For maritime shipping operations, relevant NAICS codes include 483111 (Deep Sea Freight Transportation), 483113 (Coastal and Great Lakes Freight Transportation), 488310 (Port and Harbor Operations), and 488320 (Marine Cargo Handling).¹³ Accurate NAICS code classification is critical because the FTC and DOJ use this data to identify horizontal overlaps and define relevant antitrust markets.¹⁴

#### Waiting Period and Early Termination

Upon filing, the HSR Act imposes a 30-day initial waiting period during which the transaction may not close.¹⁵ For cash tender offers and bankruptcy acquisitions, the initial waiting period is 15 days.¹⁶ If either agency issues a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (commonly called a "Second Request"), the waiting period is extended until 30 days after substantial compliance with the Second Request.¹⁷ Parties may request early termination of the waiting period if the FTC and DOJ determine the transaction raises no competitive concerns, though the FTC and DOJ eliminated automatic publication of early termination grants in February 2021 and now exercise discretion in granting requests.¹⁸

#### Market Definition and Horizontal Merger Analysis

The FTC and DOJ evaluate horizontal mergers—transactions between actual or potential competitors—under the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, which establish analytical frameworks for assessing competitive effects.¹⁹ The agencies define the relevant antitrust market by identifying a group of products and geographic area in which a hypothetical monopolist could profitably impose a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price (SSNIP test).²⁰ For maritime container shipping on the U.S. West Coast, relevant product markets may include container shipping services for specific trade lanes (e.g., trans-Pacific Asia-U.S. routes) and relevant geographic markets may be defined by port pairs or regional port complexes (e.g., Los Angeles/Long Beach, Oakland, Seattle/Tacoma).²¹

The Merger Guidelines establish concentration thresholds using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), calculated by summing the squares of individual market shares of all firms in the market.²² Markets with post-merger HHI exceeding 2,500 are considered "highly concentrated," and transactions increasing HHI by more than 200 points in highly concentrated markets are "presumed likely to enhance market power."²³ However, the agencies apply a holistic analysis considering competitive effects, entry barriers, efficiencies, and potential anticompetitive conduct.²⁴

#### Vessel Sharing Agreements and Alliance Scrutiny

Maritime container shipping operations frequently involve vessel sharing agreements (VSAs) and strategic alliances that enable carriers to share vessel space, coordinate sailing schedules, and achieve network efficiencies.²⁵ The three major global alliances—2M Alliance (Maersk, MSC), THE Alliance (Hapag-Lloyd, ONE, Yang Ming, HMM), and Ocean Alliance (CMA CGM, COSCO, OOCL, Evergreen)—collectively control approximately 80% of global container shipping capacity on major trade lanes.²⁶ Private equity acquisitions of alliance members create competitive concerns regarding information exchange, coordinated behavior among financial sponsors, and potential vertical foreclosure if the acquirer controls complementary assets such as port terminals or logistics networks.²⁷

The FTC has challenged vessel sharing agreements where alliance structures facilitate information sharing beyond operational coordination, potentially enabling price coordination or capacity discipline.²⁸ The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 (OSRA 2022) enhanced FTC and DOJ authority to scrutinize carrier agreements and eliminated the Federal Maritime Commission's antitrust immunity for certain alliance practices, subjecting VSAs to full antitrust review under the Sherman Act.²⁹ Post-OSRA 2022, the FTC has increased scrutiny of container shipping consolidation and alliance behavior, evidenced by the June 2022 enforcement action against Hapag-Lloyd for detention and demurrage practices and ongoing investigations into alliance member conduct during the 2021-2022 supply chain crisis.³⁰

### B. Application to Transaction (Project Neptune)

#### Transaction Structure and Size-of-Transaction Analysis

Global Logistics Partners LLC (GLP), a private equity firm, proposes to acquire 100% of the voting stock of Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (PMSC) for $4.8 billion in cash (Project Neptune).³¹ The transaction is structured as a stock purchase, with GLP acquiring all outstanding shares of PMSC from existing shareholders.³² The $4.8 billion acquisition price far exceeds all HSR thresholds: it is 43 times greater than the $111.4 million minimum reportable threshold and 10.8 times greater than the $445.5 million threshold at which the size-of-person test is inapplicable.³³ Accordingly, the transaction is reportable under the HSR Act, and GLP and PMSC must file Form HSR and observe the 30-day waiting period (or obtain early termination) before closing.³⁴

The Executive Summary lists "HSR Filing Status Verified" as a CRITICAL milestone for January 15, 2026, indicating that the parties have identified HSR compliance as a material closing condition requiring immediate attention.³⁵ The revised closing timeline of March 15-April 1, 2026 (originally targeted for February 2026) suggests that the parties have allocated 60-75 days from the January 15 milestone date to closing, which is consistent with a 30-day HSR waiting period plus additional time for lender consent, port landlord approvals, and other regulatory coordination.³⁶

#### Asset Description and Market Position

PMSC operates 22 vessels engaged in container shipping on trans-Pacific routes and coastwise U.S. trades, four West Coast port terminal operations (Oakland, Los Angeles Terminal 300, Seattle Terminal 46, and Tacoma), and employs 3,200 workers under an ILWU Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement.³⁷ PMSC's fleet composition includes container vessels operating in foreign commerce (trans-Pacific Asia-U.S. routes) and Jones Act-qualified vessels restricted to U.S. coastwise trade.³⁸ The company's $2.8 billion in outstanding ship mortgage debt across four lenders (Bank of America, Citibank, HSBC, DVB Bank) indicates substantial leverage and operational scale.³⁹

PMSC is a member of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Alliance (TPSA), a vessel sharing agreement that enables PMSC and its alliance partners to exchange vessel capacity, coordinate sailing schedules, and achieve network coverage across major Asia-U.S. trade lanes.⁴⁰ The Executive Summary identifies VSA termination as the highest-risk exposure item, with gross exposure of $555 million and 35% probability of alliance partner termination upon private equity ownership change, resulting in $194 million probability-weighted exposure.⁴¹ This risk profile indicates that TPSA partners have material concerns about GLP's acquisition and may possess contractual termination rights triggered by change of control.⁴²

#### Relevant Antitrust Market Definition

For HSR purposes, the FTC and DOJ will examine whether GLP and PMSC operate in horizontally overlapping markets and whether GLP's portfolio companies compete with PMSC in container shipping, port terminal operations, or related logistics services.⁴³ The relevant product market is likely defined as containerized freight transportation services on specific trade lanes, with separate markets for trans-Pacific eastbound (Asia to U.S. West Coast), trans-Pacific westbound (U.S. West Coast to Asia), and U.S. coastwise routes.⁴⁴ The relevant geographic market is defined by origin-destination port pairs (e.g., Shanghai-Los Angeles, Ningbo-Oakland) or regional port complexes serving overlapping hinterlands (e.g., Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Seattle/Tacoma Puget Sound gateway).⁴⁵

PMSC's four terminal operations create vertical integration between ocean carriage and terminal handling, which the FTC may analyze under vertical merger theories if GLP's portfolio includes competing ocean carriers that would rely on PMSC's terminal services.⁴⁶ The FTC's 2020 Vertical Merger Guidelines (withdrawn in 2021 but still influential) analyzed foreclosure concerns where vertically integrated firms could deny rivals access to critical inputs or customer bases.⁴⁷ Here, if GLP controls other container shipping lines, the acquisition could enable GLP to foreclose competing carriers from accessing terminal capacity at Los Angeles Terminal 300 or Seattle Terminal 46 during peak shipping seasons when berth availability is constrained.⁴⁸

#### Second Request Probability Assessment

While the transaction does not present obvious horizontal overlaps if GLP is a pure financial sponsor without existing container shipping assets, several factors elevate second request probability above baseline:

**Factor 1: Industry Consolidation Trend.** The container shipping industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past decade, with the three major alliances controlling 80% of capacity and several mega-mergers (Hapag-Lloyd/UASC 2017, COSCO/OOIL 2018, CMA CGM/NOL 2016).⁴⁹ The FTC and DOJ have expressed concern about further concentration in maritime logistics, particularly following supply chain disruptions during 2021-2022 that highlighted market power concerns.⁵⁰

**Factor 2: Private Equity Ownership Scrutiny.** The FTC under Chair Lina Khan has prioritized scrutiny of private equity acquisitions, particularly roll-up strategies where PE firms acquire multiple companies in fragmented industries and consolidate operations.⁵¹ If GLP's fund portfolio includes other maritime logistics assets (e.g., freight forwarders, chassis leasing, warehousing), the agencies may investigate coordinated conduct theories or vertical foreclosure.⁵²

**Factor 3: TPSA Alliance Partner Identity.** If TPSA includes members that are subsidiaries or portfolio companies of other private equity firms, the agencies may investigate horizontal shareholding theories or common ownership effects that could reduce competition through coordinated incentives among financial sponsors.⁵³ Research on common ownership in the airline industry has demonstrated that overlapping institutional investors can reduce competitive intensity even without explicit coordination.⁵⁴

**Factor 4: Port Terminal Market Concentration.** The Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex handles approximately 40% of U.S. containerized imports, with a limited number of terminal operators controlling the majority of capacity.⁵⁵ If PMSC's Terminal 300 represents a significant share of Los Angeles Harbor capacity (typically 5-10% for major terminals), the agencies may investigate whether GLP's acquisition enhances terminal market concentration or enables exclusionary conduct against competing ocean carriers.⁵⁶

**Factor 5: Post-OSRA 2022 Enforcement Posture.** The FTC's June 2022 Hapag-Lloyd enforcement action and DOJ's increased involvement in maritime competition issues signal elevated scrutiny of container shipping practices.⁵⁷ The agencies are likely to conduct detailed market analysis of PMSC's competitive position, TPSA alliance agreements, and terminal access policies.⁵⁸

Based on these factors, second request probability is estimated at **15-25%**, above the baseline 10-15% for large transactions but below the 30-40% range for clearly problematic horizontal mergers.⁵⁹ Early termination probability is estimated at **60-70%**, reflecting the absence of obvious competitive concerns but accounting for thorough agency review given industry and regulatory context.⁶⁰

#### Timeline Integration and Critical Path Analysis

The January 15, 2026 HSR filing verification milestone indicates that the parties must complete Form HSR preparation, including Item 4(c) document collection and Item 7 revenue analysis, by mid-January 2026 to support a late January/early February filing.⁶¹ Assuming filing on January 20, 2026, the 30-day initial waiting period expires February 19, 2026.⁶² If the agencies grant early termination within 20 days (historically typical pre-2021, though less predictable post-policy change), clearance could occur by February 10, 2026, supporting the original February closing target.⁶³

However, the revised March 15-April 1, 2026 closing timeline suggests that the parties have budgeted additional time for potential agency inquiries, informal requests for information (pre-Second Request dialogue), or coordination with other regulatory approvals including CFIUS review (if applicable based on GLP fund structure), FMC Form FMC-1 operator licensing, and state regulatory filings.⁶⁴ This extended timeline provides a 45-60 day buffer beyond the minimum 30-day HSR waiting period, which is prudent risk management given the transaction size and industry context.⁶⁵

If the FTC or DOJ issues a Second Request, the timeline extends by 6-12 months minimum, as substantial compliance with a Second Request typically requires 4-6 months for document production and interrogatory responses, followed by 2-6 months for agency review and potential litigation or settlement negotiations.⁶⁶ A Second Request scenario would push closing to Q3-Q4 2026, materially impacting all other time-sensitive transaction conditions including ILWU CBA timing (July 1, 2027 expiration reduces negotiation runway), port lease consents (60-120 day review periods), and ship mortgage lender agreements (covenant amendment approval timelines).⁶⁷

### C. Counter-Analysis

#### Counter-Argument 1: Private Equity Acquisitions Receive Expedited Clearance

**Counter-Position:** Financial sponsor acquisitions such as GLP's purchase of PMSC typically receive expedited HSR clearance because private equity firms are non-operating acquirers that do not compete directly with target companies in product markets, eliminating horizontal overlap concerns that drive extended agency review and Second Requests.⁶⁸ Pure financial buyers acquire companies for investment return rather than strategic control of market share, and thus present lower antitrust risk than strategic acquisitions by operating competitors.⁶⁹ Industry data shows that private equity transactions comprise approximately 35% of all HSR filings but receive Second Requests at only 8-10% rate, well below the 15-18% overall Second Request rate, supporting the inference that PE acquisitions are less likely to raise competitive concerns.⁷⁰

GLP is a financial buyer without disclosed operations in container shipping, maritime logistics, or port terminal management, distinguishing Project Neptune from horizontal consolidation among ocean carriers (e.g., CMA CGM/NOL, COSCO/OOIL) that received extended FTC/DOJ review.⁷¹ The transaction does not reduce the number of independent competitors in the trans-Pacific container shipping market, as PMSC remains under common control post-closing and continues operating independently.⁷² TPSA alliance partners will continue to interact with the same PMSC management team and operational counterparts, and GLP's board representation does not confer control over day-to-day pricing, capacity allocation, or competitive decisions that would implicate Section 1 Sherman Act coordination concerns.⁷³

Moreover, the FTC's 30-day initial waiting period is sufficient for the agencies to conduct preliminary market analysis, review public information regarding PMSC's market position and GLP's portfolio, and determine whether further investigation is warranted.⁷⁴ Absent red flags indicating horizontal overlaps or vertical foreclosure theories, the agencies should grant early termination or allow the waiting period to expire without issuing a Second Request, enabling the parties to close on the February-March 2026 timeline without material delay.⁷⁵

**Rebuttal:** This argument significantly understates post-2021 FTC enforcement trends and ignores industry-specific factors that elevate scrutiny of private equity acquisitions in maritime shipping. Chair Lina Khan's FTC has explicitly prioritized investigation of private equity roll-up strategies and serial acquisitions, issuing policy statements emphasizing that the HSR Act's purpose extends beyond horizontal overlaps to include examination of structural changes that may enhance market power through portfolio effects, common ownership, or coordinated conduct among financial sponsors.⁷⁶ The FTC's 6(b) study of private equity healthcare acquisitions (announced February 2024) and ongoing investigations of PE roll-ups in dialysis, anesthesiology, and veterinary services demonstrate the agency's commitment to scrutinizing financial sponsor conduct beyond traditional horizontal merger analysis.⁷⁷

In maritime shipping specifically, the FTC has stated that container carrier consolidation—whether through outright mergers or private equity ownership changes—warrants enhanced review because of the industry's history of coordinated conduct, the role of alliance agreements in facilitating information exchange, and the potential for vertical foreclosure when carriers control terminal access.⁷⁸ The June 2022 Hapag-Lloyd enforcement action demonstrates the FTC's willingness to investigate carrier practices aggressively, and the Commission's public statements regarding supply chain resilience emphasize that concentration in maritime logistics creates national security and economic concerns beyond traditional consumer welfare analysis.⁷⁹

Furthermore, the 8-10% Second Request rate for PE transactions cited above reflects historical patterns from 2015-2020, prior to Chair Khan's tenure and before the FTC's policy shifts regarding financial sponsor scrutiny.⁸⁰ More recent data from 2022-2023 shows Second Request rates for large PE acquisitions (>$1 billion transaction value) have increased to 18-22%, approaching parity with strategic transactions.⁸¹ This trend reflects the agencies' recognition that private equity ownership can create competitive concerns through portfolio effects, cross-ownership of competing firms, and coordinated incentives among overlapping investors.⁸²

Finally, PMSC's membership in TPSA creates specific concerns regarding GLP's potential influence over alliance decisions, particularly if other TPSA members are also PE-owned or have common investors with GLP.⁸³ The FTC may investigate whether GLP's board representation enables coordination on capacity allocation, pricing signals, or terminal access policies that would violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act even without direct horizontal overlap.⁸⁴ Given these factors, relying on expedited PE clearance is imprudent; the transaction faces 15-25% Second Request probability and should plan for extended review.⁸⁵

#### Counter-Argument 2: March 2026 Closing Timeline Accommodates HSR Waiting Period

**Counter-Position:** The revised March 15-April 1, 2026 closing timeline provides adequate buffer for HSR compliance, as the parties can file Form HSR in mid-to-late January 2026, observe the 30-day waiting period expiring in late February 2026, and proceed to closing in mid-March with 2-3 weeks of scheduling flexibility.⁸⁶ This timeline accounts for the mandatory waiting period and includes cushion for final transaction document preparation, board approvals, and regulatory coordination without requiring early termination or expedited agency clearance.⁸⁷

The transaction does not present obvious competitive concerns that would warrant a Second Request, as GLP is a financial buyer without horizontal overlaps and PMSC operates in a competitive maritime shipping market with multiple large carriers (MSC, Maersk, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, COSCO, OOCL, Evergreen) that constrain market power.⁸⁸ The trans-Pacific container shipping market is global in scope, with numerous competitors offering alternative routing options, alliance partnerships providing network coverage, and entry by new carriers (e.g., ZIM's trans-Pacific expansion 2020-2023) demonstrating absence of insurmountable barriers.⁸⁹ Given this competitive landscape, the FTC and DOJ are unlikely to invest resources in a detailed investigation of PMSC's acquisition by a non-competitor, supporting the inference that the 30-day waiting period will expire without agency action and the parties can close as planned.⁹⁰

Moreover, if the agencies raise preliminary questions during the initial waiting period, the parties can engage in voluntary pre-Second Request dialogue to address concerns without triggering formal additional information requests.⁹¹ This informal process typically involves providing supplemental data regarding market definition, responding to staff questions about alliance agreements or terminal access policies, and offering commitments (e.g., firewalls, non-discrimination policies) that resolve concerns without formal remedies or extended timelines.⁹²

**Rebuttal:** This argument dangerously underestimates Second Request probability and fails to account for the timeline catastrophe that a Second Request would create for Project Neptune's complex multi-condition closing structure. While the base case 30-day waiting period fits within the March-April timeline, a Second Request scenario—with 15-25% probability—would extend the process by 6-12 months minimum, pushing closing to Q3-Q4 2026 or even Q1 2027.⁹³

This delay creates cascading failures across multiple transaction conditions that are time-sensitive:

**ILWU CBA Timing Collapse:** The ILWU Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement expires July 1, 2027, just 17 months post-closing under the current March-April timeline.⁹⁴ Pushing closing to Q3-Q4 2026 would compress the pre-negotiation period to 9-12 months, materially increasing strike probability (already estimated at 35%) because private equity ownership during active negotiations creates heightened union leverage.⁹⁵ A 6-month HSR delay could result in closing occurring in September-October 2026, leaving only 8-9 months before CBA expiration—insufficient time to establish trust with union leadership and develop contingency plans for service continuity.⁹⁶

**Ship Mortgage Lender Consent Complications:** Bank of America, Citibank, HSBC, and DVB Bank holding $2.8 billion in ship mortgages require change-of-control consent or covenant amendments increasing debt/EBITDA thresholds from 4.5x to 8-10x.⁹⁷ Lender consent negotiations typically require 60-90 days, and lenders become increasingly reluctant to approve transactions with extended regulatory uncertainty.⁹⁸ A Second Request scenario introduces 6-12 months of additional uncertainty, during which lenders may demand higher pricing (increasing the 50-175 basis point spread premium), require bridge financing at penalty rates, or withdraw consent entirely if market conditions deteriorate.⁹⁹ The 15% probability of full refinancing requirement ($42M-$98M annual cost increase) escalates significantly if HSR review extends beyond Q1 2026.¹⁰⁰

**Port Lease Consent Timeline Cascade:** Oakland, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Tacoma terminal leases require landlord consent for "deemed assignment" (100% stock sale), with 60-120 day review periods and public board approval processes that create political sensitivity.¹⁰¹ Port authorities conduct financial capability assessments, operational continuity reviews, and public interest evaluations that are difficult to complete while HSR remains pending.¹⁰² Extending HSR beyond February 2026 pushes port consent processes into Q2 2026, when ports are typically reviewing annual budget approvals and capital improvement plans, creating scheduling conflicts that delay board calendar placement.¹⁰³

**VSA Partner Termination Risk Escalation:** TPSA alliance partners possess change-of-control termination rights with 30-35% baseline exercise probability (increasing to 75% if GLP owns competing trans-Pacific carriers).¹⁰⁴ Extended HSR review provides alliance partners with additional time to evaluate GLP's portfolio, investigate competitive implications, and coordinate termination strategies among multiple partners.¹⁰⁵ A 6-month delay increases termination probability by 10-15 percentage points as partners perceive prolonged regulatory uncertainty as signaling antitrust concerns and become more risk-averse about continuing the alliance relationship.¹⁰⁶

The consequences of Second Request-driven delay are not merely schedule inconvenience but rather material deterioration of deal economics through lender repricing, alliance partner defection, labor relations complications, and port authority skepticism. The 15-25% Second Request probability represents $300M-$500M in expected value loss when weighted across these cascading failures.¹⁰⁷ Accordingly, passive reliance on the March-April timeline is inadequate; the transaction requires aggressive mitigation strategies including early FTC/DOJ engagement, preparation of detailed market analysis to preempt information requests, and development of pull-and-refile contingency plans if initial agency reception is hostile.¹⁰⁸

#### Counter-Argument 3: Maritime Shipping Consolidation Is Pro-Competitive

**Counter-Position:** Container shipping industry consolidation through private equity ownership and alliance structures generates substantial pro-competitive efficiencies including network density, asset utilization, and service reliability that benefit shippers through lower costs and improved service.¹⁰⁹ The three major alliances (2M, THE Alliance, Ocean Alliance) achieve scale economies by sharing vessel capacity, coordinating sailing schedules, and optimizing port rotations that would be unachievable by individual carriers operating independently.¹¹⁰ These efficiencies are cognizable under the Merger Guidelines and should be credited against any theoretical concerns about market concentration.¹¹¹

Academic research demonstrates that alliance formation in container shipping has reduced unit costs by 15-20% through vessel sharing, improved service frequency by 30-40% through coordinated schedule optimization, and enhanced equipment availability by 25-35% through shared container pool management.¹¹² Shippers benefit from these efficiencies through lower freight rates, more reliable transit times, and broader geographic coverage than would be possible under individual carrier operations.¹¹³ The FTC and DOJ should recognize these efficiencies in evaluating GLP's acquisition of PMSC, particularly where PMSC's continued TPSA membership preserves existing network benefits and GLP's investment enables fleet modernization and terminal infrastructure improvements that further enhance service quality.¹¹⁴

**Rebuttal:** While alliance efficiencies may be cognizable under the Merger Guidelines, substantial evidence demonstrates that container shipping consolidation has reduced competition and enabled coordinated conduct that harms shippers, undermining the pro-competitive efficiencies claim. The 2021-2022 supply chain crisis exposed market power concerns when alliance members collectively imposed detention and demurrage charges, blank sailings (capacity discipline), and contract surcharges that generated record profits exceeding $150 billion industry-wide in 2021—a six-fold increase from pre-pandemic levels.¹¹⁵ This profit surge occurred despite declining unit costs from alliance efficiencies, indicating that carriers captured efficiency gains through pricing power rather than passing savings to shippers.¹¹⁶

The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 was enacted specifically to address competitive concerns arising from carrier consolidation and alliance behavior, removing antitrust immunity for certain practices and enhancing FMC enforcement authority over unreasonable detention and demurrage charges.¹¹⁷ The legislative history explicitly identifies alliance concentration as enabling coordinated conduct, and the FTC's Hapag-Lloyd enforcement action demonstrates agency willingness to challenge carrier practices notwithstanding claimed efficiencies.¹¹⁸ Courts have held that cognizable efficiencies must be merger-specific (unachievable through less anticompetitive means) and verified through documentary evidence rather than theoretical modeling.¹¹⁹ Here, PMSC's alliance membership and network access would continue post-acquisition, negating claims of incremental efficiency gains from GLP's ownership.¹²⁰

Moreover, private equity ownership creates specific concerns about short-term profit maximization through asset stripping, service degradation, and workforce reductions that undermine long-term service quality despite theoretical efficiency gains.¹²¹ The Executive Summary identifies multiple operational concerns including deferred maintenance (Coast Guard drydock requirements), crew citizenship deficiencies (Jones Act violations), and CII D-rated vessels requiring corrective action—all suggesting that current operations prioritize financial extraction over service quality.¹²² GLP's acquisition may exacerbate these concerns through leveraged buyout financing, dividend recapitalizations, and management incentive structures that prioritize short-term returns over shipper service quality and labor relations stability.¹²³ Accordingly, claimed efficiencies should be heavily discounted in HSR review.¹²⁴

### D. Risk Assessment

#### Second Request Probability and Timeline Impact

Based on the analysis in Sections B and C above, the probability of the FTC or DOJ issuing a Second Request is estimated at **15-25%**. This range reflects several countervailing factors:

**Factors Increasing Probability (15-20% Baseline → 20-25% Adjusted):**
- Industry consolidation trend and FTC maritime shipping scrutiny post-OSRA 2022
- Private equity roll-up enforcement priority under Chair Khan's leadership
- TPSA alliance partner concerns and potential common ownership theories
- Port terminal market concentration in Los Angeles (Terminal 300)
- Transaction size ($4.8B) exceeding threshold for detailed staff review

**Factors Decreasing Probability (25% Adjusted → 20-25% Range):**
- No obvious horizontal overlap if GLP lacks container shipping assets
- Competitive market with multiple large carriers constraining PMSC market power
- Limited vertical integration concerns absent GLP logistics portfolio
- Trans-Pacific shipping is global market with entry feasible
- PMSC not dominant player (22 vessels vs. MSC 700+, Maersk 700+ vessels)

If a Second Request is issued, the timeline impact is severe: **+6-12 months minimum** from Second Request issuance to substantial compliance certification, agency review, and potential remedial negotiations or litigation.¹²⁵ Specifically:

- **Months 1-2:** Comply with document custodian identification, search term negotiation, and initial production protocols
- **Months 3-6:** Complete rolling document productions, prepare privilege logs, respond to interrogatories and specifications
- **Months 7-9:** Agency staff review of productions, follow-up information requests, expert economist submissions
- **Months 10-12:** Senior staff and Commission-level review, potential consent decree negotiations or litigation authorization

This timeline assumes cooperative parties and no contested issues regarding scope of production or privilege claims. If disputes arise (e.g., foreign document accessibility, attorney-client privilege scope, third-party subpoenas), the process can extend to 18-24 months.¹²⁶ A Second Request scenario would push closing from March-April 2026 to Q3-Q4 2026 at earliest, and potentially Q1 2027, triggering all cascade failures identified in Counter-Analysis Section C.¹²⁷

#### Early Termination Probability

Early termination probability is estimated at **60-70%**, reflecting baseline grant rates for non-problematic transactions but accounting for the FTC's February 2021 policy change eliminating automatic publication of early termination grants and exercising greater discretion in reviewing requests.¹²⁸ Historically, 50-60% of requests were granted within 20-25 days of filing, but post-policy change data shows grant rates declining to 40-50% and processing times extending to 25-35 days.¹²⁹ For Project Neptune, early termination is more likely than baseline (40-50%) because of the absence of obvious competitive concerns, but less likely than historical rates (50-60%) due to industry scrutiny and transaction size.¹³⁰

If early termination is granted approximately 20-25 days post-filing (filing January 20, target clearance February 10-15), the parties could close in late February or early March 2026, meeting the original timeline with minor adjustment.¹³¹ However, requesting early termination may draw additional scrutiny if the FTC perceives the parties as rushing to close despite unresolved competitive questions, potentially triggering informal information requests that delay clearance even without formal Second Request.¹³²

#### Coordination with CFIUS Review (Conditional Risk)

If GLP's fund includes foreign limited partners with significant ownership stakes (>10% for certain jurisdictions, >25% generally), the transaction may require Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review under 31 C.F.R. Part 800.¹³³ PMSC operates U.S. port terminals (covered port facilities under MTSA), Jones Act-qualified vessels (critical infrastructure), and handles defense-related cargo at Terminal 46 Seattle (near Naval Station Everett), all of which create CFIUS jurisdiction if foreign ownership exceeds thresholds.¹³⁴

CFIUS review typically requires 45 days for initial review plus potential 45-day investigation period, totaling 90 days minimum before clearance.¹³⁵ CFIUS timing runs independently of HSR, but both must clear before closing, creating sequential delay if not filed simultaneously.¹³⁶ If CFIUS jurisdiction is triggered, the parties should file CFIUS notice concurrently with HSR (mid-January 2026) to enable parallel processing and avoid timeline compression.¹³⁷ CFIUS mitigation measures (e.g., foreign investor limitations, security agreements, board restrictions) may conflict with HSR remedies if both agencies impose inconsistent requirements, requiring careful coordination.¹³⁸

#### Pull-and-Refile Strategy Considerations

If initial HSR filing receives hostile reception (agency staff raises multiple preliminary concerns, requests extensive informal information, or signals imminent Second Request), the parties may consider a "pull-and-refile" strategy: withdrawing the HSR filing before Second Request issuance, engaging in pre-filing dialogue to address concerns, and refiling with supplemental information demonstrating absence of competitive harm.¹³⁹ This strategy can avoid formal Second Request while providing agencies with substantive information through voluntary submissions, but requires abandonment of the initial 30-day waiting period and restart of timing.¹⁴⁰

Pull-and-refile is most effective when specific agency concerns can be addressed through targeted information (e.g., market share data, alliance agreement terms, terminal access policies) rather than comprehensive discovery, and when timing flexibility exists to absorb 60-90 day delay from withdrawal to refiling clearance.¹⁴¹ For Project Neptune, pull-and-refile may be attractive if FTC raises VSA coordination concerns addressable through contractual firewalls or terminal access commitments, but less attractive if concerns involve broader portfolio effects or structural market power theories requiring transaction restructuring.¹⁴²

### E. Cross-Domain Implications

#### Port Lease Consent Timeline Cascade (Section IV.G)

HSR clearance is a condition precedent to port landlord consent applications at Oakland, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Tacoma, because port authorities will not commence detailed financial capability and operational continuity reviews while federal antitrust review remains pending.¹⁴³ Port consent processes require 60-120 days for staff review, public board meetings, and final approval resolutions, meaning that ports cannot issue consent until late March-early May 2026 if HSR clears in late February.¹⁴⁴ A Second Request scenario delaying HSR to Q3 2026 would push port consents to Q4 2026-Q1 2027, likely missing seasonal budget cycles and encountering political complications from leadership changes following November 2026 elections.¹⁴⁵

The 100% deemed assignment requirement across all four terminals means that failure to obtain any single port consent blocks closing entirely, creating sequential dependency where HSR delay multiplies through each subsequent approval.¹⁴⁶ The 70-80% estimated port approval probability assumes timely filings and normal processing; extended HSR review reduces approval probability to 60-70% as political and operational uncertainties compound.¹⁴⁷

#### Ship Mortgage Lender Consent Uncertainty (Section IV.H)

Lenders holding $2.8 billion in ship mortgages across 22 vessels must provide change-of-control consent or approve covenant amendments within GLP's investment timeline to avoid triggering acceleration rights.¹⁴⁸ Lender consent negotiations are highly sensitive to regulatory uncertainty: each month of HSR delay increases lender risk perception and strengthens negotiating leverage to demand higher pricing, additional covenants, or equity participation features.¹⁴⁹ The 60% estimated probability of covenant amendment approval (avoiding full refinancing) assumes HSR clearance within Q1 2026; extending to Q2-Q3 2026 reduces approval probability to 45-55% as lenders reassess PMSC's business prospects and competitive position under extended regulatory cloud.¹⁵⁰

The 15% probability of full refinancing requirement ($42M-$98M annual cost increase) reflects baseline lender risk aversion, but Second Request scenario increases refinancing probability to 25-30% as lenders demand take-out financing to eliminate uncertainty.¹⁵¹ Bridge financing to cover HSR delay period typically costs 8-12% interest (vs. 5-7% for permanent ship mortgage debt), adding $15M-$25M in annual carry costs during extended review.¹⁵²

#### ILWU CBA Negotiation Timing Compression (Section IV.E)

The ILWU Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement expires July 1, 2027, creating time-sensitive labor relations concerns if closing is delayed beyond Q1 2026.¹⁵³ Under the current March-April 2026 timeline, GLP has 15-17 months post-closing to establish relationships with union leadership, demonstrate commitment to West Coast operations, and prepare for contract negotiations before expiration.¹⁵⁴ Pushing closing to Q3-Q4 2026 compresses this period to 9-12 months, materially reducing GLP's ability to build trust and develop credible no-strike assurances.¹⁵⁵

Historical precedent shows that private equity ownership during active labor negotiations increases strike probability by 10-15 percentage points compared to incumbent management, as unions perceive PE owners as short-term financial extractors rather than long-term operational partners.¹⁵⁶ The 35% baseline strike probability (reflecting 2002 lockout and 2014-15 slowdown precedents) increases to 45-50% if closing occurs less than 12 months before CBA expiration, generating additional $50M-$100M in probability-weighted strike exposure.¹⁵⁷

#### VSA Alliance Partner Termination Risk (Section IV.J)

TPSA partners will closely monitor HSR review as a signal of competitive concerns and GLP's long-term commitment to PMSC operations.¹⁵⁸ Extended review or Second Request issuance creates perception among alliance partners that the transaction faces regulatory skepticism, increasing termination probability from 30-35% baseline to 40-50% as partners preemptively exit the alliance before potential disruption.¹⁵⁹ The $194M probability-weighted exposure from VSA termination (35% × $555M gross exposure) increases to $220M-$280M under extended HSR scenario (40-50% × $555M), representing $26M-$86M in incremental expected loss from timing delay.¹⁶⁰

Alliance partners must provide 180-day notice to terminate VSAs, meaning that partners receiving HSR Second Request notice in March 2026 could issue termination notices in April-May 2026, effective October 2026-January 2027.¹⁶¹ This timeline would result in alliance termination occurring either before closing (if HSR extends to Q4 2026) or immediately post-closing (if HSR clears Q3 2026 and closing occurs October 2026), eliminating PMSC's network coverage and requiring emergency vessel charter arrangements at penalty pricing.¹⁶²

#### Environmental Settlement Timing (Section IV.F)

The Sierra Club Clean Air Act litigation settlement negotiations at Los Angeles Terminal 300 are linked to port lease renewal discussions and require coordination with port authority capital improvement planning.¹⁶³ The 65% settlement probability at $226M-$306M (5-year phased capital investment) assumes closing occurs Q1-Q2 2026, enabling settlement finalization by Q3 2026 and commencement of Phase 1 equipment installations before 2026 holiday peak season.¹⁶⁴ HSR delay to Q3-Q4 2026 pushes settlement to Q1 2027, missing the 2026 implementation window and potentially increasing settlement costs by 10-15% as Sierra Club demands accelerated compliance timelines to compensate for regulatory delay.¹⁶⁵

### F. Recommendations

#### Recommendation 1: File HSR No Later Than January 20, 2026

To support March 15-April 1, 2026 closing, GLP and PMSC should file Form HSR no later than January 20, 2026, enabling the 30-day waiting period to expire February 19, 2026 with 3-6 weeks of buffer before closing.¹⁶⁶ Filing preparation should commence immediately to complete Item 4(c) document collection (investment committee materials, board presentations, management forecasts), Item 5 revenue reporting (NAICS code classification, product-by-product breakdowns), and Item 7 detailed revenue data (6-digit and 10-digit NAICS for all $10M+ revenue products).¹⁶⁷

Given the Executive Summary's designation of HSR Filing Status Verified as a CRITICAL milestone for January 15, 2026, the parties should confirm filing readiness by mid-January including retention of antitrust counsel with FTC maritime shipping expertise, completion of preliminary market analysis supporting absence of competitive concerns, and preparation of potential early termination request materials (though request should not be submitted without counsel advice on strategic considerations).¹⁶⁸

#### Recommendation 2: Engage FTC/DOJ Pre-Filing Consultation

Before filing HSR, antitrust counsel should consider pre-filing consultation with FTC Premerger Notification Office to discuss transaction structure, market definition issues, and potential information requests.¹⁶⁹ While pre-filing meetings are discretionary and not guaranteed, transactions raising novel issues or industry-specific concerns may benefit from advance dialogue that enables parties to address agency questions proactively through voluntary submissions attached to the HSR filing.¹⁷⁰ For Project Neptune, pre-filing discussion topics should include:

- GLP's fund structure and portfolio company holdings (confirming absence of competing maritime assets)
- TPSA alliance agreement terms and competitive effects analysis
- Port terminal market definition and capacity utilization data demonstrating competitive constraints
- Post-OSRA 2022 enforcement posture and FTC maritime shipping priorities

Pre-filing consultation can reduce Second Request probability by 5-10 percentage points if conducted effectively, but requires careful preparation to avoid inadvertently raising concerns that would not otherwise surface during initial review.¹⁷¹

#### Recommendation 3: Prepare Detailed Market Definition Analysis

To support early termination or preempt Second Request, the parties should prepare comprehensive market analysis demonstrating PMSC's limited market share in relevant antitrust markets defined by trade lane and port pair.¹⁷² This analysis should include:

- **Trans-Pacific Eastbound Market:** Market share calculations for Asia-U.S. West Coast container capacity by carrier, with PMSC representing <5% of total capacity deployed by MSC, Maersk, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, COSCO, OOCL, Evergreen, and other carriers
- **Port Terminal Market:** Terminal capacity utilization at Los Angeles Harbor, Oakland, Seattle, and Tacoma, demonstrating competitive alternatives available to ocean carriers and BCO (beneficial cargo owner) shippers
- **Alliance Structure:** TPSA membership analysis showing alliance represents <30% of trans-Pacific capacity and faces competition from 2M Alliance and Ocean Alliance
- **Entry Analysis:** Evidence of recent entry and expansion by carriers including ZIM, HMM, and regional operators demonstrating absence of insurmountable barriers

This market analysis should be prepared by economic consulting firms with FTC/DOJ merger review experience (e.g., Compass Lexecon, Analysis Group, Charles River Associates) and submitted voluntarily with the HSR filing as Item 4(c) documents or as supplemental white paper if not created in ordinary course.¹⁷³

#### Recommendation 4: Coordinate CFIUS Timing (If Applicable)

If CFIUS jurisdiction is triggered based on GLP fund composition, the parties should file CFIUS notice concurrently with HSR to enable parallel processing and avoid sequential delay.¹⁷⁴ CFIUS counsel should review GLP's limited partner list to identify foreign investor percentages by country, determine whether covered investment thresholds are exceeded, and assess whether port terminal operations and Jones Act vessels constitute covered port facilities or critical infrastructure triggering mandatory declaration.¹⁷⁵

If CFIUS filing is required, the parties should prepare national security risk mitigation measures including:
- Establishment of security sub-committee with U.S.-citizen-only directors
- Implementation of data security protocols isolating sensitive maritime and defense-related information
- Adoption of facility access restrictions limiting foreign personnel at Terminal 46 Seattle (near Naval Station Everett)
- Negotiation of security agreement with Department of Homeland Security or Department of Defense if defense cargo handling is material

CFIUS mitigation measures should be coordinated with FMC Form FMC-1 operator licensing requirements and port lease security protocols to avoid duplicative or conflicting obligations.¹⁷⁶

#### Recommendation 5: Develop Pull-and-Refile Strategy

Given 15-25% Second Request probability, the parties should develop contingency pull-and-refile strategy to avoid formal Second Request if preliminary agency reception is hostile.¹⁷⁷ This strategy should identify:

- **Trigger Conditions:** Circumstances warranting withdrawal (e.g., agency staff indicates imminent Second Request, requests information suggesting deep investigation, raises coordination theories regarding TPSA)
- **Supplemental Information Package:** Materials to provide during withdrawn period (expanded market analysis, alliance governance documents, terminal access policies)
- **Timing Tolerance:** Maximum delay acceptable before reconsidering transaction economics (e.g., 60-day pull-and-refile acceptable, 90-day extension requires lender consent renegotiation)
- **Re-Filing Strategy:** Whether to refile with expanded voluntary submissions, request pre-filing meeting to present information, or restructure transaction to address concerns

Pull-and-refile should be coordinated with other regulatory timelines (port consents, lender amendments, ILWU relations) to ensure that HSR delay does not trigger cascade failures across other conditions.¹⁷⁸

#### Recommendation 6: Include HSR Clearance as Explicit Closing Condition with Outside Date Flexibility

The definitive merger agreement should include HSR clearance as explicit closing condition with outside date provisions that accommodate potential extended review.¹⁷⁹ Recommended provisions include:

- **Regulatory Efforts Covenant:** Both parties agree to use reasonable best efforts (or hell-or-high-water standard, depending on negotiation) to obtain HSR clearance, including responding to agency information requests, engaging in substantive dialogue with staff, and considering reasonable remedial measures
- **Outside Date:** March 15, 2026 initial outside date with automatic extension to April 1, 2026 if HSR waiting period has not expired but closing otherwise ready, and further extension to June 1, 2026 if Second Request issued and parties are diligently pursuing substantial compliance
- **Termination Rights:** Either party may terminate if HSR clearance not obtained by outside date, with GLP retaining termination right if agencies require structural remedies (e.g., terminal divestiture, alliance withdrawal) that materially impair transaction value
- **Break Fee:** Mutual break fee (payable by either party) of $144M-$192M (3-4% of transaction value) to discourage opportunistic termination while providing exit option if regulatory risk materializes

These provisions should be coordinated with other regulatory condition provisions (CFIUS, FMC, port consents) to avoid conflicts and ensure consistent efforts standard across all regulatory approvals.¹⁸⁰

#### Recommendation 7: Prepare Alliance Partner Engagement Strategy

To mitigate 30-35% VSA termination probability, GLP should prepare comprehensive alliance partner engagement strategy executed immediately following HSR clearance (or concurrently with filing if acceptable to partners).¹⁸¹ This engagement should include:

- **Financial Sponsor Profile:** Presentation to TPSA partners demonstrating GLP's long-term commitment, maritime industry experience (if any), and portfolio composition (confirming absence of competing container shipping investments)
- **Operational Continuity Assurance:** Commitment letters confirming PMSC management retention, capital investment in fleet and terminals, and no near-term strategic changes affecting alliance operations
- **Governance Transparency:** Offer to provide TPSA partners with advance notice of material operational changes, board composition, and any portfolio developments that could create competitive concerns
- **Economic Incentives:** Consideration of offering partners enhanced slot exchange terms, terminal access priority, or other operational benefits to incentivize alliance continuation

Alliance partner engagement should be coordinated with antitrust counsel to ensure communications do not constitute information exchange or coordination violating Section 1 Sherman Act, and should include DOJ Antitrust Division consultation if appropriate given industry sensitivity.¹⁸²
