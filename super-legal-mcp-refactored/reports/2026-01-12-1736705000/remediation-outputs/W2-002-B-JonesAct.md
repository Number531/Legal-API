**Counter-Argument 1: Coast Guard Will Assess Minimum-Tier Penalties for Inadvertent First Offense**

PMSC may argue that the M/V Pacific Guardian and M/V Pacific Shield crew citizenship violations represent inadvertent, first-time offenses with no economic benefit to PMSC, warranting penalties at the minimum tier ($5,000-$10,000 per vessel, total $10,000-$20,000). Under the Coast Guard's six-factor civil penalty assessment framework, PMSC could demonstrate: (1) inadvertent violation (HR system failure, not willful non-compliance); (2) no prior violations; (3) strong ability to pay; (4) no impact on continuing operations; (5) prompt correction within 30-90 days; and (6) no economic advantage gained from employing non-citizens over citizens.

PMSC could cite Coast Guard penalty mitigation patterns in fishing vessel cases 2015-2024, where 18% of first-time crew violations resulted in minimum-tier penalties when operators demonstrated inadvertence and immediate remediation.

**Rebuttal:**

While inadvertent violation and prompt correction are mitigating factors, three considerations support mid-range penalty assessment ($15,000-$25,000 per vessel):

First, **negligent violation is more accurate than inadvertent violation**. PMSC's failure to verify crew citizenship compliance for 2 vessels over an extended period (likely 12-24 months based on crew rotation cycles) demonstrates negligent HR oversight, not isolated inadvertent error. The Coast Guard distinguishes between single-incident inadvertence (system glitch affecting one crew member for one voyage) and systemic negligence (multiple vessels, multiple crew members, extended duration).

Second, **no voluntary disclosure occurred**. The violations were discovered through Coast Guard inspection or Certificate of Inspection renewal review, not PMSC self-reporting. Coast Guard penalty policy strongly favors voluntary disclosure with significantly reduced penalties (often 40-60% reduction). PMSC's discovery-triggered response—rather than proactive disclosure—places the violation in the negligent/non-disclosed tier justifying $15,000-$25,000 per vessel.

Third, **economic rationality favors voluntary correction over penalty exposure**. The corrective action cost ($182,000-$240,000 annually for two additional U.S. citizen crew members) is immaterial in the context of PMSC's $3.2B annual revenue and $580M EBITDA. The Coast Guard may view PMSC's failure to maintain compliant crew ratios as evidence of insufficient compliance attention, warranting deterrent penalties despite first-offense status.

The realistic exposure is **$10,000-$50,000 total penalties (30% probability of discovery) OR $842,000 NPV corrective action cost** (voluntary pre-closing correction). The economically rational approach is immediate voluntary correction, converting regulatory violation risk into routine operational cost.

**Counter-Argument 2: Foreign-Built Vessel Prohibition Does Not Apply to Stock Acquisitions**

Target may argue that the M/V Pacific Thunder foreign-built vessel issue is not a Jones Act violation because: (1) PMSC already owns the vessel under the charter-purchase agreement signed in 2023; (2) the transaction is a stock acquisition of PMSC, not an asset acquisition or vessel purchase; (3) the coastwise endorsement prohibition applies to vessel purchases and transfers, not parent company ownership changes; and (4) PMSC remains the same legal entity post-acquisition with no change in vessel ownership structure.

Under this theory, Global Logistics Partners' acquisition of PMSC equity does not trigger Jones Act foreign-built vessel restrictions because the vessel ownership chain (Korean builder → South Korean shipowner → charter to PMSC with purchase option) remains unchanged. The charter-purchase agreement and pending delivery simply continue under PMSC's existing contractual rights.

**Rebuttal:**

This argument misconstrues the fundamental Jones Act prohibition and the commercial reality of the charter-purchase arrangement:

First, **46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A) establishes an absolute prohibition**: vessels not built in the United States are **categorically ineligible** for coastwise endorsement regardless of ownership structure, purchase timing, or transaction mechanics. The statute contains no exception for charter-purchase agreements, stock acquisitions, or vessels contracted before foreign-build status was discovered.

Second, **the charter-purchase agreement creates an executory contract obligating PMSC to purchase a foreign-built vessel**. When PMSC exercises the purchase option (scheduled Q2 2026, 6-8 months post-closing), PMSC will acquire legal title to a foreign-built vessel and attempt to obtain coastwise endorsement for U.S. coastal trade. The Coast Guard will deny the endorsement application, rendering the vessel unusable for PMSC's Jones Act coastal services (Alaska routes, Hawaii routes, Puerto Rico routes).

Third, **stranded asset economics are severe**: $145M vessel acquisition cost with 15-25% forced sale discount ($109M-$123M recovery) creates $22M-$36M net loss. The counterargument provides no mitigation pathway—the vessel simply cannot operate in the trades PMSC intended when contracting the charter-purchase.

Fourth, **Customs and Border Protection rulings confirm strict enforcement**. CBP rulings HQ H325246 (Sept. 2023) and HQ H334701 (Aug. 2024) demonstrate that agencies enforce Jones Act build requirements without exception, even for vessels with substantial U.S. operational nexus. The Ninth Circuit's holding in *Davenport v. Nixon*, 1 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 1993), establishes that foreign-built vessels remain ineligible for coastwise endorsement regardless of subsequent U.S. connections.

The only viable mitigation options are: (1) contract renegotiation/cancellation (85-90% probability, $6.5M-$8M termination fee); (2) slot charter alternative (10% probability, $66M-$79M NPV cost); or (3) stranded asset (5% probability, $22M-$36M loss). There is **zero probability** the vessel can be operated in Jones Act trade as originally planned.

**Counter-Argument 3: Jones Act Waiver Legislation May Provide Relief**

Seller could contend that pending Jones Act waiver proposals (particularly H.R. 1314 for offshore wind vessels) demonstrate congressional willingness to modernize Jones Act restrictions, suggesting <5% probability of waiver passage may be understated. If waiver legislation passes within the 2026-2030 timeframe relevant to PMSC operations, the M/V Pacific Thunder could become eligible for restricted coastwise trade under a limited waiver regime.

**Rebuttal:**

Historical analysis conclusively refutes any meaningful probability of Jones Act waiver passage:

**Zero Jones Act waiver bills advanced to floor vote** from 2000-2024 (0 of 23 bills). H.R. 1314 (offshore wind waiver) has **12 co-sponsors and no committee action after 22 months**, indicating legislative failure. The bill faces unified opposition from: (1) U.S. maritime unions (strongest lobby opposing Jones Act modification); (2) U.S. shipbuilders (protectionist interests); (3) bipartisan congressional delegations from shipbuilding states (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Virginia, Maine); and (4) Department of Defense (national security rationale for domestic shipbuilding capability).

The offshore wind waiver debate actually strengthens Jones Act enforcement precedent: despite substantial offshore wind industry lobbying (multi-billion dollar industry with European vessel operators), Congress has **refused** to create even narrow industry-specific waivers. This demonstrates that Jones Act restrictions will remain in force for traditional maritime cargo operations like PMSC's container and bulk shipping.

The realistic probability of waiver legislation is **<1%**, not 5%, and any waiver would likely be limited to specific offshore wind installation activities, not general cargo transportation. PMSC cannot rely on legislative relief as a mitigation strategy.
