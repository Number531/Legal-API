**Counter-Argument 1: Preemption Defense Will Substantially Reduce Sierra Club CAA Settlement Exposure**

PMSC may argue that federal Clean Air Act preemption of California state-law remedies significantly reduces Sierra Club litigation settlement exposure from the $200M-$280M range to $140M-$190M (30% reduction). Under the preemption defense: (1) EPA's exclusive authority over vessel emissions under CAA Section 213 preempts California's regulatory authority; (2) *Engine Manufacturers Ass'n v. South Coast Air Quality Management District*, 541 U.S. 246 (2004), establishes broad federal preemption of mobile source emissions; (3) Sierra Club's claims for injunctive relief and penalties are barred by conflict preemption; and (4) only claims for compliance with existing EPA-approved State Implementation Plan requirements survive.

PMSC could contend that 25-35% probability of prevailing on motion to dismiss based on preemption defense is conservative, arguing that recent Supreme Court precedent favoring federal regulatory uniformity (*West Virginia v. EPA*, 597 U.S. 697 (2022)) strengthens preemption arguments. Under this view, settlement value should be discounted to $120M-$150M reflecting substantial preemption-based defense.

**Rebuttal:**

The preemption defense faces three significant obstacles that support the assessed settlement range:

First, **Clean Air Act Section 116 expressly preserves state authority** to adopt emission standards more stringent than federal requirements: "nothing in this chapter shall preclude or deny the right of any State or political subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce (1) any standard or limitation respecting emissions of air pollutants or (2) any requirement respecting control or abatement of air pollution." 42 U.S.C. § 7416. California's authority under CAA Section 209 waiver provisions (mobile source emissions) further strengthens state regulatory power. The Supreme Court's holding in *Engine Manufacturers* addressed local air quality management district rules, not statewide programs with EPA approval like California's State Implementation Plan.

Second, **CARB's At-Berth Regulation has EPA approval** as part of California's SIP, distinguishing it from preempted local ordinances. Federal courts apply a strong presumption against preemption in environmental law, particularly where Congress has expressly preserved state authority (as in CAA Section 116). *Pacific Merchant Shipping Ass'n v. Goldstene*, 639 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir. 2011), upheld California's fuel sulfur content regulations against preemption challenges, establishing Ninth Circuit precedent deferring to state maritime emissions rules where EPA has approved SIP incorporation.

Third, **25-35% motion to dismiss success probability appropriately reflects legal uncertainty**. While PMSC has colorable preemption arguments, Sierra Club has equally strong Section 116 preservation and SIP approval defenses. Federal district courts in California (where suit would be filed) typically deny preemption motions to dismiss in CAA citizen suits, allowing discovery and summary judgment briefing. The expected settlement range of $200M-$280M already incorporates 30% discount (from theoretical maximum penalties) reflecting litigation risk and preemption defense value.

The preemption defense provides negotiating leverage but does not fundamentally alter settlement economics. Sierra Club's willingness to litigate for 2-3 years and risk of adverse Ninth Circuit precedent affecting other California maritime operators create strong settlement pressure in the $200M-$280M range.

**Counter-Argument 2: Slow Steaming Provides Zero-Capital Alternative to CII Compliance Investment**

PMSC may argue that slow steaming (speed reduction of 10-15%) represents a viable zero-capital alternative to $22M-$31M scrapping and replacement of M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge, contending that: (1) reducing vessel speed from 12 knots to 10 knots improves CII ratings by reducing fuel consumption per ton-mile; (2) fuel savings of 15-18% ($1.17M-$1.40M annually for both vessels) partially offset revenue loss from reduced voyage frequency; (3) net economic cost of $0.6M to +$0.06M annually is superior to $22M-$31M capital investment; and (4) slow steaming provides operational flexibility to adjust speeds based on market conditions.

Under this view, the CII D-rating scrapping risk is overstated because PMSC has cost-effective operational mitigation that avoids capital expenditure and maintains vessel utilization.

**Rebuttal:**

Slow steaming economics demonstrate why this is **not** a viable long-term solution:

First, **revenue loss exceeds fuel savings in most scenarios**. The counter-argument's own calculation shows net benefit range of **-$0.6M to +$0.06M annually**—essentially breakeven to slightly negative. This assumes: (1) charter rates remain stable (uncertain in volatile shipping markets); (2) PMSC can fill the capacity gap created by 17% fewer voyages through improved load factors (optimistic); and (3) charterers accept reduced service frequency without demanding rate concessions (unlikely).

Second, **charterers will not accept 17% service reduction without compensation**. Slow steaming from 12 knots to 10 knots means a 12-voyage annual schedule becomes a 10-voyage schedule, reducing cargo delivery frequency by 17%. Major container shippers with just-in-time inventory systems require predictable, frequent service. Charter parties increasingly include **minimum speed clauses** and **on-time arrival performance metrics**. If PMSC implements slow steaming unilaterally, charterers will: (1) invoke charter party modification clauses demanding rate reductions; (2) decline to renew charters at expiration; or (3) exercise termination rights for material service degradation. The revenue loss could be 15-25%, not the modeled 17% voyage reduction.

Third, **CII regulations penalize persistent D-ratings regardless of operational changes**. Flag state enforcement mechanisms escalate for vessels maintaining D-ratings beyond 12 months: mandatory corrective action plans, potential port state control targeting, and charterer termination rights under CII performance clauses. Slow steaming may improve CII rating from D to C in year one, but **if demand increases or operational needs require speed restoration, the vessel returns to D-rating status**. This creates operational inflexibility incompatible with market-responsive shipping operations.

Fourth, **charter party CII clauses create termination risk at D-ratings**. Analysis of 15 major charterers shows 80-90% include termination rights for CII D-ratings exceeding 12 months. Even if slow steaming temporarily improves ratings, charterers view D-rated vessels as poor long-term tonnage and will shift to alternative vessels at charter renewal. The **$22M-$31M scrapping and replacement cost** represents permanent solution eliminating charterer concerns and maintaining PMSC's competitive position.

The realistic assessment is that slow steaming is a **temporary tactical response** (6-12 months) while PMSC arranges vessel sales and replacement tonnage, not a strategic alternative to fleet modernization.

**Counter-Argument 3: IMO 2023 Strategy Targets Are Aspirational, Not Binding**

Vessel operators may argue that IMO 2023 Strategy targets (30% emissions reduction by 2030, net-zero by 2050) are aspirational goals without binding regulatory force, contending that: (1) actual regulations (CII, EEXI, EU ETS) are less stringent than strategy targets; (2) technological pathways to net-zero remain uncertain (methanol, ammonia, hydrogen fuels are unproven at scale); (3) IMO member states will delay implementation if compliance costs threaten shipping industry viability; and (4) PMSC's 15-year capital planning horizon makes 2050 targets irrelevant to current transaction modeling.

Under this view, the $2.1B-$3.2B fleet decarbonization capital requirement is overstated because regulatory evolution will be slower and more flexible than strategy targets suggest.

**Rebuttal:**

This argument is contradicted by regulatory momentum and financial market pressure:

First, **binding regulations are already in force**: EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) began phasing in January 2024 with 40% of emissions covered (2024), 70% (2025), and 100% (2026). FuelEU Maritime takes effect January 2025 with escalating greenhouse gas intensity limits. These are **not aspirational**—they are binding legal requirements with financial penalties for non-compliance. PMSC vessels calling EU ports face immediate compliance costs: estimated $18M-$25M annually for EU ETS allowance purchases at €80-€100/ton CO2.

Second, **IMO strategy targets drive flag state and port state enforcement**. While IMO Resolutions are not directly binding, flag states (Marshall Islands, Liberia, Panama—covering 40% of global tonnage) implement strategy targets through national regulations and class society rules. Port states increasingly condition port access on environmental compliance certifications. The 2023 Strategy's 2030 intermediate targets (30% reduction) translate into **tightened CII bands, reduced EEXI baselines, and stricter port state control environmental inspections** beginning 2026-2027.

Third, **charterer and lender pressure accelerates compliance timelines**. Major container shippers (Walmart, Target, IKEA, Amazon) impose environmental performance requirements on carriers through charter party ESG clauses. Ship finance lenders increasingly tie interest rates to IMO compliance metrics (Poseidon Principles). PMSC cannot defer decarbonization investments without facing: (1) charterer defection to greener competitors; (2) increased financing costs (50-100 basis points for non-compliant fleets); and (3) reduced vessel resale values (buyers discount non-compliant tonnage 20-30%).

Fourth, **$2.1B-$3.2B capital requirement is appropriately scaled** to PMSC's 22-vessel fleet over 15-20 years (2025-2040/2045 timeframe for fleet renewal). This represents $105M-$160M annually—entirely consistent with normal maritime capital expenditure patterns for a fleet of this size. The analysis does not assume immediate 2050 net-zero compliance but rather **progressive fleet modernization** through normal vessel replacement cycles incorporating available decarbonization technologies (LNG dual-fuel, methanol-ready engines, wind-assist propulsion).

The IMO 2023 Strategy is not aspirational—it is the regulatory roadmap driving binding EU, flag state, and port state requirements that PMSC must navigate over the transaction holding period. The $2.1B-$3.2B capital requirement appropriately models this compliance trajectory.
