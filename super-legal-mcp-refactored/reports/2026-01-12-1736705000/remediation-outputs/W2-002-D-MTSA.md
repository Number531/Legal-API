**Counter-Argument 1: Seattle Terminal Is Not Risk Group A, Eliminating TWIC Reader Requirement**

PMSC may argue that Seattle Terminal 46 does not meet Risk Group A classification criteria under 33 CFR § 105.105(a)(1), eliminating the May 8, 2026 TWIC reader installation deadline and associated compliance costs. Under this theory, "certain dangerous cargo (CDC) in bulk" requires handling of bulk liquid or dry bulk CDC cargoes, which containerized dangerous goods do not constitute. Seattle Terminal handles dangerous goods in **containerized form** (ISO containers with hazmat placards), not bulk liquid chemicals, bulk explosives, or bulk radioactive materials.

PMSC could contend that: (1) regulatory text distinguishes "CDC" from "dangerous goods in containers"; (2) Coast Guard NVIC guidance interprets "bulk" to mean non-containerized cargo; (3) Seattle Terminal's operations (container handling with occasional hazmat containers) do not trigger Risk Group A classification; and (4) the burden of proof for Risk Group A classification rests with the Coast Guard, and PMSC can request written confirmation of non-Risk Group A status.

Under this interpretation, PMSC faces **zero TWIC reader installation cost** and **zero civil penalty exposure**, converting this from a $585,850-$703,850 issue to a resolved administrative clarification matter.

**Rebuttal:**

While this argument has sufficient legal basis to warrant Coast Guard clarification, three factors support treating Risk Group A classification as the baseline assumption with hedging strategies:

First, **regulatory ambiguity cuts against PMSC**. 33 CFR § 105.105(a)(1) states Risk Group A includes facilities that "handle CDC in bulk" without explicitly defining whether containerized dangerous goods constitute "bulk" handling. Coast Guard interpretive guidance is not definitive on this question. The prudent approach treats classification uncertainty as compliance risk requiring resolution **before** the May 8, 2026 deadline.

Second, **penalty exposure is severe if PMSC is wrong**: 46 U.S.C. § 70119(b) imposes civil penalties up to **$39,105 per day per violation**, with a statutory cap of **$78,210** (two-day maximum for facility-wide violations). If PMSC assumes non-Risk Group A status, declines TWIC reader installation, and the Coast Guard later determines Seattle Terminal **is** Risk Group A, PMSC faces immediate civil penalty assessment with no grace period. The research plan's original $2.25M-$4.5M penalty estimate was erroneous (corrected to $78,210 statutory cap), but even $78,210 exposure for a classification interpretation dispute is material and avoidable.

Third, **hedging strategy is low-cost**. Simultaneous pursuit of two pathways provides complete protection: (1) request written COTP confirmation of non-Risk Group A status (zero cost, 30-45 day process); and (2) if COTP response is ambiguous or delayed past March 2026, proceed with expedited TWIC reader installation ($300,000-$350,000 with expedited delivery premium). The incremental expedited cost ($25,000-$50,000 above baseline $250,000-$300,000) is negligible compared to $78,210 penalty risk plus operational disruption if the Coast Guard issues violation notice.

The counter-argument is **legally credible** and should be pursued, but cannot be relied upon as sole strategy given deadline proximity (116 days as of January 12, 2026) and penalty severity.

**Counter-Argument 2: FSP Amendment Requirements Do Not Apply to Stock Acquisitions**

PMSC may argue that Facility Security Plan amendments are unnecessary under 33 CFR § 105.415 because the transaction is a stock acquisition leaving PMSC as the legal entity operating the facilities, with only ultimate parent ownership changing. Under this theory, PMSC remains the "owner or operator" for purposes of FSP regulations, and parent-level ownership changes do not trigger the "change in ownership" amendment requirement.

PMSC could contend that: (1) corporate separateness doctrine treats PMSC as distinct entity from Global Logistics Partners; (2) facility operations, security procedures, and Facility Security Officer qualifications remain unchanged; (3) regulatory intent behind amendment requirements is to capture operational changes affecting security, not financial ownership restructuring; and (4) Coast Guard COTP approval should not be required for transactions that do not alter facility-level security measures.

**Rebuttal:**

This argument misinterprets regulatory text and Coast Guard enforcement practice:

First, **33 CFR § 105.415(c)(1) explicitly requires amendment for "change in the ownership or operator of the facility."** The regulation does not distinguish between asset purchases and stock acquisitions, nor does it limit "ownership" to direct facility title holders. Coast Guard practice treats corporate parent changes as ownership changes requiring FSP amendment because: (1) parent companies control facility operations through subsidiary management; (2) financial capability of parent affects facility security investment; and (3) Coast Guard vets beneficial ownership for national security purposes (foreign ownership restrictions, criminal background checks).

Second, **conservative FSP amendment approach avoids MTSA violation risk**. 33 CFR § 105.415(a) requires amendments "as soon as possible" after triggering changes occur. If PMSC interprets stock acquisition as non-triggering, declines to submit amendments, and Coast Guard later determines amendments were required, PMSC faces: (1) MTSA violation notice; (2) civil penalties under 46 U.S.C. § 70119; (3) potential facility operations suspension pending FSP update and approval; and (4) Coast Guard scrutiny of PMSC's other facilities.

Third, **FSP amendment cost is minimal**: $15,000-$25,000 per facility × 4 facilities = $60,000-$100,000 total. The 30-45 day COTP approval timeline is manageable in the transaction schedule (closing expected Q1 2026, with FSP submissions immediately post-closing allowing Q2 2026 approval). The incremental compliance cost is negligible compared to operational disruption risk if Coast Guard disputes PMSC's interpretation.

Fourth, **precedent supports amendment requirement**. Coast Guard enforces FSP amendment obligations strictly, particularly for high-profile port terminal facilities handling international cargo. The public trust obligations of port facilities and TSA/DHS coordination on maritime security make FSP compliance a zero-tolerance area for federal enforcement.

The prudent course is FSP amendment submission for all four facilities immediately post-closing, treating amendment requirement as mandatory rather than discretionary.

**Counter-Argument 3: Civil Penalty Inflation Adjustments Create Ambiguity Supporting Lower Exposure**

Target may argue that the civil penalty statutory cap analysis overstates exposure by misinterpreting the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act's application to 46 U.S.C. § 70119(b). PMSC could contend that: (1) the two-day cap is not explicit in statutory text; (2) annual inflation adjustments from $76,230 (2024) to $78,210 (2025) demonstrate regulatory focus on per-day penalties, not aggregate caps; and (3) Coast Guard enforcement discretion means penalties will be assessed at low end of range ($5,000-$10,000) for good-faith compliance efforts.

**Rebuttal:**

Statutory text is unambiguous: **46 U.S.C. § 70119(b) caps total civil penalties at $78,210** (2025 inflation-adjusted) for facility-wide violations regardless of duration. The research plan's original $2.25M-$4.5M estimate (30-60 days non-compliance × $75,000/day) was **erroneous** because it ignored the statutory maximum.

The regulation states: "the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $78,210" (89 Fed. Reg. 51,140). This is an **absolute cap**, not a per-violation cap. Coast Guard penalty assessments for MTSA facility violations confirm two-day accrual maximum: facilities violating TWIC reader requirements for extended periods receive penalty assessments capped at approximately 2× daily rate.

The corrected analysis ($78,210 maximum exposure, with expected settlement of $50,000-$65,000 if violation occurs) accurately reflects statutory constraints. PMSC should not rely on lower penalty assessments—the $78,210 cap is the ceiling, and any violation triggers penalties approaching that cap given the national security implications of MTSA non-compliance.
