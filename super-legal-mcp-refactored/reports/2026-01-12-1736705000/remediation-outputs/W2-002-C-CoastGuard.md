**Counter-Argument 1: M/V Pacific Titan Conditional COI Does Not Create Ongoing Operational Risk**

PMSC may argue that the M/V Pacific Titan's conditional Certificate of Inspection represents a resolved compliance matter with minimal ongoing risk, contending that: (1) the Coast Guard reinstated the COI following $18.7M repairs and upgraded BWMS installation; (2) the conditional drydock requirement (September 2026) is a routine precautionary measure, not evidence of systemic structural concerns; (3) insurance covered $12.05M of repair costs (64% of total), limiting net exposure to $6.65M; and (4) the 20-25% recurrence probability is speculative and unsupported by marine surveyor data for vessels with newly installed BWMS and replaced shell plating.

Under this view, the M/V Pacific Titan incident is a one-time event fully remediated through capital investment, and the vessel will return to normal operations post-September 2026 drydock with no incremental costs beyond the already-incurred $6.65M net exposure.

**Rebuttal:**

While the conditional COI reinstatement allows current operations, three factors support the assessed ongoing risk:

First, **the 20-25% recurrence probability is based on marine surveyor expert judgment** regarding ballast tank corrosion patterns in vessels with prior BWMS-induced corrosion. Even with upgraded BWMS (Alfa Laval PureBallast 3.2 replacing failed GEA Westfalia system) and new shell plating, residual corrosion in adjacent tank structures and potential inadequate protective coating application during emergency repairs create material recurrence risk. The September 2026 mandatory drydock is **not routine**—it is a conditional requirement specifically imposed by the Coast Guard to verify absence of recurring corrosion, indicating the agency's own concern about structural integrity.

Second, **regulatory framework gaps enable undetected failures**. Neither IMO nor Coast Guard regulations require periodic BWMS performance re-testing after commissioning, meaning the upgraded Alfa Laval system could fail over 2-5 years without detection until the next special survey. This is precisely what occurred from 2019 (commissioning) to 2024 (failure discovery)—five years of undetected accelerated corrosion. The lack of mandatory periodic testing means PMSC must implement voluntary quarterly BWMS performance testing ($15,000-$25,000 annually per vessel), or face ongoing corrosion risk.

Third, **if recurrence occurs, costs are severe**: $8M-$15M additional repairs, potential COI suspension during peak shipping season creating $2M-$4M revenue loss, and Coast Guard scrutiny of PMSC's entire fleet BWMS maintenance practices potentially triggering inspections across all 22 vessels. The expected value calculation (20-25% probability × $10M-$19M exposure = $2M-$4.75M) appropriately captures this tail risk.

The conditional COI is not a "resolved" matter—it creates an ongoing compliance obligation and material recurrence risk warranting inclusion in transaction risk modeling.

**Counter-Argument 2: Underwater Survey Alternative Will Significantly Reduce Drydock Costs**

Seller will contend that PMSC's fleet optimization opportunity through underwater surveys (46 CFR § 91.40-3(c)) substantially reduces projected drydock costs, arguing that: (1) 15 vessels qualify (age <15 years with effective hull protection systems); (2) underwater survey cost of $150,000-$300,000 versus drydock cost of $1.5M-$4.5M creates $1.2M-$4.2M savings per vessel; (3) fleet-wide annual savings of $5M-$15M (4-5 vessels) materially improves operating economics; and (4) Coast Guard approval for underwater surveys is routine for vessels meeting age and coating requirements.

Under this theory, the baseline drydock cost assumption is overstated because it does not fully account for the regulatory cost-saving alternative available to two-thirds of the fleet.

**Rebuttal:**

While underwater survey presents legitimate cost savings for **some** vessels, three limitations constrain its application:

First, **Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) discretion is absolute**: "may be considered by the OCMI" means approval is not automatic even for qualifying vessels. OCMIs consider vessel operational profile, trade routes, cargo type, and maintenance history. PMSC's container ships operating trans-Pacific routes with 12-18 day passages face harsher corrosive environments than coastwise traders, potentially reducing OCMI approval rates.

Second, **M/V Pacific Titan's conditional COI likely precludes underwater survey** for the mandated September 2026 drydock. The Coast Guard explicitly requires physical drydocking to verify absence of recurring ballast tank corrosion—underwater survey cannot provide equivalent hull thickness gauging for internal ballast tank structures. This eliminates one of the 15 potentially qualifying vessels from the savings calculation.

Third, **realizable savings are likely $3M-$8M annually, not $5M-$15M**. Assuming Coast Guard approves underwater surveys for 50-60% of the 15 qualifying vessels (7-9 vessels eligible), and PMSC alternates drydock/underwater survey on 2.5-year intervals, approximately 3-4 vessels per year substitute underwater survey for drydock. At $1.2M-$4.2M savings per substitution, annual savings are $3.6M-$16.8M, with midpoint $8M-$10M. The $5M-$15M range appropriately captures realistic savings.

The underwater survey opportunity is real but constrained by OCMI discretion, conditional COI limitations, and fleet operational profiles. It does not fundamentally alter PMSC's structural drydock cost obligations.

**Counter-Argument 3: Port State Control Deficiency Risk Is Overstated Given PMSC's Strong Safety Record**

PMSC may argue that its Port State Control examination performance demonstrates low detention risk, pointing to: (1) estimated 5-8 PSC examinations annually across 22-vessel fleet (industry-typical frequency); (2) assumed 1-2 deficiencies per examination (below industry average); (3) no documented detentions in available data; and (4) classification society relationships (ABS, Lloyd's Register, Bureau Veritas) indicating strong maintenance standards.

Under this view, the regulatory framework discussion overstates PSC risk by focusing on potential structural deficiencies without acknowledging PMSC's operational track record.

**Rebuttal:**

The analysis appropriately presents PSC as an **enforcement framework**, not a projected liability:

First, **PMSC's PSC performance data is incomplete**. The statement "[PENDING VERIFICATION - PMSC's actual PSC examination statistics for FY2023-FY2024 required from data room]" indicates available data does not provide comprehensive PSC history. Without verified examination counts, deficiency categories, and resolution timelines, any assertion of "strong safety record" is unsupported.

Second, **FY2024 industry-wide Coast Guard PSC statistics** show concerning patterns: fire safety deficiencies lead for fourth consecutive year (oil accumulation in engine rooms as top single deficiency), and 65 Safety Management System deficiencies indicate broader compliance issues. PMSC operates in the same regulatory environment facing the same inspection priorities.

Third, **the M/V Pacific Titan incident demonstrates that major structural deficiencies can exist despite classification society oversight**. ABS surveyors discovered the hull corrosion during special survey—it was not identified through PMSC's internal maintenance or interim inspections. This validates the framework analysis showing that PSC examinations target structural deficiencies (bulk carriers and container ships receive enhanced scrutiny) and that deficiency discovery can trigger vessel detention.

The PSC framework analysis does not assert PMSC faces imminent detention risk—it establishes that regulatory authority exists, enforcement priorities target structural integrity, and PMSC vessels are subject to these examinations. This is appropriate context for understanding the M/V Pacific Titan conditional COI and fleet-wide compliance obligations.
