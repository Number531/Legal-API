# II. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

1. **Under the Ocean Shipping Reform Act's enhanced detention and demurrage enforcement authority (46 U.S.C. § 41305(a)), does PMSC face material liability when 12 shipper complaints allege unreasonable detention charges totaling $1.0M-$2.2M aggregate exposure, 8 of 12 complaints have already settled favorably, 4 remain in active settlement negotiations, and when the Hapag-Lloyd $2M precedent settlement (June 2022) suggests resolution within manageable ranges for this $4.8B transaction?**

2. **Under the Jones Act's 75% U.S. citizen crew requirement (46 U.S.C. § 8103(a)), does PMSC face material non-compliance exposure when 2 vessels (M/V Pacific Guardian at 72.7% and M/V Pacific Shield at 72.5%) each require only 1 additional U.S. crew member, corrective hiring costs $310K annually through SIU hiring halls, and when Coast Guard discovery probability remains 30% within 12 months absent voluntary disclosure?**

3. **Under the Maritime Transportation Security Act's TWIC reader mandate for Risk Group A facilities (33 CFR § 105.253(a)(2)), does PMSC's Seattle Terminal face violation exposure when the regulatory deadline is May 8, 2026 (116 days remain), when 60-70% probability exists that container terminals handling only packaged TEU cargo (not bulk CDC) qualify as non-Risk Group A exempt facilities, and when TWIC reader equipment ordered June 2024 enables compliance within 42-63 days if required?**

4. **Under ship mortgage change-of-control provisions with Bank of America, Citibank, HSBC, and DVB Bank holding $2.8B in debt across 22 vessels, will PMSC obtain lender consent for private equity acquisition when 60% probability exists for covenant amendment approval (increasing debt/EBITDA threshold from 4.5x to 8-10x), when 15% probability requires full refinancing at $42M-$98M annual cost increase, and when immediate pre-signing lender engagement is critical to February-March 2026 closing timeline?**

5. **Under the ILWU Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement expiring July 1, 2027 (17 months post-closing), does PMSC face material strike risk when historical precedent shows 35% probability of work stoppage (2002 lockout, 2014-15 9-month slowdown), when 90-day strike would cause $474M revenue loss plus $241M customer defection to competing ports, and when private equity ownership during contract negotiations creates heightened union leverage concerns?**

6. **Under the Clean Air Act citizen suit provisions (42 U.S.C. § 7604), does PMSC face material exposure from Sierra Club litigation alleging violations at Los Angeles Terminal (Pier 300) when 65% settlement probability exists at $226M-$306M requiring 5-year phased capital investment (shore power, zero-emission equipment), when partial federal preemption defense covers 30-40% of vessel emissions claims, and when settlement exceeding $315M would render LA Terminal EBITDA-negative triggering potential lease termination?**

7. **Under port terminal lease change-of-control provisions at Oakland (Port of Oakland), Los Angeles (Port of LA), Seattle (Terminal 46), and Tacoma, does PMSC require landlord consent when 100% stock sale constitutes "deemed assignment" at all 4 terminals, when 70-80% approval probability exists but 60-120 day consent timeline creates closing delay, and when Oakland's 2028 lease renewal at $35M+ annual rent creates strategic walk-away optionality generating $63M-$83M EBITDA improvement?**

8. **Under the IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator regulation requiring corrective action plans for D-rated vessels (MARPOL Annex VI), does PMSC face compliance costs when 2 bulk carriers (M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge) rated D require investment decisions, when rotor sail technology installation costs $9M with 1.2-year payback through fuel savings versus $39.5M-$55.3M scrapping loss, and when CII E-rating in 2027 would trigger port access restrictions making vessels commercially unviable?**

9. **Under the Trans-Pacific Strategic Alliance (TPSA) vessel sharing agreement change-of-control termination provisions, do PMSC's alliance partners face termination decision when 30-35% probability exists if Global Logistics Partners' portfolio contains non-competitive assets, when probability increases to 75% if GLP owns Trans-Pacific competing carriers, when termination would cost PMSC $36.5M annually for 5 years ($145.7M DCF exposure) to replace lost slot exchange capacity through time charters, and when early pre-closing partner engagement reduces termination probability to 10-15%?**

10. **Under LHWCA Section 905(b)'s vessel negligence exception (33 U.S.C. § 905(b)), does the pending Martinez v. PMSC case (U.S. District Court, Central District of California, trial October 2025) create precedent risk when 70% plaintiff verdict probability exists at $2M-$5M judgment, when PMSC's dual capacity as terminal operator and vessel owner creates 285 annual LHWCA claims across 3,200 workers, when 5-10% conversion rate to Section 905(b) tort suits generates $28.5M-$57M annual fleet-wide exposure (14-29 cases), and when Maritime Employer's Liability insurance existence remains unverified creating potential coverage gap for uninsured $6M-$11M deductibles?**

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
All 10 Questions Presented reformatted from generic statute-question format to Under/Does/When structure incorporating 3-6 PMSC-specific transaction facts per question. Each question now cites specific statutory sections (not general chapters), names PMSC explicitly, includes quantified exposure ranges from section analyses, references key precedents (Hapag-Lloyd, 2002 ILWU lockout, Sierra Club CAA litigation), and identifies critical transaction-specific facts (12 FMC complaints with 8 settled, 2 vessels at 72.5-72.7% crew compliance, $2.8B mortgages across 4 lenders, 4 port terminals requiring consent, etc.). Questions remain answerable as Yes/No/Probably Yes/Probably No while providing rich factual context demonstrating thorough due diligence analysis.
