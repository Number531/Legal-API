# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Global Logistics Partners LLC Acquisition of Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (Project Neptune)
**Transaction Value**: $4.8 Billion
**Prepared for**: Global Logistics Partners LLC Board of Directors
**Date**: January 12, 2026

---

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION**: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Risk Rating**: HIGH

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

We recommend proceeding with the acquisition subject to three critical conditions: (1) obtaining ship mortgage lender consent with covenant amendments before signing, (2) extending the closing date to March-April 2026 to accommodate 60-120 day consent processes, and (3) securing $280M escrow with targeted R&W insurance for perpetual liabilities. The transaction presents manageable risks with $2.05B probability-weighted exposure against a $4.8B purchase price, though three deal-blocking scenarios require immediate mitigation.

### Rationale

The acquisition of PMSC provides strategic access to West Coast port infrastructure with 4 terminals, 22 vessels, and $3.2B annual revenue. The legal due diligence identified 18 HIGH severity findings across 10 domains, with aggregate probability-weighted exposure of $2.05B. However, after correlation adjustments eliminating double-counting, net exposure reduces to $1.99B. The largest exposures cluster in three categories: environmental/regulatory ($460M weighted), commercial contracts ($194M weighted), and labor relations ($166M weighted).

Two findings initially flagged as "deal-blocking" in the research plan have been invalidated through detailed legal analysis. Jones Act penalties were reduced from $39.6M to $310K annually (corrective hiring cost), and MTSA exposure was reduced from $2.25M-$4.5M to $105,850 (penalty cap correction). These corrections eliminate $41.5M-$43.7M of erroneous exposure.

The remaining risks are manageable through standard M&A protections: escrow, indemnification, insurance requirements, and closing conditions. The February 2026 target closing is not feasible due to 60-120 day consent requirements at four port terminals and ship mortgage lender negotiations.

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

1. **Ship Mortgage Lender Consent** - Pre-signing engagement with Bank of America, Citibank, HSBC, and DVB Bank required immediately; 60% approval probability with covenant amendments (increase debt/EBITDA from 4.5x to 8-10x) - See **Section IV.H**
2. **Timeline Extension** - Outside date must extend to March 15-April 1, 2026 to accommodate port consent processes (60-120 days); February closing creates 95% probability of delay - See **Section IV.G**
3. **MEL Insurance Verification** - Maritime Employer's Liability policy existence UNVERIFIED; if absent, $28.5M-$57M annual Section 905(b) exposure partially uninsured - See **Section IV.I**

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question (Abbreviated) | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|------------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Under the Shipping Act, do FMC D&D complaints create material liability? | **Probably No** | 8 of 12 complaints settled; remaining 4 likely settle at $1.5M-$2.2M aggregate, well below materiality threshold for $4.8B transaction | IV.A |
| 2 | Under the Jones Act, are PMSC vessels compliant with crew citizenship requirements? | **Probably No** | 2 vessels (Pacific Guardian, Pacific Shield) at 72.5-72.7% vs. 75% requirement; correctable within 90 days for $310K annually, NOT $39.6M originally estimated | IV.B |
| 3 | Under MTSA, is Seattle Terminal in violation of TWIC reader requirements? | **No** | Deadline is May 8, 2026 (116 days remain), NOT December 31, 2024; 60-70% probability non-Risk Group A classification eliminates mandate entirely | IV.D |
| 4 | Under ship mortgage agreements, will lenders consent to PE acquisition? | **Probably Yes** | 60% probability all lenders approve with covenant amendments; 15% probability full refinance required ($42M-$98M annual increase); requires immediate pre-signing engagement | IV.H |
| 5 | Under ILWU CBA, does 2027 expiration create strike risk? | **Yes** | 35% strike probability based on historical precedent (2002 lockout, 2014-15 slowdowns); $474M 90-day revenue loss + $241M customer defection if strike occurs | IV.E |
| 6 | Under Clean Air Act, does Sierra Club litigation create material exposure? | **Yes** | 65% settlement probability at $226M-$306M (5-year phased capital); partial preemption defense available for vessel emissions (30-40% of claims) | IV.F |
| 7 | Under port lease provisions, do change-of-control provisions require consent? | **Yes** | 100% stock sale constitutes "deemed assignment" at all 4 terminals; 70-80% approval probability but 60-120 day timeline creates closing delay | IV.G |
| 8 | Under IMO regulations, do CII D-rated vessels require capital investment? | **Yes** | 2 vessels (Sierra Nevada, Cascade Ridge) rated D; rotor sails $9M with 1.2-year payback economically superior to $39.5M-$55.3M scrapping loss | IV.F |
| 9 | Under VSA agreements, can alliance partners terminate upon PE acquisition? | **Probably Yes** | 30-35% termination probability if GLP portfolio non-competitive; increases to 75% if portfolio includes Trans-Pacific competitors | IV.J |
| 10 | Under Section 905(b), does Martinez litigation create precedent risk? | **Yes** | 70% plaintiff win probability at $2M-$5M verdict; fleet-wide exposure $28.5M-$57M annually (14-29 converted LHWCA claims per year) | IV.I |

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Labor Risk Cascade (ILWU-Covenant-VSA Interconnection)

The ILWU CBA expiration July 1, 2027 creates interconnected risks across multiple domains.

**Primary Finding**: 35% probability of 90-day strike causing $474M revenue loss plus $241M customer defection (see **Section IV.E**).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Ship Mortgage Covenants (Section IV.H)**: ILWU strike during 2027 reduces EBITDA below covenant thresholds, potentially triggering debt/EBITDA breach (currently 10.3x post-acquisition vs. 4.5x threshold); lenders may accelerate $2.8B debt
- **VSA Stability (Section IV.J)**: Strike-induced service disruptions may trigger VSA termination rights under force majeure or service quality provisions, converting 35% strike probability to 50%+ VSA termination risk
- **Port Lease Renewals (Section IV.G)**: Strike at Oakland during lease renewal negotiations weakens bargaining position; Port may impose onerous conditions or select alternative operator

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $715M gross ($474M strike + $241M defection) cascading to $1.2B if VSA termination follows

### B. Environmental Compliance Cascade (Sierra Club-Port-IMO)

The Sierra Club CAA litigation drives capital investment requirements intersecting with port lease and IMO mandates.

**Primary Finding**: 65% probability of $226M-$306M settlement requiring 5-year phased capital investment (see **Section IV.F**).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Port Lease Consent (Section IV.G)**: Ports may condition change-of-control consent on accelerated Sierra Club compliance timelines, increasing capital burden
- **LA Terminal Economics (Section IV.F)**: If settlement exceeds $300M, terminal EBITDA becomes negative, triggering lease termination option with $400M enterprise value reduction
- **IMO GHG Alignment (Section IV.F)**: Sierra Club shore power investments ($30M-$45M) partially overlap with IMO GHG Phase 1 requirements, creating $15M-$25M integration savings if coordinated

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $306M-$706M depending on settlement amount and terminal exit decision

### C. Financing Structure Cascade (Lender Consent-Covenant-Refinancing)

The acquisition financing creates debt/EBITDA ratio of 10.3x, materially breaching existing covenant of 4.5x.

**Primary Finding**: 60% probability lenders approve with covenant amendments; 15% probability full refinancing required at $42M-$98M annual increase (see **Section IV.H**).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **Timeline (All Sections)**: Lender negotiations require 60-90 days, making February 2026 closing infeasible
- **DVB Bank Jones Act Loans (Section IV.H)**: $550M DVB facility has additional U.S.-build requirements; non-compliance with Jones Act crew provisions (Section IV.B) could trigger cross-default
- **LHWCA Self-Insurance (Section IV.E)**: DOL may scrutinize PE ownership; if self-insurance revoked, $5M-$9M annual premium increases, further pressuring EBITDA and covenant compliance

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $584M NPV (10.3x leverage with $29.36M annual debt service increase + $8.3M-$11M one-time refinancing costs)

### D. Maritime Liability Cascade (Section 905(b)-Insurance-LHWCA)

Fleet-wide Section 905(b) exposure of $28.5M-$57M annually creates perpetual liability requiring insurance verification.

**Primary Finding**: 285 annual LHWCA claims with 5-10% conversion rate generates 14-29 tort suits annually at $2M average verdict (see **Section IV.I**).

**Cross-Domain Impacts**:
- **MEL Coverage Gap (Section IV.I)**: If no MEL policy exists, $7M-$14.5M annual P&I deductibles are UNINSURED; Martinez verdict $2M-$5M may be fully uninsured
- **LHWCA Reserve Adequacy (Section IV.E)**: $180M actuarial reserve may require 15% top-up ($27M) under PE ownership scrutiny
- **Premium Increases (Section IV.I)**: Post-acquisition insurance premiums expected to increase $3M-$5M annually due to PE ownership risk profile

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $534M NPV (perpetual) plus $27M one-time reserve top-up

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Escrow Amount | $350M | $280M | $220M | II |
| Escrow Term | 48 months | 36 months | 24 months | II |
| Sierra Club Indemnity | Uncapped | $306M cap | $200M cap | IV.F |
| ILWU Strike Indemnity | 18-month survival | 12-month survival | CBA expiration survival | IV.E |
| MEL Insurance | Closing condition | Pre-closing verification | Rep & warranty | IV.I |
| Ship Mortgage Consent | Pre-signing | Pre-closing | Financing condition | IV.H |
| Purchase Price Reduction | $500M | $350M | $200M | II |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **Assumption Corrections**: Research plan overstated Jones Act penalties by $39.3M and MTSA exposure by $2.1M-$4.4M; sellers may have relied on inflated figures
2. **Oakland Walk-Away Value**: Walk-away generates +$63M-$83M EBITDA improvement vs. accepting $42M rent; not a liability but optionality
3. **IMO GHG Positive NPV**: $57M-$85M capital investment generates $48M-$96M annual fuel savings with 4-12 month payback; value accretive, not liability

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| # | Expected Seller Argument | Likelihood | Our Counter |
|---|--------------------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | "Jones Act risk is $39.6M per voyage" | HIGH | Invalidated: crew citizenship triggers $10K-$50K penalties, NOT merchandise forfeiture |
| 2 | "MTSA is already in violation" | MEDIUM | Invalidated: deadline May 8, 2026 (116 days remain); no current violation |
| 3 | "Sierra Club will settle for <$150M" | MEDIUM | CAA precedent (NRDC v. LA, Sierra Club v. Oakland) shows $65M-$90M capital mandates for smaller facilities |
| 4 | "$280M escrow exceeds market standard" | HIGH | 13.7% coverage ratio within standard 10-20% range for PE maritime acquisitions |

## VI. TIMELINE & CRITICAL PATH

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Risk Level | Section |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|---------|
| Ship Mortgage Lender Engagement | January 17, 2026 | None | CRITICAL | IV.H |
| Port Consent Applications Filed | January 20, 2026 | FSP amendments submitted | HIGH | IV.G |
| HSR Filing Status Verified | January 15, 2026 | None | CRITICAL | N/A |
| MEL Policy Verification | January 20, 2026 | Data room access | CRITICAL | IV.I |
| Jones Act Crew Hiring Initiated | January 25, 2026 | 90-day compliance window | MEDIUM | IV.B |
| Seattle TWIC Risk Group Confirmation | February 15, 2026 | USCG COTP response | LOW | IV.D |
| Lender Consent Obtained | March 1, 2026 | Covenant amendments | HIGH | IV.H |
| Port Consents Obtained | March 15-April 1, 2026 | Commission approval | HIGH | IV.G |
| **Revised Closing Target** | **March 15-April 1, 2026** | All conditions | | |

### Critical Path Risks

- **Lender Consent (15% failure probability)**: If all lenders refuse consent, transaction fails or requires $800M+ bridge facility
- **Port Consent (5-10% denial probability)**: Denial at any terminal requires renegotiation or transaction restructuring
- **Timeline Compression**: February 2026 closing has 95% probability of delay; outside date extension mandatory

## VIII. DECISION REQUIRED

```
DECISION REQUIRED: Approval to proceed with acquisition on amended terms
                   by Board of Directors by January 20, 2026.

OPTIONS:

Option A: PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS (RECOMMENDED)
- Conditions: (1) Lender pre-signing engagement, (2) Timeline extension to March-April 2026,
              (3) $280M escrow with staggered 3-year release, (4) MEL verification/procurement
- Risk: $2.05B weighted exposure manageable with standard M&A protections
- Benefit: Strategic West Coast port infrastructure, $3.2B revenue platform
- Status: RECOMMENDED

Option B: PROCEED WITH ENHANCED PROTECTIONS
- Conditions: All Option A conditions PLUS (1) $350M escrow, (2) R&W insurance $500M limit,
              (3) Sierra Club uncapped indemnity, (4) ILWU strike MAC clause
- Risk: Seller may reject enhanced terms; 30% probability of failed negotiation
- Benefit: Comprehensive downside protection
- Status: ACCEPTABLE IF SELLER AGREES

Option C: DO NOT PROCEED
- Conditions: None
- Risk: Loss of strategic opportunity; potential competing bidder
- Benefit: Avoid $2.05B exposure; preserve capital for alternative deployment
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED unless lender consent fails

RECOMMENDED: Option A

Rationale: Transaction risk profile is manageable with $280M escrow covering 13.7% of
weighted exposure (standard range 10-20%). Three invalidated assumptions reduce actual
exposure by $41.5M-$43.7M versus research plan estimates. Critical timeline and consent
conditions are procedural, not substantive obstacles.
