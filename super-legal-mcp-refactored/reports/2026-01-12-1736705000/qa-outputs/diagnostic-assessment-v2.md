## Red Flag Deductions (-4.5%)

### RF-001: Missing Antitrust/HSR Section (-3%)
**Evidence**: Research plan specified 10 sections including HSR/Antitrust. Final document has 10 sections but IV.D is MTSA, not Antitrust. Timeline references "HSR Filing Status Verified" but no substantive analysis.

**Impact**: Potential deal-blocking regulatory approval missing. $4.8B transaction requires HSR analysis: filing thresholds, waiting periods, Second Request probability, competitive overlap.

**Remediation**: Create Section IV.K: Antitrust and HSR Compliance (minimum 3,000 words, CREAC structure).

### RF-002: Unverified Citations (-1%)
**Evidence**: GREP found 100 instances of [INFERRED:] or [PENDING VERIFICATION] tags.

**Impact**: Undermines credibility. Partner would require verification before client delivery.

**Remediation**: Verify all citations via public databases or mark [HYPOTHETICAL] with disclaimer.

### RF-003: Non-Bluebook Format (-0.5%)
**Evidence**: Citations use inline bracketed format "[VERIFIED:uscode.house.gov]" instead of superscript footnotes.

**Impact**: Requires complete reformatting for client delivery.

**Remediation**: Convert to Bluebook superscript format with footnotes section.
