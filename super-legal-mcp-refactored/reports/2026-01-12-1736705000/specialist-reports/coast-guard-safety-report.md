## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report analyzes U.S. Coast Guard vessel safety compliance for Pacific Maritime Services Corporation's (PMSC) 22-vessel fleet (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers) in connection with the $4.8B acquisition by Global Logistics Partners LLC. The analysis focuses on Certificate of Inspection (COI) requirements under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 33 and 46 CFR Subchapter I, drydocking compliance under 46 CFR § 91.40-3, ballast water management system (BWMS) compliance under 33 CFR Part 151 Subpart D, Port State Control (PSC) detention risk, and civil penalty exposure under 46 U.S.C. § 2110.

### Key Findings Summary

**1. M/V Pacific Titan Hull Corrosion Incident (CRITICAL ISSUE #3) - RESOLVED**

The M/V Pacific Titan (22,000 TEU ULCV, built 2019) experienced hull corrosion in cargo hold ballast tanks during November 2024 drydocking/special survey at Keppel Shipyard, Singapore. Hull thickness gauging revealed 15 shell plates corroded from 8mm original thickness to 6mm actual (vs. 7mm minimum required per 46 CFR and ABS Rules), representing 25% thickness loss over approximately 5 years of service.

**Root Cause:** Ballast water management system (BWMS) failure led to improper ballast water treatment, creating highly corrosive environment in ballast tanks. Normal corrosion rate for properly treated ballast water is 0.1-0.2mm/year; M/V Pacific Titan experienced accelerated 0.4mm/year rate (2× normal).

**Coast Guard Response:** Certificate of Inspection (COI) suspended May 15, 2024 (NOTE: Timeline inconsistency with November 2024 drydocking requires clarification - see Section V.B.1) under 46 CFR § 31.10-21 authority for failure to maintain structural requirements. Following emergency repairs, Coast Guard reinstated COI on June 20, 2024 with conditional monitoring requirements.

**Financial Impact:**
- **Total Repair Costs:** $18.7M
  - Hull plate replacement: $4.2M (15 shell plates replaced)
  - BWMS replacement: $2.8M (new GEA Westfalia system installed)
  - Drydock extension: $2.38M (28-day stay vs. 14-day planned)
  - Lost revenue: $9.3M (1 missed trans-Pacific voyage)
- **Insurance Recovery:** $12.05M
  - Hull & machinery coverage: $2.2M (after $2M deductible)
  - Loss of hire: $4.65M (14 days covered after 14-day waiting period)
  - **Coverage Gap:** $800K BWMS replacement cost disputed by insurers (classified as "maintenance" rather than "casualty")
- **Net Cost to PMSC:** $6.65M absorbed in FY2024

**Conditional COI Requirements:**
1. **Enhanced BWMS Maintenance:** Quarterly inspections (vs. annual standard) including UV lamp replacement, filter replacement, chemical dosing calibration, discharge water sampling for BWDS compliance verification
   - **Cost Impact:** $150K-$250K annually per vessel (4 inspections × $40K-$60K each)
   - **Fleet-Wide Impact:** If extended to all 22 vessels (recommended best practice), annual BWMS costs increase from $550K-$1.1M baseline to $3.3M-$5.5M enhanced program (+$2.2M-$4.4M incremental)
   - **Transaction Data:** Research plan references "$150K-$250K annually fleet-wide" which appears to represent incremental cost amortized across fleet (~$200K per vessel)

2. **Accelerated Drydocking:** Next drydock mandated September 2026 (2.0 years from June 2024 reinstatement vs. standard 2.5-year interval) for comprehensive ballast tank re-inspection and hull thickness re-gauging

3. **Quarterly Reporting:** BWMS inspection results, BWDS test results, and ballast tank condition reports submitted to Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI)

**Civil Penalty Assessment:** $0 - Coast Guard exercised enforcement discretion and DID NOT assess civil penalties (potential exposure: $15K-$165K under 46 U.S.C. § 3318) because:
- Deficiency discovered during proactive self-inspection (ABS special survey) rather than Coast Guard enforcement action
- Immediate corrective action taken ($18.7M emergency repairs)
- No casualties, injuries, or pollution resulted
- PMSC has favorable compliance history (2.5% PSC detention rate vs. ~5% industry average)
- Conditional COI with enhanced monitoring imposed as alternative enforcement mechanism

**Residual Risk:** **MEDIUM** - 15-25% probability that September 2026 drydock will reveal recurring ballast tank corrosion (exposure: $5M-$15M for additional repairs, drydock extension, lost revenue if corrosion mechanism not fully addressed by BWMS replacement and enhanced maintenance program).

**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUE #3 is **RESOLVED** with acceptable residual risk. M/V Pacific Titan has valid conditional COI, all repairs completed, enhanced monitoring in place, and no ongoing Coast Guard enforcement actions.

**2. Fleet-Wide Drydocking Compliance and Budget**

All 22 PMSC vessels are subject to mandatory 2.5-year drydocking intervals under 46 CFR § 91.40-3 Table 91.40-3(a) for "Ships" operating in salt water service. The regulation requires "two examinations within any five year period" with "no more than three years elapsing between any two examinations."

**Annual Drydocking Burden:**
- **Vessels Requiring Drydock:** 22 vessels ÷ 2.5 years = **8.8 vessels per year**
- **FY2024:** 9 vessels (4 ULCV, 3 Post-Panamax, 1 Panamax, 1 Bulk) = $24.75M budget
- **FY2025:** 8 vessels (0 ULCV, 3 Post-Panamax, 3 Panamax, 2 Bulk) = $19.58M budget
- **FY2026:** 9 vessels (including M/V Pacific Titan accelerated drydock) = $27.83M budget
- **Annual Average:** $24.31M (aligns with research plan's $25M-$40M projection - lower end indicates well-maintained fleet)

**Drydocking Costs by Vessel Class (2024-2025 Industry Estimates):**

| Vessel Class | Count | Age Range | Typical Drydock Cost | Annual Fleet Cost |
|--------------|-------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **ULCV** (18,000-24,000 TEU) | 4 | 4-7 years | $2.5M-$4.5M | $4M-$6M (1-2 vessels/year) |
| **Post-Panamax** (8,000-14,000 TEU) | 8 | 8-16 years | $1.8M-$3.2M | $5.4M-$9.6M (3 vessels/year) |
| **Panamax** (4,000-7,000 TEU) | 6 | 12-19 years | $1.5M-$2.8M | $3M-$5.6M (2 vessels/year) |
| **Handymax Bulk** (50-60K DWT) | 2 | 18-20 years | $1.2M-$2.5M | $1.2M-$2.5M (0.8 vessels/year) |
| **Supramax Bulk** (50-60K DWT) | 2 | 12-14 years | $1.0M-$2.0M | $0.8M-$1.6M (0.8 vessels/year) |
| **TOTAL FLEET** | **22** | **4-20 years** | — | **$19.6M-$27.8M/year** |

**Cost Drivers Escalating with Vessel Age:**
- **Vessels Age 0-9 Years (8 vessels, 36% of fleet):** Minimal steel work; primary costs are anti-fouling coating ($500K-$800K), BWMS maintenance ($150K-$250K), mandatory equipment certifications
- **Vessels Age 10-14 Years (7 vessels, 32% of fleet):** Moderate steel work (selective plate renewals in high-stress areas), propulsion system overhauls, cargo equipment repairs
- **Vessels Age 15+ Years (7 vessels, 32% of fleet):** **HIGH COST** - Enhanced Survey Programme (ESP) requirements trigger extensive ballast tank coating renewals, cargo hold steel renewals, main engine overhauls; bulk carriers M/V Sierra Nevada (age 20) and M/V Cascade Ridge (age 18) present highest risk ($2.5M-$3.5M drydock costs vs. $1.5M-$2.0M standard)

**Underwater Survey Cost-Savings Opportunity:**

46 CFR § 91.40-3(c) permits vessels <15 years old with effective hull protection systems to substitute underwater surveys (divers/ROV inspection, hull cleaning, no drydock facility) for alternate drydockings, subject to Coast Guard OCMI approval.

**PMSC Fleet Eligibility:**
- **Eligible Vessels (age <15 years):** 15 vessels
  - 4 ULCVs (age 4-7): ELIGIBLE
  - 6 Post-Panamax (age 8-14): ELIGIBLE
  - 3 Panamax (age 12-14): ELIGIBLE
  - 2 Supramax bulk carriers (age 12-14): ELIGIBLE
- **Require Case-by-Case Approval (age 15+):** 7 vessels
  - 2 Post-Panamax (age 15-16)
  - 3 Panamax (age 15-19)
  - 2 Handymax bulk carriers (age 18-20)

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- **Underwater Survey Cost:** $150K-$300K per vessel
- **Drydock Cost:** $1.5M-$4.5M per vessel
- **Potential Savings:** $1.2M-$4.2M per vessel per alternate drydock avoided
- **Annual Fleet Savings:** If 4-5 vessels per year utilize underwater survey instead of full drydock = **$5M-$15M annually**

**Limitation:** M/V Pacific Titan's conditional COI likely precludes underwater survey approval for at least September 2026 drydock cycle due to Coast Guard requirement for physical drydocking to verify no recurrence of ballast tank corrosion.

**High-Risk Scenario:** If additional vessels experience BWMS-induced corrosion similar to M/V Pacific Titan, annual drydocking costs could escalate to $35M-$45M (upper end of research plan projection) due to emergency repairs, drydock extensions, and lost revenue from vessel detentions.

**3. Ballast Water Management System (BWMS) Compliance**

All 22 PMSC vessels are compliant with 33 CFR Part 151 Subpart D ballast water discharge requirements and met the **September 8, 2024 IMO D-2 standard compliance deadline**. Each vessel is equipped with Coast Guard-approved BWMS (per 46 CFR Part 162 type approval) using UV treatment, electrolysis, or chemical treatment technologies from vendors including GEA Westfalia, Alfa Laval PureBallast, Hyde Marine BALPURE, and other type-approved systems.

**Ballast Water Discharge Standard (BWDS) - 33 CFR § 151.2030:**

Vessels must meet the following biological limits when discharging ballast water into U.S. waters:
- **Organisms ≥50 micrometers:** <10 viable organisms per cubic meter
- **Organisms 10-49 micrometers:** <10 viable organisms per milliliter
- **Indicator Microbes:**
  - Toxicogenic *Vibrio cholerae*: <1 cfu per 100 mL
  - *Escherichia coli*: <250 cfu per 100 mL
  - Intestinal enterococci: <100 cfu per 100 mL

**Commissioning Testing Completed:** All PMSC vessels completed initial commissioning testing upon BWMS installation to validate mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological performance per IMO BWM Convention and Coast Guard requirements. However, **neither IMO nor Coast Guard currently require periodic re-testing** after commissioning to verify ongoing BWDS compliance, creating compliance risk.

**M/V Pacific Titan BWMS Failure - Causation Analysis:**

The BWMS failure on M/V Pacific Titan (specific failure mode not disclosed - likely UV lamp failure, chemical dosing malfunction, or filtration bypass) created a perfect storm for accelerated corrosion:

1. **Untreated Seawater:** BWMS failed to properly treat ballast water, allowing microbial organisms and dissolved oxygen to remain in ballast tanks
2. **Residual Treatment Chemicals:** Partially functioning BWMS introduced oxidants (from electrolysis) or UV byproducts without completing biological treatment
3. **Synergistic Corrosion:** Combination of untreated seawater + residual treatment chemicals created highly corrosive environment (more corrosive than either untreated seawater OR properly treated ballast water alone)
4. **Microbial-Induced Corrosion (MIC):** Biological organisms (sulfate-reducing bacteria, iron-oxidizing bacteria) colonized ballast tank surfaces, producing acidic byproducts that accelerated localized pitting corrosion
5. **5-Year Accumulation:** Corrosion progressed undetected from 2019 (vessel commissioning) to November 2024 (special survey hull thickness gauging), resulting in 2mm thickness loss (8mm → 6mm)

**Root Cause - Inadequate BWMS Maintenance:**

Based on repair scope and conditional COI requirements, Coast Guard/ABS investigation likely determined:
1. **Failure to replace UV lamps** per manufacturer schedule (typical 8,000-14,000 operating hours, requiring replacement every 12-24 months depending on usage)
2. **Lack of BWMS performance monitoring** - No periodic discharge water sampling to verify BWDS compliance (not required by regulation, but industry best practice)
3. **Delayed detection** - Ballast tank corrosion only detected during mandatory 5-year special survey hull thickness gauging; no interim ballast tank internal inspections conducted

**Fleet-Wide BWMS Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Potential Impact | Mitigation Priority |
|-------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Similar BWMS failures in other vessels** (if fleet-wide maintenance deficiency) | **10-15%** | $10M-$30M (2-3 vessels require hull plate replacement) | **URGENT** - Fleet-wide BWMS audit within 30 days |
| **BWMS approaching end of service life** (systems installed 2010-2015, now 10-15 years old) | **20-30%** | $2.8M × [vessels requiring BWMS replacement] = $5.6M-$8.4M for 2-3 vessels | **HIGH** - Identify BWMS age profile, budget proactive replacements FY2025-2026 |
| **PSC BWMS compliance inspection failure** (discharge record book errors, inoperative BWMS components) | **15-20%** | $14,988-$29,980 civil penalty per vessel + PSC detention ($150K-$500K lost revenue for 2-5 day detention) | **MEDIUM** - Pre-arrival PSC coordination for U.S. port calls, discharge record book audit |

**Enhanced BWMS Maintenance Program (Conditional COI Requirement):**

Coast Guard imposed the following BWMS maintenance requirements on M/V Pacific Titan as condition of COI reinstatement; **voluntary adoption fleet-wide is strongly recommended** to prevent recurring incidents:

**Standard BWMS Maintenance (Pre-Incident):**
- **Frequency:** Annual inspection
- **Scope:** UV lamp output testing, filter cleaning, chemical tank level checks
- **Cost:** $25K-$50K per vessel annually
- **Fleet-Wide Cost:** $550K-$1.1M annually (22 vessels)

**Enhanced BWMS Maintenance (Post-Incident Requirement):**
- **Frequency:** Quarterly inspections (every 3 months)
- **Scope:**
  - **UV Lamp Replacement:** Replace UV lamps even if within rated service life (proactive replacement vs. run-to-failure)
  - **Filter Replacement:** Complete filter cartridge replacement (vs. cleaning/backwashing)
  - **Chemical Dosing Calibration:** Recalibrate chemical dosing systems, verify chemical concentrations
  - **Discharge Water Sampling:** Collect ballast water discharge samples, test for BWDS compliance (organism counts, indicator microbes), test for corrosivity (pH, dissolved oxygen, chloride content)
  - **Ballast Tank Internal Inspection:** Annual ballast tank entry inspection (vs. standard drydock interval inspection every 2.5-5 years)
- **Cost:** $150K-$250K annually per vessel (4 inspections × $40K-$60K each)
- **Fleet-Wide Cost (if adopted voluntarily):** $3.3M-$5.5M annually (22 vessels)
- **Incremental Cost:** +$2.2M-$4.4M above baseline annual BWMS maintenance

**Transaction Impact:** Research plan references "$150K-$250K annually fleet-wide" as incremental cost, which equates to approximately $200K per vessel if amortized across all 22 vessels. This suggests either: (1) Enhanced maintenance required only for M/V Pacific Titan with proportional allocation methodology, or (2) Voluntary fleet-wide adoption with cost efficiencies from bulk service contracts.

**4. Port State Control (PSC) Performance and Detention Risk**

**PMSC Fleet PSC Record:**
- **Fleet Detention Rate:** 2.5% (transaction data)
- **U.S. Coast Guard Overall Average:** 0.94% (FY2024, 82 detentions out of 8,710 exams)
- **Industry Average (Container/Bulk Carriers):** ~5% (estimated based on global PSC statistics)

**Assessment:** PMSC's 2.5% detention rate is **2.5× higher than U.S. overall average** but **50% better than industry average** for cargo vessels. This indicates **above-average fleet maintenance and compliance**, with detentions typically involving minor, correctable deficiencies (expired lifesaving equipment, fire safety equipment, documentation errors) rather than serious structural or operational deficiencies.

**Interpretation:** 2.5% detention rate suggests approximately **1 vessel detention every 2 years** across the 22-vessel fleet. Detentions are typically resolved within 24-72 hours by correcting deficiencies and obtaining Coast Guard re-inspection clearance.

**U.S. Coast Guard PSC FY2024 Statistics:**

- **Total Port Calls:** 84,034 port calls by 11,273 vessels from 79 flag states
- **Examination Rate:** 10.4% (8,710 SOLAS safety exams conducted)
- **Detention Ratio:** 0.94% (down from 1.22% in FY2023), three-year rolling average 1.01%

**Top Deficiency Categories (FY2024):**
1. **Fire Safety Deficiencies:** Leading category for 4th consecutive year
   - Oil accumulation in engine room: 18 deficiencies (single most common deficiency)
2. **Safety Management System (SMS) Deficiencies:** 65 total (down from 85 in FY2023)
   - Maintenance of ship and equipment: Leading SMS subcategory
3. **Structural Deficiencies:** Included in detention causes but not separately quantified in public summaries

**PMSC Fleet Deficiencies (FY2024):** 3 vessels received COI deficiencies (not PSC detentions, but Coast Guard domestic inspections):
1. **M/V Pacific Atlas:** Expired liferaft (exceeds 12-month servicing interval per 46 CFR § 199.190) - **Corrected within 30 days, no penalty**
2. **M/V Sierra Nevada:** Missing immersion suit (46 CFR § 199.70(b)(2)) - **Corrected within 30 days, no penalty**
3. **M/V Pacific Endeavor:** Inoperative lifeboat davit hydraulic system (46 CFR § 199.160) - **Corrected within 30 days, no penalty**

**Coast Guard Targeting Matrix (Priority Boarding Determination):**

The Coast Guard assigns boarding priority scores based on risk factors; vessels scoring **17+ points receive priority boarding**:

| Factor | Points | PMSC Fleet Assessment |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **Flag State** (detention ratio ≥2× average) | +7 | Unknown - depends on U.S. vs. foreign flag mix (Jones Act vessels vs. flags of convenience) |
| **Recognized Organization** (classification society detention ratio) | Variable | **ABS = LOW RISK** (top-tier classification society with industry-low detention ratio) |
| **Ship Type** (general cargo, Ro-Ro, vehicle carriers) | +4 | Container ships/bulk carriers likely +4 points (moderate risk vessel types) |
| **Ship Age** | 0-4 yrs: -3<br>5-9 yrs: 0<br>10-14 yrs: +3<br>15-24 yrs: +5<br>25+ yrs: +7 | 4 ULCVs (4-7 yrs): 0 points<br>14 vessels (8-16 yrs): +3 points<br>4 vessels (18-20 yrs): +5 points |
| **Ship Management** (company detention history) | Variable | Depends on PMSC's PSC database record across all U.S. ports over past 3 years |

**M/V Pacific Titan Heightened PSC Risk:**

Following COI suspension/reinstatement, M/V Pacific Titan is at **significantly elevated PSC detention risk** (15-25% probability on next U.S. port call vs. 2.5% fleet average) due to:

1. **Coast Guard Database Flagging:** PSC officers have access to vessel COI history including suspensions; M/V Pacific Titan flagged for enhanced inspection
2. **Targeted Structural Inspection:** PSC exam likely to include below-deck inspection of ballast tanks, cargo holds, engine room (vs. standard topside-only exam)
3. **BWMS Compliance Verification:** PSC will review:
   - Quarterly BWMS inspection reports required by conditional COI
   - Ballast water discharge record book for BWDS compliance entries
   - BWMS operational status (visual inspection of UV lamps, filters, chemical tanks)
   - BWMS type approval certificate and commissioning test reports
4. **Documentation Scrutiny:** Any missing or incomplete conditional COI documentation may result in detention pending corrective action

**Detention Cost Impact:**
- **Vessel Detention Duration:** 2-5 days (typical for documentation/equipment deficiencies requiring contractor services)
- **Lost Revenue:** $50K-$100K per day (container ship daily charter rate + cargo delay penalties)
- **Total Detention Cost:** $150K-$500K per incident

**Mitigation Strategy - M/V Pacific Titan:**
1. **Pre-Arrival Notification:** Submit notice to Coast Guard Sector 72 hours before arrival with summary of repairs, conditional COI status, enhanced maintenance program
2. **Documentation Package:** Prepare comprehensive briefing package including:
   - Current COI with conditional requirements listed
   - Hull plate replacement certificates (Keppel Shipyard work completion, ABS survey approval)
   - Quarterly BWMS inspection reports (Q3 2024, Q4 2024, Q1 2025)
   - BWMS performance test results (discharge water BWDS compliance verification)
   - Ballast tank internal inspection photos/reports
3. **Voluntary PSC Pre-Coordination:** Request voluntary meeting with Coast Guard PSC Coordinator before vessel arrival to review documentation, address questions proactively
4. **Crew Briefing:** Ensure Master, Chief Engineer, and Chief Officer thoroughly familiar with conditional COI requirements and able to explain repairs/enhanced maintenance to PSC officers

---

**5. Civil Penalty Exposure and Enforcement Risk**

**M/V Pacific Titan Incident - No Penalty Assessed:**

Despite potential civil penalty exposure of $15K-$165K under 46 U.S.C. § 3318 for operating vessel with structural deficiency, the Coast Guard assessed **$0 penalty**. This is consistent with Coast Guard enforcement policy documented in civil penalty case guides and reflects enforcement discretion based on:

1. **Proactive Self-Discovery:** Deficiency discovered during scheduled ABS special survey (proactive compliance activity) rather than Coast Guard enforcement action (PSC detention, marine casualty investigation)
2. **Immediate Corrective Action:** $18.7M emergency repairs undertaken immediately upon discovery; vessel did not attempt to return to service with deficiency
3. **No Harm:** No casualties, injuries, or pollution resulted from structural deficiency
4. **Good Compliance History:** PMSC's 2.5% PSC detention rate (better than industry average), minimal COI deficiency history (3 minor deficiencies in FY2024, all corrected promptly)
5. **Conditional COI as Alternative Enforcement:** Coast Guard imposed enhanced BWMS maintenance and accelerated drydocking as conditions of COI reinstatement, providing ongoing oversight mechanism without need for civil penalty

**Coast Guard Civil Penalty Framework (2025 Inflation-Adjusted Amounts):**

Per 33 CFR § 27.3, effective December 29, 2025 for violations occurring after November 2, 2015:

| Violation Type | Statutory Authority | Penalty Amount | PMSC Fleet Applicability |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Operating vessel with structural deficiency** | 46 U.S.C. § 3318 | **$29,980** per violation<br>(vessels ≥1,600 GT) | All 22 PMSC vessels >1,600 GT; M/V Pacific Titan potential exposure $29,980 × [voyages while deficient] = $0-$150K (waived) |
| **Operating without valid COI or failure to comply with COI conditions** | 46 U.S.C. § 3318 | **$14,988** per violation | M/V Pacific Titan conditional COI compliance; fleet-wide COI validity |
| **Failure to notify Coast Guard of drydocking** | 46 U.S.C. § 3318 | **$2,998** per violation | Required notification per 46 CFR § 91.40-5 when drydock occurs |
| **Vessel inspection/examination fees unpaid** | 46 U.S.C. § 2110(e) | **$11,823** per violation | COI inspection fees, drydock exam fees |

**Fleet-Wide Civil Penalty Risk Assessment (FY2025-2026):**

| Risk Scenario | Probability | Penalty Exposure | Weighted Expected Value |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **M/V Pacific Titan conditional COI violation** (failure to submit quarterly BWMS reports, missed accelerated September 2026 drydock deadline) | **5-10%** | $29,980 (failure to comply with COI conditions) + potential COI suspension | $2,249 (7.5% × $29,980) |
| **Fleet-wide BWMS non-compliance** discovered during PSC exam (inoperative BWMS, discharge record book violations) | **10-15%** | $14,988-$29,980 per vessel depending on severity × 2 vessels | $3,747 (12.5% × $14,988 × 2) |
| **Drydock interval violation** (vessel operated beyond 3-year maximum interval due to shipyard capacity constraints) | **<2%** | $29,980 + vessel detention + expedited drydock costs | $600 (2% × $29,980) |
| **Repeat lifesaving equipment deficiency** (expired liferaft, missing immersion suits not corrected within timeline) | **15-20%** | $14,988 per vessel × 2 vessels | $5,246 (17.5% × $14,988 × 2) |
| **TOTAL EXPECTED ANNUAL PENALTY EXPOSURE** | — | — | **$11,842** |

**Assessment:** $11,842 annual expected civil penalty exposure represents **de minimis risk** for a company with estimated $3.2B annual revenue (0.0004% of revenue). This indicates **strong compliance culture** and low likelihood of Coast Guard enforcement actions.

**Coast Guard Enforcement Statistics (CY2023):**

Per ALCOAST 179/25 (April 2025), Coast Guard Hearing Office adjudicated civil penalties arising from:
- 5,000+ commercial fishing vessel examinations
- 46,000 recreational vessel boardings
- 10,000 facility inspections
- 3,000 marine casualty investigations
- 2,000 pollution investigations

Typical COI penalty cases involve:
- **High Priority:** Operating passenger vessels without valid COI (public safety risk)
- **Moderate Priority:** Operating cargo vessels overloaded beyond COI limits, structural deficiencies discovered during PSC exam where vessel operator was negligent, failure to correct COI deficiencies within prescribed timeline
- **Low Priority:** Minor equipment deficiencies corrected promptly (consistent with PMSC's FY2024 experience - 3 deficiencies, 0 penalties)

**TOTAL ANNUAL COAST GUARD COMPLIANCE COSTS (FY2025-2026 Projected):**

| Category | Gross Exposure | Net Probability-Weighted |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Baseline Drydocking (regulatory requirement)** | $24.31M | $24.31M (100% certain) |
| **Enhanced BWMS Maintenance (conditional COI requirement)** | $150K-$250K | $200K (100% certain) |

| **TOTAL ANNUAL COMPLIANCE COSTS** | **$35.05M-$82.15M** | **$35.46M** |

**Transaction Impact Analysis:**

- **$35.46M annual compliance costs** (weighted estimate) = **0.74% of $4.8B deal value annually**
- **$35.46M** = **1.11% of $3.2B estimated annual revenue**
- **Context:** Typical maritime operating costs (crew wages, fuel, insurance, maintenance, port fees, administration) = 60-70% of revenue
- **Coast Guard Compliance as % of Total Operating Costs:** $35.46M ÷ ($3.2B × 65% operating cost ratio) = **1.7% of total operating costs**

**Assessment:** Coast Guard compliance costs are **predictable, budgeted, and within industry norms** for a 22-vessel container/bulk carrier fleet. The $35.46M annual cost aligns with PMSC's historical $25M-$40M drydocking budget (lower end), indicating well-maintained fleet with limited exceptional issues beyond M/V Pacific Titan incident.

**Deal-Breaking Risk:** **LOW** - Coast Guard compliance does not present material transaction risk. M/V Pacific Titan incident has been resolved, conditional COI requirements are manageable, and residual risks (recurring corrosion, fleet-wide BWMS failures) have low-to-moderate probability with quantifiable mitigation strategies.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Certificate of Inspection (COI) Regulatory Framework

#### 1. Statutory Foundation: 46 U.S.C. Chapter 33

The U.S. Coast Guard's vessel inspection and certification authority derives from **46 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Inspection and Certificates)**, which consolidates laws governing vessel inspection that have developed over 140+ years.¹ Chapter 33 establishes:

- **Vessels Subject to Inspection** (46 U.S.C. § 3301): All 22 PMSC vessels (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers) fall within categories requiring Coast Guard inspection and certification²
- **Certificate of Inspection Requirements** (46 U.S.C. § 3302): Mandates COI issuance, display, compliance, and expiration requirements³
- **Classification Societies** (46 U.S.C. § 3316): Authorizes delegation of inspection authority to recognized organizations like American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)⁴

**Key Provision - 46 U.S.C. § 3316 Classification Societies:**

46 U.S.C. § 3316 establishes the relationship between classification societies (such as ABS) and the Federal Government for promoting maritime safety.⁵ The statute provides:

> "In the inspection of hulls, boilers, and machinery, the current standards established by the American Bureau of Shipping and designated Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels respecting material and construction of hulls, boilers, and machinery, except as otherwise provided for by law and regulations in this chapter, **shall be accepted as standard by the Coast Guard**."⁶

> "The approved plans and certificate of the American Bureau of Shipping, or other recognized classification society for classed vessels, **may be accepted by the Coast Guard as evidence of the structural efficiency of the hull** and reliability of machinery of vessels."⁷

**Application to M/V Pacific Titan Incident:** The M/V Pacific Titan hull corrosion incident (November 2024) directly implicates this provision. As an ABS-classed vessel, the Coast Guard relied on ABS special survey findings (15 shell plates corroded from 8mm to 6mm vs. 7mm minimum) to suspend the COI. ABS hull thickness gauging during special survey triggered Coast Guard enforcement action.

#### 2. Regulatory Implementation: 46 CFR Subchapter I

Coast Guard regulations implementing Chapter 33 are found in **46 CFR Subchapter I - Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels**.⁸ All 22 PMSC vessels fall under Subchapter I jurisdiction.

**46 CFR Part 31 - Inspection and Certification:**⁹

- **§ 31.10-3 - Certificate of Inspection:** Every cargo vessel must have a valid COI issued by the Coast Guard. The COI specifies authorized routes, cargo limitations, manning requirements, lifesaving equipment, and structural compliance.¹⁰

- **§ 31.10-5 - Application for Inspection:** Vessel owners must apply for initial inspection, annual inspection, periodic drydock inspection, and renewal inspection at COI expiration (typically 5 years).¹¹

- **§ 31.10-21 - Conditions of Inspection:** The Coast Guard may refuse to issue, suspend, or revoke a COI if the vessel fails to meet statutory or regulatory requirements, or if there is a failure to maintain safety requirements.¹²

**46 CFR Part 91 - Inspection and Certification (Subchapter I Vessels):**¹³

Part 91 provides detailed inspection requirements specific to cargo vessels, including drydocking intervals (discussed in Section IV.B below).

#### 3. COI Suspension Authority and M/V Pacific Titan Incident

**Regulatory Basis for COI Suspension:**

46 CFR § 31.10-21 authorizes the Coast Guard to **suspend a Certificate of Inspection** where:

1. The vessel does not meet the requirements of law or regulations; OR
2. There is a failure to maintain the safety requirements requisite to the issuance of a certificate of inspection.¹⁴

**M/V Pacific Titan Hull Corrosion - COI Suspension Analysis:**

The M/V Pacific Titan COI suspension (May 15, 2024 per research plan, though transaction data indicates November 2024 drydocking - timeline requires clarification) was based on **structural deficiency discovered during special survey**:

**Deficiency Details:**
- **Location:** Cargo hold ballast tanks (15 shell plates)
- **Original Thickness:** 8mm (design specification)
- **Actual Thickness (measured November 2024):** 6mm
- **Minimum Required Thickness:** 7mm per 46 CFR hull structural standards and ABS Rules
- **Thickness Loss:** 25% (2mm loss from 8mm original)
- **Corrosion Rate:** Accelerated internal corrosion due to BWMS failure

**Regulatory Violations:**

The 6mm actual thickness violated:
1. **ABS Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels** - Hull structural strength requirements (accepted as Coast Guard standard per 46 U.S.C. § 3316)
2. **46 CFR § 176.970 (analogous provision)** - Unsafe vessel condition prohibiting voyage
3. **Classification Society Standards** - ABS special survey hull thickness requirements

**Coast Guard Enforcement Action:**

Upon receiving ABS special survey report showing sub-standard hull thickness, the Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection (OCMI) at Singapore (or U.S. port of next arrival) exercised authority under 46 CFR § 31.10-21 to:

1. **Suspend COI** effective immediately (May 15, 2024 or upon discovery in November 2024)
2. **Prohibit vessel from proceeding to sea** until repairs completed
3. **Require emergency plate replacement** (15 shell plates replaced at Keppel Shipyard, Singapore)
4. **Mandate BWMS replacement** (root cause of accelerated corrosion)
5. **Require re-inspection** prior to COI reinstatement

**COI Reinstatement (June 20, 2024):**

Following completion of:
- Hull plate replacement ($4.2M)
- BWMS replacement ($2.8M - new GEA Westfalia system)
- Re-gauging of repaired areas
- ABS surveyor approval
- Coast Guard OCMI re-inspection

The Coast Guard issued a **conditional COI** with the following terms:
- **Enhanced Inspection Schedule:** BWMS quarterly inspections (vs. annual standard) at cost $150K-$250K annually fleet-wide
- **Next Drydock:** September 2026 (accelerated from standard 2.5-year interval to ensure no recurrence)
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Hull thickness re-gauging at next drydock with focus on ballast tank areas

**Compliance Assessment:** The conditional COI reinstatement indicates Coast Guard satisfaction with emergency repairs but ongoing concern about root cause (BWMS failure leading to corrosion). The enhanced BWMS inspection schedule ($150K-$250K annually fleet-wide) represents an ongoing operational cost burden imposed as condition of continued operations.

### B. Drydocking Requirements and Fleet Compliance

#### 1. Statutory and Regulatory Framework

**46 CFR § 91.40-3 - Drydock Examination Intervals:**¹⁵

46 CFR § 91.40-3 establishes mandatory drydocking intervals for cargo vessels operating in salt water. Table 91.40-3(a) specifies:

**For "Ships" (including container ships and bulk carriers):**
- **Drydock Examination Interval:** 2.5 years
- **Internal Structural Examination Interval:** 2.5 years
- **Cargo Tank Internal Examination Interval:** 2.5 years (or as specified in Part 151)

**2.5-Year Interval Definition:**¹⁶

"Where Table 91.40-3(a) indicates a 2.5 year examination interval, it means **a vessel must undergo two examinations within any five year period**. **No more than three years may elapse between any two examinations.**"

**Application to PMSC Fleet:**

All 22 PMSC vessels (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers) operating in salt water service are subject to the **2.5-year drydocking requirement**. This translates to:

- **Mandatory drydock every 2.5 years** (with maximum 3-year gap between examinations)
- **Two drydockings per vessel within each 5-year COI cycle**
- **Annual fleet drydocking burden:** Approximately 8-9 vessels per year (22 vessels ÷ 2.5 years = 8.8 vessels/year)

#### 2. Underwater Survey Alternative

**46 CFR § 91.40-3(c) - Underwater Survey in Lieu of Drydocking:**¹⁷

Vessels meeting specific criteria may substitute **underwater surveys** for alternate drydock examinations:

**Eligibility Requirements:**
1. **Vessel Age:** Less than 15 years old (except wooden hull vessels)
2. **Service:** Salt water service with 2.5-year drydock interval
3. **Hull Protection:** Fitted with an effective hull protection system (anti-fouling coating, cathodic protection, etc.)
4. **OCMI Approval:** Vessel owners must apply to Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection for approval

**Extended Participation (Vessels 15+ Years):**¹⁸

"Vessels 15 years of age or older may be considered for continued participation in the underwater survey program on a case-by-case basis. The determination will be made by the Coast Guard during the next required drydock examination."

**PMSC Fleet Applicability:**

- **4 ULCVs** (built 2017-2020, age 4-7 years): **ELIGIBLE** for underwater survey program (age <15 years)
- **8 Post-Panamax vessels** (built 2008-2016, age 8-16 years): **6 vessels ELIGIBLE** (age <15), **2 vessels require case-by-case approval** (age 15-16)
- **6 Panamax vessels** (built 2005-2012, age 12-19 years): **3 vessels ELIGIBLE** (age 12-14), **3 vessels require case-by-case approval** (age 15-19)
- **4 Bulk carriers** (built 2004-2012, age 12-20 years): **2 vessels ELIGIBLE** (age 12-14), **2 vessels require case-by-case approval** (M/V Sierra Nevada age 20, M/V Cascade Ridge age 18)

**Cost Benefit Analysis - Underwater Survey vs. Drydocking:**

- **Underwater Survey Cost:** $150K-$300K per vessel (divers, ROV inspection, hull cleaning, no drydock facility fees)
- **Drydock Cost:** $1.5M-$4.5M per vessel (facility fees, steel work, painting, equipment repairs)
- **Potential Annual Savings:** If 4-5 vessels per year utilize underwater survey instead of drydock = **$5M-$15M annual savings**

**Limitation - M/V Pacific Titan:** Following the November 2024 hull corrosion incident, M/V Pacific Titan's conditional COI likely **precludes underwater survey** for at least the next drydock cycle (September 2026). Coast Guard will require physical drydocking to verify no recurrence of ballast tank corrosion.

#### 3. Annual Fleet Drydocking Budget and Cost Analysis

**Drydocking Cost Components:**

Based on industry data and vessel specifications, drydocking costs vary by vessel type, age, and scope of work:

**Container Ship Drydocking Costs (2024-2025 Estimates):**¹⁹

| **Post-Panamax** (8 vessels) | 8,000-14,000 TEU | 8-16 years | **$1.8M-$3.2M** | Mid-size facilities, increasing steel work for older vessels, propulsion system overhauls, cargo handling equipment repairs |
| **Panamax** (6 vessels) | 4,000-7,000 TEU | 12-19 years | **$1.5M-$2.8M** | Smaller facilities, significant steel work for vessels 15+ years, main engine overhauls common |

**Bulk Carrier Drydocking Costs (2024-2025 Estimates):**²⁰

| Vessel Class | DWT | Age Range | Typical Drydock Cost | Cost Drivers |
|--------------|-----|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Handymax** (2 vessels) | 50,000-60,000 DWT | 18-20 years | **$1.2M-$2.5M** | Enhanced Survey Programme (ESP) requirements for 15+ year vessels, ballast tank coating renewal, steel renewals in cargo holds, propulsion overhaul |
| **Supramax** (2 vessels) | 50,000-60,000 DWT | 12-14 years | **$1.0M-$2.0M** | Standard special survey, ballast tank inspections, hull coating renewal |

**M/V Pacific Titan Exceptional Costs (November 2024):**

The M/V Pacific Titan drydocking provides a case study in **exceptional drydocking costs** due to structural deficiencies:

- **Planned Drydock Cost (pre-discovery):** ~$3.0M (standard ULCV special survey)
- **Actual Total Cost:** $18.7M
  - Emergency hull plate replacement: $4.2M (15 shell plates, extensive steel work)
  - BWMS replacement: $2.8M (new GEA Westfalia system)
  - Drydock extension: $2.38M (28-day extended stay vs. 14-day planned)
  - Lost revenue (missed voyage): $9.3M
- **Insurance Recovery:** $12.05M (hull & machinery $4.2M covered less $2M deductible = $2.2M; loss of hire $4.65M for 14 days after waiting period; BWMS $800K gap due to coverage dispute)
- **Net Cost to PMSC:** $6.65M after insurance

**Fleet-Wide Annual Drydocking Budget (2024-2025):**²¹

Based on 2.5-year intervals and 22-vessel fleet:

| Fiscal Year | Vessels Scheduled | Estimated Costs | Risk Adjustment (10% contingency) | Total Budget |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| **FY2024** | 9 vessels (4 ULCV, 3 Post-Panamax, 1 Panamax, 1 Bulk) | $22.5M | +$2.25M | **$24.75M** |

| **Annual Average** | 8.8 vessels | $22.1M | +$2.21M | **$24.31M** |

**Actual Historical vs. Research Plan Projection:**

- **Research Plan Estimate:** $25M-$40M annually
- **Calculated Estimate (base case):** $24.31M annually
- **High-Risk Scenario (if additional vessels have structural issues similar to M/V Pacific Titan):** $35M-$45M annually

**Key Findings:**

1. **PMSC's historical drydocking budget aligns with lower end of projection** ($24-25M), indicating well-maintained fleet with limited exceptional repairs historically
2. **M/V Pacific Titan incident ($18.7M total, $6.65M net) represents anomaly** - if similar corrosion issues emerge fleet-wide, annual costs could reach $35M-$40M (upper projection range)
3. **Enhanced BWMS maintenance program** ($150K-$250K annually fleet-wide) adds $150K-$250K to baseline operating costs as condition of M/V Pacific Titan conditional COI
4. **Vessel age risk:** 7 vessels are 15+ years old, increasing likelihood of steel renewals and Enhanced Survey Programme requirements (bulk carriers M/V Sierra Nevada age 20, M/V Cascade Ridge age 18 present highest risk)

#### 4. Drydocking Schedule Compliance and Extensions

**Commandant Extension Authority:**²²

"The Commandant (CG-CVC) may authorize extensions to the examination intervals specified in paragraph (a) of this section."

Extensions are discretionary and typically granted only for:
- Force majeure (shipyard unavailability due to natural disasters)
- Operational emergencies (vessel required for critical cargo transport)
- Technical delays beyond owner's control

**M/V Pacific Titan Accelerated Schedule:**

The conditional COI for M/V Pacific Titan mandates **September 2026 drydock** (approximately 2 years from June 2024 reinstatement), **accelerating the standard 2.5-year interval** to 2.0 years. This represents Coast Guard heightened scrutiny following structural deficiency.

**Fleet Compliance Assessment:**

Based on transaction data, PMSC has maintained **good drydocking compliance** with no indications of:
- Overdue drydockings
- Extension requests due to maintenance failures
- Coast Guard enforcement actions for drydock interval violations

The M/V Pacific Titan incident appears to be an isolated event (BWMS failure-induced corrosion) rather than systemic maintenance deficiency.

### C. Ballast Water Management System (BWMS) Compliance

#### 1. Regulatory Framework: 33 CFR Part 151 Subpart D

**Statutory Basis:**

The **National Invasive Species Act of 1996** (NISA), reauthorized and amended by the **Vessel Incidental Discharge Act of 2018** (VIDA), directs the Coast Guard to regulate ballast water discharges to prevent introduction of aquatic nuisance species into U.S. waters.²³

**33 CFR § 151.2025 - Ballast Water Management Requirements:**²⁴

All vessels operating in U.S. waters must:

1. **Install Coast Guard-approved BWMS** (per 46 CFR Part 162 type approval)
2. **Maintain BWMS per manufacturer specifications**
3. **Meet ballast water discharge standard (BWDS)** at all times of discharge

**33 CFR § 151.2030 - Ballast Water Discharge Standard (BWDS):**²⁵

Vessels must meet the following biological standards when discharging ballast water into U.S. waters:

| Organism Size | Discharge Limit |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **≥50 micrometers** | <10 viable organisms per cubic meter |
| **10-49 micrometers** | <10 viable organisms per milliliter |
| **Indicator Microbes:** | |
| - Toxicogenic *Vibrio cholerae* | <1 colony forming unit (cfu) per 100 mL |
| - *Escherichia coli* | <250 cfu per 100 mL |
| - Intestinal enterococci | <100 cfu per 100 mL |

**Compliance Deadline:**

By **September 8, 2024**, all ships were mandated to comply with the IMO D-2 standard (equivalent to U.S. BWDS above).²⁶

#### 2. PMSC Fleet BWMS Compliance Status

**Fleet-Wide Installation:**

All 22 PMSC vessels are equipped with Coast Guard-approved ballast water management systems using **UV treatment, electrolysis, or chemical treatment technologies**.²⁷ BWMS vendors include:

- **GEA Westfalia** (M/V Pacific Titan replacement system, 2024)
- **Alfa Laval PureBallast**
- **Hyde Marine BALPURE**
- Other Coast Guard type-approved systems (46 CFR § 162.060)

**Commissioning Testing:**

Per IMO BWM Convention and Coast Guard requirements, all PMSC vessels completed **commissioning testing** upon BWMS installation to validate mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological performance.²⁸ However, **neither IMO nor Coast Guard currently require periodic re-testing** after commissioning to verify ongoing BWDS compliance.²⁹

#### 3. M/V Pacific Titan BWMS Failure and Hull Corrosion Causation

**BWMS Failure Mechanism:**

The M/V Pacific Titan hull corrosion incident (November 2024) was **directly caused by BWMS failure**:

**Normal BWMS Operation:**
- Ballast water intake → UV treatment or chemical dosing → Kills organisms → Treated water stored in ballast tanks
- Treated ballast water has **reduced biological activity** → Less microbial-induced corrosion (MIC)
- Modern BWMS-treated ballast water is **more corrosive than untreated seawater** due to chemical byproducts (oxidants from electrolysis, UV byproducts)

**M/V Pacific Titan BWMS Failure:**
- BWMS **failed to treat ballast water properly** (specific failure mode not disclosed - possible UV lamp failure, chemical dosing system malfunction, or filtration bypass)
- **Untreated seawater + residual treatment chemicals** created highly corrosive environment in ballast tanks
- **Accelerated internal corrosion** of hull shell plating in ballast tank areas
- **15 shell plates corroded** from 8mm original thickness → 6mm actual (vs. 7mm minimum required) in approximately **5 years** (vessel built 2019, incident 2024)
- **Corrosion rate:** 2mm loss over 5 years = **0.4mm/year** (vs. normal 0.1-0.2mm/year for properly treated ballast water)

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The Coast Guard and ABS investigation (details not publicly available, but inferred from repairs required) likely determined:

1. **Inadequate BWMS maintenance** - Failure to replace UV lamps, clean filters, calibrate chemical dosing per manufacturer schedule
2. **Lack of BWMS performance monitoring** - No periodic testing of discharge water quality to verify BWDS compliance
3. **Delayed detection** - Ballast tank corrosion not detected until special survey (hull thickness gauging every 5 years), allowing 5 years of accelerated corrosion

#### 4. Enhanced BWMS Maintenance Program (Conditional COI Requirement)

Following M/V Pacific Titan COI reinstatement (June 20, 2024), the Coast Guard imposed **enhanced BWMS inspection schedule** as condition of operations:³⁰

**Standard BWMS Maintenance (pre-incident):**
- **Annual inspection**: UV lamp output testing, filter cleaning, chemical tank levels
- **Cost**: $25K-$50K per vessel annually

**Enhanced BWMS Maintenance (post-incident, conditional COI requirement):**
- **Quarterly inspections** (every 3 months vs. annual)
- **Scope**: UV lamp replacement (even if within rated life), complete filter replacement, chemical dosing system calibration, discharge water sampling for BWDS compliance verification
- **Cost**: **$150K-$250K annually per vessel** (4 inspections/year × $40K-$60K per inspection)
- **Fleet-Wide Impact**: If Coast Guard extends enhanced maintenance to all 22 vessels (not explicitly required, but recommended practice post-incident), annual BWMS maintenance costs increase from $550K-$1.1M (baseline) to **$3.3M-$5.5M** (enhanced program)
- **Transaction Impact**: Research plan states "$150K-$250K annually" which appears to reference **fleet-wide incremental cost** ($3.3M enhanced - $1.1M baseline = $2.2M incremental, or approximately $200K per vessel if amortized across 22 vessels)

**Compliance Monitoring:**

The conditional COI for M/V Pacific Titan likely requires:
- **Quarterly BWMS reports** to Coast Guard OCMI documenting inspection results, repairs, BWDS test results
- **Annual ballast tank internal inspection** (vs. standard drydock interval inspection only)
- **Next drydock (September 2026)**: Comprehensive ballast tank coating inspection, additional hull thickness gauging in ballast areas

### D. Port State Control (PSC) Record and Detention Risk

#### 1. U.S. Coast Guard Port State Control Program

The U.S. Coast Guard administers **Port State Control** examinations for foreign-flag vessels entering U.S. ports under authority of international conventions (SOLAS, MARPOL, STCW, MLC 2006).³¹ The U.S. is a member of international PSC memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and employs a risk-based **targeting matrix** to prioritize vessel inspections.

#### 2. 2024 PSC Statistics - U.S. Ports

**Overall PSC Performance (FY2024):**³²

- **Total Port Calls:** 84,034 port calls by 11,273 individual vessels from 79 flag states
- **SOLAS Safety Exams Conducted:** 8,710 examinations (10.4% examination rate)
- **Total Detentions:** 82 vessels detained
- **Annual Detention Ratio:** 0.94% (decreased from 1.22% in FY2023)
- **Three-Year Rolling Average:** 1.01% detention ratio

**Key Deficiency Categories (FY2024):**³³

1. **Fire Safety Deficiencies:** Leading category for 4th consecutive year
   - Oil accumulation in engine room: 18 deficiencies (most common single deficiency)
2. **Safety Management System (SMS) Deficiencies:** 65 total (down from 85 in FY2023)
   - Maintenance of ship and equipment: Leading SMS subcategory
3. **Structural Deficiencies:** Not specifically quantified in public summaries, but included in detention causes

**Assessment:** The 0.94% detention ratio represents **strong overall industry performance**. The decline from 1.22% (FY2023) indicates improved flag state/classification society oversight following heightened Coast Guard enforcement in prior years.

#### 3. PMSC Fleet PSC Record

Per transaction data, PMSC's 22-vessel fleet demonstrates **favorable PSC performance**:

- **PMSC Fleet Detention Rate:** 2.5% (transaction data estimate)
- **Industry Average Detention Rate:** ~5% (estimated for container ships/bulk carriers based on global PSC statistics)
- **U.S. Coast Guard Overall Average:** 0.94% (FY2024, all vessel types)

**Context:**

PMSC's 2.5% detention rate is:
- **Lower than industry average** (~5%), indicating above-average maintenance and compliance
- **Higher than U.S. overall PSC average** (0.94%), but overall average includes all vessel types (cruise, tankers, offshore supply) which may have different risk profiles

**Interpretation:** A 2.5% detention rate suggests that **approximately 1 vessel every 2 years** experiences temporary detention during PSC inspection. Detentions are typically resolved within 24-72 hours by correcting minor deficiencies (expired certificates, inoperative equipment, documentation issues). Based on FY2024 deficiency patterns, likely PMSC detention causes include:

1. Fire safety equipment deficiencies (engine room oil accumulation, expired fire extinguishers)
2. Lifesaving equipment deficiencies (expired liferaft servicing, missing immersion suits)
3. BWMS compliance issues (documentation, discharge record book errors)

The **M/V Pacific Titan hull corrosion incident** (COI suspension) is **NOT classified as a PSC detention** because it occurred during scheduled drydocking/special survey in Singapore, not during a port call PSC inspection. However, if M/V Pacific Titan had arrived at a U.S. port prior to completing repairs, Coast Guard PSC would have detained the vessel for structural deficiency.

#### 4. PSC Targeting and Detention Risk Post-Incident

**Coast Guard Targeting Matrix:**³⁴

The U.S. Coast Guard uses a **Safety and Environmental Protection Compliance Targeting Matrix** to assign boarding priority scores based on:

| Factor | Point Assignment | PMSC Fleet Risk |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Flag State** | 7 points if flag detention ratio ≥2× overall average | [Depends on vessel flags - not specified in transaction data; assume mix of U.S. flag (Jones Act vessels) and foreign flags of convenience] |
| **Recognized Organization (RO)** | Points based on RO detention ratio | **ABS = LOW RISK** (ABS is top-tier classification society with low detention ratio) |
| **Ship Type** | General cargo, Ro-Ro, vehicle carriers = 4 points | Container ships/bulk carriers = **MODERATE RISK** (4 points likely) |
| **Ship Age** | 0-4 years: -3 points<br>5-9 years: 0 points<br>10-14 years: +3 points<br>15-24 years: +5 points<br>25+ years: +7 points | **PMSC Fleet Age Profile:**<br>- 4 ULCVs (4-7 years): 0 points<br>- 14 vessels (8-16 years): +3 points<br>- 4 vessels (18-20 years): +5 points |
| **Ship Management** | Points based on company detention history | Unknown - depends on PMSC's historical PSC record |

**Priority Boarding Threshold:** Vessels scoring **17+ points** receive priority boarding.³⁵

**M/V Pacific Titan Post-Incident Risk:**

Following COI suspension/reinstatement, M/V Pacific Titan may be **flagged for enhanced PSC scrutiny** in Coast Guard databases:

- **Previous detention/deficiency flag:** Coast Guard PSC officers have access to vessel history including COI suspensions, even if not technically PSC detentions
- **Targeted for structural inspection:** PSC exam may include **enhanced hull/ballast tank inspection** beyond standard topside exam
- **BWMS compliance verification:** PSC likely to review BWMS maintenance records, discharge records, conduct visual inspection

**Estimated Detention Risk (Next 12 Months):**

- **M/V Pacific Titan:** **15-25% probability** of PSC detention on next U.S. port call (vs. 2.5% fleet average) due to heightened scrutiny and conditional COI status
- **Fleet-Wide:** **2.5-3.5% detention probability** (slight increase from historical 2.5% due to regulatory focus on BWMS/fire safety in FY2024-2025)

**Mitigation Strategy:**

1. **Pre-arrival notification to Coast Guard:** PMSC should proactively notify Coast Guard Sector of M/V Pacific Titan's arrival, offer pre-arrival briefing on repairs completed, enhanced BWMS maintenance program
2. **Documentation readiness:** Ensure all COI conditions documented (quarterly BWMS reports, hull plate replacement certificates, ABS survey completion certificates)
3. **Fleet-wide BWMS audit:** Preemptively inspect all 22 vessels' BWMS for proper operation before U.S. port calls

### E. Civil Penalty Exposure: 46 U.S.C. § 2110 and Related Violations

#### 1. Statutory Penalty Authority

**46 U.S.C. § 2110 - Violations of Inspection Requirements:**³⁶

The Coast Guard may assess civil penalties for violations of inspection and certification requirements under Chapter 33. Penalties are set forth in statute and adjusted annually for inflation per the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act.

**33 CFR § 27.3 - Penalty Adjustment Table (2025 Inflation-Adjusted Amounts):**³⁷

| Violation | Statutory Citation | 2025 Penalty Amount | Application to PMSC Fleet |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Vessel inspection or examination fees** | 46 U.S.C. § 2110(e) | **$11,823 per violation** | Failure to pay COI inspection fees |
| **Vessel inspection violations (general)** | 46 U.S.C. § 3318 | **$14,988 per violation** | Operating without valid COI, failure to comply with COI conditions |
| **Failure to provide notice (§ 3304(b))** | 46 U.S.C. § 3318 | **$2,998 per violation** | Failure to notify Coast Guard of drydocking |
| **Vessels ≥1,600 gross tons** | 46 U.S.C. § 3318 | **$29,980 per violation** | Major structural/safety violations (applicable to all PMSC vessels >1,600 GT) |
| **Vessels <1,600 gross tons** | 46 U.S.C. § 3318 | **$5,996 per violation** | (Not applicable to PMSC fleet - all vessels >1,600 GT) |
| **Failure to comply with § 3311(b)** | 46 U.S.C. § 3318 | **$29,980 per violation** | Operating vessel in unsafe condition |

**Effective Date:** These amounts apply to penalty assessments issued after **December 29, 2025**, for violations occurring after November 2, 2015.³⁸

#### 2. M/V Pacific Titan Incident - Penalty Exposure Analysis

**Potential Violations:**

The M/V Pacific Titan hull corrosion incident (COI suspension May 15, 2024 or November 2024) potentially violated:

1. **46 U.S.C. § 3318 - Operating vessel with structural deficiency**
   - **Penalty:** $29,980 per violation (vessel ≥1,600 GT)
   - **Violation Period:** From date corrosion exceeded allowable limits to COI suspension date
   - **Voyages Affected:** Unknown - if vessel completed voyages while hull thickness was sub-standard (prior to special survey discovery), each voyage = separate violation
   - **Estimated Exposure:** $29,980 × [number of voyages with sub-standard hull] = **$0-$150K** (assuming 0-5 voyages; actual voyage count requires operational data)

2. **46 U.S.C. § 3318 - Failure to maintain vessel in compliance with COI**
   - **Penalty:** $14,988 per violation
   - **Basis:** BWMS failure constitutes failure to maintain vessel equipment per COI requirements
   - **Estimated Exposure:** $14,988 × 1 violation = **$15K**

**Total Potential Penalty:** **$15K-$165K**

**Actual Penalty Assessed: $0**

Based on transaction data, **no civil penalty was assessed** for the M/V Pacific Titan incident. This is consistent with Coast Guard enforcement policy:

**Coast Guard Enforcement Discretion:**

The Coast Guard typically **does NOT assess civil penalties** when:

1. **Violation discovered during proactive self-inspection** (special survey/drydocking) rather than Coast Guard enforcement action
2. **Immediate corrective action taken** (emergency repairs, BWMS replacement, enhanced maintenance program)
3. **No casualties, injuries, or pollution resulted** from the violation
4. **Good compliance history** (PMSC's 2.5% PSC detention rate indicates above-average compliance)
5. **Conditional COI with enhanced monitoring** imposed as alternative to penalty

**Coast Guard Civil Penalty Case Outcomes (CY2023):**³⁹

During CY2023, the Coast Guard Hearing Office adjudicated civil penalties arising from:
- 5,000+ commercial fishing vessel examinations
- 46,000 recreational vessel boardings
- 10,000 facility inspections
- 3,000 marine casualty investigations
- 2,000 pollution investigations

While specific CY2023 COI violation cases are not publicly detailed, typical COI penalty cases involve:
- Operating passenger vessels without valid COI (**high penalty priority**)
- Operating cargo vessels overloaded beyond COI limits (**moderate penalty priority**)
- Failure to correct COI deficiencies within prescribed timeline (**moderate penalty priority**)
- Structural deficiencies discovered during PSC exam where vessel operator was negligent (**moderate to high penalty priority**)

**M/V Pacific Titan Scenario:** The fact that PMSC **proactively discovered the deficiency during scheduled special survey** (not during Coast Guard enforcement action) and **immediately undertook $18.7M repairs** likely weighed heavily in Coast Guard's decision not to assess civil penalty.

#### 3. Fleet-Wide Penalty Exposure (FY2024 Minor Deficiencies)

**Three COI Deficiencies Issued (FY2024):**

Transaction data indicates 3 PMSC vessels received COI deficiencies in FY2024:

1. **M/V Pacific Atlas** - Expired liferaft
   - **Corrected:** Within 30 days
   - **Penalty:** $0 (corrected within allowed timeframe)

2. **M/V Sierra Nevada** - Missing immersion suit
   - **Corrected:** Within 30 days
   - **Penalty:** $0 (corrected within allowed timeframe)

3. **M/V Pacific Endeavor** - Inoperative lifeboat davit
   - **Corrected:** Within 30 days
   - **Penalty:** $0 (corrected within allowed timeframe)

**Potential Penalty if NOT Corrected:**

Each deficiency, if not corrected within Coast Guard-prescribed timeline, could have resulted in:
- **Penalty:** $14,988 per violation (46 U.S.C. § 3318)
- **Total Exposure if Uncorrected:** $14,988 × 3 = **$44,964**

**Actual Penalty:** **$0** (all deficiencies corrected promptly)

#### 4. Ongoing Penalty Risk Assessment

**FY2025-2026 Penalty Risk Factors:**

| Risk Factor | Probability | Potential Penalty | Mitigation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **M/V Pacific Titan conditional COI violation** (failure to maintain quarterly BWMS inspections) | **5-10%** | $29,980 per violation (failure to comply with COI conditions) | Implement automated tracking for quarterly BWMS reports to Coast Guard |
| **Fleet-wide BWMS non-compliance** discovered during PSC exam | **10-15%** | $14,988-$29,980 per vessel depending on severity | Proactive fleet-wide BWMS audit, discharge record book compliance review |
| **Drydock interval violation** (vessel operated beyond 3-year maximum interval) | **<2%** | $29,980 per violation + vessel detention | PMSC has good drydock compliance history; low risk |
| **Repeat lifesaving equipment deficiency** (recurring expired liferaft/immersion suit issues) | **15-20%** | $14,988 per vessel if not corrected within timeline | Enhanced preventive maintenance tracking for lifesaving equipment certification dates |

**Annual Expected Penalty Exposure:**

Using probability-weighted exposure:

- M/V Pacific Titan conditional COI: 7.5% × $29,980 = $2,249
- Fleet BWMS non-compliance: 12.5% × $14,988 × 2 vessels = $3,747
- Drydock violation: 2% × $29,980 = $600
- Lifesaving equipment: 17.5% × $14,988 × 2 vessels = $5,246

**Total Annual Expected Penalty:** **$11,842** (FY2025-2026)

**Interpretation:** PMSC's expected annual civil penalty exposure is **de minimis** ($12K annually for a $3.2B revenue company = 0.0004% of revenue), indicating **strong compliance culture** and low enforcement risk.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **M/V Pacific Titan Recurring Corrosion** (September 2026 drydock reveals additional ballast tank corrosion) | **HIGH** | **15-25%** | $5M-$15M (additional repairs, drydock extension, lost revenue) | Enhanced ballast tank inspections during annual surveys, quarterly BWMS performance monitoring, ballast water sampling for corrosivity |
| **Fleet-Wide BWMS Failure Pattern** (similar BWMS failures in other vessels leading to corrosion) | **MEDIUM** | **10-15%** | $10M-$30M (if 2-3 additional vessels require hull plate replacement) | Immediate fleet-wide BWMS audit, proactive BWMS replacement for systems approaching end of service life (10+ years), implement BWMS performance testing program |
| **Bulk Carrier Enhanced Survey Programme (ESP) Steel Renewals** (M/V Sierra Nevada age 20, M/V Cascade Ridge age 18) | **MEDIUM** | **40-60%** | $2M-$5M per vessel (extensive steel renewals during next drydock for vessels 15+ years) | Budget $4M-$8M for bulk carrier drydockings in FY2025-2026; consider vessel replacement strategy for 20+ year vessels |
| **Port State Control Detention - M/V Pacific Titan** | **MEDIUM** | **15-25%** | $150K-$500K per detention (drydock delay, cargo delay penalties, lost revenue for 2-5 day detention) | Pre-arrival Coast Guard notification, comprehensive documentation package, voluntary PSC pre-exam coordination |
| **Conditional COI Compliance Failure** (M/V Pacific Titan misses quarterly BWMS reporting deadline) | **LOW** | **5-10%** | $29,980 civil penalty + potential COI suspension | Implement automated tracking system for conditional COI requirements, assign dedicated compliance officer for M/V Pacific Titan oversight |
| **Drydock Interval Violation** (vessel operated beyond 3-year maximum interval due to shipyard capacity constraints) | **LOW** | **<5%** | $29,980 civil penalty + vessel detention + $1M-$3M expedited drydock costs | Advance drydock scheduling (12-18 months ahead), maintain relationships with multiple shipyards across Asia-Pacific |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **M/V Pacific Titan Timeline Inconsistency:**
   - Research plan states "COI suspension May 15, 2024"
   - Transaction data states "drydocking November 2024"
   - COI reinstatement "June 20, 2024"
   - **Issue:** COI cannot be reinstated (June 2024) before drydocking (November 2024)
   - **Resolution Required:** Clarify actual incident timeline; determine if May 15 refers to 2025, or November refers to November 2023, or research plan contains error
   - **Due Diligence Action:** Request actual Coast Guard COI suspension notice, ABS special survey report, drydock work orders with completion dates

2. **BWMS Coverage Gap in Insurance Recovery:**
   - **Issue:** Insurance dispute over $800K BWMS replacement cost
   - **Risk:** Insurers may exclude future BWMS failures as "maintenance-related" rather than "casualty"
   - **Due Diligence Action:** Review hull & machinery policy for BWMS coverage exclusions, consider separate BWMS equipment breakdown coverage

3. **Fleet Age Profile - 7 Vessels Age 15+ Years:**
   - **Issue:** 32% of fleet (7 vessels) are age 15+ years, triggering Enhanced Survey Programme requirements, increasing drydock costs, and reducing underwater survey eligibility
   - **Due Diligence Action:** Obtain vessel-by-vessel drydocking cost history for past 5 years to identify trend of increasing steel renewals; evaluate fleet modernization/replacement strategy

4. **PMSC 2.5% PSC Detention Rate vs. U.S. 0.94% Average:**
   - **Issue:** PMSC fleet detention rate 2.5× higher than U.S. overall average (though still better than ~5% industry average for cargo vessels)
   - **Due Diligence Action:** Request vessel-specific PSC detention records for past 3 years to identify repeat offenders; determine if detention rate is driven by few problem vessels or systemic issues

5. **No Civil Penalty for M/V Pacific Titan:**
   - **Issue:** While likely explained by proactive self-discovery and immediate corrective action, absence of penalty is unusual for structural deficiency involving 15 hull plates and $18.7M repairs
   - **Due Diligence Action:** Request any Consent Agreement, Compliance Agreement, or Letter of Warning issued by Coast Guard in lieu of penalty; determine if PMSC committed to any fleet-wide corrective actions beyond M/V Pacific Titan

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Quantified Risk Exposure (FY2025-2026):**

| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Weighted Estimate (Probability-Adjusted) |
|----------|--------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| **M/V Pacific Titan Recurring Corrosion** | $5M | $15M | $3M (20% probability × $15M) |
| **Fleet BWMS Failures (2-3 vessels)** | $10M | $30M | $3.75M (12.5% probability × $30M) |
| **Bulk Carrier ESP Steel Renewals** | $4M | $8M | $4M (50% probability × $8M) |
| **PSC Detentions (M/V Pacific Titan + 1 other)** | $300K | $1M | $200K (20% probability × $1M) |
| **Civil Penalties (fleet-wide)** | $0 | $150K | $12K (probability-weighted, calculated in Section IV.E.4) |
| **Enhanced BWMS Maintenance (ongoing)** | $150K | $250K | $200K (100% certain - conditional COI requirement) |
| **Baseline Drydocking Costs (8.8 vessels/year)** | $19.6M | $27.8M | $24.3M (100% certain - regulatory requirement) |
| **TOTAL COAST GUARD COMPLIANCE COSTS** | **$35.05M** | **$82.15M** | **$35.46M** |

**Interpretation:**

- **Base Case (Weighted Estimate):** $35.46M annually (FY2025-2026) aligns with research plan's **$25M-$40M** projection
- **Upside Case (Low Estimate):** $35.05M if no exceptional issues occur beyond baseline drydocking + enhanced BWMS maintenance
- **Downside Case (High Estimate):** $82.15M if multiple vessels experience BWMS-induced corrosion + bulk carriers require extensive steel renewals

**Transaction Impact:**

- **$4.8B deal value** → $35.46M annual Coast Guard compliance costs = **0.74% of deal value annually**
- **$3.2B PMSC annual revenue** (estimated) → $35.46M = **1.11% of revenue**
- For context, typical maritime operating costs (crew, fuel, insurance, maintenance, port fees) = 60-70% of revenue, so Coast Guard compliance represents **1.6-1.9% of total operating costs**

**Deal-Breaking Risk Assessment:** **LOW**

The $35.46M annual Coast Guard compliance costs (weighted estimate) are:
1. **Predictable and budgeted** (per transaction data, PMSC has maintained $25M-$40M drydocking budgets historically)
2. **Within industry norms** for a 22-vessel container/bulk carrier fleet
3. **Not indicative of systemic safety failures** (M/V Pacific Titan incident appears isolated; fleet otherwise has good compliance record)
4. **Manageable through operational best practices** (proactive BWMS maintenance, advanced drydock scheduling)

**CRITICAL ISSUE #3 STATUS:**

The M/V Pacific Titan hull corrosion incident (research plan-designated CRITICAL ISSUE #3) has been **RESOLVED** with the following outcomes:

✓ Emergency repairs completed ($18.7M total cost, $6.65M net after insurance)
✓ COI reinstated with conditional monitoring (June 20, 2024)
✓ No civil penalty assessed
✓ Enhanced BWMS maintenance program implemented ($150K-$250K annually fleet-wide)
✓ Next drydock accelerated to September 2026 for re-inspection

**Residual Risk:** **MEDIUM** - Risk of recurring corrosion at September 2026 drydock (15-25% probability, $5M-$15M potential cost)

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Certificate of Inspection (COI) Regulatory Compliance:**
   - All 22 PMSC vessels are subject to Coast Guard inspection under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 33 and 46 CFR Subchapter I
   - M/V Pacific Titan COI suspension (May/November 2024 - timeline requires clarification) was properly based on ABS special survey findings of hull thickness deficiency (6mm actual vs. 7mm minimum required)
   - COI reinstatement (June 20, 2024) with conditional monitoring is standard Coast Guard practice for structural deficiencies promptly corrected
   - **Legal Risk:** LOW - PMSC has valid COIs for all vessels except M/V Pacific Titan's conditional status

2. **Drydocking Intervals and Fleet Budget:**
   - Mandatory 2.5-year drydocking interval (46 CFR § 91.40-3) requires ~8.8 vessels drydocked annually
   - Annual drydocking budget: **$24.31M** (base case) to **$27.83M** (with M/V Pacific Titan FY2026 accelerated drydock)
   - PMSC's historical $25M-$40M annual budget is adequate; actual costs align with lower end ($24-25M) indicating well-maintained fleet
   - **Opportunity:** Underwater survey program could save $5M-$15M annually if 4-5 eligible vessels substitute underwater survey for alternate drydock

3. **Ballast Water Management System (BWMS) Compliance:**
   - All 22 vessels compliant with 33 CFR Part 151 Subpart D and September 8, 2024 D-2 standard deadline
   - M/V Pacific Titan BWMS failure caused accelerated ballast tank corrosion (0.4mm/year vs. 0.1-0.2mm/year normal rate)
   - Enhanced BWMS maintenance program ($150K-$250K annually fleet-wide) imposed as conditional COI requirement
   - **Operational Risk:** MEDIUM - Fleet-wide BWMS audit recommended to prevent recurring failures in other vessels (10-15% probability, $10M-$30M exposure)

4. **Port State Control (PSC) Performance:**
   - PMSC 2.5% detention rate is **better than ~5% industry average** but **higher than 0.94% U.S. overall average** (FY2024)
   - Indicates above-average fleet maintenance; detentions typically minor/correctable (expired lifesaving equipment, fire safety deficiencies)
   - M/V Pacific Titan faces **15-25% PSC detention probability** on next U.S. port call due to heightened Coast Guard scrutiny
   - **Mitigation:** Pre-arrival Coast Guard notification, documentation package demonstrating repairs/enhanced maintenance

5. **Civil Penalty Exposure:**
   - M/V Pacific Titan: $0 penalty assessed (potential $15K-$165K exposure waived due to proactive self-discovery, immediate corrective action)
   - Fleet-wide expected annual penalty: **$11,842** (de minimis - 0.0004% of revenue)
   - 2025 inflation-adjusted penalties: $14,988 (general COI violations), $29,980 (structural violations for vessels ≥1,600 GT)
   - **Legal Risk:** LOW - Strong compliance culture; Coast Guard enforcement discretion favors PMSC

6. **Transaction Impact:**
   - **Annual Coast Guard Compliance Costs:** $35.46M (weighted estimate) = 0.74% of $4.8B deal value = 1.11% of revenue = 1.6-1.9% of total operating costs
   - **Within normal operating parameters** for 22-vessel container/bulk carrier fleet
   - **M/V Pacific Titan net cost:** $6.65M (after $12.05M insurance recovery) absorbed in FY2024; no ongoing liability beyond enhanced maintenance
   - **CRITICAL ISSUE #3 RESOLVED:** M/V Pacific Titan incident fully addressed; residual risk manageable

### B. Recommended Next Steps

   - **Priority Vessels:** Vessels with BWMS age 10+ years, vessels scheduled for U.S. port calls in next 90 days
   - **Deliverable:** BWMS audit report identifying deficiencies; remediation plan with costs/timeline

3. **Drydocking Schedule Verification:**
   - **Action:** Confirm next drydock dates for all 22 vessels; verify no vessel will exceed 3-year maximum interval in next 24 months
   - **Deliverable:** Fleet drydocking matrix (Excel) showing: vessel name, last drydock date, next drydock due date, shipyard contracted (if scheduled), budget allocated

#### Short-Term Actions (Within 90 Days):

4. **M/V Pacific Titan PSC Pre-Arrival Coordination:**
   - **Action:** For M/V Pacific Titan's next U.S. port call, submit pre-arrival notification to Coast Guard Sector with documentation package: COI, hull plate replacement certificates, BWMS quarterly reports, ABS survey completion certificate
   - **Deliverable:** Pre-arrival briefing scheduled with Coast Guard PSC Coordinator; voluntary PSC exam coordination

5. **Hull & Machinery Insurance Policy Review:**
   - **Action:** Review insurance policy for BWMS coverage exclusions; address $800K coverage gap that occurred for M/V Pacific Titan BWMS replacement
   - **Options:** (a) Negotiate endorsement covering BWMS equipment breakdown, (b) Obtain separate equipment breakdown policy, (c) Self-insure via increased deductible
   - **Deliverable:** Insurance broker recommendation memo; policy amendments if cost-effective

6. **Bulk Carrier Drydocking Budget Adjustment:**
   - **Action:** Increase drydocking budget allocation for M/V Sierra Nevada (age 20) and M/V Cascade Ridge (age 18) to $2.5M-$3.5M per vessel (vs. standard $1.5M-$2.0M) to account for Enhanced Survey Programme steel renewals
   - **Deliverable:** Updated FY2025-2026 capital budget reflecting $4M-$8M total for bulk carrier drydockings

#### Long-Term Considerations (6-12 Months):

7. **Underwater Survey Program Implementation:**
   - **Action:** Apply to Coast Guard OCMI for underwater survey approval for 10-13 eligible vessels (age <15 years) to substitute underwater survey for alternate drydock
   - **Cost-Benefit:** Potential $5M-$15M annual savings vs. full drydock for 4-5 vessels per year
   - **Deliverable:** OCMI application submitted; hull protection system verification (anti-fouling coating, cathodic protection)

8. **Fleet Modernization Strategy - Bulk Carriers:**
   - **Action:** Evaluate replacing M/V Sierra Nevada (age 20) and M/V Cascade Ridge (age 18) with newer tonnage vs. continued operation with increasing steel renewal costs
   - **Analysis:** Compare: (a) Ongoing drydock costs for 20-year vessels ($2.5M-$3.5M every 2.5 years + operational downtime), (b) Purchase of 5-10 year used bulk carriers ($15M-$25M per vessel), (c) Chartering replacement tonnage
   - **Deliverable:** Fleet renewal business case for CFO/Board approval

9. **Safety Management System (SMS) Enhancement - BWMS Module:**
   - **Action:** Integrate BWMS performance monitoring into SMS: quarterly discharge water sampling, UV lamp output testing, ballast tank corrosivity monitoring
   - **Rationale:** Coast Guard FY2024 PSC statistics show SMS deficiencies (maintenance of equipment) are second-leading detention category; proactive BWMS monitoring prevents future M/V Pacific Titan scenarios
   - **Deliverable:** Updated SMS procedures manual; BWMS performance dashboard for fleet management

10. **Pre-Acquisition Due Diligence - Timeline Clarification:**
    - **Action:** Resolve M/V Pacific Titan incident timeline inconsistency (COI suspension May 15, 2024 vs. drydocking November 2024 vs. reinstatement June 20, 2024)
    - **Documents Needed:** Actual Coast Guard COI suspension notice, ABS special survey report, Keppel Shipyard work orders/completion certificates
    - **Rationale:** Timeline discrepancy may indicate (a) typo in research plan, (b) multiple corrosion incidents (May 2024 AND November 2024), or (c) prolonged repair period (November 2023 to June 2024)
    - **Risk:** If multiple corrosion incidents occurred, indicates more serious systemic BWMS/corrosion problem than single isolated event

### C. Outstanding Questions

The following questions should be answered through supplemental due diligence before transaction close:

1. **M/V Pacific Titan Incident Timeline:** What are the actual dates of COI suspension, drydocking, and COI reinstatement? (Resolve May 15, 2024 vs. November 2024 inconsistency)

2. **Fleet Flag Distribution:** How many of the 22 vessels are U.S.-flag (Jones Act) vs. foreign-flag? (Affects Coast Guard vs. flag state inspection jurisdiction, PSC targeting matrix scoring)

3. **BWMS Age Profile:** What is the age and manufacturer of BWMS on all 22 vessels? (Identifies vessels at high risk of BWMS failure due to approaching end of 10-15 year service life)

4. **PSC Detention History:** Which specific vessels were detained in past 3 years, and for what deficiencies? (Identifies repeat offenders requiring enhanced oversight vs. fleet-wide issue)

5. **Coast Guard Settlement Agreement:** Did PMSC enter into any Consent Agreement, Compliance Agreement, or Letter of Warning with Coast Guard regarding M/V Pacific Titan? (Determines if PMSC has ongoing commitments beyond conditional COI)

6. **Classification Society Conditions of Class:** Does ABS have any outstanding "Conditions of Class" or "Recommendations" for PMSC fleet? (ABS may have issued fleet-wide BWMS inspection requirements or ballast tank coating requirements separate from Coast Guard COI)

7. **Drydocking Cost Trend Analysis:** What were actual drydocking costs for past 5 years by vessel? (Identifies whether drydocking costs are increasing due to fleet aging, supporting fleet modernization business case)
