## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report analyzes Jones Act cabotage compliance for Pacific Maritime Services Corporation's (PMSC) six-vessel U.S.-flag fleet and two offshore wind crew transfer vessels under construction in China (COSCO shipyard, $35M investment). The acquisition presents **TWO MATERIAL JONES ACT ISSUES**: (1) crew citizenship violations on two vessels falling below the statutory 75% U.S. citizen threshold (M/V Pacific Guardian at 72.7%, M/V Pacific Shield at 72.5%), and (2) foreign-built offshore wind vessels ineligible for U.S. coastwise operations under 46 U.S.C. § 12112.

### Key Findings

**1. Crew Citizenship Non-Compliance (MEDIUM SEVERITY)**

Two of PMSC's six Jones Act vessels operate with crew compositions below the statutorily mandated 75% U.S. citizen threshold required by 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b):

- **M/V Pacific Guardian**: 32 U.S. citizens / 44 total crew = 72.7% (2.3 percentage points below threshold; requires 1 additional U.S. crew member)
- **M/V Pacific Shield**: 29 U.S. citizens / 40 total crew = 72.5% (2.5 percentage points below threshold; requires 1 additional U.S. crew member)

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:** The research plan cited "$39.6M penalty per voyage + vessel forfeiture risk" based on 46 U.S.C. § 55102 (Jones Act merchandise transportation statute). However, **crew citizenship violations under 46 U.S.C. § 8103 are governed by a different penalty regime.** Section 55102 penalties apply to **foreign vessels** transporting merchandise in U.S. coastwise trade (forfeiture of merchandise or value-based penalties). PMSC's vessels are **U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-owned** – they satisfy the Jones Act build/flag/ownership requirements. The crew deficiency triggers **administrative civil penalties** under Coast Guard authority, **NOT merchandise forfeiture or vessel seizure.**

**Revised Penalty Exposure:**
- **Without Voluntary Disclosure:** $30,000 - $50,000 (Coast Guard administrative civil penalties for two vessels)
- **With Voluntary Disclosure + Prompt Correction:** $5,000 - $15,000 (50-75% penalty reduction)
- **Vessel Forfeiture Risk:** None (no statutory basis for forfeiture based solely on crew citizenship percentage violations)

**Corrective Action Timeline:**
- **Optimistic (30 days):** Submit job orders to Seafarers International Union (SIU) hiring halls, mariners join vessels within 2-3 weeks
- **Realistic (60-90 days):** Account for mariner availability, vessel scheduling, Coast Guard verification inspection
- **Annual Cost:** $182,000 - $240,000 for two additional crew members (base salary + SIU benefits)

**Voluntary Disclosure Benefits:**
Submitting a corrective action plan to the Coast Guard demonstrating good-faith compliance efforts can reduce penalties by 50-75%. Coast Guard enforcement history (2005-2009) shows average of 108 crew citizenship violation reports annually, indicating active monitoring.

**2. Offshore Wind Vessels – Foreign-Built Ineligibility (HIGH SEVERITY)**

PMSC's $35M investment in two crew transfer vessels under construction at COSCO (China) shipyard presents a **stranded asset** situation. Vessels intended to transport technicians between U.S. ports and offshore wind installations on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) **CANNOT operate legally** due to Jones Act U.S.-build requirement.

**Legal Analysis:**
- 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A) requires vessels engaged in coastwise trade to be "built in the United States"
- COSCO-built vessels = **foreign-built** = **ineligible for coastwise endorsement**
- Transportation of personnel from U.S. ports to OCS offshore wind farms = coastwise trade requiring Jones Act compliance
- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rulings (July-September 2023, confirmed August 2024) clarify Jones Act applies to offshore wind operations where vessels establish "coastwise points" by attaching to seabed

**Exposure and Mitigation Options:**

| Option | Cost | Timeline | Recommendation |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| **Cancel COSCO contracts** | $5M-$8M cancellation fees | Immediate | **RECOMMENDED PRE-CLOSING** if U.S. offshore wind not strategic priority |
| **Re-order from U.S. shipyard** | $44M-$56M (25-60% premium) + $5M-$8M cancellation = **$49M-$64M total** | 18-24 months construction | Required if maintaining U.S. offshore wind market entry |
| **Redeploy to foreign markets** | $20M-$35M write-down (60-100% of investment) | Uncertain | Requires establishing foreign offshore wind operations (no current contracts) |
| **Bareboat charter to foreign entity** | $5.8M-$11M annual revenue (16.6-31.4% ROI) | Requires securing foreign charterers | Partial recovery option pending market development |

**Recommended Strategy:**
1. **Pre-Closing:** Negotiate COSCO contract termination targeting ≤$5M cancellation fees
2. **If U.S. market strategic:** Order replacement vessels from U.S. shipyards (Gulf Island, Fincantieri Bay, VT Halter Marine)
3. **If market entry delayed:** Write off cancellation fees and exit offshore wind CTV sector

**Total Offshore Wind Exposure:** $5M-$8M minimum (cancellation fees) to $49M-$64M (cancellation + U.S. replacement vessels) or $35M (100% stranded investment if no mitigation)

**3. Successor Liability for Pre-Closing Violations (LOW SEVERITY)**

**Transaction Structure:** Stock purchase of Delaware corporation PMSC by Global Logistics Partners LLC = acquirer inherits **ALL** pre-closing liabilities under traditional corporate law principles.

**Application to Jones Act Violations:**
- **Scenario 1 (Pre-Closing Discovery):** Coast Guard assesses penalties before closing → unpaid penalty liability transfers to acquirer
- **Scenario 2 (Post-Closing Discovery):** Coast Guard discovers pre-closing crew violations after closing → PMSC (now owned by acquirer) remains liable for pre-closing conduct

**Mitigation via Purchase Agreement:**
- **Representation & Warranty:** Seller represents Jones Act compliance for past 3 years
- **Pre-Closing Condition:** Require seller to cure crew deficiencies (hire 2 additional U.S. crew) **before closing**
- **Indemnification:** Seller indemnifies buyer for Jones Act penalties arising from pre-closing conduct (3-year survival period)
- **Escrow Holdback:** **Recommend $100,000 escrow** for 18 months post-closing to secure indemnification (covers high-end penalty + corrective action costs)

**Federal Common Law Successor Liability Analysis:**
Federal appellate courts (3rd, 6th, 7th, 9th Circuits) have applied federal common law successor liability to Jones Act **seaman injury claims** (extending FELA precedent). However, **no case law found** applying this doctrine to Jones Act **cabotage regulatory violations** (distinguished as administrative penalties vs. tort liability). In stock purchases, this distinction is academic – corporate entity liability transfers automatically.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure | Deal Impact |
|------|----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Crew citizenship penalties | MEDIUM | HIGH (if Coast Guard discovers 73% compliance) | $10K-$50K | **NOT DEAL-BLOCKING** – curable in 30-90 days |
| COSCO offshore wind stranded investment | HIGH | CERTAIN (foreign-built ineligible for U.S. trade) | $35M at risk; $5M-$8M min loss | **NOT DEAL-BLOCKING** – $35M is 0.7% of $4.8B transaction value |
| Successor liability (pre-closing violations) | LOW | MEDIUM (only if violations discovered post-closing) | $10K-$50K | Mitigated via escrow + indemnification |
| Vessel forfeiture | LOW | LOW (no statutory basis for crew violations) | N/A | Not applicable to crew citizenship deficiencies |

**Aggregate Quantified Exposure:**
- **Crew Penalties (Worst Case):** $50,000
- **Offshore Wind (Minimum Loss):** $5M - $8M (cancellation fees)
- **Offshore Wind (If Re-Order U.S.):** $14M - $29M **additional capital** beyond original $35M budget
- **Corrective Action Costs:** $182K - $240K annually (2 additional crew)
- **Escrow Recommendation:** $100,000

**Total Worst-Case Exposure:** $5.2M - $8.3M (assuming COSCO cancellation + high-end crew penalties + escrow)

**Total If U.S. Vessel Re-Order:** $19.2M - $37.3M (additional capital beyond original offshore wind budget)

### Cross-Domain Impacts

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Crew citizenship violations | Employment / SIU Labor Relations (T5) | employment-labor-analyst | SIU crew availability for immediate hiring (2 unlicensed mariners); impact on existing SIU collective bargaining agreement crew manning provisions | MEDIUM |
| Vessel forfeiture risk clarification | Maritime Liens & Ship Mortgages (T8) | securities-researcher | If vessel forfeiture were applicable (it is not), would create maritime lien senior to $2.8B preferred ship mortgages; confirms no vessel arrest risk for crew violations | LOW |
| Offshore wind COSCO vessels | Transaction Valuation | No specialist assigned | $35M stranded investment reduces enterprise value; write-off $5M-$8M minimum impacts EBITDA and debt/EBITDA covenant compliance | MEDIUM |

### Finding Confidence Levels

| No federal common law successor liability for Jones Act cabotage penalties | MEDIUM | No case law found after extensive search; distinguishable from seaman injury claims |

### Recommendations

**IMMEDIATE (Pre-Closing – Within 22 Days Before February 2026 Closing):**

1. **Crew Citizenship Audit**: Verify current crew composition on M/V Pacific Guardian and M/V Pacific Shield (confirm 32/44 and 29/40 ratios are accurate)

2. **Coast Guard Inquiry**: Confirm no pending investigations or civil penalty assessments for crew citizenship violations; request statement of no pending enforcement actions

3. **Pre-Closing Condition**: Require seller to **hire 2 additional U.S. citizen crew members** (1 per vessel) to achieve 75% compliance **before closing date** (estimated 30-day timeline via SIU dispatch)

4. **COSCO Contract Negotiation**: Initiate termination negotiations targeting ≤$5M cancellation fees; obtain COSCO written cancellation terms before closing

5. **Purchase Agreement Modifications**:
   - Add R&W: "All Jones Act vessels have maintained 75% U.S. citizen crew compliance for past 36 months"
   - Add Indemnification: Seller indemnifies buyer for Jones Act penalties arising from pre-closing conduct (3-year survival, capped at $500K)
   - Add Escrow: $100,000 holdback for 18 months to secure Jones Act indemnification
   - Add Disclosure Schedule: Disclose M/V Pacific Guardian and M/V Pacific Shield current 73% crew status + corrective action plan

**SHORT-TERM (Post-Closing – Within 90 Days):**

1. **If Crew Not Cured Pre-Closing**: Submit voluntary disclosure to Coast Guard Sector offices (vessels' home ports) with corrective action plan demonstrating commitment to hire 2 U.S. crew within 90 days

2. **SIU Job Orders**: Submit requests to SIU hiring halls in vessel home ports for Able Seaman (AB) or Qualified Member of Engine Department (QMED) ratings

3. **COSCO Cancellation Execution**: Finalize COSCO contract termination; write off $5M-$8M cancellation fees in Q1 2026 financial statements

4. **Offshore Wind Strategy Decision**:
   - **Option A (Market Exit)**: Write off cancellation fees; exit offshore wind CTV sector
   - **Option B (Market Entry)**: Place U.S. shipyard orders for replacement vessels ($44M-$56M; 18-24 month construction)

**LONG-TERM (Ongoing Compliance):**

1. **Quarterly Crew Citizenship Audits**: Implement compliance management system for all 6 Jones Act vessels; verify 75% threshold maintained at each crew rotation

2. **Coast Guard Relationship**: Establish proactive communication with Coast Guard Sector offices; participate in voluntary Jones Act compliance seminars (CBP hosts training at Custom House New Orleans)

3. **SIU Partnership**: Maintain strong relationship with SIU for reliable access to qualified U.S. citizen mariners; consider preferred hiring arrangements

4. **Offshore Wind Market Monitoring**: Track CBP Jones Act rulings and potential legislative changes (proposed bills to relax Jones Act offshore wind requirements)

### Outstanding Questions Requiring Data Room Verification

1. **Historical Crew Compliance**: Request vessel manning records (crew lists with citizenship status) for M/V Pacific Guardian and M/V Pacific Shield for past 36 months to determine if 73% is recent development or long-standing issue

2. **Coast Guard Inspection History**: Obtain copies of most recent Certificate of Inspection (COI) inspections for both vessels; confirm Coast Guard did not cite crew citizenship deficiencies during last COI renewal

3. **COSCO Contract Terms**: Review COSCO shipbuilding contracts for exact cancellation provisions, payment milestones, and force majeure clauses; determine current construction status and funds paid to date (out of $35M total)

4. **Offshore Wind Business Plan**: Understand strategic importance of offshore wind CTV operations to PMSC's growth strategy; assess whether $49M-$64M U.S. replacement vessel investment justified by projected revenues

5. **Seller Knowledge of Violations**: Determine whether PMSC management was aware of crew citizenship deficiencies and whether any internal compliance audits identified the issue (relevant for willfulness analysis and indemnification negotiation)

### Conclusion

PMSC's Jones Act compliance issues are **material but not deal-blocking**. Crew citizenship deficiencies on two vessels (73% vs. 75% required) expose the company to $10K-$50K Coast Guard civil penalties but are curable within 30-90 days via SIU hiring at annual cost of $182K-$240K. The $39.6M penalty exposure cited in the research plan **does not apply** to crew citizenship violations – that penalty regime governs foreign vessels transporting merchandise, whereas PMSC operates compliant U.S.-built/flagged/owned vessels with minor crew percentage shortfalls.

The offshore wind COSCO vessel investment ($35M) represents a more significant exposure, with vessels ineligible for U.S. operations due to foreign-build status. Minimum loss of $5M-$8M (cancellation fees) to maximum additional capital requirement of $14M-$29M (if re-ordering from U.S. shipyards) is manageable in context of $4.8B transaction (0.1-0.6% of deal value).

**Recommended approach**: (1) Require seller to cure crew deficiencies pre-closing or establish $100K escrow; (2) negotiate COSCO contract termination targeting ≤$5M fees; (3) defer offshore wind U.S. market entry decision until post-closing strategic review. These measures reduce Jones Act risk to acceptable levels while preserving transaction momentum toward February 2026 closing.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Crew Citizenship Requirements Under 46 U.S.C. § 8103

#### 1. Statutory Framework

**46 U.S.C. § 8103** (commonly referred to as the "75/25 Rule") establishes mandatory citizenship requirements for documented U.S. vessels:¹

- **Officers (Licensed Personnel):** Only U.S. citizens may serve as master, chief engineer, radio officer, or officer in charge of a deck or engineering watch on a documented vessel. 46 U.S.C. § 8103(a).²

- **Unlicensed Seamen:** Not more than 25% of the total number of unlicensed seamen may be aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence. 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b).³

- **Statutory Threshold:** 75% of unlicensed crew must be U.S. citizens (excluding licensed officers).⁴

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED via 46 U.S.C. § 8103, Cornell Legal Information Institute, accessed January 12, 2026]

#### 2. Application to PMSC's Fleet

**Non-Compliant Vessels:**

**M/V Pacific Guardian:**
- Current Crew: 32 U.S. citizen crew / 44 total crew = 72.7%
- **NON-COMPLIANT:** Falls 2.3 percentage points below statutory 75% threshold
- Required: Minimum 33 U.S. citizen crew (75% of 44 = 33)
- Deficiency: 1 additional U.S. citizen crew member required

**M/V Pacific Shield:**
- Current Crew: 29 U.S. citizen crew / 40 total crew = 72.5%
- **NON-COMPLIANT:** Falls 2.5 percentage points below statutory 75% threshold
- Required: Minimum 30 U.S. citizen crew (75% of 40 = 30)
- Deficiency: 1 additional U.S. citizen crew member required

**Total Fleet Deficiency:** 2 U.S. citizen crew members across 2 vessels

#### 3. Coast Guard Enforcement History

During 2005-2009, the Coast Guard issued an average of 108 reports of violations of 46 U.S.C. § 8103 annually.⁵ In 2009 alone, 75 violation reports were issued.⁶ Violations included:
- Citizenship requirements for fishing vessel crews
- Citizenship requirements for masters and officers in charge of deck/engineering watches
- Unlicensed seamen citizenship percentage violations

**Enforcement Trend:** Coast Guard actively monitors crew citizenship compliance through vessel inspections, Certificate of Inspection (COI) renewals, and complaint-driven investigations.

### B. Penalty Exposure for Crew Citizenship Violations

#### 1. Distinction Between Crew Violations and Merchandise Transportation Violations

**Critical Legal Distinction:**

The research plan references "$39.6M penalty per voyage" based on **46 U.S.C. § 55102** (Jones Act cabotage merchandise transportation statute). However, crew citizenship violations under **46 U.S.C. § 8103** are governed by **different penalty provisions**.

**46 U.S.C. § 55102** penalties apply to:
- Use of foreign-built, foreign-flagged, or non-U.S.-owned vessels for coastwise merchandise transportation
- Penalty: Forfeiture of merchandise OR recovery of greater of (a) value of merchandise or (b) cost of transportation⁷

**46 U.S.C. § 8103** crew citizenship violations:
- Governed by general civil penalty provisions under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 2
- Coast Guard enforcement through administrative civil penalties
- **No statutory vessel forfeiture provision** for crew citizenship violations alone

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED via 46 U.S.C. §§ 8103, 55102; U.S. Coast Guard enforcement guidance]

#### 2. Applicable Penalty Framework for Crew Violations

Coast Guard civil penalties for crew citizenship violations are governed by:

- **46 U.S.C. § 2103a**: Civil penalties for violations of subtitle II (which includes 46 U.S.C. § 8103)
- **Inflation-adjusted penalties**: Updated annually per Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015

**Coast Guard Civil Penalty Assessment:**
- Violations assessed per inspection/discovery, not per voyage
- Penalties range from $1,000 to $25,000 per violation depending on:
  - Gravity of violation
  - Culpability (willful vs. negligent vs. inadvertent)
  - History of prior violations
  - Good faith efforts to comply
  - Economic benefit from non-compliance

**Mitigation Factors:**
- Self-disclosure prior to Coast Guard discovery
- Prompt corrective action
- Cooperation with investigation
- Implementation of compliance management system

#### 3. Revised Penalty Exposure Calculation

**Per-Vessel Penalty (Administrative Civil Penalty):**

**Low-End Scenario (Inadvertent, First Offense, Prompt Correction):**
- M/V Pacific Guardian: $5,000 - $10,000
- M/V Pacific Shield: $5,000 - $10,000
- **Total:** $10,000 - $20,000

**Mid-Range Scenario (Negligent, No Prior Self-Disclosure):**
- M/V Pacific Guardian: $15,000 - $25,000
- M/V Pacific Shield: $15,000 - $25,000
- **Total:** $30,000 - $50,000

**High-End Scenario (Willful, Multiple Voyages, Economic Benefit):**
- If Coast Guard determines violations were willful and occurred over multiple voyages, penalties could accumulate
- Potential: $25,000 per vessel per inspection = $50,000+
- Additional penalties if violations discovered during multiple port calls

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:** The $39.6M penalty exposure cited in the research plan appears to conflate two separate Jones Act regimes:
1. **Crew citizenship violations (46 U.S.C. § 8103):** Administrative civil penalties $10K-$50K range
2. **Foreign vessel cabotage violations (46 U.S.C. § 55102):** Merchandise forfeiture or value-based penalties (potentially $39.6M+ if foreign vessel transported 36,000 tons merchandise)

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [METHODOLOGY: Legal analysis based on Coast Guard penalty assessment framework; penalty ranges are expert judgment based on Coast Guard enforcement patterns 2015-2025]

### C. Offshore Wind Vessels – Foreign-Built COSCO Vessels

#### 1. Jones Act Requirements for Offshore Wind Operations

**Statutory Requirements:**

For vessels to engage in U.S. offshore wind operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), they must satisfy Jones Act coastwise endorsement requirements under **46 U.S.C. § 12112**:⁸

1. **U.S.-Built:** Vessel must be constructed in the United States (46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A))
2. **U.S.-Owned:** 75% of ownership at each tier must be U.S. citizens (46 U.S.C. § 50501)
3. **U.S.-Flagged:** Documented under U.S. laws with coastwise endorsement
4. **U.S.-Crewed:** 75% of unlicensed crew must be U.S. citizens (46 U.S.C. § 8103(b))

#### 2. CBP Offshore Wind Rulings (2023-2024)

**July 17, 2023 – Initial Ruling:**
CBP ruled that foreign vessels could load monopile foundations in U.S. ports, transport them to offshore work sites, and install them.⁹

**September 14, 2023 – Revocation:**
CBP modified its July ruling in response to a petition from the American Maritime Partnership, determining that "the use of a foreign-flagged jack-up vessel to transport monopiles between a U.S. port and an installation site on the OCS would violate the Jones Act, because a second coastwise point is established once the jack-up vessel attaches itself to the seabed for the purposes of monopile installation."¹⁰

**August 21, 2024 – Confirmation:**
CBP confirmed its September 2023 interpretation, solidifying that Jones Act-compliant vessels are required for offshore wind foundation installation when vessels attach to the seabed.¹¹

**Crew Transfer Vessel Exception:**
CBP rulings indicate that foreign wind turbine installation vessels (WTIVs) can move crew members and work materials from work site to work site because crew members are not considered "passengers" and materials are not considered "merchandise" under the Jones Act.¹²

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** This crew transfer exception applies to **installation operations** where vessels move between fixed turbines on the OCS. It does **NOT** apply to crew transfer vessels (CTVs) that transport workers **between U.S. ports and offshore installations**, which constitutes coastwise trade requiring Jones Act compliance.

#### 3. PMSC's COSCO-Built Crew Transfer Vessels

**Investment Details:**
- **Vessel 1:** Crew transfer vessel under construction at COSCO China shipyard
- **Vessel 2:** Crew transfer vessel under construction at COSCO China shipyard
- **Total Investment:** $35M
- **Purpose:** Transport technicians and support personnel between U.S. ports (e.g., New Bedford, MA; Norfolk, VA) and offshore wind farms on U.S. OCS

**Jones Act Compliance Analysis:**

**Foreign-Built Status:**
- COSCO is a Chinese shipbuilder
- Vessels constructed in China = **FOREIGN-BUILT**
- **INELIGIBLE for coastwise endorsement** under 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A)

**Prohibited Operations:**
- Transport of personnel (crew, technicians, maintenance workers) from **U.S. ports to U.S. offshore wind installations** = coastwise trade
- CBP interpretations confirm this requires Jones Act-compliant vessels
- Foreign-built CTVs **CANNOT operate legally in this trade**

#### 4. Exposure and Mitigation Options

**Stranded Investment:**
- **Total Capital at Risk:** $35M (100% of vessel investment)
- Vessels cannot generate revenue in intended U.S. offshore wind market

**Option 1: Cancel Contracts with COSCO**
- **Cancellation Fees:** $5M - $8M (estimated 14-23% of contract value)
- **Net Loss:** $5M - $8M
- **Timeline:** Immediate (negotiate termination with COSCO)

**Option 2: Re-Order from U.S. Shipyard**
- **U.S. Shipyard Cost:** $44M - $56M for equivalent vessels (25-60% premium over Chinese construction)
- **Construction Timeline:** 18-24 months (U.S. shipyard capacity constraints)
- **Available U.S. Shipyards:** Gulf Island Shipyards (Louisiana), Fincantieri Bay Shipbuilding (Wisconsin), VT Halter Marine (Mississippi)
- **Total Cost Impact:** Cancellation fees ($5M-$8M) + U.S. construction ($44M-$56M) = **$49M-$64M total** vs. original $35M
- **Additional Capital Required:** $14M-$29M

**Option 3: Redeploy to Foreign Market**
- Operate vessels in foreign offshore wind markets (Europe, Asia) where Jones Act does not apply
- **Challenge:** PMSC has no current foreign offshore wind contracts
- **Revenue Recovery:** Uncertain; would require establishing foreign operations
- **Likely Write-Down:** $20M-$35M (60-100% of investment)

**Option 4: Bareboat Charter to Foreign Entity**
- Charter foreign-built vessels to foreign offshore wind operators
- **Revenue:** $8K-$15K per day per vessel = $5.8M-$11M annually (both vessels)
- **ROI:** 16.6%-31.4% annually on $35M investment
- **Challenge:** Requires securing foreign charterers; no existing relationships

#### 5. Recommended Course of Action

**Immediate Action (Pre-Closing):**
1. **Negotiate COSCO contract termination:** Target cancellation fee ≤$5M
2. **If cancellation fees >$8M:** Consider placing vessels in bareboat charter to foreign operators pending market development
3. **Do NOT take delivery** of COSCO vessels for intended U.S. offshore wind operations

**Long-Term Strategy:**
1. **If U.S. offshore wind market remains strategic priority:** Order replacement vessels from U.S. shipyards ($44M-$56M)
2. **If market entry delayed:** Defer vessel acquisition until Jones Act waiver obtained (unlikely) or U.S. shipyard capacity improves

### D. Corrective Action Plan for Crew Citizenship Violations

#### 1. Required Actions to Achieve Compliance

**M/V Pacific Guardian:**
- Current: 32 U.S. citizen crew / 44 total
- Required: 33 U.S. citizen crew (75% threshold)
- **Action: Hire 1 additional U.S. citizen unlicensed seaman**

**M/V Pacific Shield:**
- Current: 29 U.S. citizen crew / 40 total
- Required: 30 U.S. citizen crew (75% threshold)
- **Action: Hire 1 additional U.S. citizen unlicensed seaman**

**Total Hiring Need:** 2 U.S. citizen unlicensed mariners

#### 2. Hiring Process via Seafarers International Union (SIU)

**SIU Hiring Halls:**
- Primary source for unlicensed merchant mariners on U.S.-flag commercial vessels
- Hiring halls located in major ports: Baltimore, MD; Houston, TX; Honolulu, HI; Jacksonville, FL; Joliet, IL; Mobile, AL; New York, NY; Norfolk, VA; Oakland, CA; Philadelphia, PA; Piney Point, MD; San Juan, PR; Seattle, WA; Tacoma, WA; Wilmington, CA

**Process:**
1. **Job Order Submission:** PMSC submits request to SIU hiring hall for unlicensed mariners (Able Seaman, Ordinary Seaman, or QMED ratings)
2. **Referral:** SIU dispatches qualified mariners based on seniority and rotation list
3. **Documentation Verification:** Confirm Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC), TWIC, medical certificate, U.S. citizenship
4. **Sign-On:** Mariner signs articles and joins vessel

**Timeline:**
- **Immediate Availability (Major Ports):** 7-14 days (mariners available in hiring hall rotation)
- **Delayed Availability:** 30-60 days (if specific ratings in short supply)
- **Worst Case:** 90 days (if specialized ratings required or during peak demand periods)

#### 3. Cost Impact

**Annual Salary per Unlicensed Seaman:**
- Able Seaman (AB): $65,000 - $80,000 annually
- Ordinary Seaman (OS): $45,000 - $60,000 annually
- Benefits (SIU health/pension): Additional 40-50% of base salary

**Total Cost for 2 Additional Crew:**
- **Base Salary:** $130,000 - $160,000 annually (assuming AB ratings)
- **Benefits:** $52,000 - $80,000 annually
- **Total Annual Cost:** $182,000 - $240,000

**One-Time Costs:**
- **Recruitment/Processing:** $2,000 - $5,000 (SIU dispatch fees, onboarding)
- **Training (if required):** $5,000 - $15,000 (vessel-specific familiarization, safety training)

#### 4. Timeline to Compliance

**Optimistic Scenario (30 days):**
- Days 1-7: Submit job orders to SIU hiring halls in vessel home ports
- Days 8-14: SIU dispatches mariners, documentation verification
- Days 15-21: Mariners join vessels, sign articles
- Days 22-30: Crew familiarization, vessel returns to full Jones Act compliance

**Realistic Scenario (60-90 days):**
- Days 1-14: Job order submission and initial SIU dispatch
- Days 15-45: Mariners complete previous contract rotations, availability delays
- Days 46-60: Mariners join vessels
- Days 61-90: Crew stabilization, compliance verification by Coast Guard

**Delay Factors:**
- Mariner availability in specific rotations
- Seasonal demand fluctuations (summer months higher demand)
- Vessel scheduling (mariners must join vessel in port, not at sea)
- Coast Guard inspection schedule (next COI renewal or Port State Control)

#### 5. Voluntary Disclosure and Penalty Mitigation

**Voluntary Disclosure to Coast Guard:**

**Benefits:**
- Demonstrates good faith compliance efforts
- May reduce civil penalties by 50-75%
- Avoids criminal referral risk (willful violations)
- Establishes cooperative relationship with Coast Guard

**Process:**
1. **Pre-Closing Disclosure:** PMSC (or Global Logistics Partners post-acquisition) submits written disclosure to Coast Guard Sector offices where vessels are homeported
2. **Corrective Action Plan Submission:** Include timeline, SIU job orders, commitment to hire U.S. crew within 90 days
3. **Progress Reports:** Monthly updates to Coast Guard on hiring status
4. **Compliance Certification:** Upon achieving 75% threshold, request Coast Guard verification inspection

**Expected Penalty with Voluntary Disclosure:**
- **Without Disclosure:** $30,000 - $50,000 (mid-range scenario)
- **With Voluntary Disclosure + Prompt Correction:** $5,000 - $15,000 (75% reduction)
- **Net Benefit:** $15,000 - $35,000 penalty savings

**VERIFICATION STATUS:** [VERIFIED: SIU hiring hall locations via www.seafarers.org] [METHODOLOGY: Timeline estimates based on SIU dispatch procedures; salary data from Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics May 2024; penalty mitigation estimates based on Coast Guard civil penalty guidelines]

### E. Successor Liability for Pre-Closing Jones Act Violations

#### 1. Transaction Structure: Stock Purchase

**PMSC Acquisition Structure:**
- Global Logistics Partners LLC acquiring 100% stock of PMSC (Delaware corporation)
- **Stock Purchase** = Acquirer steps into seller's shoes
- PMSC corporate entity continues to exist post-closing
- All pre-closing liabilities remain with PMSC corporate entity

#### 2. Federal Common Law of Successor Liability

**General Rule (State Law):**
In asset purchases under state law, buyers generally do NOT assume seller's liabilities except:
1. Express assumption in purchase agreement
2. De facto merger
3. Mere continuation of seller's business
4. Fraudulent transfer to escape liabilities

**Federal Common Law Exception:**
Federal appellate courts (Third, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits) have recognized **federal common law successor liability** for certain federal statutes, including:
- Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
- Title VII (employment discrimination)
- Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
- Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)

**Key Principle:** Federal common law successor liability does NOT require commonality of ownership; **substantial continuity of operations** can be sufficient to impose successor liability.¹³

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** PMSC transaction is a **stock purchase**, not an asset purchase. Stock purchases trigger successor liability under traditional corporate law principles, NOT federal common law exceptions.

#### 3. Jones Act Cabotage Violations: Successor Liability Analysis

**Two Distinct Jones Act Regimes:**

**A. Jones Act Seaman Injury Claims (46 U.S.C. § 30104):**
- Personal injury claims by seamen against employers
- Federal common law successor liability **HAS BEEN APPLIED** to Jones Act seaman injury claims in some circuits
- Reasoning: Jones Act extends FELA to maritime workers; FELA successor liability precedent applies

**B. Jones Act Cabotage Violations (46 U.S.C. §§ 55102, 8103):**
- Regulatory violations for use of foreign vessels or non-compliant crew
- **NO CASE LAW FOUND** applying federal common law successor liability to Jones Act cabotage penalties
- Distinguishable from seaman injury claims (tort liability vs. regulatory penalties)

#### 4. Stock Purchase Successor Liability: Automatic

**In Stock Purchase Transactions:**
- Acquirer (Global Logistics Partners) acquires **corporate entity** PMSC
- PMSC remains liable for **ALL pre-closing debts and obligations**
- **No distinction** between pre-closing and post-closing liabilities
- Acquirer cannot avoid liability by claiming transaction occurred

**Application to PMSC Crew Citizenship Violations:**

**Scenario 1: Violations Discovered Pre-Closing**
- Coast Guard issues civil penalty assessment against PMSC for M/V Pacific Guardian and M/V Pacific Shield crew non-compliance
- Penalty accrues pre-closing but unpaid at closing
- **Result:** Global Logistics Partners (as owner of PMSC stock) **inherits liability** for unpaid penalty
- **Exposure:** $10,000 - $50,000 (full penalty amount)

**Scenario 2: Violations Discovered Post-Closing for Pre-Closing Conduct**
- Coast Guard discovers crew non-compliance that occurred **before closing date**
- Penalty assessed **after closing date**
- **Result:** PMSC (now owned by Global Logistics Partners) **remains liable** for pre-closing conduct
- **Reasoning:** Corporate entity PMSC engaged in violations; change of stock ownership does not extinguish corporate liability

**Mitigation via Purchase Agreement:**

**Indemnification Provision:**
- Seller (PMSC family shareholders) indemnifies Buyer for Jones Act penalties arising from pre-closing conduct
- Buyer discovers violation post-closing, pays penalty to Coast Guard, seeks reimbursement from Seller
- **Challenge:** Enforceability depends on Seller's creditworthiness and escrow holdback

**Escrow Holdback:**
- Buyer withholds $50,000 - $100,000 of purchase price in escrow for 12-18 months post-closing
- If Coast Guard assesses penalty for pre-closing crew violations, Buyer recovers from escrow
- **Recommended Amount:** $100,000 (covers high-end penalty scenario + corrective action costs)

#### 5. Recommendations

**Pre-Closing Due Diligence:**
1. **Crew Citizenship Audit:** Verify all 6 Jones Act vessels currently maintain 75% U.S. citizen crew threshold
2. **Coast Guard Inquiry:** Confirm no pending investigations or civil penalty assessments for crew citizenship violations
3. **Historical Compliance Review:** Request vessel manning records for past 3 years to assess historical compliance patterns

**Purchase Agreement Protections:**
1. **Representation & Warranty:** Seller represents that all Jones Act vessels have maintained 75% U.S. citizen crew compliance for past 3 years
2. **Pre-Closing Condition:** Require Seller to cure crew citizenship deficiencies (hire 2 additional U.S. crew) **before closing**
3. **Indemnification:** Seller indemnifies Buyer for Jones Act penalties arising from pre-closing conduct (survival period: 3 years post-closing, statute of limitations for Coast Guard civil penalties)
4. **Escrow Holdback:** $100,000 escrow for 18 months to secure Jones Act indemnification obligations

**Post-Closing Risk Management:**
1. **Voluntary Disclosure:** If crew deficiencies not cured pre-closing, Global Logistics Partners should make voluntary disclosure to Coast Guard within 30 days post-closing
2. **Corrective Action:** Hire 2 additional U.S. crew via SIU within 60-90 days
3. **Compliance Management System:** Implement quarterly crew citizenship audits for all Jones Act vessels to prevent future violations

### F. Case Law Precedent: Furie Operating Alaska LLC (2017)

#### 1. Case Background

**Furie Operating Alaska LLC v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security** (settled April 4, 2017)

**Facts:**
- Furie transported Spartan 151 jack-up drilling rig from Gulf of Mexico (Texas) to Alaska in 2011
- Used foreign-flagged vessel (Chinese heavy-lift vessel *Kang Sheng Kou*) to transport rig from Texas around South America to Vancouver, Canada
- U.S.-flagged tugs towed rig from Vancouver to Alaska
- Furie applied for Jones Act waiver from Secretary of Homeland Security; waiver **denied**
- Rationale for denial: U.S. citizen-owned vessels were available to perform transportation

**CBP Penalty Assessment:**
- CBP initially assessed **$15 million** penalty (largest Jones Act penalty in history)
- Penalty based on value of drilling rig transported in violation of 46 U.S.C. § 55102

**Settlement:**
- Furie negotiated penalty down to **$10 million** (33% reduction)
- Furie paid $10 million to settle federal claims in April 2017
- Settlement represented largest Jones Act penalty ever paid¹⁴

#### 2. Legal Significance

**Penalty Calculation Methodology:**
- CBP assessed penalty based on **fair market value of merchandise** transported (drilling rig = "merchandise")
- CBP rejected argument that drilling rig should be classified as "vessel" (which would trigger lower penalty under 46 U.S.C. § 55111 towing statute: $1,100 + $60 per ton)
- Court reasoning: Jack-up drilling rigs transported aboard another vessel are "merchandise" in commercial sense, not vessels

**Mitigation Factors:**
- CBP reduced penalty from $15M to $10M (33% mitigation)
- Factors considered:
  - Furie's good faith belief it could obtain waiver
  - Lack of willful intent to violate Jones Act
  - Procedural defects in waiver application process
  - Economic impact of full penalty on company
- **Mitigation authority:** Commissioner of CBP has discretion to adjust penalties if violation incurred without willful negligence or intent to defraud

#### 3. Implications for PMSC

**Distinguishing Factors:**

**Furie Case:**
- Foreign vessel transporting merchandise (drilling rig)
- Violation of 46 U.S.C. § 55102 (merchandise transportation)
- Penalty based on value of merchandise ($15M initial assessment)
- Single voyage violation

**PMSC Crew Violations:**
- U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged vessels with non-compliant crew percentages
- Violation of 46 U.S.C. § 8103 (crew citizenship requirements)
- Penalty based on administrative civil penalty framework ($10K-$50K range)
- Multiple voyage operations over extended period

**Key Takeaway:** Furie case demonstrates CBP's willingness to assess **multi-million dollar penalties** for Jones Act merchandise transportation violations, but crew citizenship violations are governed by **different penalty regime** (civil penalties vs. merchandise forfeiture).

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Critical Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure Range | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **Crew citizenship violations (M/V Pacific Guardian, M/V Pacific Shield)** | MEDIUM | HIGH (73% current compliance discovered by Coast Guard) | $10,000 - $50,000 civil penalties | Hire 2 U.S. crew within 90 days; voluntary disclosure to Coast Guard |
| **COSCO offshore wind vessels – stranded investment** | HIGH | CERTAIN (foreign-built vessels cannot operate in U.S. coastwise trade) | $35M total investment at risk; $5M-$8M cancellation fees | Cancel COSCO contracts; re-order from U.S. shipyards ($44M-$56M) OR exit market |
| **Successor liability for pre-closing violations** | LOW | MEDIUM (only if violations discovered post-closing for pre-closing conduct) | $10,000 - $50,000 penalties | Escrow holdback $100K; seller indemnification; pre-closing crew audit |
| **Vessel forfeiture (crew violations)** | LOW | LOW (no statutory vessel forfeiture provision for crew violations) | $180M (vessel values if forfeited) | N/A – forfeiture not applicable to crew citizenship violations |

### B. Deal-Blocking Issues

**None Identified.** Crew citizenship deficiencies are curable within 30-90 days via SIU hiring. COSCO offshore wind vessels are not critical to PMSC's core maritime operations ($35M investment is 0.7% of $4.8B transaction value).

### C. Material Findings Requiring Disclosure

1. **M/V Pacific Guardian and M/V Pacific Shield crew non-compliance:** 72.7% and 72.5% respectively (below 75% threshold)
2. **COSCO offshore wind vessels:** Foreign-built, ineligible for U.S. Jones Act trade ($35M stranded investment)
3. **Corrective action required:** Hire 2 additional U.S. citizen crew members within 90 days
4. **Penalty mitigation strategy:** Voluntary disclosure to Coast Guard can reduce penalties by 50-75%

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Crew Citizenship Violations Are Governed by Administrative Civil Penalty Regime, NOT Merchandise Forfeiture:** PMSC's M/V Pacific Guardian (72.7% U.S. crew) and M/V Pacific Shield (72.5% U.S. crew) violate 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b) 75% citizenship threshold. However, these violations trigger Coast Guard administrative civil penalties ($10K-$50K range), **NOT** the $39.6M merchandise forfeiture penalties under 46 U.S.C. § 55102 cited in the research plan. Section 55102 applies to **foreign vessels** transporting merchandise; PMSC operates compliant U.S.-built/flagged/owned vessels with minor crew percentage shortfalls.

2. **Crew Deficiencies Are Readily Curable:** Hiring 2 additional U.S. citizen unlicensed mariners via Seafarers International Union (SIU) hiring halls can cure violations within 30-90 days at annual cost of $182K-$240K. Voluntary disclosure to Coast Guard can reduce penalties by 50-75%.

3. **Offshore Wind COSCO Vessels Cannot Operate in U.S. Coastwise Trade:** $35M investment in two COSCO-built crew transfer vessels is stranded asset. Foreign-built vessels ineligible for coastwise endorsement under 46 U.S.C. § 12112(a)(2)(A). CBP offshore wind rulings (2023-2024) confirm Jones Act applies to vessels transporting personnel from U.S. ports to OCS installations. Minimum exposure: $5M-$8M cancellation fees.

4. **Stock Purchase Structure Ensures Automatic Successor Liability:** Global Logistics Partners acquires PMSC corporate entity, inheriting all pre-closing liabilities. Escrow holdback ($100K) and seller indemnification (3-year survival) mitigate risk of post-closing penalty assessments for pre-closing conduct.

5. **No Vessel Forfeiture Risk for Crew Citizenship Violations:** Unlike 46 U.S.C. § 55102 merchandise transportation violations (which authorize vessel forfeiture), crew citizenship violations under § 8103 have no statutory vessel forfeiture provision. Coast Guard can assess civil penalties but cannot seize/arrest vessels solely for crew percentage deficiencies.

6. **Furie Case Demonstrates CBP's Enforcement Posture:** $10M settlement (reduced from $15M initial assessment) for transporting drilling rig via foreign vessel illustrates CBP's willingness to assess multi-million dollar penalties for merchandise transportation violations, but distinguishes crew compliance violations as separate regime with lower penalty exposure.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

**Pre-Closing Actions (Priority 1 – Within 22 Days):**

1. Conduct crew citizenship audit verifying M/V Pacific Guardian and M/V Pacific Shield current crew compositions
2. Obtain Coast Guard statement confirming no pending investigations or civil penalty assessments
3. Require seller to hire 2 additional U.S. citizen crew members **before closing** OR establish $100K escrow holdback
4. Negotiate COSCO contract termination targeting ≤$5M cancellation fees
5. Modify purchase agreement to include Jones Act compliance representations, seller indemnification (3-year survival), and disclosure schedule

**Post-Closing Actions (Priority 2 – Within 90 Days):**

1. If crew not cured pre-closing: Submit voluntary disclosure to Coast Guard with corrective action plan
2. Submit SIU job orders for 2 unlicensed mariners (AB or QMED ratings)
3. Finalize COSCO contract cancellation; write off $5M-$8M cancellation fees
4. Decide offshore wind strategy: market exit (write-off) vs. U.S. vessel re-order ($44M-$56M)

**Ongoing Compliance (Priority 3 – Long-Term):**

1. Implement quarterly crew citizenship audits for all 6 Jones Act vessels
2. Establish proactive Coast Guard relationship; participate in CBP Jones Act compliance training
3. Maintain SIU partnership for reliable U.S. citizen mariner access
4. Monitor CBP Jones Act rulings and legislative developments affecting offshore wind

### C. Outstanding Questions

1. **Historical Crew Compliance:** Are 73% crew compositions recent developments (last 6 months) or long-standing pattern (3+ years)? Relevant for willfulness determination and penalty assessment.

2. **Coast Guard Awareness:** Has Coast Guard conducted recent inspections of M/V Pacific Guardian or M/V Pacific Shield and either (a) cited crew citizenship deficiencies or (b) failed to identify violations during Certificate of Inspection renewals?

3. **COSCO Construction Status:** How much of $35M has been paid to COSCO to date? What is current construction percentage complete? Do contracts contain force majeure provisions that could reduce cancellation fees if Jones Act ineligibility constitutes supervening legal impossibility?

4. **Seller Knowledge:** Was PMSC management aware of crew citizenship deficiencies? Any internal audits or legal opinions addressing Jones Act compliance? Relevant for indemnification negotiation and willfulness analysis.

5. **Offshore Wind Strategic Importance:** Does PMSC project significant revenue from offshore wind CTV operations justifying $49M-$64M U.S. vessel investment, or is this ancillary business line that can be exited without material impact on core container/bulk shipping operations?

## IX. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)
✓ All relevant statutory authorities researched (46 U.S.C. §§ 8103, 55102, 12112)
✓ CBP and Coast Guard regulatory guidance consulted (Dec 2024 publications)
✓ Most recent CBP offshore wind rulings analyzed (Aug 2024 confirmation)
✓ Largest Jones Act enforcement action precedent identified (Furie $10M settlement)
✓ Federal common law successor liability doctrine researched
✓ Cross-referenced findings with SIU crew hiring procedures and timelines
✓ Gap identification: Farrell Lines case and Matson Navigation case not located (alternative sources used)

### Confidence Levels

| Finding Category | Confidence | Basis |
|-----------------|------------|-------|
| Statutory requirements (75% crew threshold, U.S.-build) | **HIGH** | Direct statutory text from 46 U.S.C. §§ 8103, 12112 |
| Penalty range for crew violations ($10K-$50K) | **MEDIUM** | Expert judgment based on Coast Guard framework; no published schedule |
| COSCO vessel ineligibility for U.S. trade | **HIGH** | 46 U.S.C. § 12112 + CBP offshore wind rulings Aug 2024 |
| Furie case precedent ($10M settlement) | **HIGH** | DOJ official press release + multiple law firm analyses |
| Voluntary disclosure penalty reduction (50-75%) | **MEDIUM** | CBP mitigation guidelines + expert judgment |
| SIU hiring timeline (30-90 days) | **MEDIUM** | SIU procedures + industry practice |
| Stock purchase automatic successor liability | **HIGH** | Corporate law treatises + M&A legal analyses |
| No vessel forfeiture for crew violations | **HIGH** | Statutory analysis (no forfeiture provision in § 8103) |
| Corrective action costs ($182K-$240K annually) | **HIGH** | Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data May 2024 |
| COSCO cancellation fees ($5M-$8M) | **MEDIUM** | Standard shipbuilding contract terms (14-23% of contract value) |

### Known Limitations

1. **Penalty Assessment Methodology:** Coast Guard civil penalty schedules for crew citizenship violations are not publicly published. Penalty ranges ($10K-$50K) are based on expert judgment derived from Coast Guard penalty assessment framework and enforcement history statistics (2005-2009: avg 108 violations/year). Actual penalties may vary based on case-specific factors (willfulness, economic benefit, compliance history).

2. **Case Law Gaps:** Unable to locate *United States v. Matson Navigation*, 201 F.3d 1114 (9th Cir. 2000) and *Farrell Lines v. United States*, 23 Cl. Ct. 640 (1991) cited in research plan. Furie Operating Alaska case (2017) serves as best available merchandise forfeiture precedent. CourtListener search for Jones Act cabotage penalty cases returned no § 55102-specific forfeiture decisions, suggesting limited published case law in this area.

3. **Voluntary Disclosure Benefits:** 50-75% penalty reduction estimate based on CBP mitigation guidelines and enforcement patterns. Actual mitigation depends on quality of corrective action plan, promptness of disclosure, and cooperation with Coast Guard investigation. No guarantee of specific mitigation percentage.

4. **COSCO Contract Terms:** Cancellation fee estimates ($5M-$8M, 14-23% of $35M) based on standard shipbuilding contract industry practice. Actual cancellation provisions require review of executed COSCO contracts in data room. Force majeure clauses may affect cancellation fee exposure if Jones Act ineligibility constitutes supervening legal impossibility.

5. **Offshore Wind Market Developments:** CBP Jones Act rulings for offshore wind are evolving. August 2024 confirmation represents most recent guidance, but CBP may issue additional rulings as industry develops. Legislative proposals to relax Jones Act for offshore wind (e.g., proposed amendments allowing foreign-built specialized vessels) could change compliance landscape.

6. **Historical Crew Compliance:** Research plan states M/V Pacific Guardian and M/V Pacific Shield currently operate at 73% U.S. crew. Duration of non-compliance (recent vs. long-standing) not available without vessel manning records from data room. Duration affects willfulness analysis and penalty multiplier.

7. **Federal Common Law Successor Liability for Cabotage Penalties:** Extensive search found no case law applying federal common law successor liability doctrine to Jones Act cabotage regulatory penalties (distinguishable from seaman injury claims where doctrine has been applied). Absence of case law does not definitively establish doctrine is inapplicable, but no precedent found supporting extension to administrative penalties.
