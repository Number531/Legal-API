## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This memorandum analyzes International Maritime Organization (IMO) environmental compliance for Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (PMSC) in connection with Global Logistics Partners LLC's proposed $4.8 billion acquisition. PMSC operates 22 vessels (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers) subject to comprehensive IMO emissions regulations, Clean Air Act requirements, Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) liability, and California Air Resources Board (CARB) At-Berth Regulation. The analysis identifies **$550M-$800M in environmental capital obligations over 5 years**, **$226M-$306M Sierra Club litigation settlement exposure**, and **$1.15B-$1.68B long-term decarbonization requirements through 2050**.

**Transaction Risk Level: HIGH**

Environmental compliance obligations represent 11.5-16.7% of transaction value ($4.8B) in immediate 5-year capital requirements, with potential for **$400M enterprise value reduction** if PMSC elects to exit Los Angeles Terminal rather than fund Clean Air Act compliance mandates. Buyer must negotiate substantial purchase price reductions, indemnities, and escrows to allocate environmental regulatory risk appropriately.

### Key Findings

#### 1. CRITICAL ISSUE #6: Sierra Club Clean Air Act Citizen Suit - $226M-$306M Settlement Exposure

*Sierra Club v. Pacific Maritime Services Corp.*, Case No. 2:23-cv-08791 (C.D. Cal. filed March 2024) [HYPOTHETICAL - case number format for demonstration] alleges Clean Air Act violations at PMSC's Los Angeles Terminal (Pier 300) for vessel emissions at berth, diesel cargo handling equipment, and drayage truck pollution. Plaintiffs demand **$315M capital investment**: (1) shore power installation for 6 additional berths ($45M), (2) replacement of 108 diesel cargo handling units with electric equipment ($270M), (3) 100% zero-emission truck mandate by 2030.

**Statutory Penalty Exposure:** 42 U.S.C. § 7413(b) provides $122,488 per day per violation (2025 inflation-adjusted). Assuming 9 years of violations (2015-2024), maximum exposure is $402.4M (3,285 days × $122,488). However, comparable Clean Air Act citizen suit settlements for port/terminal operations typically result in: (a) **$100M-$500M injunctive relief** (operational changes/capital investment), (b) **$2M-$10M civil penalties** to government, (c) **$5M-$25M Supplemental Environmental Projects** (community benefits).

**Estimated Settlement Range: $226M-$306M** comprising:
- Phased capital investment: $200M-$250M (shore power $30M-$45M, CHE replacement $125M-$175M, ZEV truck infrastructure $25M-$40M)
- Civil penalty: $3M-$8M (paid to South Coast Air Quality Management District)
- Supplemental Environmental Project: $10M-$20M (community health monitoring, diesel retirement program)
- Consent decree: 7-10 year term with annual compliance reporting

**Settlement Probability:** 60-75% within 12-18 months [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on (1) Mayor Bass administration port decarbonization priorities, (2) EPA $412M grant to Port of LA for zero-emission transformation (October 2024), signaling federal policy alignment with Sierra Club objectives, (3) environmental justice community pressure in Wilmington/San Pedro heavily impacted by port emissions, (4) historical pattern of terminal operators settling CAA citizen suits to avoid litigation uncertainty].

**Alternative Outcome: LA Terminal Exit Risk ($400M Enterprise Value Reduction):**
If PMSC determines $315M capital mandate renders terminal economically infeasible, lease contains provision allowing termination. LA Terminal economics:
- Current revenue: $420M annually (2.1M TEU)
- Current EBITDA: $125M (30% margin)
- Post-compliance adjusted EBITDA: $22M-$37M (after $88M-$103M annual cost increase)

If PMSC exits terminal: Net EBITDA loss $40M annually → at 10× multiple = **$400M enterprise value reduction**. This scenario directly impacts T7 (port lease negotiations) and T8 (ship mortgage covenant compliance).

**Transaction Mitigation Recommendations:**
1. **Material Adverse Effect carve-out:** Adverse judgment >$100M constitutes MAE permitting buyer termination/price reduction
2. **Seller indemnity:** PMSC indemnifies buyer for settlements/judgments up to $150M (buyer bears excess risk)
3. **Escrow:** $100M-$150M purchase price pending litigation resolution
4. **Pre-closing settlement mandate:** PMSC commits to good-faith settlement negotiations prior to closing

#### 2. CRITICAL ISSUE #7: IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) D-Rated Vessels - $9M Capital + $39.5M-$55.3M Scrapping Risk

**Two bulk carriers (M/V Sierra Nevada, M/V Cascade Ridge) rated "D" for three consecutive years (2022-2024)**, triggering mandatory SEEMP Part III corrective action plan submission to flag state under IMO Resolution MEPC.328(76). CII ratings do NOT currently trigger Port State Control detention, but IMO Phase 1 review (2025) identifies enforcement gaps, and flag states expected to scrutinize corrective action plans more aggressively in 2025 enforcement period.

**Compliance Pathways:**

**Option A (Recommended): Rotor Sails + Hull Coating - $9M Investment**
- Capital: Rotor sail installation $4M/vessel × 2 = $8M + advanced hull coating $500K × 2 = $1M
- Fuel savings: 15-20% efficiency gain = $6.54M-$7.8M annually (both vessels)
- **Payback: 1.2 years**
- NPV (10 years): $36M-$43M
- Outcome: Upgrade from D-rating to B/C-rating, preserve $70M-$90M combined book value

**Option B: Slow Steaming (Speed Reduction)**
- No capital cost, but reduces vessel utilization
- Revenue loss: $1.34M annually (16.7% fewer voyages)
- Fuel savings: $5.2M-$6.5M annually
- Net benefit: $3.9M-$5.2M annually
- Risk: Charter party implications, cargo interests may object to transit time increases

**Option C: Scrapping**
- Scrap proceeds: $8M-$12M per vessel
- Book value write-down: $25M-$35M per vessel
- **Total fleet write-down: $50M-$70M (2 vessels)**
- Tax benefit: ~$10.5M-$14.7M (21% rate)
- **Net economic loss: $39.5M-$55.3M**

**Analysis:** Rotor sail investment economically dominates scrapping ($9M investment vs. $39.5M-$55.3M loss). PMSC has inexplicably delayed this decision despite compelling ROI. **Buyer should mandate Phase 1 ESD installations ($57M-$85M fleet-wide) as closing condition** or negotiate equivalent purchase price reduction.

#### 3. CARB At-Berth Regulation Compliance - $113M-$160M Shore Power Investment

California Air Resources Board's At-Berth Regulation (13 CCR § 2299.3) requires 80% auxiliary engine emission reduction for vessels at California ports. PMSC operates 3 California terminals:
- **Los Angeles (Pier 300):** 10 berths, 4 equipped with shore power → **6 berth gap = $42M-$48M**
- **Long Beach (Pier J):** 8 berths, 3 equipped → **5 berth gap = $35M-$40M**
- **Oakland (Outer Harbor):** 4 berths, 2 equipped → **2 berth gap = $14M-$16M**

**Total shore power capital gap: $91M-$104M (13 berths)**

**Vessel Retrofits:** $500K-$1.5M per vessel × 18 container ships = **$9M-$27M**

**Alternative Control Technology (Interim):** $2M-$4M per berth × 4-6 berths = **$8M-$16M**

**Total CARB Compliance Cost: $113M-$160M**

**Enforcement Risk:** Del Monte Fresh Produce paid **$1,990,650 settlement** (January 2025) for At-Berth violations - largest CARB penalty to date. PMSC exposure if enforcement action initiated before compliance: **$5.2M-$13M penalties** (assuming 2,600 non-compliant visits annually × $2,000-$5,000 per visit × 30-50% enforcement probability).

**EPA Grant Opportunity:** Port of Los Angeles awarded $412M EPA grant (October 2024) for zero-emission transformation. PMSC should coordinate to access **30-50% co-funding ($35M-$70M)**, reducing net capital outlay to $48M-$125M.

**Critical Overlap:** CARB shore power requirements substantively overlap with Sierra Club litigation demands ($45M shore power LA Terminal). Settlement of Sierra Club case incorporating CARB compliance timeline could reduce duplicative obligations.

#### 4. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) Liability - March 2023 Bunker Spill: $2M-$5M NOAA NRD Assessment Pending

March 2023 bunker hose rupture at Long Beach Terminal discharged **18,000 gallons heavy fuel oil**. PMSC responded effectively (95% recovered within 48 hours), paid **$685K** (cleanup deductible $500K + Coast Guard penalty $185K), and invested **$1.4M** in fleet-wide bunker hose replacement/monitoring systems.

**NOAA Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) Status:** [PENDING] Per 15 CFR Part 990, NOAA and California Department of Fish & Wildlife conducting assessment (typical timeline 18-36 months post-spill). Assessment quantifies injury to natural resources and scales restoration requirements.

**Comparable NRD Settlements:**
- Cosco Busan (53,000 gallons, San Francisco Bay, 2007): **$44.4M** ($838/gallon)
- Richmond, CA (smaller harbor spill, San Francisco Bay Estuary): **$650K** ($90-$130/gallon estimated)
- LLOG Exploration (672,000 gallons crude, Gulf of Mexico, 2023): **$3.1M**

**PMSC Exposure Estimate:** $90-$838 per gallon × 18,000 gallons = $1.62M-$15.08M range. Adjusted for harbor location (-40%), rapid response (-30%), limited wildlife injury (-20%) = **$2M-$5M** (midpoint $3.5M).

**P&I Club Coverage:** American Steamship Owners Mutual P&I Association provides $1B per occurrence coverage. $500K deductible already satisfied by cleanup costs. **NOAA NRD will be covered by P&I club**, resulting in **$0-$4.5M net PMSC exposure** (most likely $0 additional beyond $685K already paid, as assessment likely $2M-$3M falls within P&I coverage).

**Expected Settlement Timeline:** Q3 2025 - Q2 2026

**Transaction Recommendation:** Request escrow $2M-$3M purchase price pending NOAA settlement (released upon settlement within range); verify P&I club coverage confirmation for NRD claim.

#### 5. Ballast Water Management Convention - $16M-$30M BWMS Replacement Cycle + $2.8M Pacific Titan Failure

All 22 vessels compliant with IMO BWM Convention (33 CFR Part 151, Subpart D), equipped with Coast Guard-approved BWMS. **M/V Pacific Titan BWMS failure** (November 2024) discovered during drydock: malfunction contributed to ballast tank corrosion (15 shell plates corroded 8mm→6mm). Replacement cost **$2.8M** (equipment $1.8M + labor $1M), **$0 insurance recovery** (hull & machinery insurers denied claim, asserted BWMS requires separate machinery breakdown endorsement).

**Fleet BWMS Lifecycle Risk:** Fleet average age 8-12 years; typical BWMS service life 10-15 years → **8-10 vessels approaching replacement cycle** over next 5 years. **Projected capital: $2M-$3M per vessel × 8-10 vessels = $16M-$30M.**

**Coast Guard Enforcement:** Up to $27,500/day civil penalties for BWMS violations (33 CFR § 151, Subpart D). Inoperable BWMS is detainable deficiency under PSC procedures. 2020 statistics: 42% of ballast water deficiencies involved inoperable BWMS.

**PMSC Enhanced Maintenance:** Post-Pacific Titan, implemented quarterly BWMS inspections (increased from annual) = **$150K-$250K annually fleet-wide**.

**Transaction Impact:** $16M-$30M capital requirement should be factored into working capital adjustments or purchase price. Verify insurance policies include machinery breakdown coverage for BWMS (Pacific Titan $2.8M loss demonstrates gap in current insurance program).

#### 6. IMO 2023 GHG Strategy - $1.15B-$1.68B Decarbonization Investment (2026-2050)

IMO 2023 Strategy mandates **net-zero GHG emissions by 2050** (escalated from 50% reduction in 2018 strategy), with interim checkpoints:
- **2030:** 20-30% reduction vs. 2008 baseline + 40% carbon intensity improvement
- **2040:** 70-80% reduction vs. 2008 baseline
- **2030 alternative fuels:** 5-10% of energy from zero/near-zero GHG sources

**PMSC Current Emissions:** 2.4M tons fuel × 3.17 tons CO2/ton = **7.61M tons CO2 annually** (0.445 kg CO2/TEU-mile intensity).

**Compliance Pathway:**

**Phase 1 (2026-2030): Energy Efficiency - $57M-$85M**
- Rotor sails (wind-assist): $30M-$50M (4 bulk carriers + 6 older container ships)
- Air lubrication systems: $16M-$24M (8 high-utilization vessels)
- Advanced hull coatings: $11M (22 vessels)
- **Fuel savings: $48M-$96M annually** (payback 4-12 months)
- **Achieves: 20-37% emission reduction** (meets 2030 target lower range)

**Phase 2 (2030-2035): Fuel Transition Planning - $10M-$20M**
- Pilot methanol-ready newbuilds (2-3 vessels with dual-fuel engines)
- E-fuel supply chain partnerships
- Technology monitoring (ammonia, carbon capture)

**Phase 3 (2035-2045): Fleet Conversion - $880M-$1.575B**
- Retrofit 12-15 vessels to e-methanol/e-ammonia: $180M-$375M ($15M-$25M per vessel)
- Replace 7-10 oldest vessels with zero-carbon newbuilds: $700M-$1.2B ($100M-$120M per newbuild)

**Phase 4 (2045-2050): Net-Zero Achievement - $200M-$400M**
- Final conversions, carbon offsets, potential CCS deployment

**Total 25-Year Investment: $1.15B-$1.68B (24-35% of current $4.8B enterprise value)**

**Critical Technology Assessment:**
- **LNG:** IMO analysis confirms LNG lacks GHG reduction potential for 2040+ compliance; not viable long-term
- **E-methanol:** 85-95% GHG reduction, but currently <1% of methanol supply; commercial readiness 2035-2040
- **E-ammonia:** 85-95% GHG reduction, pilot phase, commercial readiness 2030-2035
- **Energy efficiency (Phase 1):** Immediate ROI (4-12 month payback), essential near-term investment regardless of long-term fuel choice

**Competitive Advantage:** Early movers deploying ESDs (2026-2030) gain: (1) $48M-$96M annual fuel cost savings, (2) regulatory compliance certainty, (3) customer preference (cargo interests demand low-carbon shipping), (4) EU Emissions Trading System credit access.

**Transaction Negotiation:** Buyer should require:
1. Seller complete Phase 1 ESD installations ($57M-$85M) pre-closing or reduce purchase price equivalently
2. Establish decarbonization reserve fund ($50M-$100M) dedicated to Phase 2-4
3. Engage classification societies/fuel suppliers on alternative fuel readiness assessments

#### 7. MARPOL 73/78 Compliance - Fuel Strategy Optimization Opportunity: $270M-$360M Annual Savings

**Current Strategy:** PMSC operates entire fleet on 0.1% very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) globally, exceeding both 0.5% global sulphur cap and 0.1% ECA requirements (MARPOL Annex VI, 40 CFR Part 1043). Annual fuel cost: **$480M** (2.4M tons × $200/ton).

**Optimization Opportunity:** Switch to 0.5% fuel outside ECAs, 0.1% within ECAs:
- Annual cost: $120M-$210M (vs. $480M current)
- **Potential savings: $270M-$360M annually**

**Tradeoffs:**
- Operational complexity: Segregated fuel tanks, changeover procedures before entering/exiting ECAs
- Compliance risk: Fuel changeover documentation critical; improper changeover risks $500,000 criminal penalties (33 U.S.C. § 1908(a) class D felony) + obstruction of justice charges (18 U.S.C. § 1505)
- Coast Guard enforcement: 9,500 PSC inspections annually, 80+ MARPOL Annex VI violations discovered over 3.5 years, 12+ enforcement actions initiated

**Analysis:** PMSC's conservative single-fuel strategy prioritizes compliance certainty over cost optimization. Post-acquisition, buyer should conduct fuel strategy review, but **risk/reward calculation tilts toward maintaining status quo** unless dual-fuel management controls significantly enhanced (crew training, PSC preparation, P&I club confirmation of penalty coverage).

### Conclusions and Recommendations

**1. Transaction Structure:**
- **Purchase Price Adjustment:** Negotiate $300M-$400M reduction reflecting immediate 5-year environmental capital requirements ($356M-$559.5M) plus Sierra Club litigation risk premium
- **Escrow Allocations:**
  - $100M-$150M Sierra Club litigation resolution escrow (released upon settlement within estimated range or 24 months, whichever first)
  - $2M-$3M NOAA NRD assessment escrow (released upon settlement Q3 2025-Q2 2026)
- **Material Adverse Effect (MAE) Carve-Out:** Adverse CAA litigation judgment >$100M or LA Terminal lease termination constitutes MAE permitting buyer termination or price renegotiation

**2. Seller Representations and Indemnities:**
- PMSC represents no undisclosed environmental violations or pending investigations beyond Sierra Club litigation and March 2023 bunker spill
- PMSC indemnifies buyer for Sierra Club settlement/judgment up to $150M (buyer bears excess risk as business risk of port operations)
- PMSC indemnifies buyer for undisclosed pre-closing environmental violations discovered post-closing (survival period: 5 years for environmental representations given long-tail liability)

**3. Pre-Closing Covenants:**
- PMSC commits to good-faith Sierra Club settlement negotiations prior to closing
- PMSC submits SEEMP Part III corrective action plans for M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge to flag state within 30 days
- PMSC provides access to all EPA ECHO compliance records, Coast Guard PSC inspection reports, and P&I club correspondence regarding environmental claims

**4. Post-Closing Capital Commitments:**
- Buyer commits $57M-$85M for IMO GHG Phase 1 ESD installations (rotor sails, air lubrication, hull coatings) within 24 months post-closing
- Buyer establishes $50M-$100M decarbonization reserve fund for Phase 2-4 IMO GHG compliance
- Buyer prioritizes shore power installations at LA Terminal (6 berths, $42M-$48M) within 18-24 months to reduce CARB enforcement exposure

**5. Insurance Program Enhancements:**
- Verify P&I club confirms OPA 90 NOAA NRD coverage for March 2023 spill
- Add machinery breakdown coverage endorsement to hull policies covering BWMS ($2.8M Pacific Titan loss demonstrates current gap)
- Review P&I club environmental claims history impact on renewal rates post-acquisition

**6. Regulatory Engagement Strategy:**
- Coordinate with Port of LA to access $412M EPA grant for shore power co-funding (potential 30-50% cost reduction = $35M-$70M)
- Engage CARB on phased compliance schedule for At-Berth Regulation (precedent: stipulated agreements with other terminal operators)
- Monitor IMO Phase 1 CII review outcomes (2025) and flag state corrective action plan enforcement intensity

**7. Litigation Management:**
- Retain environmental litigation counsel experienced in Clean Air Act citizen suits and OPA 90 NRD negotiations
- Develop settlement framework for Sierra Club case targeting $225M-$275M range (midpoint of $226M-$306M estimated settlement)
- Prepare contingency plan for LA Terminal lease termination election if settlement exceeds $300M (triggers economic infeasibility under lease terms)

**Overall Assessment:** Environmental compliance represents **material transaction risk** requiring sophisticated allocation of regulatory obligations between seller and buyer. Immediate 5-year capital requirements ($356M-$559.5M) are manageable within PMSC's operating cash flow, but **Sierra Club litigation ($226M-$306M) and alternative LA Terminal exit risk ($400M EV reduction) create binary outcomes** requiring careful contract negotiation and escrow protection. Long-term IMO GHG decarbonization ($1.15B-$1.68B through 2050) is industry-wide challenge affecting all maritime operators; **Phase 1 ESD investments ($57M-$85M) offer immediate ROI (4-12 month payback)** and should be mandated as closing condition or reflected in purchase price adjustment.

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. PMSC Fleet Composition and Operations

Pacific Maritime Services Corporation operates an integrated maritime business with:
- **22 owned vessels**: 18 container ships (342,000 TEU capacity), 4 bulk carriers (260,000 DWT)
- **8 chartered vessels**: Additional container ship capacity for trans-Pacific routes
- **4 West Coast terminals**: Los Angeles (Pier 300), Long Beach (Pier J), Oakland (Outer Harbor), Seattle (Terminal 46)
- **Trade routes**: Trans-Pacific (Asia-U.S. West Coast), intra-coastal Alaska service (Jones Act)

### B. Regulatory Framework Overview

PMSC's environmental compliance obligations arise from multiple regulatory regimes:

1. **International Maritime Organization (IMO)**: MARPOL 73/78 Convention, BWM Convention, GHG Strategy
2. **Federal U.S. Implementation**: 33 U.S.C. § 1901 et seq. (Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships), 33 CFR Part 151 (MARPOL implementation), 40 CFR Part 1043 (marine engine emissions)
3. **Clean Air Act**: 42 U.S.C. § 7413 (federal enforcement), 42 U.S.C. § 7604 (citizen suits)

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. MARPOL 73/78 Compliance Status

#### 1. MARPOL Annex I: Oil Pollution Prevention (33 CFR Part 151, Subpart A)

**Regulatory Framework:** MARPOL Annex I addresses oil pollution from operational discharges and accidental spills. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) is implemented in U.S. law through the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, 33 U.S.C. § 1901 et seq., with detailed regulations at 33 CFR Part 151.

**PMSC Fleet Compliance [VERIFIED via research plan]:**
- All 22 vessels equipped with oily water separators (OWS) as required by 33 CFR § 151.10
- Oil Record Books maintained per MARPOL Annex I Regulation 17 and 33 CFR § 151.25
- No illegal discharges recorded in EPA ECHO database [HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO - actual facility-specific records require data room access]
- No "Magic Pipe" falsifications (common violation in maritime industry enforcement actions)

**Enforcement Context:** The U.S. Coast Guard and EPA enforce MARPOL Annex I violations under 33 U.S.C. § 1908, which provides for criminal penalties up to $500,000 for organizational defendants (class D felony) and administrative civil penalties. MARPOL violations are frequently charged alongside obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1505) when false records are used to conceal violations, carrying equal penalty amounts.¹

**Significance:** PMSC's clean MARPOL Annex I record reduces transaction risk. However, purchaser should verify through data room review: (1) all Oil Record Books for past 5 years, (2) internal audit reports, (3) any Coast Guard Port State Control inspection reports noting deficiencies, (4) crew training records on MARPOL compliance.

#### 2. MARPOL Annex VI: Air Emissions (40 CFR Part 1043, 33 CFR Part 151, Subpart C)

**A. IMO 2020 Global Sulphur Cap (0.5% m/m)**

**Regulatory Requirement:** Effective January 1, 2020, MARPOL Annex VI Regulation 14 limits sulphur content in marine fuel oil to 0.5% mass by mass (m/m) globally, with stricter 0.1% limits in Emission Control Areas (ECAs) including U.S. coastal waters.² The IMO 2020 sulphur cap represents a significant reduction from the previous 3.5% global limit.³

**PMSC's Compliance Strategy [VERIFIED via research plan]:**
PMSC operates its entire fleet on 0.1% very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) globally, exceeding both the 0.5% global requirement and 0.1% ECA requirement. This single-fuel strategy simplifies compliance but increases fuel costs significantly.

**Cost Impact Analysis:**
- Annual fuel consumption: 2.4 million tons
- Annual fuel cost: $480 million (at ~$200/ton for 0.1% VLSFO)
- Cost premium: 0.1% VLSFO costs $150-$200 per ton more than 0.5% compliant fuel
- **Potential annual savings if switched to 0.5% fuel outside ECAs: $360M-$480M**

However, dual-fuel management (0.5% global, 0.1% ECA) requires:
- Segregated fuel tanks and piping
- Fuel changeover procedures before entering/exiting ECAs
- Risk of non-compliance if changeover not properly documented
- Additional crew training and operational complexity

**Enforcement Risk:** The Coast Guard conducts approximately 9,500 Port State Control inspections annually, all including MARPOL Annex VI compliance checks. Over the past 3.5 years (as of 2020), Coast Guard discovered 80+ violations and initiated over a dozen enforcement actions specific to Annex VI.⁴ Criminal sanctions under 33 U.S.C. § 1908(a) carry maximum fines of $500,000 per violation for organizational defendants (class D felony).⁵

**B. NOx Emissions Compliance**

**Regulatory Tiers:**
- **Tier II** (vessels constructed 2011-2015): NOx limits vary by engine RPM, generally 14.4-44 g/kWh depending on rated speed
- **Tier III** (vessels constructed after 2016 operating in ECAs): 3.4 g/kWh (approximately 80% reduction from Tier II)⁶

**PMSC Fleet Status [VERIFIED via research plan]:**
- 4 ultra-large container vessels (ULCVs) built 2017-2020: **Tier III compliant** with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems installed
- Older vessels built before 2016: **Tier II compliant**, grandfathered and not required to retrofit to Tier III
- All trans-Pacific routes transit U.S. ECA waters, making Tier III compliance critical for newer vessels

**Compliance Verification:** Tier III vessels must maintain NOx Technical File per 40 CFR § 1043.70 and conduct periodic NOx verification testing. Coast Guard may inspect SCR systems during Port State Control to ensure proper operation.

#### 3. Financial Comparison: PMSC's Conservative vs. Optimized Fuel Strategy

| Strategy | Annual Cost | Compliance Risk | Operational Complexity |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Current (0.1% VLSFO globally)** | $480M | Minimal | Low |
| **Optimized (0.5% global, 0.1% ECA)** | $120M-$210M | Moderate | High |
| **Annual Savings Potential** | **$270M-$360M** | Fuel changeover documentation critical | Requires crew training, segregated tanks |

**Recommendation:** PMSC's conservative single-fuel strategy prioritizes compliance certainty over cost optimization. Post-acquisition, Global Logistics Partners should conduct fuel strategy review to assess whether $270M-$360M annual savings justifies operational complexity and compliance risk of dual-fuel management. Any decision to change fuel strategy must include:
- Flag state approval of fuel management plan
- Crew training on fuel changeover procedures per STCW requirements
- Enhanced Port State Control preparation procedures
- Insurance review (P&I club coverage for fuel-related penalties)

### B. IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) Ratings and Financial Implications

#### 1. CII Regulatory Framework (IMO Resolution MEPC.328(76))

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2023 - The IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) rating system became mandatory for all cargo ships of 5,000 gross tonnage and above.⁷

**Rating Methodology:** Ships receive annual ratings from A (best) to E (worst) based on grams of CO2 emitted per cargo ton-mile. The CII calculation considers:
- Total CO2 emissions from fuel consumption
- Distance traveled (nautical miles)
- Cargo carried (deadweight tonnage or TEU)
- Vessel type and size

**Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Ships rated **D for three consecutive years** or **E for one year** must submit a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) Part III corrective action plan showing how C-rating or above will be achieved
- Plan must be approved by flag state administration or recognized organization (classification society)
- IMO Regulation MARPOL Annex VI Reg. 28 requires this enhancement but does **not specify operational consequences** beyond administrative requirements⁸

**Critical Finding:** As of 2024-2025, **CII ratings D and E do NOT automatically trigger Port State Control detention**.⁹ Port State Control authorities may note CII rating during inspections and verify presence of CII Statement of Compliance certificate, but poor ratings alone are not currently detainable deficiencies under Paris MOU or U.S. Coast Guard PSC procedures.¹⁰

However, this may change: IMO's Phase 1 CII review (finalized 2025) identified gaps in enforcement mechanisms, and 2025 marks the first real enforcement period where flag states are expected to scrutinize corrective action plans.¹¹

#### 2. PMSC Fleet CII Performance Analysis

**Fleet Distribution [VERIFIED via research plan]:**
- 2 vessels: **A-rated** (newest ULCVs, highly fuel-efficient)
- 8 vessels: **B-rated** (above industry average)
- 10 vessels: **C-rated** (industry average, compliant)
- **2 vessels: D-rated** (M/V Sierra Nevada, M/V Cascade Ridge - older bulk carriers)

**Critical Issue #7: D-Rated Vessels - Immediate Compliance Risk**

**M/V Sierra Nevada:**
- Age: 20 years (built 2004)
- Type: Bulk carrier
- CII Rating: D (2022, 2023, 2024) - **THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS**
- Book Value: $35M-$45M
- Scrap Value: $8M-$12M

**M/V Cascade Ridge:**
- Age: 18 years (built 2006)
- Type: Bulk carrier
- CII Rating: D (2022, 2023, 2024) - **THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS**
- Book Value: $35M-$45M
- Scrap Value: $8M-$12M

**Regulatory Consequence - Corrective Action Plan Required:**
Both vessels **must submit SEEMP Part III corrective action plans** to their flag state (assumed U.S. flag for analysis) demonstrating pathway to achieve C-rating or above. Failure to submit acceptable corrective action plans or continued D/E ratings may result in:
- Enhanced Port State Control targeting (increased inspection frequency)
- Flag state restrictions on trading certificates
- Charter party termination rights (some time charter agreements include CII performance clauses)
- Reputational damage (cargo interests increasingly scrutinize vessel environmental performance)

#### 3. CII Improvement Options - Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Option A: Hull Coating & Maintenance**
- **Cost:** $500K per vessel
- **Fuel Savings:** 3-5% reduction in fuel consumption
- **CII Impact:** Modest - may improve from D to C if combined with other measures
- **Implementation:** Applied during scheduled drydock (every 2.5-4 years for bulk carriers)
- **ROI:** 2-3 years based on fuel cost savings ($480M annual / 22 vessels / 0.04 savings = ~$873K annual savings per vessel)¹²

**Option B: Slow Steaming (Speed Reduction)**
- **Cost:** Operational (no capital expenditure)
- **Speed Reduction:** From 15-18 knots to 12-14 knots
- **Fuel Savings:** 20-30% reduction in fuel consumption¹³
- **CII Impact:** Significant - likely sufficient to achieve C-rating
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Longer voyage times reduce vessel utilization
  - Revenue impact: Fewer round-trip voyages per year
  - Cargo interests may object to transit time increases
  - Charter party implications (time charter vs. voyage charter economics)

**Revenue Impact Calculation:**
- Current round trips per year (bulk carrier, trans-Pacific): ~12 voyages
- At reduced speed: ~10 voyages (-16.7% capacity)
- Book value per vessel: $40M (midpoint)
- Annual revenue contribution: $40M × 10% ROI = $4M revenue/vessel
- Revenue loss: $4M × 16.7% = **$668K annual revenue loss per vessel**
- **Both vessels: $1.34M annual revenue loss**

**Option C: Wind-Assisted Propulsion (Rotor Sails/WindWings)**
- **Capital Cost:** $3M-$5M per vessel for rotor sail installation¹⁴
- **Fuel Savings:** 5-30% depending on route and number of sails installed (typically 10-20% for bulk carriers on trans-Pacific routes)¹⁵
- **CII Impact:** Moderate to significant - sufficient to achieve C-rating
- **Implementation:** Retrofit during drydock
- **Operational Considerations:**
  - Deck space required (may reduce cargo capacity)
  - Additional maintenance requirements
  - Route optimization needed (greatest benefit on routes with favorable wind patterns)
  - Trans-Pacific routes offer good wind conditions

**ROI Calculation:**
- Capital cost: $4M per vessel (midpoint)
- Annual fuel savings: $480M total fuel / 22 vessels = $21.8M per vessel × 15% savings = $3.27M annual savings
- **Payback period: 1.2 years**
- Net present value over 10-year remaining vessel life: **$23M per vessel** (at 8% discount rate)

**Option D: Energy Saving Devices (ESDs) - Air Lubrication**
- **Capital Cost:** $2M-$3M per vessel
- **Fuel Savings:** 7-12% reduction¹⁶
- **CII Impact:** Moderate - combined with hull coating may achieve C-rating
- **Drawbacks:** Requires specialized maintenance, increases drydock time by 15-20 days every 5 years¹⁷

**Option E: Scrapping Decision**
- **Scrap proceeds:** $8M-$12M per vessel
- **Book value write-down:** $35M-$45M book value - $10M scrap value = **$25M-$35M write-down per vessel**
- **Total fleet write-down: $50M-$70M** (2 vessels)
- **Tax impact:** Write-down reduces taxable income, tax benefit ~$10.5M-$14.7M (at 21% corporate rate)
- **Net economic loss: $39.5M-$55.3M after tax benefit**

#### 4. Recommended CII Compliance Strategy

**Tier 1 Priority (Immediate - Q1 2026):**
1. Submit SEEMP Part III corrective action plans for M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge to flag state
2. Engage classification society (e.g., ABS, DNV) to approve corrective action plans within 90 days

**Tier 2 Priority (2026 Capital Allocation):**
1. Install rotor sails on both D-rated bulk carriers (**$8M capital**, 1.2-year payback)
2. Apply advanced hull coating during next scheduled drydock (**$1M**, incremental cost)
3. Project combined CII improvement: 15-20% fuel efficiency gain → **upgrade from D to B/C rating**

**Tier 3 Priority (Contingency - If CII Does Not Improve by 2027):**
1. Evaluate scrapping decision for 2027-2028
2. If CII rating remains D in 2025, 2026, 2027 (sixth consecutive year), flag state may impose operational restrictions
3. Net economic analysis: $8M capital investment + $1M coating = $9M vs. $39.5M-$55.3M scrapping loss → **investment option strongly preferred**

**Financial Impact Summary:**

| Scenario | Capital Cost | Annual Savings | NPV (10 years) | Risk Level |
|----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Rotor Sails + Hull Coating** | $9M | $6.54M-$7.8M | $36M-$43M | Low |
| **Slow Steaming** | $0 | Fuel $5.2M-$6.5M<br>Revenue -$1.34M<br>**Net: $3.9M-$5.2M** | $20M-$26M | Medium (charter impacts) |
| **Scrapping** | $0 | $0 | **-$39.5M to -$55.3M** | High (asset loss) |

**Conclusion:** Rotor sail installation is the economically optimal solution, offering:
- Compliance with CII requirements (avoid D-rating)
- Rapid ROI (1.2 years)
- Fuel cost savings ($6.5M-$7.8M annually for both vessels)
- Preservation of asset value ($70M-$90M combined book value)
- Alignment with IMO 2023 GHG Strategy decarbonization pathway

### C. Clean Air Act Citizen Suit Litigation: *Sierra Club v. PMSC*

#### 1. Case Background

**Critical Issue #6 [HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO based on research plan]:**

*Sierra Club v. Pacific Maritime Services Corp.*, Case No. 2:23-cv-08791 (C.D. Cal. filed March 2024) [PENDING VERIFICATION - case number format hypothetical for demonstration purposes]

**Allegations:**
- Clean Air Act violations for vessel emissions at berth (auxiliary engine NOx and PM2.5 emissions)
- PMSC's LA Terminal Pier 300 operations violate California air quality standards
- Specific sources of emissions:
  1. **Vessel hotelling:** Ships at berth run auxiliary diesel engines to generate electricity for refrigerated containers, emitting NOx and PM2.5 particulate matter
  2. **Cargo handling equipment (CHE):** 180 CHE units, 60% diesel-powered (108 units), 40% electric/hybrid (72 units)
  3. **Drayage trucks:** 1,200 truck trips per day, many older pre-2010 high-emission diesel engines (88% of fleet, only 12% zero-emission vehicles)

**Legal Claims:**
- Clean Air Act citizen suit under 42 U.S.C. § 7604
- California Health & Safety Code violations
- Public nuisance (state law claim)

**Plaintiffs' Demands:**
1. Mandate 100% zero-emission trucks by 2030 (current 12% ZEV → need 88% fleet turnover)
2. Replace 108 diesel CHE units with electric equipment: **$270M capital** (108 units × $2.5M per electric RTG crane)
3. Install shore power at all berths: Currently 4 of 10 berths have shore power, need 6 additional berths = **$45M capital**
4. **Total capital investment: $315M+ over 5 years**
5. Ongoing operating costs: $25M-$40M annually (electricity for shore power/CHE charging, maintenance)

#### 2. Clean Air Act Penalty Exposure Analysis

**Statutory Authority:** 42 U.S.C. § 7413(b) authorizes civil penalties for Clean Air Act violations.

**2024-2025 Inflation-Adjusted Penalties:**
- **2024 penalty:** $121,275 per day per violation¹⁸
- **2025 penalty (effective January 8, 2025):** $122,488 per day per violation (1.02% inflation adjustment)¹⁹
- **Research plan states: $37,500/day** - This appears to reference an older penalty amount or a different CAA provision

**Penalty Calculation Methodology:**

Assuming violations alleged from terminal opening (2015) to present (9 years):
- Days of violation: 9 years × 365 days = **3,285 days**
- At current $122,488/day penalty: **$402.4M maximum statutory exposure**

However, courts rarely impose maximum statutory penalties. Typical Clean Air Act citizen suit settlements range from:
- **Low range:** $500K-$2M (compliance-focused, minimal monetary penalty)
- **Mid range:** $5M-$15M (significant injunctive relief + monetary penalty)
- **High range:** $20M-$50M (egregious violations, lengthy non-compliance period)

**Comparable Case Analysis:**

1. **ExxonMobil Clean Air Act Enforcement:**
   - Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed record Clean Air Act penalty against ExxonMobil in December 2024²⁰
   - Demonstrates courts willing to impose substantial penalties for systematic CAA violations
   - Environmental NGOs increasingly successful in CAA citizen suit enforcement²¹

2. **Settlement Precedent [METHODOLOGY: Industry practice]:**
   - Most Clean Air Act citizen suits involving port/terminal operations settle for:
     - Injunctive relief (operational changes): $100M-$500M capital investment
     - Civil penalty: $2M-$10M paid to U.S. Treasury or state environmental fund
     - Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP): $5M-$25M community benefit projects

#### 3. PMSC's Legal Defenses

**Defense #1: Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP) Voluntary Compliance Exceeds Targets**

PMSC's position: LA Terminal lease requires compliance with Clean Air Action Plan (voluntary plan), and PMSC exceeds CAAP targets:
- Current CHE: 40% electric vs. 25% CAAP target
- CAAP is voluntary framework, not regulatory mandate
- PMSC has invested $50M+ in environmental improvements since 2015

**Weakness:** Courts have held voluntary compliance programs do not shield from Clean Air Act liability if emissions violate National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).

**Defense #2: Clean Air Act Preemption of Vessel Hotelling Regulation**

PMSC's position: Federal Clean Air Act preempts state/local regulation of ocean-going vessel emissions. Vessel auxiliary engines while at berth are subject to federal EPA/Coast Guard jurisdiction under MARPOL Annex VI, not state/local air quality regulation.

**Legal Authority:** Engine Manufacturers Ass'n v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., 541 U.S. 246 (2004) (Clean Air Act preempts state regulation of nonroad engines and vehicles).

**Strength:** This defense has substantial merit for **vessel hotelling emissions**. EPA historically has authority over vessel emissions.

**Limitation:** Preemption defense does **not apply** to terminal-based emission sources (CHE, trucks) which are clearly subject to state regulation.

**Defense #3: Economic Infeasibility - Lease Termination Right**

PMSC's position: $315M capital mandate would render terminal operations economically infeasible. LA Terminal lease contains provision allowing PMSC to terminate lease if regulatory changes make operations uneconomic.

**LA Terminal Economics:**
- Current annual revenue: $420M (2.1M TEU × $200/TEU average)
- Current EBITDA: $125M (30% margin)
- Current rent: $85M annually

**Impact of $315M Capital Investment:**
- Annualized capital cost: $315M / 5 years = $63M/year capital outlay
- Additional operating costs: $25M-$40M annually
- **Total annual cost increase: $88M-$103M**
- **Adjusted EBITDA: $22M-$37M** (17.6%-29.6% EBITDA margin reduction)

**Lease Termination Analysis:**
If PMSC determines terminal no longer economically viable, may exercise lease termination right and exit LA Terminal:
- Revenue loss: $420M annually
- Cost savings: $295M operating expenses + $85M rent = $380M
- Net EBITDA loss: $40M annually

**Strategic Considerations:**
- LA Terminal represents 13% of PMSC's total revenue ($3.2B)
- Largest container terminal in PMSC's network (2.1M TEU of 4.7M total)
- Exit would require redeployment of vessels and renegotiation of service contracts
- Competitor acquisition opportunity (other terminal operators may purchase lease assignment)

#### 4. Litigation Status and Settlement Probability

**Current Procedural Posture [HYPOTHETICAL - based on research plan March 2024 filing]:**
- Motion to dismiss pending (hearing Q1 2025)
- Discovery has not commenced
- No settlement discussions reported

**Settlement Probability Assessment [METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment based on:**
1. **Port of LA policy priorities:** Mayor Bass administration prioritizes port decarbonization, aligning with Sierra Club objectives
2. **Public pressure:** Environmental justice communities in Wilmington/San Pedro heavily impacted by port emissions
3. **EPA support:** EPA awarded Port of LA $412M grant for zero-emission transformation in October 2024,²² indicating federal support for aggressive emission reductions
4. **Precedent:** Port terminals historically settle CAA citizen suits to avoid prolonged litigation and operational uncertainty]

**Estimated settlement range: 60-75% probability within 12-18 months**

**Likely Settlement Terms:**
1. **Phased capital investment: $200M-$250M** (reduced from $315M demand)
   - Priority: Shore power for 4-6 additional berths ($30M-$45M)
   - CHE replacement: 50-70 diesel units → electric over 5 years ($125M-$175M)
   - ZEV truck infrastructure: Charging stations, on-site hydrogen fueling ($25M-$40M)
   - Truck mandate: 40% ZEV by 2028, 75% by 2030 (phased vs. 100% by 2030)

2. **Civil penalty: $3M-$8M** paid to South Coast Air Quality Management District

3. **Supplemental Environmental Project: $10M-$20M**
   - Community health monitoring in Wilmington/San Pedro
   - Diesel truck/equipment retirement program
   - Urban forestry/air filtration in environmental justice communities

4. **Consent decree term: 7-10 years** with annual reporting requirements

**Total Settlement Cost: $213M-$278M capital + $13M-$28M penalties/SEP = $226M-$306M**

#### 5. Transaction Impact Analysis

**Scenario A: Settlement Before Closing (Optimal)**
- Certainty of exposure amount
- Consent decree provides compliance roadmap
- Negotiations may result in more favorable terms with PMSC's existing relationships
- **Recommended:** Buyer should request PMSC initiate settlement discussions pre-closing, or negotiate purchase price reduction equal to estimated settlement cost ($225M-$300M)

**Scenario B: Litigation Continues Post-Closing**
- Uncertainty inhibits capital planning
- Risk of adverse judgment ($315M+ injunction)
- Reputational impact on new owner
- **Mitigation:** Escrow $100M-$150M of purchase price pending litigation resolution, or obtain representation and warranty insurance covering environmental litigation exposure

**Scenario C: Lease Termination Election**
- PMSC exits LA Terminal rather than invest $315M
- Revenue loss: $420M annually
- EBITDA loss: $40M annually (after cost savings)
- **Impact on transaction value:** At 10× EBITDA multiple, $40M EBITDA loss = **$400M reduction in enterprise value**
- **Cross-reference:** This scenario directly impacts T7 (port lease negotiations specialist) and T8 (ship mortgage lender covenant compliance)

**Recommendation:** Buyer should negotiate contractual protection:
1. **Material Adverse Effect (MAE) carve-out:** Adverse CAA litigation judgment >$100M constitutes MAE permitting buyer to terminate or reduce purchase price
2. **Seller indemnity:** PMSC indemnifies buyer for CAA litigation settlements/judgments up to $150M (above which buyer bears risk)
3. **Regulatory cooperation:** PMSC commits to good-faith settlement negotiations with Sierra Club and EPA prior to closing

### D. CARB At-Berth Regulation Compliance and Shore Power Requirements

#### 1. Regulatory Framework: 13 CCR § 2299.3

**Regulation Title:** Airborne Toxic Control Measure for Auxiliary Diesel Engines Operated on Ocean-Going Vessels At-Berth in a California Port

**Original Adoption:** December 2007, with compliance requirements beginning in 2014
**Updated Regulation:** Approved 2020, effective 2023 for container, refrigerated-cargo, and cruise vessels²³

**Affected Ports:** Six California ports:
1. Los Angeles (PMSC operates Pier 300 terminal)
2. Long Beach (PMSC operates Pier J terminal)
3. Oakland (PMSC operates Outer Harbor terminal)
4. San Diego
5. San Francisco
6. Hueneme

**Compliance Requirements:**
Vessels visiting regulated California ports must achieve **80% reduction in auxiliary engine emissions** through:
- **Option 1:** Shore power (cold ironing) - vessel plugs into local electrical grid, shutting down auxiliary engines
- **Option 2:** CARB-approved alternative control technology (emissions capture/control systems)
- **Option 3:** Limited circumstances remediation fund (if unable to comply, pay into environmental fund for port-adjacent community projects)

#### 2. PMSC Shore Power Infrastructure Status

**Los Angeles Terminal (Pier 300):**
- Total berths: 10
- Shore power equipped: 4 berths [VERIFIED via research plan]
- **Gap: 6 berths** require shore power installation
- **Capital cost estimate: $7M-$8M per berth × 6 = $42M-$48M**

**Long Beach Terminal (Pier J):**
- Total berths: 8
- Shore power equipped: 3 berths [assumed proportional to LA Terminal]
- **Gap: 5 berths** require shore power installation
- **Capital cost estimate: $35M-$40M**

**Oakland Terminal (Outer Harbor):**
- Total berths: 4
- Shore power equipped: 2 berths [assumed]
- **Gap: 2 berths**
- **Capital cost estimate: $14M-$16M**

**Total PMSC Shore Power Capital Gap: $91M-$104M** (13 berths across 3 terminals)

**Note:** Research plan states Sierra Club demands $45M shore power investment for LA Terminal alone (6 berths), which aligns with $7M-$8M per berth estimate. This $45M figure is subset of total $91M-$104M needed across all three California terminals.

#### 3. Vessel Shore Power Compatibility

**Vessel Retrofit Requirements:**
- **Capital cost per vessel:** $500K-$1.5M to install shore power connection systems²⁴
- **PMSC container ship fleet:** 18 vessels
- **Estimated retrofit cost (if not already equipped):** $9M-$27M fleet-wide

**Alternative: Emissions Capture and Control Technology**
- Cost-effective alternative to vessel retrofits
- Capture systems mounted on dock, no vessel modifications required
- **Cost:** $2M-$4M per berth for capture system
- Operational complexity: Requires certified emissions reduction performance testing
- Used successfully by some PMSC competitor terminals

#### 4. Compliance Performance and Enforcement

**2024 Compliance Rate:** Over 95% compliance with 2020 At-Berth Regulation across California ports²⁵

**PMSC Compliance Status [METHODOLOGY: Industry average applied]:**
Assuming PMSC performs at or above industry average, expect 93-97% visit compliance at berths with shore power equipped. However, **non-equipped berths create compliance gap**.

**Enforcement Actions - Comparable Cases:**

1. **Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A. Settlement (January 2025):**
   - Settlement amount: **$1,990,650**
   - **Largest penalty to date** for California Ocean-Going Vessel At Berth Regulation violations²⁶
   - Demonstrates CARB's aggressive enforcement posture

2. **Typical Enforcement Progression:**
   - Letters of Warning (LOW)
   - Notices of Violation (NOV)
   - Civil Penalties (assessed per visit, $1,000-$10,000 range historically, escalating to $1.99M Del Monte case)

**PMSC Exposure Estimate [METHODOLOGY: Comparable enforcement]:**

Assumptions:
- 13 non-compliant berths (LA 6 + Long Beach 5 + Oakland 2)
- Average 200 vessel visits per berth annually = 2,600 total non-compliant visits
- CARB enforcement probability: 30-50% over 2-year period (2025-2026)
- If enforced, penalty range: $2,000-$5,000 per visit (conservative, below Del Monte penalty intensity)

**Estimated exposure: $5.2M-$13M penalties** if CARB enforcement action initiated before shore power installations complete

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Prioritize shore power installations at highest-volume berths (LA Terminal Pier 300)
2. Accelerated timeline: Complete within 18-24 months vs. 5-year phasing
3. Negotiate compliance schedule with CARB (similar to stipulated agreements other terminal operators have achieved)
4. Interim: Maximize use of alternative control technology where available

#### 5. Federal Authorization and Legal Framework

**EPA Authorization:** Federal Register published October 20, 2023, granting EPA authorization for California's 2020 At Berth Regulation amendments, confirming federal preemption waiver under Clean Air Act § 209(e) for nonroad engines.²⁷

**Legal Significance:** EPA authorization eliminates preemption defenses for vessel operators. California regulations are federally authorized and enforceable.

**Cross-Reference to Sierra Club Litigation:** Shore power requirements under CARB At-Berth Regulation overlap substantially with Sierra Club's Clean Air Act citizen suit demands. Settlement of Sierra Club litigation could incorporate CARB compliance timeline, potentially reducing duplicative obligations.

#### 6. Financial Summary: Shore Power Compliance Pathway

| Cost Category | Amount | Timeline | Funding Source Options |
|--------------|--------|----------|------------------------|
| **Shore power infrastructure (13 berths)** | $91M-$104M | 24-36 months | Capital budget, EPA grants (Port of LA awarded $412M EPA grant Oct 2024 for ZE transformation) |
| **Vessel retrofits (18 container ships)** | $9M-$27M | 18-24 months | Capital budget, potential cost-sharing with other terminal operators/ports |
| **Alternative control technology (interim)** | $8M-$16M | 12 months | Capital budget |
| **CARB penalty exposure (if delayed)** | $5.2M-$13M | Immediate | Operating expenses |
| **Total Compliance Cost** | **$113M-$160M** | 36 months | |

**EPA Grant Opportunity:** Port of Los Angeles received **$412M EPA grant** (announced October 2024) for zero-emission port transformation, which may provide co-funding for PMSC's shore power infrastructure investments.²² PMSC should coordinate with Port of LA to access grant funds, potentially reducing net capital outlay by 30-50% ($35M-$70M grant allocation).

### E. Oil Pollution Act Liability for March 2023 Bunker Spill

#### 1. Incident Summary [VERIFIED via research plan]

**Date:** March 2023
**Location:** Long Beach Terminal (Pier J)
**Vessel:** M/V Pacific Atlas
**Circumstances:** During bunkering operations, hose ruptured
**Volume:** 18,000 gallons heavy fuel oil (HFO) spilled into harbor
**Response:** PMSC activated spill response plan, deployed booms/skimmers/absorbent pads, recovered 95% of oil within 48 hours

#### 2. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 Liability Framework (33 U.S.C. § 2702)

**Statutory Basis:** OPA 90 imposes **strict liability** for oil spills from vessels into navigable waters of the U.S., regardless of fault.²⁸

**Definition of "Oil":** Under OPA 90, "oil" means oil of any kind or in any form, including petroleum, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil.²⁹ Bunker fuel (HFO) clearly falls within this definition.

**Liable Party:** The responsible party for a vessel is the owner or operator of the vessel from which oil is discharged.³⁰ PMSC, as vessel owner and terminal operator, is strictly liable under 33 U.S.C. § 2702(a).

**Recoverable Damages (33 U.S.C. § 2702(b)):**
1. Natural resources damages
2. Real or personal property damages
3. Subsistence use losses
4. Revenues lost
5. Profits and earning capacity lost
6. Public services costs (cleanup, emergency response)

#### 3. Cleanup Costs and Coast Guard Enforcement

**Spill Response Costs [VERIFIED via research plan]:**
- Cleanup costs: **$850K** (PMSC-funded response contractor, boom deployment, skimming operations, absorbent materials, waste disposal)
- Covered by P&I club: $850K subject to $500K deductible
- **PMSC net cost: $500K** (deductible) + **$350K from P&I club**

**Coast Guard Investigation Findings:**
- Violation: 33 CFR Part 155, Subpart B (failure to maintain bunker hose beyond service life, not inspected per required schedule)
- Finding: Bunker hose was 8 years old, exceeded manufacturer-recommended 5-year service life
- Finding: PMSC's inspection logs showed hose last inspected 14 months prior (required: quarterly per 33 CFR § 155.750)

**Coast Guard Civil Penalty:**
- Proposed penalty: $185K under 33 U.S.C. § 1321(b) (Clean Water Act oil spill provisions)
- **PMSC paid: $185K (August 2023)**
- No criminal prosecution: DOJ declined criminal referral, finding no intent to violate and adequate spill response mitigated environmental harm

**Total Immediate Costs:**
- Cleanup: $500K (PMSC deductible)
- Coast Guard penalty: $185K
- **Subtotal: $685K**

#### 4. NOAA Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA)

**Regulatory Authority:** 15 CFR Part 990 governs NOAA's natural resource damage assessment process under OPA 90.³¹

**Assessment Process:**
1. **Preassessment (2023):** NOAA and California Department of Fish & Wildlife (co-trustees) conducted initial injury determination
   - Documented impacts: Oiled shoreline (2,400 linear feet), killed fish (estimated 150-300 individuals), oiled seabirds (18 documented), benthic habitat contamination

2. **Assessment Phase (2024-2025):** [PENDING - per research plan]
   - Quantify injury severity and extent
   - Determine baseline natural resource conditions
   - Calculate restoration scaling (how much restoration required to compensate for injury)

3. **Restoration Planning:** Will follow assessment, typically proposes habitat restoration projects equivalent to compensate for injuries

**Comparable NOAA NRD Settlements:**

1. **Cosco Busan (San Francisco Bay, 2007):**
   - Spill volume: 53,000 gallons bunker fuel
   - **NRD settlement: $44.4M** (with responsible parties)³²
   - Note: 2.9× larger spill than PMSC incident

2. **LLOG Exploration (Gulf of Mexico, 2023):**
   - Spill volume: 672,000 gallons crude oil
   - **NRD settlement: $3.1M**³³
   - Note: 37× larger spill than PMSC incident

3. **Richmond, CA oil spill (San Francisco Bay Estuary):**
   - Spill volume: not specified (smaller harbor spill)
   - **NRD settlement: $450K (restoration) + $200K (assessment costs) = $650K total**³⁴

**PMSC Exposure Estimate [METHODOLOGY: Proportional comparison to Cosco Busan and Richmond settlements]:**

Cosco Busan: $44.4M ÷ 53,000 gallons = $838 per gallon NRD liability
Richmond: $450K ÷ estimated 5,000 gallons = $90 per gallon (smaller harbor spill, less sensitive habitat)

PMSC spill: 18,000 gallons × $90-$838/gallon = **$1.62M-$15.08M range**

**Adjusted for:**
- Harbor location (less sensitive than open bay): -40%
- Rapid response (95% recovered within 48 hours): -30%
- Limited documented wildlife injury: -20%

**Estimated NOAA NRD Assessment: $2M-$5M** (midpoint $3.5M)

**Status [PENDING]:** Research plan states NOAA NRD assessment pending. Typical timeline: 18-36 months from spill for assessment completion, followed by settlement negotiations (6-12 months).

**Expected Settlement Timeline:** Q3 2025 - Q2 2026

#### 5. P&I Club Coverage

**Insurance Coverage [Cross-reference T10 Insurance Coverage specialist]:**
- PMSC is member of American Steamship Owners Mutual P&I Association
- Coverage: $1B per occurrence
- Deductible: $500K per claim

**OPA 90 COFR Requirement:** Coast Guard requires Certificate of Financial Responsibility (COFR) demonstrating $1B financial responsibility for PMSC's fleet, provided by P&I club guarantee.³⁵

**March 2023 Spill Coverage:**
- Cleanup costs: $850K covered (less $500K deductible)
- Coast Guard penalty: $185K **not covered** (P&I clubs typically exclude fines/penalties but cover legal defense costs)
- NOAA NRD: **$2M-$5M will be covered** by P&I club under OPA natural resource damage provisions (33 U.S.C. § 2706), subject to $500K deductible already paid for cleanup

**PMSC Net Exposure:**
- Already paid: $685K (cleanup deductible + CG penalty)
- Future NOAA NRD: **$0-$4.5M** (range depends on assessment; deductible already satisfied by cleanup costs, P&I covers balance)
- **Most likely outcome: $0 additional exposure** beyond $685K already paid, as NOAA assessment likely $2M-$3M falls within P&I coverage

#### 6. Preventive Measures and Corrective Actions

**PMSC Actions Post-Spill [recommended for data room verification]:**
1. Replaced all bunker hoses fleet-wide (estimated cost $150K)
2. Implemented enhanced inspection protocol (quarterly vs. annual)
3. Mandated maximum 5-year hose service life (below manufacturer 7-year rating)
4. Conducted crew training on hose inspection procedures
5. Installed hose pressure monitoring systems ($50K per vessel × 22 = $1.1M capital investment)

**Total remediation investment: ~$1.4M**

**Future Risk Mitigation:**
- Enhanced bunker hose maintenance reduces future spill probability
- Clean spill record essential for P&I club membership renewal (rates may increase with repeat incidents)
- Coast Guard will scrutinize future Port State Control inspections for bunker operations compliance

#### 7. Transaction Impact

**Disclosed Contingent Liability:** $2M-$5M NOAA NRD assessment (likely covered by P&I club, minimal net cost to PMSC)

**Historical Cost:** $685K cleanup/penalty + $1.4M remediation = $2.085M already incurred

**Reputational Impact:** Single spill incident with 95% recovery and no criminal prosecution represents relatively favorable outcome. However, multiple spills would materially impact:
- P&I club membership/rates
- Charter party terms (charterers may demand environmental performance warranties)
- Port authority relationships (ports may prioritize berth assignments to operators with clean environmental records)

**Recommendation:** Buyer should:
1. Verify P&I club coverage confirmation for NOAA NRD claim
2. Review P&I club renewal terms post-acquisition (environmental claims history affects rates)
3. Obtain NOAA assessment status update (expected Q3 2025 completion)
4. Request escrow $2M-$3M of purchase price pending NOAA settlement (released upon settlement within estimated range)

### F. Ballast Water Management Convention Compliance (33 CFR Part 151, Subpart D)

#### 1. Regulatory Framework

**IMO BWM Convention:** Entered into force September 8, 2017; U.S. ratified and implemented through 33 CFR Part 151, Subpart D

**Requirement:** All vessels ≥400 gross tonnage must install Coast Guard-approved ballast water management system (BWMS) to treat ballast water discharges, meeting Ballast Water Discharge Standard (BWDS) of <10 viable organisms per m³ for organisms ≥50 micrometers.³⁶

**PMSC Fleet Compliance [VERIFIED via research plan]:**
- All 22 vessels equipped with Coast Guard-approved BWMS
- Technology types: UV treatment, electrolysis, chemical treatment (varies by vessel)
- Compliance: 100% of fleet meets 33 CFR § 151.2025 requirements

#### 2. M/V Pacific Titan BWMS Failure (November 2024)

**Incident [Cross-reference T3 Coast Guard Vessel Safety specialist]:**
- During drydock at Keppel Singapore, BWMS failure discovered
- Failure contributed to ballast tank corrosion (15 shell plates corroded from 8mm to 6mm, below 7mm minimum)
- Root cause: BWMS malfunction allowed untreated seawater, accelerating corrosion

**Replacement:**
- Old system removed, replaced with GEA Westfalia BWMS
- Cost: **$2.8M** (equipment $1.8M + installation labor $1M)
- Insurance coverage: Initially disputed by hull & machinery insurers (claimed BWMS not covered under hull policy, requires separate machinery breakdown endorsement)
- Actual recovery: **$0** - insurers denied claim, PMSC bore full $2.8M cost [per research plan analysis]

**Regulatory Reporting [33 CFR § 151.2040]:**
When BWMS stops operating properly during voyage, vessel must report to nearest Captain of the Port (COTP) or District Commander as soon as practicable.³⁷ Vessel may continue to next port of call subject to COTP directions.

**M/V Pacific Titan Compliance:**
- BWMS failure discovered during scheduled drydock (not during voyage)
- No violation of 33 CFR reporting requirements
- No ballast water discharge occurred while BWMS inoperative
- Replacement completed before vessel returned to service

**Coast Guard Enforcement Context:**
- **Civil penalties:** Up to $27,500 per day for violations of 33 CFR Part 151, Subpart D³⁸
- **Criminal penalties:** Class C felony for knowing violations
- **2020 Enforcement Statistics:** 8 Letters of Warning, 11 Notices of Violation, 4 Civil Penalties issued for ballast water violations³⁹
- **Common deficiencies:** 42% involved inoperable BWMS, 22% incomplete BWM plans, 13% failures to report to NBIC (National Ballast Information Clearinghouse)⁴⁰

**PMSC's Compliance Posture:**
- No Coast Guard enforcement actions related to ballast water management
- Enhanced maintenance program implemented post-Pacific Titan failure: **$150K-$250K annually** for quarterly BWMS inspections fleet-wide (increased from annual inspections)⁴¹

#### 3. Ballast Water Management Risks Going Forward

**Risk #1: BWMS Equipment Failure**
- Marine environment (saltwater, vibration, temperature extremes) stresses BWMS components
- Typical BWMS service life: 10-15 years
- Fleet average age: 8-12 years → several vessels approaching BWMS replacement cycle
- **Projected capital: $2M-$3M per vessel × 8-10 vessels over next 5 years = $16M-$30M**

**Risk #2: Port State Control Detention**
- Inoperable BWMS is detainable deficiency under Paris MOU and U.S. Coast Guard PSC procedures
- If BWMS fails during voyage and vessel discharges non-compliant ballast water, Coast Guard may detain vessel until repairs complete
- **Detention cost:** $200K-$500K per day (lost revenue, crew wages, port fees, cargo delay penalties)

**Risk #3: Lack of Consumables**
- Some BWMS require consumables (chemicals, UV lamp replacements)
- Coast Guard guidance: "Lack of consumables that render BWMS inoperable does not meet intent of 'stops operating properly' and will not justify employing alternative management method"⁴²
- Vessels must maintain adequate consumables inventory or face violations

**Mitigation Recommendations:**
1. Quarterly BWMS inspections (already implemented)
2. Maintain spare parts inventory for critical BWMS components ($500K fleet-wide investment)
3. Budget $3M-$6M annually for BWMS lifecycle replacements (2-3 vessels per year)
4. Enhanced crew training on BWMS operation and troubleshooting
5. Predictive maintenance program using BWMS performance data analytics

### G. IMO GHG Strategy Compliance Pathways and Capital Requirements

#### 1. IMO 2023 GHG Strategy Targets

**Net-Zero by 2050:** The 2023 IMO GHG Strategy (revised from 2018 strategy) aims to reach **net-zero GHG emissions by or around 2050**, representing significant escalation from previous 50% reduction target.⁴³

**Interim Checkpoints:**
- **2030:** At least 20% reduction (striving for 30%) compared to 2008 baseline⁴⁴
- **2040:** At least 70% reduction (striving for 80%) compared to 2008 baseline⁴⁵

**Carbon Intensity Target:** Reduce CO2 emissions per transport work by at least 40% by 2030 (average across international shipping)⁴⁶

**Alternative Fuels Target:** Zero or near-zero GHG emission technologies/fuels must represent at least 5% (striving for 10%) of energy used by international shipping by 2030.⁴⁷

#### 2. PMSC Fleet Decarbonization Pathway Analysis

**Current Emissions Profile [estimated]:**
- Annual fuel consumption: 2.4 million tons VLSFO
- CO2 emissions: 2.4M tons × 3.17 tons CO2/ton fuel = **7.61 million tons CO2 annually**
- Per TEU-mile intensity: 7.61M tons ÷ (342,000 TEU capacity × 50,000 miles average annual distance) = 0.445 kg CO2/TEU-mile

**2030 Compliance Requirement (40% intensity reduction):**
- Target intensity: 0.445 × 0.6 = **0.267 kg CO2/TEU-mile**
- Required reduction: **2.74 million tons CO2** (36% of current emissions)

**2050 Net-Zero Requirement:**
- **Zero fossil fuel consumption** or 100% carbon offset/capture
- Requires transition to zero-carbon fuels (e-methanol, e-ammonia, hydrogen) or carbon capture systems

#### 3. Technology Pathways and Capital Requirements

**Pathway A: Energy Efficiency Improvements (2026-2030)**

Deployed technologies:
1. **Rotor sails (wind-assist):** 10-20% fuel reduction, $3M-$5M per vessel
   - Priority: 4 bulk carriers + 6 older container ships = **$30M-$50M**
   - Annual fuel savings: 240K-480K tons × $200/ton = $48M-$96M
   - Payback: 4-12 months

2. **Air lubrication systems:** 7-12% fuel reduction, $2M-$3M per vessel
   - Deploy on 8 high-utilization vessels = **$16M-$24M**
   - Annual fuel savings: 168K-288K tons × $200/ton = $34M-$58M
   - Payback: 4-8 months

3. **Advanced hull coatings:** 3-5% fuel reduction, $500K per vessel
   - Apply to all 22 vessels over drydock cycle = **$11M**
   - Annual fuel savings: 72K-120K tons × $200/ton = $14M-$24M
   - Payback: 5-9 months

**Total Pathway A Investment: $57M-$85M**
**Total Annual Fuel Savings: 480K-888K tons (20-37% reduction)**
**Achieves 2030 compliance: Partial (need 36% reduction, achieves 20-37%)**

**Pathway B: Alternative Fuel Transition (2030-2040)**

**Option B1: LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas)**
- **IMO analysis:** LNG lacks GHG reduction potential to comply with 2040+ targets, not viable long-term⁴⁸
- Environmental/financial concerns rule out major LNG role⁴⁹
- **Recommendation:** Do not invest in LNG conversion**Pathway B2: Methanol (Transitional)**
- Methanol-ready engines commercially available (MAN Energy Solutions, Wärtsilä)
- **Newbuild cost premium:** $5M-$10M per vessel vs. conventional diesel
- **Retrofit cost:** $15M-$25M per vessel (engine replacement)
- **Fuel cost:** Conventional methanol $400-$600/ton vs. VLSFO $200/ton (2× cost), but e-methanol $800-$1,200/ton (4-6× cost)
- **GHG reduction:** Conventional methanol 10-15%, e-methanol 85-95%⁵⁰
- **Infrastructure:** Methanol bunkering available at limited ports (Rotterdam, Singapore, Los Angeles planning)

**Recommendation:** Defer methanol retrofits until:
1. E-methanol production scales (currently <1% of methanol supply)
2. Bunkering infrastructure expands to Asia-Pacific routes
3. Fuel cost gap narrows (anticipated 2035-2040 as e-fuel production scales)

**Pathway B3: Ammonia (Long-term)**
- E-ammonia: 85-95% GHG reduction potential⁵¹
- Technology maturity: Pilot phase, first commercial ammonia-powered vessels launching 2025-2027
- **Engine cost:** $20M-$30M per vessel (newbuild or retrofit)
- **Safety concerns:** Ammonia toxicity requires enhanced crew training, safety systems
- **Timeline:** Commercial readiness 2030-2035

**Pathway C: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**
- Onboard CO2 capture from exhaust: 70-90% capture efficiency
- **Cost:** $10M-$15M per vessel installation + $50-$100/ton CO2 operating cost
- **Storage:** Requires CO2 offloading infrastructure at ports (not currently available)
- **Timeline:** Demonstration projects 2025-2028, commercial deployment 2030+

#### 4. Recommended Decarbonization Strategy (2026-2050)

**Phase 1 (2026-2030): Energy Efficiency - $57M-$85M**
- Deploy ESDs (rotor sails, air lubrication, hull coatings) achieving 20-37% fuel reduction
- Maintain VLSFO fuel (proven, compliant with current regulations)
- Monitor alternative fuel market development

**Phase 2 (2030-2035): Fuel Transition Planning - $10M-$20M**
- Pilot methanol-ready vessels (2-3 newbuilds with dual-fuel engines)
- Invest in e-fuel supply chain partnerships
- Evaluate ammonia technology maturity
- Capex: $10M-$20M planning/pilot phase

**Phase 3 (2035-2045): Fleet Conversion - $800M-$1.2B**
- Convert 12-15 vessels to e-methanol/e-ammonia (prioritize youngest, highest-value vessels)
- Retrofit cost: $15M-$25M × 12-15 vessels = $180M-$375M
- Replace 7-10 oldest vessels with zero-carbon newbuilds: $100M-$120M per vessel = $700M-$1.2B
- **Total Phase 3 Capex: $880M-$1.575B**

**Phase 4 (2045-2050): Net-Zero Achievement - $200M-$400M**
- Final vessel conversions
- Carbon offset purchases for residual emissions
- CCS installation if economically viable

**Total 25-Year Decarbonization Investment: $1.15B-$1.68B**

**Impact on Transaction Value:**
- Decarbonization capex represents 24-35% of current enterprise value ($4.8B)
- Buyer must assess willingness to fund multi-decade capital program
- Alternative: Accelerate vessel replacement cycle, scrap non-compliant vessels by 2040

**Competitive Dynamics:**
- All maritime operators face identical IMO mandates
- Early movers (deploying ESDs 2026-2030) gain:
  - Fuel cost savings ($48M-$96M annually)
  - Regulatory compliance certainty
  - Customer preference (cargo interests increasingly demand low-carbon shipping)
  - Access to EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) credits

**Recommendation:** Buyer should negotiate seller commitment to:
1. Complete Phase 1 ESD installations ($57M-$85M) prior to closing or reduce purchase price accordingly
2. Establish decarbonization reserve fund ($50M-$100M) dedicated to Phase 2-4 investments
3. Engage classification societies and fuel suppliers on alternative fuel readiness assessments

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Potential Financial Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Timeline |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Sierra Club CAA citizen suit settlement** | High | Probable (60-75% settlement within 18 months) | $226M-$306M settlement<br>Alt: $400M EV loss (terminal exit) | Purchase price reduction, escrow $100M-$150M, indemnity cap $150M | Immediate |
| **CARB At-Berth Regulation enforcement** | Medium | Possible (30-50% over 24 months) | $5.2M-$13M penalties + $113M-$160M compliance capital | Accelerated shore power installations (18-24 months), access EPA grant co-funding | 24-36 months |
| **CII D-rated vessels (2 bulk carriers)** | Medium | Certain (3 consecutive years D-rating triggers corrective action plan) | $39.5M-$55.3M scrapping loss if no action | $9M rotor sail + hull coating investment (1.2-year payback) | Immediate |
| **NOAA NRD assessment (March 2023 bunker spill)** | Low | Certain (assessment pending completion) | $2M-$5M gross, $0-$4.5M net after P&I coverage | Escrow $2M-$3M pending settlement, verify P&I coverage | Q3 2025-Q2 2026 |
| **BWMS lifecycle replacements** | Medium | Certain (8-10 vessels approaching end-of-life) | $16M-$30M capital over 5 years | Budget $3M-$6M annually, maintain spare parts inventory, quarterly inspections | 2026-2030 |
| **IMO GHG Phase 1 (2030 compliance)** | Medium | Certain (regulatory mandate) | $57M-$85M ESD installations | Immediate investment (4-12 month payback from fuel savings) | 2026-2030 |
| **IMO GHG Phase 3 (2050 net-zero)** | High | Certain (regulatory mandate) | $880M-$1.575B fleet conversion/replacements | Phased investment, technology monitoring, e-fuel partnerships | 2035-2045 |
| **MARPOL Annex VI fuel management violations** | Medium | Possible (if dual-fuel strategy adopted) | $500K criminal penalties per violation + obstruction of justice | Maintain conservative single-fuel strategy unless controls enhanced | Ongoing |
| **Port State Control detention (BWMS failure)** | Medium | Possible (if BWMS fails during voyage) | $200K-$500K per day detention costs | Quarterly inspections, crew training, predictive maintenance | Ongoing |
| **P&I club rate increases** | Low | Possible (post-acquisition environmental claims review) | 10-25% premium increase ($1M-$2.5M annually) | Demonstrate enhanced environmental compliance program, BWMS/bunker hose remediation investments | Annual renewal |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Sierra Club Litigation Discovery Status:** Motion to dismiss pending (Q1 2025 hearing). If denied, discovery will reveal internal PMSC communications regarding air quality compliance decisions. Buyer should request:
   - All Sierra Club discovery responses to date
   - PMSC's defense strategy memoranda
   - Any settlement demand letters or offer proposals exchanged

2. **LA Terminal Lease Termination Economics:** PMSC's calculation of "economic infeasibility" under lease termination provision requires independent validation:
   - Review lease Section [X] termination clause exact language
   - Obtain Port of LA's position on whether $315M capital mandate triggers termination right
   - Analyze whether Port could block termination or impose penalties

3. **CII Corrective Action Plan Status:** Research plan states PMSC "must" submit SEEMP Part III but doesn't confirm whether submitted:
   - Verify with flag state whether plans submitted for M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge
   - If submitted, obtain copies and flag state approval status
   - If not submitted, determine penalty exposure for late submission

4. **NOAA NRD Assessment Coordination:** Typical NRDA timeline suggests assessment should be near completion (March 2023 + 18-24 months = Q3 2024-Q1 2025):
   - Request status update from NOAA Natural Resource Trustee
   - Obtain copies of any draft restoration scaling documents
   - Determine whether PMSC has been provided preliminary damage estimate

5. **Pacific Titan BWMS Insurance Denial Precedent:** $2.8M uninsured loss suggests potential systemic gap in fleet-wide coverage:
   - Review all hull & machinery policies for BWMS coverage exclusions
   - Determine whether other 21 vessels have same coverage gap
   - Calculate potential uninsured exposure if multiple BWMS failures occur simultaneously

6. **EPA ECHO Database Verification:** Research plan assumes clean compliance record [HYPOTHETICAL]:
   - Conduct EPA ECHO searches for all 22 vessels using IMO numbers
   - Confirm no undisclosed Notices of Violation, civil penalties, or ongoing investigations
   - Cross-reference with Coast Guard Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) database

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Quantified Exposure Summary (5-Year Horizon):**

| Category | Low Case | Base Case | High Case | Weighted Expected Value (Probability-Adjusted) |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Sierra Club Settlement | $226M (25%) | $266M (50%) | $306M (25%) | **$266M** |
| LA Terminal Exit (Alternative) | $0 (75%) | $0 (50%) | $400M (25%) | **$100M** (downside scenario) |
| CARB At-Berth Penalties | $0 (50%) | $5.2M (30%) | $13M (20%) | **$4.16M** |
| CARB Shore Power Capital | $48M (EPA grant max) | $86M | $125M (no EPA grant) | **$86M** (assumed 40% grant probability) |
| CII Compliance (2 vessels) | $9M (100%) | $9M | $9M | **$9M** (rotor sails mandatory) |
| IMO GHG Phase 1 ESDs | $57M (100%) | $71M | $85M | **$71M** (regulatory mandate) |
| BWMS Replacements | $16M (100%) | $23M | $30M | **$23M** (lifecycle requirement) |
| NOAA NRD (net after P&I) | $0 (60%) | $2M (30%) | $4.5M (10%) | **$1.05M** |
| **Total Expected Exposure (5 years)** | **$356M** | **$462M** | **$972.5M** | **$460.21M** |

**Key Observations:**
1. **Binary Outcome Risk:** LA Terminal exit scenario creates non-linear risk profile. $100M weighted downside scenario significantly understates tail risk if 25% probability materializes.
2. **Sierra Club Settlement Concentration:** $266M represents 58% of total expected 5-year environmental exposure, making litigation outcome critical transaction variable.
3. **EPA Grant Leverage:** CARB shore power cost variance ($48M-$125M) depends entirely on EPA grant access. PMSC should prioritize Port of LA grant coordination pre-closing to reduce uncertainty.
4. **Regulatory Mandates (Non-Discretionary):** $103M (CII $9M + IMO GHG $71M + BWMS $23M) represents unavoidable 5-year capital, independent of litigation outcomes.

### D. Successor Liability Considerations

**Environmental Liability Transfer Under Federal Statutes:**

1. **OPA 90 Successor Liability (33 U.S.C. § 2702):**
   - Liability attaches to "owner or operator" of vessel at time of discharge
   - **March 2023 bunker spill:** Pre-acquisition spill, but NOAA NRD assessment pending. Buyer succeeds to PMSC's OPA 90 liability if acquisition structured as stock purchase (buyer becomes vessel owner).
   - **Mitigation:** Asset purchase exempts buyer from pre-closing OPA 90 liability (seller retains vessel ownership until closing, liability remains with seller for pre-closing incidents).
   - **Indemnity:** If stock purchase, require seller indemnity for all pre-closing environmental liabilities, including specifically the March 2023 bunker spill and pending NOAA NRD assessment.

2. **Clean Air Act Successor Liability (42 U.S.C. § 7413):**
   - Sierra Club citizen suit names PMSC as defendant for alleged violations dating to 2015
   - **Stock purchase:** Buyer succeeds to all PMSC liabilities, including Sierra Club litigation
   - **Asset purchase:** Buyer may still face successor liability under common law "substantial continuity" doctrine if buyer: (a) acquires substantially all assets, (b) continues same business, (c) retains same management/workforce
   - **De facto merger doctrine:** Courts may pierce asset purchase to impose successor liability if transaction structured to avoid liabilities while continuing same operations

3. **CARB At-Berth Regulation Enforcement:**
   - California environmental agencies have aggressively pursued successor liability theories
   - Del Monte $1.99M settlement (January 2025) demonstrates CARB enforcement intensity
   - **Mitigation:** Negotiate CARB tolling agreement pre-closing, confirming no undisclosed violations and establishing baseline compliance status

### E. Insurance Coverage Gaps Identified

1. **BWMS Machinery Breakdown:** Pacific Titan $2.8M loss, $0 recovery
   - **Gap:** Hull & machinery policies exclude BWMS unless machinery breakdown endorsement purchased
   - **Fleet Exposure:** 22 vessels × $2M-$3M replacement cost = $44M-$66M uninsured exposure if multiple failures
   - **Remediation Cost:** Machinery breakdown endorsement ~$150K-$300K annually for fleet

2. **Environmental Penalties and Fines:**
   - P&I clubs typically exclude civil/criminal fines, penalties, and punitive damages
   - Coast Guard $185K bunker spill penalty NOT covered by P&I
   - Potential CARB At-Berth penalties $5.2M-$13M NOT covered
   - **Mitigation:** Consider environmental impairment liability (EIL) policy covering fines/penalties (premium ~$500K-$1M annually for $10M-$25M coverage)

3. **Consent Decree Compliance Costs:**
   - If Sierra Club case settles via consent decree, injunctive relief compliance costs ($200M-$250M capital investment) NOT covered by any insurance
   - Legal defense costs covered by P&I, but settlement/judgment amounts typically excluded if characterized as "punitive" or "regulatory compliance"
   - **Note:** This is not insurable risk; must be allocated contractually between buyer/seller via purchase price, indemnities, escrows

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Material Environmental Liabilities Identified:** PMSC faces $460M (weighted expected value) in 5-year environmental compliance obligations, concentrated in three critical areas: (a) Sierra Club Clean Air Act litigation ($266M settlement exposure), (b) IMO GHG Phase 1 decarbonization ($71M mandatory capital), and (c) CARB At-Berth shore power compliance ($86M net after EPA grant co-funding). These obligations represent 9.6% of $4.8B transaction value and materially affect purchase price negotiations.

**2. Binary Risk: LA Terminal Exit:** Alternative outcome if Sierra Club litigation results in economically infeasible compliance mandate: PMSC exercises lease termination right, exits LA Terminal, suffers $40M annual EBITDA loss = **$400M enterprise value reduction** (at 10× multiple). This tail risk (25% probability) creates non-linear transaction risk profile requiring sophisticated contractual protection (MAE carve-out, escrows, indemnities).

**3. IMO Compliance Pathway Clear:** PMSC's path to 2030 IMO GHG compliance is technically and economically straightforward: $57M-$85M investment in energy-saving devices (rotor sails, air lubrication, hull coatings) delivers **4-12 month payback** via $48M-$96M annual fuel savings. This investment is non-discretionary (regulatory mandate) and economically compelling (rapid ROI). PMSC's inexplicable delay suggests either capital constraints, management inertia, or strategic deferral pending transaction. Buyer should mandate completion as closing condition.

**4. CII D-Rated Vessels Require Immediate Action:** M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge face regulatory and economic jeopardy. Three consecutive years D-rating (2022-2024) triggers SEEMP Part III corrective action plan requirement. Without intervention, vessels face: (a) flag state operational restrictions, (b) charter party termination rights, (c) scrapping decision with $39.5M-$55.3M net economic loss. **$9M rotor sail investment prevents $40M-$55M asset destruction** - compelling business case for immediate action.

**5. MARPOL Compliance Conservative but Costly:** PMSC's single-fuel strategy (0.1% VLSFO globally) sacrifices $270M-$360M annual fuel cost savings to ensure MARPOL Annex VI compliance certainty. This trade-off prioritizes regulatory risk avoidance over economic optimization. Post-acquisition, buyer should evaluate whether enhanced operational controls justify dual-fuel strategy, but current assessment: **risk/reward favors status quo** given $500K criminal penalty exposure and Coast Guard enforcement intensity (9,500 annual PSC inspections, 80+ violations discovered over 3.5 years).

**6. OPA 90 Exposure Manageable:** March 2023 bunker spill (18,000 gallons HFO) resulted in effective response (95% recovery), Coast Guard penalty paid ($185K), and remediation investments completed ($1.4M). Pending NOAA NRD assessment ($2M-$5M gross exposure) likely fully covered by P&I club, resulting in minimal net buyer exposure. Single spill incident does not indicate systemic compliance failure. **Recommendation: Escrow $2M-$3M pending NOAA settlement, verify P&I coverage.**

**7. Long-Term Decarbonization Fundamental Industry Challenge:** IMO 2023 GHG Strategy's net-zero 2050 mandate requires $1.15B-$1.68B investment over 25 years (24-35% of current enterprise value). This is not PMSC-specific risk - **all maritime operators face identical decarbonization imperative**. Competitive advantage accrues to early movers deploying Phase 1 ESDs (2026-2030) capturing fuel cost savings and customer preference for low-carbon shipping. Technology pathway: e-methanol/e-ammonia emergence 2035-2040 for Phase 3 fleet conversion. LNG not viable long-term solution per IMO analysis.

**8. Insurance Program Gaps:** Pacific Titan BWMS failure ($2.8M, $0 recovery) exposes hull & machinery policy gap - **machinery breakdown endorsement absent** despite $44M-$66M fleet-wide BWMS replacement exposure. P&I club exclusion of fines/penalties creates potential $5.2M-$13M uninsured CARB exposure. **Recommendation: Add machinery breakdown coverage ($150K-$300K annually), consider environmental impairment liability policy ($500K-$1M premium for $10M-$25M coverage).**

### B. Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing):**

1. **Initiate Sierra Club Settlement Negotiations:** PMSC should engage Sierra Club and South Coast Air Quality Management District in good-faith settlement discussions targeting $225M-$275M resolution (midpoint of $226M-$306M range). Delay increases litigation costs and uncertainty. Settlement pre-closing provides transaction certainty.

2. **Submit CII Corrective Action Plans:** PMSC must file SEEMP Part III for M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge with flag state within 30 days, obtaining classification society approval within 90 days. Noncompliance risks flag state enforcement escalation and charter party default.

3. **EPA ECHO Verification:** Conduct comprehensive EPA ECHO database searches for all 22 vessels (by IMO number) and 4 terminals (by facility ID) to verify clean compliance record. Cross-reference Coast Guard MISLE database for Port State Control inspection deficiencies and enforcement actions.

4. **NOAA NRD Assessment Status:** Request status update from NOAA Natural Resource Trustee on March 2023 bunker spill assessment (expected Q3 2024-Q1 2025 completion). Obtain preliminary damage estimate if available. Confirm P&I club acknowledges OPA 90 NRD coverage.

5. **Port of LA EPA Grant Coordination:** Engage Port of Los Angeles regarding $412M EPA Clean Ports Program grant allocation for PMSC shore power investments. Target 30-50% co-funding ($35M-$70M) to reduce net CARB At-Berth compliance capital from $113M-$160M to $48M-$125M.

**Transaction Structure Recommendations:**

6. **Purchase Price Adjustment:** Negotiate $300M-$400M reduction reflecting: (a) immediate 5-year environmental capital requirements ($356M-$559.5M base case), (b) Sierra Club litigation risk premium, (c) CII non-compliance asset impairment risk. Alternative: Structured escrows and indemnities if seller resists headline purchase price reduction.

7. **Escrow Allocations:**
   - **$100M-$150M Sierra Club Litigation Escrow:** Released upon settlement within $226M-$306M estimated range OR 24 months post-closing, whichever occurs first. If settlement exceeds $306M, seller absorbs excess up to indemnity cap (below). If settlement below $226M, seller retains savings.
   - **$2M-$3M NOAA NRD Escrow:** Released upon NOAA settlement within estimated $2M-$5M range OR 18 months post-closing. Minimal risk given P&I coverage.

8. **Seller Indemnities:**
   - **Environmental Violations:** PMSC indemnifies buyer for all undisclosed pre-closing environmental violations, penalties, fines, and remediation costs discovered post-closing. Survival period: 5 years (reflects long-tail nature of environmental liability).
   - **Sierra Club Settlement Cap:** PMSC indemnifies buyer for Sierra Club settlement/judgment amounts from $0-$150M. Buyer bears amounts exceeding $150M as ongoing business risk of port operations (buyer has operational control post-closing to manage compliance). Cap indexed to final settlement amount, not preliminary demands.
   - **Specific Exclusions:** March 2023 bunker spill and NOAA NRD assessment specifically indemnified by seller (pre-closing incident, assessment pending).

9. **Material Adverse Effect (MAE) Carve-Out:**
   - Adverse Sierra Club judgment >$100M constitutes MAE permitting buyer to: (a) terminate purchase agreement without penalty, OR (b) reduce purchase price dollar-for-dollar above $100M threshold.
   - LA Terminal lease termination (whether voluntary PMSC election or Port of LA revocation) constitutes MAE given $40M annual EBITDA impact ($400M EV reduction).
   - CII corrective action plan rejection by flag state constitutes MAE for affected vessels (M/V Sierra Nevada, M/V Cascade Ridge) as assets would face operational restrictions/scrapping.

**Post-Closing Implementation:**

10. **IMO GHG Phase 1 ESD Deployment ($57M-$85M, 24-month timeline):**
    - **Priority Vessels:** 2 CII D-rated bulk carriers (rotor sails + hull coating, $9M) - immediate implementation to achieve C-rating upgrade
    - **High-Utilization Vessels:** 8 container ships (air lubrication systems, $16M-$24M) - maximize fuel savings ROI
    - **Remaining Fleet:** Hull coatings applied during scheduled drydock cycle ($11M over 24 months)
    - **Expected Outcomes:** 20-37% fleet-wide emission reduction, $48M-$96M annual fuel savings (4-12 month payback), 2030 IMO compliance achieved

11. **CARB At-Berth Shore Power Acceleration (18-24 month timeline):**
    - **LA Terminal Priority:** 6 berths shore power installation ($42M-$48M, net $25M-$29M after EPA grant)
    - **Long Beach Terminal:** 5 berths ($35M-$40M, net $21M-$24M after EPA grant)
    - **Oakland Terminal:** 2 berths ($14M-$16M, net $8M-$10M after EPA grant)
    - **Vessel Retrofits:** 18 container ships shore power connectivity ($9M-$27M)
    - **Total Net Investment:** $48M-$125M (after 30-50% EPA grant co-funding)
    - **Enforcement Mitigation:** Eliminates $5.2M-$13M CARB penalty exposure, aligns with Sierra Club settlement compliance timeline

12. **BWMS Lifecycle Replacement Program ($3M-$6M annually):**
    - **Immediate:** M/V Pacific Titan replacement completed (November 2024, $2.8M)
    - **2026-2030:** 8-10 vessels approaching BWMS end-of-life (10-15 year service life)
    - **Budget Allocation:** $3M-$6M annual capital budget for 2-3 vessel replacements per year
    - **Maintenance Protocol:** Quarterly inspections fleet-wide ($150K-$250K annually), spare parts inventory ($500K), predictive maintenance analytics
    - **Insurance Enhancement:** Add machinery breakdown coverage endorsement to hull & machinery policies ($150K-$300K annually) to avoid repeat of Pacific Titan $2.8M uninsured loss

13. **Decarbonization Reserve Fund ($50M-$100M):**
    - Establish dedicated fund for IMO GHG Phase 2-4 investments (2030-2050)
    - **Purpose:** Technology monitoring, e-fuel supply chain partnerships, pilot vessel conversions, alternative fuel infrastructure
    - **Governance:** Annual review of IMO regulatory developments, technology readiness assessments, competitive benchmarking
    - **Deployment:** Phase 2 (2030-2035) pilot programs $10M-$20M, Phase 3 (2035-2045) fleet conversion $880M-$1.575B (future funding required beyond reserve)

**Regulatory Engagement:**

14. **CARB Compliance Schedule Negotiation:** Engage California Air Resources Board to negotiate stipulated compliance schedule for At-Berth Regulation violations (if any discovered). Precedent: Other terminal operators have achieved phased compliance agreements avoiding immediate penalties in exchange for committed investment timelines.

15. **IMO Phase 1 CII Review Monitoring:** Track IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) outcomes from Phase 1 CII review (finalized 2025). Key issues: (a) enhanced enforcement mechanisms for D/E ratings, (b) potential port state control detention authority, (c) revised CII calculation methodology. Results will inform 2026-2030 compliance strategy.

16. **Flag State Coordination:** For U.S. flag vessels, coordinate with U.S. Coast Guard on SEEMP Part III corrective action plan approval process, CII rating verification, and BWMS compliance documentation. For foreign flag vessels, engage respective flag state administrations (assumed Marshall Islands, Liberia, Panama) on equivalent requirements.

**Insurance Program Optimization:**

17. **P&I Club Renewal (Annual):** Review environmental claims history impact on renewal terms. Demonstrate enhanced compliance program (BWMS/bunker hose remediation, shore power investments, ESD deployments) to mitigate potential 10-25% premium increases. Confirm OPA 90 NOAA NRD coverage explicitly in renewal terms given March 2023 spill precedent.

18. **Environmental Impairment Liability (EIL) Policy:** Obtain quote for EIL policy covering environmental fines, penalties, and remediation costs excluded by P&I club. Estimated premium $500K-$1M annually for $10M-$25M coverage. Cost-benefit analysis: $5.2M-$13M CARB penalty exposure justifies $500K premium (5-10% of exposure).

### C. Outstanding Questions

**Questions Requiring Data Room Verification:**

1. Has PMSC submitted SEEMP Part III corrective action plans for M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge? If yes, obtain copies and flag state approval status. If no, determine why delayed and penalty exposure for late submission.

2. What is exact language of LA Terminal lease Section [X] termination clause regarding "economic infeasibility"? Does $315M Sierra Club capital mandate trigger termination right? Has Port of LA acknowledged termination right or disputed interpretation?

3. Pacific Titan BWMS machinery breakdown insurance denial - do other 21 vessels have identical coverage gap? Review all hull & machinery policies to quantify fleet-wide uninsured BWMS exposure ($44M-$66M if all vessels lack coverage).

4. Sierra Club litigation discovery - what internal PMSC communications exist regarding Los Angeles Terminal air quality compliance decisions? Any "smoking gun" documents acknowledging violations? (Material to settlement value assessment.)

5. NOAA NRD assessment status - has NOAA provided PMSC with preliminary damage estimate for March 2023 bunker spill? Typical timeline suggests assessment near completion (March 2023 + 18-24 months). Early indication of whether exposure within $2M-$5M estimated range.

6. EPA $412M Clean Ports Program grant - has Port of Los Angeles committed specific allocation to PMSC shore power projects? Grant announcement (October 2024) references 337 yard tractors, 56 top handlers, shore power connections, but doesn't specify terminal operator allocations. Confirmation critical to net capital planning ($48M-$125M variance based on 30-50% co-funding assumption).

**Questions Requiring Legal Analysis:**

7. **Successor Liability Exposure:** If acquisition structured as asset purchase (rather than stock purchase), does "substantial continuity" doctrine apply to impose Clean Air Act successor liability for Sierra Club litigation? Analysis required: (a) percentage of assets acquired, (b) workforce retention percentage, (c) operational continuity indicators, (d) Ninth Circuit case law on environmental successor liability.

8. **CARB Tolling Agreement Feasibility:** Can buyer negotiate CARB tolling agreement pre-closing establishing baseline compliance status and precluding retroactive enforcement? California environmental agencies historically reluctant to provide compliance safe harbors, but precedent exists in hazardous waste context. Worth pursuing given $5.2M-$13M penalty exposure.

9. **Flag State CII Enforcement Authority:** Do U.S. or foreign flag states (Marshall Islands, Liberia, Panama) have authority to impose operational restrictions on vessels with persistent D/E CII ratings beyond SEEMP Part III corrective action plan requirement? IMO Phase 1 review (2025) may clarify enhanced enforcement mechanisms. Current regulatory gap creates uncertainty.

**Questions for Cross-Domain Specialists:**

10. **T3 (Coast Guard Vessel Safety):** Do 33 CFR Part 155 bunker hose violations ($185K Coast Guard penalty, March 2023) or BWMS failures (M/V Pacific Titan, November 2024) affect Certificate of Inspection (COI) renewal for affected vessels? COI suspension would ground vessels, creating immediate revenue loss.

11. **T7 (Port Lease Negotiations):** Can Port of Los Angeles EPA $412M grant co-fund PMSC shore power investments ($35M-$70M allocation targeted)? Grant application process, timeline, and allocation criteria require clarification. Material impact on net capital outlay ($113M-$160M vs. $48M-$125M).

12. **T8 (Ship Mortgage Covenants):** If PMSC exits LA Terminal (lease termination election), does $40M annual EBITDA loss trigger ship mortgage covenant defaults? Debt service coverage ratios, minimum EBITDA covenants, and cross-default provisions require review. Potential cascade: lease termination → covenant default → lender acceleration → forced asset sales.

13. **T10 (Insurance Coverage):** Confirm P&I club explicitly acknowledges OPA 90 NOAA NRD coverage for March 2023 bunker spill. Pacific Titan BWMS machinery breakdown coverage denial precedent suggests potential coverage disputes. Obtain P&I club's written confirmation of $2M-$5M NRD assessment coverage to avoid repeat of $2.8M uninsured Pacific Titan loss.

14. **T1 (Securities Disclosure):** How does $1.15B-$1.68B long-term IMO GHG decarbonization requirement affect: (a) goodwill/intangible asset impairment testing (vessels may become obsolete pre-2050 if not converted), (b) going concern analysis (capital requirements 24-35% of current EV), (c) Item 303 MD&A disclosure of known trends/uncertainties?

### D. Final Assessment

**Transaction Recommendation:** **PROCEED WITH MODIFIED TERMS**

Environmental compliance obligations are **material but manageable** with appropriate contractual risk allocation. Key transaction modifications required:

**1. Purchase Price:** Reduce by $300M-$400M reflecting immediate 5-year environmental capital requirements ($356M-$559.5M) and Sierra Club litigation risk premium. Alternative: Maintain headline price with $100M-$150M escrows and $150M indemnity cap.

**2. MAE Protection:** Carve out (a) Sierra Club adverse judgment >$100M, (b) LA Terminal lease termination, (c) CII corrective action plan rejection as buyer termination rights or price reduction triggers.

**3. Pre-Closing Covenants:** Mandate (a) Sierra Club settlement negotiations, (b) CII corrective action plan submissions, (c) NOAA NRD status update, (d) EPA grant coordination with Port of LA.

**4. Post-Closing Capital:** Commit $57M-$85M IMO GHG Phase 1 ESDs within 24 months (4-12 month payback justifies immediate deployment). Prioritize shore power investments ($48M-$125M net after EPA grants) within 18-24 months to eliminate CARB enforcement exposure.

**5. Insurance Enhancements:** Add machinery breakdown coverage ($150K-$300K annually), consider EIL policy ($500K-$1M annually), verify P&I NRD coverage.

**Red Flags Do Not Constitute Deal-Breakers:** Sierra Club litigation, CII D-ratings, NOAA NRD assessment, and BWMS failures represent **known, quantifiable risks** amenable to contractual allocation. All maritime operators face identical IMO decarbonization mandates - PMSC's environmental profile is **industry-typical**, not outlier. Transaction remains commercially viable with appropriate pricing adjustments and risk-sharing mechanisms.

**DATABASE PROVENANCE NOTE:** Due to the hypothetical nature of this scenario (Pacific Maritime Services Corporation is a fictional entity created for research plan demonstration purposes), specific EPA ECHO Facility IDs, Coast Guard Port State Control inspection reports, TTB permit numbers, and case docket numbers marked "[HYPOTHETICAL]" or "[PENDING VERIFICATION]" throughout this report represent realistic placeholders demonstrating proper citation methodology. In an actual transaction, all database identifiers would be verified through direct queries to EPA ECHO (https://echo.epa.gov/), Coast Guard MISLE, PACER (https://pacer.uscourts.gov/), and NOAA DARRP databases using vessel IMO numbers, terminal facility addresses, and party names.
