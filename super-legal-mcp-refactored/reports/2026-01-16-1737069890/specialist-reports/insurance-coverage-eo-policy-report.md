## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Purpose**: This report analyzes Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance coverage for Liberty Life Insurance Corporation's pending litigation (IUL class action and 12 FINRA arbitrations) in connection with American Financial Holdings LLC's proposed $2.9B acquisition. The analysis addresses coverage for $26.86M-$46.13M total claims exposure, self-insured retention exhaustion, tail coverage requirements for the M&A transaction, and uninsured exposure quantification for escrow/indemnification purposes.

### Key Findings Summary

**1. E&O Policy Structure (Chubb)**

Liberty Life maintains professional liability insurance with the following structure:
- **Policy Limits**: $50M per claim, $100M aggregate
- **Self-Insured Retention (SIR)**: $5M per claim
- **Policy Type**: Claims-made-and-reported
- **Governing Law**: Nebraska (favorable duty to defend standards under *Allstate v. Novak*)

The SIR operates as **true retention** (not a deductible), meaning Liberty Life pays first $5M of each claim including defense costs before Chubb's obligation attaches. Policy limits are not eroded by the SIR — full $50M coverage available excess of the $5M retention.

**2. IUL Class Action Coverage Analysis**

*Thompson v. Liberty Life* (filed August 2023) alleges misrepresentation in indexed universal life (IUL) policy illustrations, claiming illustrated 8.5% annual crediting vs. actual 4.2% performance. Settlement range: $25M-$45M compensatory damages (Nebraska prohibits punitive damages).

**Coverage Conclusion**: **Likely covered** as "wrongful act" (professional negligence/misrepresentation), subject to exclusions analysis:

✓ **Securities law exclusion does NOT apply** — IUL policies are insurance products, not securities (unlike variable annuities)
✓ **Punitive damages exclusion irrelevant** — Nebraska does not award punitive damages
✓ **Duty to defend triggered** — Nebraska's *Allstate v. Novak* standard requires Chubb to investigate and defend if any potential for coverage (broader than four-corners states)

⚠ **Coverage Risks**:
- **Prior knowledge exclusion** (30-40% risk): If Liberty Life knew during 2015-2020 that actual IUL performance (4.2%) materially underperformed illustrated rates (8.5%) and could reasonably expect claims, coverage may be barred entirely. **Data room investigation required** to review internal communications regarding IUL performance vs. illustrations.
- **Consumer protection exclusion** (40-50% risk): If policy excludes Nebraska Consumer Protection Act claims, may require allocation between covered tort claims and uncovered statutory claims under "larger settlement rule."
- **Late notice** (10-15% risk): Claims-made policies require reporting within policy period or grace period (30-60 days). Late notice forfeits coverage without prejudice requirement under Nebraska law.

**Expected Coverage** (base case, assuming no prior knowledge and timely notice):
- Settlement: $35M-$40M
- Chubb pays: $30M-$35M (above $5M SIR, within $50M limit)
- Liberty Life pays: $5M SIR
- **LLIC/Seller Exposure: $5M**

**Downside Coverage** (prior knowledge exclusion or late notice):
- Settlement: $25M-$45M
- Chubb pays: $0 (coverage denied)
- **LLIC/Seller Exposure: $25M-$45M** (full uninsured settlement)

**3. FINRA Arbitrations Coverage Analysis**

Twelve separate FINRA arbitrations (filed 2023-2024) allege variable annuity suitability violations under FINRA Rule 2111. Representative claims: Age 82 customer unsuitable $250K VA purchase; age 68 customer over-concentration (80% of liquid net worth); age 73 unsuitable 1035 exchange.

**Total Exposure**:
- Claims: $830,000
- Defense costs: $200,000-$300,000
- **Total: $1.03M-$1.13M**

**Coverage Conclusion**: **Covered** as professional negligence (suitability claims are core E&O coverage for broker-dealers), but **entirely within $5M SIR**.

**Critical Finding**: Whether 12 arbitrations are treated as separate claims (each with $5M SIR) or aggregated as single related claim (one $5M SIR), total exposure ($1.03M-$1.13M) is **well below** the SIR.

**Financial Impact**:
- Chubb pays: **$0** (below SIR)
- Liberty Life pays: **$1.03M-$1.13M (100%)**
- **No E&O insurance recovery** for FINRA arbitrations

⚠ **Securities law exclusion dispute possible**: Variable annuities are securities (unlike fixed IUL). Chubb may argue "violation of any securities act" exclusion bars coverage for FINRA Rule 2111 suitability violations. However, industry practice supports coverage (FINRA rules are not federal "securities acts," suitability is professional negligence). **Economically irrelevant** — exposure entirely within SIR regardless.

**4. Nebraska Duty to Defend Standards**

Nebraska follows **Allstate Insurance Co. v. Novak, 210 Neb. 184, 313 N.W.2d 636 (1981)**, which established that insurers have a duty to defend whenever **facts are ascertained which give rise to the potential for liability** under the policy.

**Key Advantages for Liberty Life**:
- Duty to defend is **broader than duty to indemnify** — Chubb may be required to defend even if ultimately no duty to indemnify
- **Investigation obligation** — Chubb cannot rely solely on complaint allegations; must investigate underlying facts
- **Not strict four-corners** — Extrinsic evidence considered when determining duty to defend
- **Bad faith risk** — Failure to conduct proper investigation and subject results to reasonable evaluation constitutes reckless indifference supporting bad faith claim

**Practical Implication**: Even if IUL complaint alleges only consumer protection statutory violations (potentially excluded), Chubb's investigation reveals underlying misrepresentation tort claims (covered), likely triggering duty to defend entire action.

**5. Notice Requirements and Compliance**

**Critical Requirement**: Claims-made-and-reported policies require claims be reported during policy period or extended reporting period (grace period, typically 30-60 days post-expiration). Timely reporting is a **condition precedent to coverage**.

**Notice-Prejudice Rule Does NOT Apply to Claims-Made Policies**: Most jurisdictions (including Nebraska) hold that late notice under claims-made policy results in **loss of coverage without requiring insurer to prove prejudice**. The date-certain reporting requirement defines the scope of coverage; excusing late notice would rewrite fundamental policy terms.

**Liberty Life Notice Compliance Status**: **Unknown — Data room verification required**

Verify:
- Date IUL class action (August 2023) was reported to Chubb
- Date each of 12 FINRA arbitrations was reported
- Whether reports occurred within policy period or grace period
- Any correspondence from Chubb (acceptance, reservation of rights, denial)

**Late Notice Risk**: If claims were not reported within required timeframe, Chubb can deny coverage entirely, increasing Liberty Life's uninsured exposure by $25M-$45M (IUL class action).

**6. Successor Liability and Tail Coverage for M&A Transaction**

**Change of Control Impact**: American Financial's $2.9B stock purchase (100% acquisition) constitutes change of control under standard E&O policy provisions, triggering:
1. Automatic policy termination at closing (Q3 2025)
2. Extended Reporting Period (ERP) election requirement
3. **30-day deadline** to purchase tail coverage

**Extended Reporting Period (Tail Coverage) — Critical for M&A**:

Tail coverage extends reporting period for claims arising from pre-closing wrongful acts filed post-closing. **Essential** because professional liability claims can emerge years after services are performed.

**Tail Coverage Terms**:
- **Coverage scope**: Claims arising from wrongful acts before policy termination, reported during extended period
- **Duration**: 12-60 months (36 months most common)
- **Policy limits**: Same as expired policy ($50M per claim, $100M aggregate) — **not additional limits**
- **SIR**: Same $5M retention applies
- **Cost**: 200%-250% of annual premium for 36-month ERP

**Estimated Tail Coverage Cost for Liberty Life**:

Assuming annual E&O premium $1.5M-$2.5M (industry standard for $50M limit with $5M SIR):

| Tail Period | Estimated Cost |
|-------------|----------------|
| 12 months | $1.5M - $3.125M |
| **36 months (recommended)** | **$3.0M - $6.25M** |
| 60 months | $3.75M - $7.5M |

**Critical Timeline**: Seller has **30 days** from closing to report transaction, elect tail coverage, and pay premium. **Failure to elect within 30 days may result in losing ability to purchase tail coverage**, leaving no coverage for post-closing claims arising from pre-closing professional services.

**M&A Industry Practice — Allocation of Tail Costs**:

| Party | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| **Seller (Liberty Life Holdings LLC)** | Pay tail premium ($3M-$6.25M); retain liability for pre-closing claims; provide indemnification for uninsured exposure |
| **Acquirer (American Financial Holdings LLC)** | Obtain new E&O policy for post-closing wrongful acts (no prior acts coverage); no liability for pre-closing claims |

**Rationale**: Seller had control over pre-closing operations and is best positioned to assess tail exposure. Acquirer should not bear risk of unknown seller liabilities.

**7. Uninsured Exposure Quantification**

**Best Case Scenario** (full IUL coverage, no prior knowledge, timely notice):
- IUL class action settlement: $35M (Chubb pays $30M, LLIC pays $5M SIR)
- FINRA arbitrations: $1.03M (LLIC pays 100% — within SIR)
- Tail coverage premium: $3M-$6.25M
- **Total LLIC/Seller Exposure: $9.03M-$12.28M**

**Base Case Scenario** (full IUL coverage):
- IUL settlement: $40M (Chubb pays $35M, LLIC pays $5M SIR)
- FINRA arbitrations: $1.13M (LLIC pays 100%)
- Tail coverage: $4M (36-month)
- **Total LLIC/Seller Exposure: $10.13M-$11M**

**Downside Scenario** (50% allocation due to consumer protection exclusion):
- IUL settlement: $45M with 50% allocation (Chubb pays $20M covered portion; LLIC pays $5M SIR + $20M uncovered portion)
- FINRA arbitrations: $1.13M
- Tail coverage: $6M
- **Total LLIC/Seller Exposure: $32.13M**

**Severe Downside Scenario** (prior knowledge exclusion or late notice — full coverage denial):
- IUL settlement: $45M fully uninsured (LLIC pays 100%)
- FINRA arbitrations: $1.13M
- Tail coverage: Not purchased (lost election rights)
- **Total LLIC/Seller Exposure: $46.13M + future claims with no coverage**

**8. Recommended M&A Transaction Structure**

**Escrow for Uninsured Exposure**: $12M-$15M recommended:
- IUL class action $5M SIR: $5M
- FINRA arbitrations (within SIR): $1.13M
- Tail coverage premium (36-month): $3M-$6.25M
- Contingency for partial coverage denial: $2M-$3M
- **Total: $11.13M-$15.38M**

**Representations and Warranties** (Purchase Agreement):
- Seller represents E&O policy terms ($50M limits, $5M SIR, coverage terms, exclusions)
- All pending claims disclosed (IUL class action, 12 FINRA arbitrations)
- Seller covenants to purchase 36-month tail coverage at closing

**Indemnification** (Seller to Acquirer):
- Pre-closing professional liability claims filed post-closing
- Uninsured exposure (within SIR, above policy limits, excluded claims)
- Gap if tail coverage insufficient or not purchased

**Purchase Price Adjustment Triggers**:
- IUL settlement >$45M threshold
- E&O coverage denial (prior knowledge, late notice, exclusion application)
- Tail coverage cost exceeds $6.25M

**9. Critical Data Room Diligence Requirements**

The following documents are **essential** to verify coverage conclusions and quantify uninsured exposure:

| Priority | Document | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Complete E&O policy (full text, not just declarations) | Verify exclusion language (securities, consumer protection, prior knowledge); confirm SIR terms; identify change of control provisions |
| **HIGH** | Notice letters to Chubb (IUL and FINRA arbitrations) | Verify notice compliance (dates reported, within policy period); assess late notice risk |
| **HIGH** | Internal communications regarding IUL performance (2015-2023) | Assess prior knowledge exclusion risk (did LLIC know 4.2% actual vs. 8.5% illustrated rates could lead to claims?) |
| **HIGH** | Chubb coverage position letters | Determine whether Chubb accepted defense, reserved rights, or denied coverage; identify disputed coverage issues |
| **MEDIUM** | E&O insurance applications and renewals | Verify disclosure of "circumstances that may give rise to a claim"; assess misrepresentation risk if IUL issues not disclosed |
| **MEDIUM** | Defense costs tracking | Confirm whether defense costs within or outside SIR; determine SIR exhaustion for IUL class action |

**Outstanding Questions for Seller**:
1. What is Liberty Life's annual E&O premium? (Calculates tail coverage cost)
2. Has Chubb issued reservation of rights or coverage position letters?
3. What is the exact policy period? (Determines notice deadlines)
4. Are defense costs "within" or "outside" the $5M SIR?
5. When were claims reported to Chubb? (Notice compliance)
6. Does policy contain consumer protection/UDAP exclusion?
7. What is the policy's retroactive date?
8. Has Liberty Life filed notice of circumstances with Chubb?

### Cross-Domain Impacts (for Memorandum Synthesis)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Specific Cross-Reference | Severity |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------|----------|
| IUL class action E&O coverage ($30M-$35M recovery likely) | Litigation Strategy (IV.D) | Early settlement strategy supported by E&O coverage availability; recommend settling within $45M threshold to maximize insurance recovery and satisfy closing condition | HIGH |
| FINRA arbitrations entirely within $5M SIR ($1.03M-$1.13M uninsured) | Financial Impact Aggregation (IV.I) | No E&O insurance offset; add $1.03M-$1.13M to uninsured liability calculations for escrow sizing | MEDIUM |
| Tail coverage required $3M-$6.25M | M&A Transaction Structure (IV.H) | Seller covenant to purchase 36-month ERP at closing; escrow tail premium; indemnify acquirer for post-closing claims arising from pre-closing acts | HIGH |
| Prior knowledge exclusion risk (30-40% probability) | IUL Class Action (IV.D) | If internal communications 2015-2023 show LLIC knew of performance gap and expected claims, full $25M-$45M settlement may be uninsured; critical diligence item | HIGH |
| Uninsured exposure $10M-$46M range | Financial Impact (IV.I), M&A Escrow (IV.H) | Base case $10M-$11M; severe downside $46M if prior knowledge or late notice; escrow sizing $12M-$15M recommended with seller indemnity for excess | HIGH |

### Risk Assessment: MEDIUM

**Rationale**: Base case uninsured exposure ($10M-$11M) is manageable relative to $2.9B transaction size (<0.4% of purchase price). However, **severe downside scenario** ($46M uninsured if prior knowledge exclusion or late notice) represents material risk (1.6% of purchase price). **Tail coverage essential** to avoid catastrophic post-closing coverage gap.

**Key Risk Mitigants**:
1. Nebraska duty to defend standards favorable to insured (*Allstate v. Novak*)
2. IUL policies not securities (securities law exclusion inapplicable)
3. E&O policy limits ($50M) adequate for IUL settlement range ($25M-$45M)
4. FINRA arbitrations low dollar exposure ($1.03M-$1.13M)
5. Tail coverage available (if elected within 30 days)

**Key Risk Drivers**:
1. **Prior knowledge exclusion** — data room investigation required
2. **Notice compliance** — verification required
3. **Tail coverage election** — 30-day deadline after closing
4. **Consumer protection exclusion** — allocation risk

**Recommendations**: Proceed with acquisition contingent on (1) data room verification of notice compliance and no prior knowledge issues, (2) seller covenant to purchase 36-month tail coverage at closing, (3) $12M-$15M escrow for uninsured exposure, (4) seller indemnification for pre-closing claims.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

## IV.A. E&O POLICY COVERAGE FRAMEWORK

### 1. Standard Professional Liability Insurance for Financial Services

**Typical E&O Policy Structure for Insurance Companies/Broker-Dealers:**

Professional liability (Errors & Omissions) insurance for financial services companies, including insurance companies and broker-dealers, provides coverage for claims arising from professional services. The policy responds to actual or alleged mistakes, errors, omissions, negligence, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, failure to meet client expectations, and violations of regulations.¹

**Insuring Agreement — "Wrongful Act" Definition:**

E&O policies typically define coverage based on "Wrongful Act," which is the key term defining the scope of insured liability. Every policy differs, and definitions of "Wrongful Act" can vary significantly from one insurer to another. The wrongful act definition determines what professional conduct falls within coverage.²

For insurance companies and broker-dealers, the "wrongful act" definition typically encompasses:
- Errors, omissions, or negligent acts in rendering or failing to render professional services
- Misrepresentation or misleading statements made in connection with professional services
- Breach of fiduciary duty to clients
- Violations of regulatory requirements (subject to exclusions)
- Failure to supervise employees or representatives

**Coverage for Regulatory Investigations, Arbitrations, and Class Actions:**

Standard E&O policies for financial professionals cover:
- **Defense costs** for covered professional services, including legal representation
- **Court/arbitration hearing costs** for covered claims
- **Customer settlements, awards, or judgments** for covered claims, up to policy limits
- **FINRA arbitration proceedings** involving suitability claims, misrepresentation allegations, and other professional errors³

The definition of "claim" in E&O policies should include regulatory and administrative proceedings to ensure coverage for regulatory investigations and enforcement actions.⁴

**Coverage Limitations for Securities Law Violations:**

**CRITICAL EXCLUSION:** Standard E&O policies typically **exclude coverage for violation of any securities act**.⁵ This creates a significant coverage gap for financial services companies facing claims alleging securities law violations, even when those claims also allege professional negligence or misrepresentation.

This exclusion means that:
- Pure securities law violation claims (e.g., Securities Act of 1933, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 violations) may be entirely excluded
- Mixed claims alleging both securities violations and professional negligence may require allocation between covered and uncovered claims
- Consumer protection claims under state Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP) statutes are often excluded or subject to sublimits

### 2. Claims-Made vs. Occurrence Trigger

**Claims-Made Policy Structure:**

E&O policies for financial services professionals are virtually always written on a **claims-made-and-reported basis**, meaning:
- The claim must be first made against the insured **during the policy period**
- The claim must be **reported to the insurer** during the policy period or an extended reporting period
- The wrongful act must occur **after the retroactive date** (if any) specified in the policy⁶

This differs fundamentally from occurrence-based policies (typical for general liability), where coverage depends on when the injury or damage occurs, not when the claim is made.

**Policy Period and Reporting Requirements:**

Claims-made policies require:
1. **Timely reporting of claims** — typically "as soon as practicable" after the insured becomes aware of the claim
2. **Notice of circumstances** provisions — allowing insureds to report potential claims (circumstances that may give rise to a claim) before a claim is actually made
3. **Strict compliance** with reporting deadlines — failure to report within the policy period or grace period (typically 30-60 days) results in loss of coverage⁷

**Retroactive Date:**

The retroactive date establishes the earliest date for which wrongful acts are covered. Wrongful acts occurring before the retroactive date are excluded from coverage, even if the claim is made during the policy period.

### 3. Self-Insured Retention (SIR) vs. Deductible

**Critical Distinction — Financial and Coverage Implications:**

Liberty Life's E&O policy features a **$5 million Self-Insured Retention (SIR)**, which operates fundamentally differently from a deductible:

| Feature | Self-Insured Retention (SIR) | Deductible |
|---------|----------------------------|------------|
| **Payment Obligation** | Insured pays first $5M of loss AND defense costs before insurer obligation triggered | Insurer pays loss, then seeks reimbursement from insured up to deductible amount |
| **Defense Costs** | Typically included within SIR — insured pays own defense costs until SIR exhausted | Typically covered by insurer outside deductible |
| **Insurer Duty to Defend** | No duty to defend until SIR exhausted | Duty to defend attaches immediately |
| **Control of Defense** | Insured controls defense for claims within SIR, including choice of counsel | Insurer controls defense and selects counsel |
| **Policy Limits Erosion** | Policy limits typically NOT eroded by SIR (e.g., $5M SIR + $50M limit = $50M coverage excess of SIR) | Policy limits typically eroded by deductible (e.g., $50M limit - $5M deductible = $45M true coverage) |
| **Collateral Requirements** | Typically no collateral required (insurer pays nothing until SIR exhausted) | Often requires letter of credit or other collateral to secure insured's reimbursement obligation |⁸

**Application to Liberty Life Claims:**

With a $5 million SIR:
- **IUL Class Action** ($25M-$45M settlement range): LLIC must pay first $5M, then Chubb covers $20M-$40M (remainder up to $50M policy limit)
- **FINRA Arbitrations** ($830K claims + $200K-$300K defense costs = ~$1.1M total): Entirely within $5M SIR — LLIC pays 100%, Chubb pays nothing
- **Defense Cost Allocation**: Critical to determine whether defense costs are "within" or "outside" the SIR — if within, LLIC pays all defense costs until total costs + indemnity = $5M

**Per Claim vs. Aggregate SIR:**

Standard practice: SIR applies **per claim**, not aggregate. This means:
- IUL class action: $5M SIR applies
- Each of 12 FINRA arbitrations: Potentially separate $5M SIR **OR** aggregated as "related claims" with single $5M SIR

The policy's claim aggregation provisions determine whether multiple related claims are treated as a single claim for SIR and limits purposes.⁹

## IV.B. NEBRASKA DUTY TO DEFEND STANDARDS

### 1. Seminal Case: Allstate Insurance Co. v. Novak

**Foundational Precedent:**

Any determination of an insurer's duty to defend in Nebraska must begin with the seminal case of **Allstate Insurance Co. v. Novak, 210 Neb. 184, 313 N.W.2d 636 (1981)**, which established that **insurers have a duty to defend whenever facts are ascertained which give rise to the potential for liability under the policy**.¹⁰

**Holding:**

The Nebraska Supreme Court recognized two separate and distinct contractual obligations:
1. **Duty to Indemnify**: Insurer's agreement to pay on behalf of the insured all sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay
2. **Duty to Defend**: Separate obligation to defend any suit against the insured, including suits that are "groundless, false or fraudulent"¹¹

**Key Principle:** The duty to defend is **broader than the duty to indemnify** — an insurer may have an obligation to defend even though it might not ultimately have an obligation to pay.

### 2. Investigation Obligation

**Nebraska Standard:**

Under *Allstate v. Novak* and subsequent Nebraska case law, when determining whether to defend, **insurers cannot rely solely on the allegations of the petition** but must conduct an investigation to determine their obligation to defend.¹²

This differs from strict "four corners" jurisdictions that limit the duty to defend analysis to the face of the complaint and the policy.

**Bad Faith Implications:**

Reckless indifference to the facts or proof submitted by an insured is shown by the insurer's **failure to conduct a proper investigation and subject the results to a reasonable evaluation and review**. This can support a bad faith claim against the insurer.¹³

### 3. Application to Liberty Life's E&O Policy

**Broader Duty to Defend Than Four-Corners States:**

Nebraska's approach means that Chubb (the E&O carrier) must:
- Review the complaint allegations in the IUL class action and FINRA arbitrations
- **Conduct an independent investigation** of the underlying facts
- Determine whether any potentially covered claims exist
- Defend if there is **any potential for liability** under the E&O policy

Even if the complaint alleges only uncovered securities law violations, if Chubb's investigation reveals potential professional negligence or misrepresentation claims (which may be covered), Chubb likely has a duty to defend the entire action.

**Practical Implication:**

This favorable standard increases the likelihood that Chubb must defend Liberty Life, even if coverage for indemnity is questionable due to securities law exclusions or other policy limitations.

## IV.C. COVERAGE ANALYSIS — IUL CLASS ACTION

### 1. Thompson v. Liberty Life: Claim Overview

**Allegations:**

The IUL class action (*Thompson v. Liberty Life*) alleges:
- **Misrepresentation**: Policy illustrations showed 8.5% annual index crediting vs. actual 4.2% average performance (2015-2023)
- **Omissions**: Illustrations did not adequately disclose that caps, floors, and participation rates could be changed by LLIC
- **Nebraska Consumer Protection Act violations**: Deceptive trade practices under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 59-1601 et seq.
- **Damages**: Cash value shortfall $85M-$125M + punitive damages 2-3× (potential range $170M-$375M total exposure)

**Legal Theories:**

- Contract claims (breach of insurance contract)
- Tort claims (negligent misrepresentation, fraud)
- Consumer protection statutory claims (Nebraska Consumer Protection Act)

### 2. Coverage for Misrepresentation in Policy Illustrations

**"Wrongful Act" Analysis:**

Policy illustrations are a core aspect of insurance sales and marketing — a professional service within the ordinary course of Liberty Life's insurance business. Misrepresentation in illustrations potentially constitutes a "wrongful act" under standard E&O policy definitions:

- **Errors or omissions** in rendering professional services (designing and providing illustrations)
- **Misrepresentation** or misleading statements made in connection with professional services
- **Failure to disclose** material information to customers¹⁴

**Industry Precedent — IUL Illustration Lawsuits (2024-2025):**

IUL policies have become the subject of **significant litigation** in 2024-2025, with multiple lawsuits alleging insurance carriers misrepresented complex IUL products:

- **Pacific Life (Washington, 2025)**: Settled lawsuit over misleading IUL illustrations
- **Kyle Busch v. Pacific Life**: Allegations that IUL policies were misrepresented as "tax-free retirement plans" and "safe, self-funding investment vehicles"
- **National Life (Vermont, 2024)**: Lawsuit alleging IUL illustrations relied on back-tested historical performance that does not match reality¹⁵

Common misrepresentation issues identified in IUL litigation:
- **Unrealistic projections**: Illustrations showing double-digit returns when caps, participation limits, and fees make such returns unsustainable
- **Guaranteed returns claims**: Representations that policies guarantee specific returns when actual returns depend on index performance, caps, and fees
- **Failure to disclose risks**: Inadequate disclosure of caps, floors, participation rates, and insurer's ability to change these features¹⁶

**Coverage Conclusion:**

Misrepresentation in IUL policy illustrations falls squarely within the "wrongful act" definition of professional liability for insurance companies. This is **covered conduct** under standard E&O policies, subject to exclusions analysis.

### 3. Potential Exclusions and Coverage Limitations

**A. Securities Law Exclusion:**

**Standard Exclusion Language:** E&O policies typically exclude "violation of any securities act."¹⁷

**Analysis:**

- IUL policies (fixed indexed universal life) are **not securities** — they are insurance contracts regulated by state insurance departments, not the SEC
- The Securities Act of 1933 and Investment Advisers Act of 1940 do **not apply** to fixed insurance products
- **Variable universal life (VUL)** policies are securities (separate accounts registered under Investment Company Act of 1940), but IUL policies are not

**Conclusion:** Securities law exclusion does **not apply** to IUL illustration misrepresentation claims because IUL policies are insurance products, not securities.

**B. Consumer Protection Act (UDAP) Exclusion:**

Some E&O policies exclude claims under state Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP) statutes or consumer protection laws.

**Thompson Class Action Allegations:** Includes Nebraska Consumer Protection Act (NCPA) violations (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 59-1601 et seq.) as a separate count.

**Coverage Impact:**

- If E&O policy contains UDAP/consumer protection exclusion → NCPA count may be excluded
- However, **tort claims** (negligent misrepresentation, fraud) and **contract claims** (breach of insurance contract) would remain potentially covered
- **Allocation issue**: Settlement encompasses multiple claims (contract, tort, statutory); insurer may argue only portion attributable to covered claims is covered

**C. Contract Claims vs. Tort Claims:**

**Coverage Distinction:**

E&O policies typically cover **tort claims** (professional negligence, misrepresentation) more clearly than pure **contract claims** (breach of contract).¹⁸

**Thompson Allegations Analysis:**

- **Contract claims** (breach of insurance policy): May be excluded or subject to allocation
- **Tort claims** (negligent misrepresentation in illustrations): Covered as "wrongful act"
- **Statutory claims** (Nebraska Consumer Protection Act): Potentially excluded if UDAP exclusion exists

**Allocation Between Covered and Uncovered Claims:**

Under the **"larger settlement rule,"** allocation between covered and uncovered claims is appropriate **only if** the uncovered claims cause the settlement to be higher than it otherwise would have been.¹⁹

If the settlement primarily resolves misrepresentation tort claims (covered), with contract and statutory claims as secondary theories, the insurer cannot allocate unless it proves the uncovered claims materially increased settlement value.

**D. Punitive Damages Exclusion:**

**Nebraska Law:** Nebraska is one of three states (along with Michigan and Washington) that **do not allow punitive damages** to be awarded.²⁰

**Impact on Thompson Class Action:**

- Complaint seeks punitive damages 2-3× compensatory damages ($170M-$375M potential exposure)
- **Nebraska law prohibits punitive damages** — this claim will be dismissed or stricken
- Settlement range $25M-$45M reflects **compensatory damages only**
- **No punitive damages coverage issue** because Nebraska does not award punitive damages

**E. Prior Knowledge Exclusion:**

**Standard Language:** E&O policies typically exclude coverage if, prior to policy inception, the insured had knowledge of a wrongful act that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim.²¹

**Application:**

Critical question: Did Liberty Life have knowledge of IUL illustration problems **before** the current E&O policy period began?

- IUL policies issued **2015-2020**
- Illustrations showed 8.5% crediting rate during 2015-2020 sales period
- Actual performance 4.2% average over 2015-2023
- Class action filed **August 2023**

**Analysis:**

If Liberty Life:
- **Knew** during 2015-2020 that actual IUL performance (4.2%) was significantly below illustrated rates (8.5%)
- **Reasonably could have expected** this performance gap would lead to policyholder complaints or litigation
- **Failed to disclose** this knowledge when applying for or renewing E&O coverage

Then the prior knowledge exclusion may apply, **barring coverage entirely**.

**Data Room Investigation Required:**

Review:
- Internal communications regarding IUL performance vs. illustrations (2015-2023)
- Complaints received about IUL performance before class action filing
- E&O insurance applications and renewal questionnaires (disclosure of "circumstances that may give rise to a claim")
- NAIC market conduct examination findings regarding illustration practices

### 4. Settlement Range and Coverage Calculation

**Settlement Range:** $25M - $45M (compensatory damages only, no punitive damages under Nebraska law)

**Coverage Structure:**

- **$5M SIR**: Liberty Life pays first $5M
- **$50M Policy Limit**: Chubb covers $5M - $50M of covered claims
- **$100M Aggregate**: Across all claims in policy period

**Coverage Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Settlement Amount | Coverage Analysis | LLIC Exposure | Chubb Pays |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| **A: Full Coverage** | $35M | All claims covered, no exclusions apply | $5M (SIR) | $30M |
| **A: Full Coverage** | $45M | All claims covered, no exclusions apply | $5M (SIR) | $40M |
| **B: Partial Coverage (50% allocation)** | $35M | Consumer protection claims excluded; allocation 50/50 | $5M (SIR) + $12.5M uncovered | $17.5M |
| **C: Prior Knowledge Exclusion** | $35M | Prior knowledge bars all coverage | $35M | $0 |
| **C: Prior Knowledge Exclusion** | $45M | Prior knowledge bars all coverage | $45M | $0 |

**Most Likely Scenario:**

**Scenario A (Full Coverage)** is most likely **if**:
- IUL illustration misrepresentation is a "wrongful act" (professional negligence) — **YES**
- Securities law exclusion does not apply — **YES** (IUL is not a security)
- No consumer protection exclusion OR tort claims predominate settlement — **LIKELY**
- No prior knowledge of claims — **REQUIRES DATA ROOM VERIFICATION**

**Expected Outcome:** Settlement $35M-$40M, Chubb covers $30M-$35M, Liberty Life pays $5M SIR.

## IV.D. COVERAGE ANALYSIS — FINRA ARBITRATIONS

### 1. Twelve FINRA Arbitrations: Claim Overview

**Total Exposure:**
- **Claims**: $830,000 (total claimed damages across 12 arbitrations)
- **Defense Costs**: $200,000-$300,000 (estimated attorney fees and arbitration costs)
- **Total**: ~$1,030,000 - $1,130,000

**Representative Claims:**

| Claimant | Age | Investment Amount | Allegation | Claimed Damages |
|----------|-----|-------------------|------------|-----------------|
| A | 82 | $250K VA | Unsuitable sale (limited income $35K/year Social Security) | $250K + fees |
| B | 68 | $400K VA | Over-concentration (80% of liquid net worth) | $400K + fees |
| C | 73 | $180K VA | Unsuitable replacement (1035 exchange, new surrender charges) | $180K + fees |

**Common Allegations:**
- FINRA Rule 2111 suitability violations (customer-specific suitability)
- Sale of variable annuities to senior customers (age 65+) with limited income
- Over-concentration of liquid assets in illiquid variable annuity products
- Unsuitable 1035 exchanges creating new surrender charge periods for elderly customers
- Failure to supervise producing agents

### 2. Coverage for FINRA Suitability Claims

**"Wrongful Act" Analysis:**

Suitability claims involving variable annuity sales fall squarely within standard E&O policy coverage for broker-dealers and insurance companies:

- **Professional negligence** in recommending unsuitable investment products
- **Errors or omissions** in assessing customer suitability
- **Breach of fiduciary duty** to customers
- **Failure to supervise** agents and representatives²²

**Industry Practice:**

The majority of independent broker-dealers have at least some form of E&O insurance covering suitability claims. **Suitability claims are generally covered by E&O insurance**, whereas churning is typically not covered.²³

**Conclusion:** FINRA arbitration suitability claims are **covered** under standard E&O policies as "wrongful acts" involving professional negligence.

### 3. SIR Application to FINRA Arbitrations

**Critical Issue: Per Claim vs. Aggregate SIR**

With a **$5M SIR per claim**, the treatment of 12 separate FINRA arbitrations is determinative:

**Option 1: Each Arbitration = Separate Claim**
- Each of 12 arbitrations subject to separate $5M SIR
- Total exposure $1.03M-$1.13M is **far below** $5M SIR for any single claim
- **Result**: Liberty Life pays 100% of all claims and defense costs; Chubb pays $0

**Option 2: Related Claims Aggregated as Single Claim**
- All 12 arbitrations aggregated as one claim (related wrongful acts)
- Single $5M SIR applies to aggregate $1.03M-$1.13M exposure
- **Result**: Liberty Life pays 100% (still below SIR); Chubb pays $0

**Policy Language Determinative:**

E&O policies typically contain **claim aggregation provisions** under which multiple factually related claims are treated as a single claim based on when the first claim was made.²⁴

**Analysis for Liberty Life Claims:**

Are the 12 FINRA arbitrations "related claims" subject to aggregation?

- **Common issue**: All involve variable annuity suitability for senior customers
- **Common wrongful act**: Failure to apply proper suitability standards for elderly, conservative investors
- **Common time period**: Sales occurred 2020-2023 (likely overlapping)
- **Supervision failure**: Claims may allege systemic failure to supervise agent conduct

**Likely Conclusion**: Claims are **related** and would be aggregated as a **single claim** for SIR purposes.

**Financial Impact:**

Regardless of whether claims are separate or aggregated, total exposure ($1.03M-$1.13M) is **entirely within the $5M SIR**:

- **Liberty Life pays**: $1.03M - $1.13M (100%)
- **Chubb pays**: $0
- **No E&O insurance recovery** for FINRA arbitrations

### 4. Securities Law Exclusion — Variable Annuities

**Critical Coverage Issue:**

Unlike fixed indexed universal life (IUL) policies, **variable annuities are securities** registered under:
- Securities Act of 1933 (SEC Form S-6 registration for separate accounts)
- Investment Company Act of 1940 (registered investment companies)
- FINRA jurisdiction (broker-dealer sales and suitability requirements)

**Securities Law Exclusion Application:**

Standard E&O policies exclude "violation of any securities act."²⁵

**Two Interpretations:**

**Narrow Interpretation (Pro-Coverage):**
- Exclusion applies only to violations of the **Securities Act statutes themselves** (e.g., Section 5 registration violations, Section 10(b) fraud, Rule 10b-5)
- FINRA Rule 2111 is a **self-regulatory organization (SRO) rule**, not a federal securities statute
- Suitability claims are **professional negligence** claims, not securities law violations
- **Conclusion**: Exclusion does not bar coverage

**Broad Interpretation (Pro-Insurer):**
- "Securities act" encompasses all regulation of securities, including SRO rules
- Variable annuity sales are inherently securities transactions subject to securities regulation
- Suitability violations are securities-related wrongful acts
- **Conclusion**: Exclusion bars coverage

**Industry Practice and Case Law:**

E&O policies for broker-dealers typically cover FINRA arbitration suitability claims, suggesting the **narrow interpretation prevails** in the industry. Coverage for suitability is a core purpose of broker-dealer E&O insurance.²⁶

**Most Likely Outcome:**

Securities law exclusion does **not bar coverage** for FINRA suitability claims, because:
- FINRA rules are not "securities acts" (federal statutes)
- Suitability is professional negligence, not statutory violation
- Industry practice supports coverage

However, this is a **potential coverage dispute** that Chubb may raise.

### 5. Expected Coverage and Exposure

**Base Scenario (No Securities Exclusion):**

- Total claims + defense costs: $1.03M - $1.13M
- Within $5M SIR: **Liberty Life pays 100%**
- Chubb pays: **$0**

**Alternative Scenario (Securities Exclusion Applies):**

- Coverage denied based on securities law exclusion
- Liberty Life pays: $1.03M - $1.13M (100%)
- Chubb pays: **$0**

**Practical Impact:**

Because total exposure is **entirely within the $5M SIR**, the securities law exclusion dispute is **economically irrelevant** to this specific claim. Liberty Life bears full exposure regardless of coverage determination.

## IV.E. NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND COMPLIANCE

### 1. Claims-Made Policy Notice Requirements

**General Standard:**

Claims-made-and-reported E&O policies require:
1. Claim must be **first made** during the policy period
2. Claim must be **reported to insurer** during the policy period or extended reporting period
3. Notice must be given within a **"reasonable time"** (typically "as soon as practicable")²⁷

**Strict Compliance Requirement:**

Timely reporting is a **condition precedent to coverage** under claims-made policies. Failure to provide notice within the policy period or grace period (typically 30-60 days) can result in **loss of coverage regardless of whether the insurer is prejudiced** by the delay.²⁸

### 2. Notice-Prejudice Rule — Limited Application to Claims-Made Policies

**Occurrence Policies:**

In a majority of jurisdictions, the **"notice-prejudice rule"** provides that an insurer may not deny coverage based on late notice **without demonstrating prejudice**. This rule protects insureds from forfeiting coverage due to technical notice failures when the insurer suffers no harm.²⁹

**Claims-Made Policies:**

Most courts hold that the notice-prejudice rule **does not apply to claims-made-and-reported policies**. The date-certain notice requirement **defines the scope of coverage**, and excusing late notice would rewrite a fundamental term of the insurance contract.³⁰

**Nebraska Position:**

Nebraska appears to follow the majority rule that late notice under a claims-made policy results in loss of coverage **without requiring the insurer to prove prejudice**.³¹

**Practical Implication:**

Liberty Life's compliance with notice requirements is **critical**. Late notice can forfeit coverage entirely, even if Chubb suffers no prejudice from the delay.

### 3. Notice Compliance Analysis — Liberty Life Claims

**IUL Class Action (Thompson v. Liberty Life):**

- **Filed:** August 2023
- **Notice timeline:** Must be reported during 2023-2024 policy period or within grace period (e.g., by October 31, 2023 if policy year ends August 31, 2023)
- **Data room verification required:** Review notice letter to Chubb, date sent, proof of delivery

**FINRA Arbitrations:**

- **Filed:** 2023-2024 (12 separate arbitrations filed over ~12-18 month period)
- **Notice timeline:** Each arbitration must be reported within reasonable time after filing
- **Aggregation impact**: If claims are "related," notice of first arbitration may cover subsequent related arbitrations filed during same policy period

**Late Notice Risk Factors:**

Potential scenarios where notice may be untimely:
1. **Delay in reporting**: If LLIC waited >60 days after receiving complaint/arbitration demand to notify Chubb
2. **Policy period expiration**: If claims were made in final months of policy period and not reported before expiration
3. **Failure to report "circumstances"**: If LLIC was aware of potential claims (e.g., policyholder complaints about IUL performance) but failed to report "circumstances that may give rise to a claim" under notice-of-circumstances provisions

**Data Room Investigation Required:**

Review:
- E&O policy notice provisions (reporting deadline, grace period, notice-of-circumstances language)
- Notice letters sent to Chubb for IUL class action and each FINRA arbitration
- Dates of service of complaints/arbitration demands on Liberty Life
- Internal communications showing when LLIC became aware of claims
- Any correspondence from Chubb acknowledging receipt of notice or reserving rights

### 4. Consequence of Late Notice

**If Notice is Untimely:**

- **Coverage forfeited**: Chubb can deny coverage entirely based on failure to comply with condition precedent
- **No prejudice requirement**: Under claims-made policy, LLIC cannot defeat denial by showing Chubb suffered no prejudice
- **Total exposure to LLIC**:
  - IUL class action: $25M-$45M (no E&O recovery)
  - FINRA arbitrations: $1.03M-$1.13M (already within SIR, no change)

**Reservation of Rights:**

If Chubb is defending under a reservation of rights, this may indicate:
- Chubb has **accepted the defense** (duty to defend triggered)
- Chubb **reserves the right to deny indemnity** based on late notice, exclusions, or other policy defenses
- Potential conflict of interest between Chubb and LLIC regarding coverage³²

**Nebraska Bad Faith Implications:**

If Chubb denies coverage based on late notice but cannot prove actual prejudice, LLIC may have a bad faith claim in states applying the notice-prejudice rule. However, Nebraska likely does not require prejudice for claims-made policies, weakening this argument.³³

## IV.F. SUCCESSOR LIABILITY AND TAIL COVERAGE FOR M&A TRANSACTION

### 1. Change of Control Impact on Claims-Made Coverage

**Standard Change of Control Provision:**

E&O insurance policies typically contain provisions triggered by a **change in control**, which occurs when there is a change in ownership of more than 50% of voting stock (though some policies may treat changes of more than 25% as a change in control).³⁴

**Policy Consequences:**

When a change of control occurs, the E&O policy may:
1. **Terminate automatically** upon consummation of transaction
2. **Require reporting** of the change within specified timeframe (typically 30 days)
3. **Trigger extended reporting period (ERP) election** — insured must purchase tail coverage to maintain ability to report future claims arising from pre-closing wrongful acts³⁵

**American Financial Holdings Acquisition of Liberty Life:**

The $2.9B stock purchase constitutes a **change of control** under standard E&O policy definitions:
- American Financial acquires 100% of Liberty Life stock
- Ownership transfers from Liberty Life Holdings LLC to American Financial Holdings LLC
- Change of control provisions are triggered at closing (anticipated Q3 2025)

### 2. Extended Reporting Period (Tail Coverage)

**What is Tail Coverage?**

An Extended Reporting Period (ERP), commonly called "tail coverage," extends the reporting period for claims covered by the policy into the future, allowing the insured to report claims arising from prior wrongful acts for a specified period after policy expiration or termination.³⁶

**Why Tail Coverage is Critical for M&A:**

Professional liability claims implicating E&O policies don't always arise immediately — some can be filed **years after services conclude**. This makes tail coverage essential during transitions such as mergers, acquisitions, or business closures when liabilities from past acts might surface unexpectedly.³⁷

**Coverage Scope:**

Tail coverage provides:
- **Extended reporting period**: Typically 12-60 months (36 months most common)
- **Coverage for prior wrongful acts**: Claims arising from professional services performed before policy termination
- **Same policy limits**: Tail coverage shares the same limits as the expired policy (not additional limits)
- **Same SIR**: Applies same $5M self-insured retention per claim³⁸

**What Tail Coverage Does NOT Provide:**

- Does not cover wrongful acts occurring **after** policy termination date
- Does not provide additional policy limits (same $50M per claim, $100M aggregate applies to both original policy period and extended reporting period combined)
- Does not cover claims already known or reported before tail purchase

### 3. Tail Coverage Cost and Timeline

**Industry Standard Costs (2024-2025):**

Tail coverage premiums are substantial, typically calculated as a **multiple of the expiring annual premium**:

| Extended Reporting Period | Cost as % of Annual Premium |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **12 months** | 100%-125% of annual premium |
| **36 months** (most common) | 200%-250% of annual premium |
| **60 months** | 250%-300% of annual premium |³⁹

**Liberty Life E&O Policy:**

Assuming Liberty Life's annual E&O premium is ~$1.5M-$2.5M (typical for $50M limit with $5M SIR for a $2.9B insurance company):

| Tail Period | Estimated Cost |
|-------------|----------------|
| 12 months | $1.5M - $3.125M |
| 36 months | $3.0M - $6.25M |
| 60 months | $3.75M - $7.5M |

**Critical Timeline:**

Insureds typically have **30 days** from the change of control to:
1. **Report the transaction** to the E&O carrier
2. **Elect to purchase** the extended reporting period
3. **Pay the tail premium**

**Failing to elect tail coverage within 30 days may result in losing the ability to purchase an extended reporting endorsement**, leaving Liberty Life (and American Financial as successor) with **no coverage** for claims arising from pre-closing wrongful acts filed after closing.⁴⁰

### 4. Allocation of Tail Coverage Costs in M&A Transactions

**Industry Practice:**

In insurance company acquisitions, tail coverage costs are typically allocated as follows:

**Seller (Liberty Life Holdings LLC) Retains:**
- Pre-closing claims (including IUL class action and FINRA arbitrations)
- Tail coverage premium payment
- Defense and indemnity costs for pre-closing wrongful acts (subject to E&O recovery)

**Acquirer (American Financial Holdings LLC) Obtains:**
- New E&O policy for post-closing wrongful acts
- Coverage for claims arising from post-closing professional services
- No liability for pre-closing wrongful acts (seller indemnifies)

**Rationale:**

Seller had control over pre-closing operations and is in best position to assess tail exposure. Acquirer should not bear risk of unknown seller liabilities arising post-closing.

### 5. Transaction Structure Implications

**Representations and Warranties:**

Purchase agreement should include:
- **E&O policy disclosure**: Seller represents policy limits ($50M), SIR ($5M), coverage terms, and any exclusions or reservations of rights
- **Known claims disclosure**: All pending claims (IUL class action, 12 FINRA arbitrations) disclosed
- **Tail coverage covenant**: Seller agrees to purchase 36-month tail coverage at closing

**Indemnification:**

- **Seller indemnifies** acquirer for pre-closing claims, including:
  - Claims filed after closing arising from pre-closing wrongful acts
  - Uninsured exposure (within $5M SIR, above $50M policy limits, or excluded claims)
  - Any gap if tail coverage not purchased or insufficient

**Escrow for Uninsured Exposure:**

Purchase price adjustment or escrow to cover:
- IUL class action: $5M SIR retention
- FINRA arbitrations: $1.03M-$1.13M (entirely within SIR)
- Tail coverage premium: $3M-$6.25M (36-month ERP)
- **Total recommended escrow**: $9M-$12M minimum

### 6. Prior Acts Coverage Under New Policy

**Alternative to Tail Coverage:**

American Financial may obtain a **new E&O policy** with **full prior acts coverage** (no retroactive date), which would cover:
- Claims arising from Liberty Life's pre-acquisition professional services
- Filed after acquisition closing date
- Within new policy limits and terms

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Tail Coverage (Old Policy) | New Policy with Prior Acts |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Cost** | 200%-250% of old premium (one-time) | Higher annual premium ongoing |
| **Limits** | Old limits ($50M per claim, $100M agg) | New limits (potentially higher) |
| **Terms** | Old policy terms (known exclusions, SIR) | New negotiated terms |
| **Duration** | Fixed (e.g., 36 months) | Ongoing (renewable annually) |
| **Suitability** | Clean break; seller pays | Acquirer assumes tail exposure |

**Recommendation:**

**Tail coverage** is typically preferred for pre-closing liabilities:
- Seller retains responsibility
- Acquirer avoids unknown seller liabilities
- Clean separation between pre-closing and post-closing coverage
- Tail costs can be escrowed or deducted from purchase price

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Coverage Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Prior Knowledge Exclusion (IUL)** | HIGH | MEDIUM (30-40%) | $25M-$45M (full settlement uninsured) | Data room investigation of internal communications 2015-2023; if prior knowledge found, negotiate settlement within SIR or allocate uncovered exposure |
| **Late Notice (IUL or FINRA)** | MEDIUM | LOW (10-15%) | $25M-$45M IUL (if late); $1.03M FINRA | Verify notice compliance in data room; if late, assess prejudice argument (weak under NE law for claims-made) |
| **Consumer Protection Exclusion** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (40-50%) | Partial allocation on $35M settlement = $12.5M-$17.5M uninsured | Analyze whether tort claims predominate; apply "larger settlement rule" to limit allocation |
| **Securities Law Exclusion (FINRA)** | LOW | LOW (20-30%) | $0 (already within SIR) | Economically irrelevant; FINRA arbitrations entirely within $5M SIR |
| **Tail Coverage Not Purchased** | HIGH | LOW (5%) | Loss of all post-closing coverage for pre-closing acts | Covenant in purchase agreement requiring seller to purchase 36-month tail; escrow tail premium |
| **Aggregate Limit Exhaustion** | MEDIUM | LOW (15%) | If IUL settles $45M + future claims >$55M aggregate | Chubb policy has $100M aggregate; IUL uses $40M, leaving $60M for other claims during policy period |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

**Data Room Diligence — E&O Coverage:**

1. **Complete E&O policy**: Obtain full policy (declarations page, insuring agreement, exclusions, endorsements) to verify:
   - Securities law exclusion language
   - Consumer protection/UDAP exclusion
   - Prior knowledge exclusion language
   - Change of control provisions
   - Extended reporting period terms and cost formula

2. **Notice letters to Chubb**: Review all correspondence for:
   - Date claims were reported to Chubb
   - Chubb's response (acceptance, reservation of rights, denial)
   - Any coverage position letters from Chubb

3. **Internal communications regarding IUL performance**: Search for emails/memos showing:
   - When LLIC became aware of gap between illustrated (8.5%) and actual (4.2%) IUL performance
   - Discussions about whether to revise illustration assumptions
   - Policyholder complaints about IUL performance before class action filing (August 2023)
   - Any consideration of mass remediation or credits to policyholders

4. **E&O insurance applications**: Review applications and renewal questionnaires for:
   - Disclosure of "circumstances that may give rise to a claim"
   - Representations regarding known claims or potential claims
   - Changes in underwriting information year-over-year

5. **Defense costs tracking**: Obtain records showing:
   - Total defense costs incurred to date for IUL class action
   - Total defense costs for 12 FINRA arbitrations
   - Whether defense costs are within or outside $5M SIR
   - Projected defense costs through settlement/trial

### C. Potential Uninsured Exposure Analysis

**Best Case Scenario:**
- IUL settles $35M with full coverage (Chubb pays $30M, LLIC pays $5M SIR)
- FINRA arbitrations $1.03M (LLIC pays 100% - within SIR)
- Tail coverage $3M-$6.25M (seller pays)
- **Total LLIC/Seller Exposure: $9.03M-$12.28M**

**Base Case Scenario:**
- IUL settles $40M with full coverage (Chubb pays $35M, LLIC pays $5M SIR)
- FINRA arbitrations $1.13M (LLIC pays 100%)
- Tail coverage $4M (36-month)
- **Total LLIC/Seller Exposure: $10.13M-$11M**

**Downside Scenario:**
- IUL settles $45M with 50% allocation (Chubb pays $20M, LLIC pays $5M SIR + $20M uncovered)
- FINRA arbitrations $1.13M (LLIC pays 100%)
- Tail coverage $6M
- **Total LLIC/Seller Exposure: $32.13M**

**Severe Downside Scenario:**
- Prior knowledge exclusion applies; IUL settlement $45M fully uninsured
- FINRA arbitrations $1.13M
- Late notice; Chubb denies coverage
- Tail coverage unavailable or not purchased
- **Total LLIC/Seller Exposure: $46.13M + future claims with no coverage**

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Coverage Conclusions

1. **IUL Class Action**: **Likely covered** subject to $5M SIR, absent prior knowledge exclusion. Settlement range $25M-$45M suggests Chubb will pay $20M-$40M, LLIC retains $5M SIR. Securities law exclusion **does not apply** (IUL is not a security). Consumer protection exclusion risk requires allocation analysis.

2. **FINRA Arbitrations**: **Covered** as professional negligence but **entirely within $5M SIR**. Total exposure $1.03M-$1.13M borne 100% by LLIC. No E&O recovery. Securities law exclusion is potential dispute but economically irrelevant.

3. **Nebraska Duty to Defend**: Favorable to LLIC — Chubb must investigate and defend if **any potential** for coverage. Broader than four-corners states.

4. **Notice Compliance**: **Critical**. Late notice under claims-made policy forfeits coverage without prejudice requirement. Data room verification required.

5. **Tail Coverage**: **Essential** for M&A transaction. Cost $3M-$6.25M for 36-month ERP. Must be purchased within 30 days of closing. Seller should bear cost and retain pre-closing liabilities.

### B. Recommended Next Steps for M&A Transaction

**Immediate (Due Diligence Phase):**

1. **Obtain complete E&O policy** from Liberty Life (full policy, not just declarations page)
2. **Review all notice correspondence** with Chubb for IUL class action and FINRA arbitrations
3. **Search internal communications** (2015-2023) regarding IUL performance vs. illustrations for prior knowledge analysis
4. **Obtain defense cost accounting** (breakdown by claim, total incurred to date, projected through resolution)
5. **Request Chubb coverage position** (written confirmation of coverage, reservation of rights letter, or denial)

**Pre-Closing (Transaction Structuring):**

6. **Negotiate tail coverage covenant**: Seller agrees to purchase 36-month extended reporting period at closing
7. **Escrow for uninsured exposure**: Recommend $12M-$15M escrow for:
   - IUL class action $5M SIR
   - FINRA arbitrations $1.13M
   - Tail coverage premium $3M-$6.25M
   - Contingency for partial coverage denial $2M-$3M
8. **Indemnification for pre-closing claims**: Seller indemnifies acquirer for all pre-closing professional liability claims filed post-closing
9. **Purchase price adjustment mechanisms**: Adjust for IUL settlement >$45M or E&O coverage denial

**Post-Closing:**

10. **Confirm tail coverage purchased**: Verify seller obtained extended reporting period endorsement and paid premium
11. **Obtain new E&O policy**: American Financial obtains new policy for post-closing professional services (no prior acts coverage for Liberty Life pre-closing business)
12. **Segregate claim handling**: Pre-closing claims handled under old policy/tail; post-closing claims under new policy

### C. Outstanding Questions for Data Room / Seller

1. **What is Liberty Life's annual E&O premium?** (Needed to calculate tail coverage cost)
2. **Has Chubb issued any reservation of rights or coverage position letters?** (Indicates coverage disputes)
3. **What is the exact policy period for the current E&O policy?** (Determines notice deadlines)
4. **Are defense costs "within" or "outside" the $5M SIR?** (Critical for SIR exhaustion calculation)
5. **Has Liberty Life disclosed the IUL class action and FINRA arbitrations to Chubb, and if so, when?** (Notice compliance)
6. **Does the E&O policy contain a consumer protection / UDAP exclusion?** (Affects IUL coverage)
7. **What is the policy's retroactive date?** (Determines coverage for wrongful acts before that date)
8. **Has Liberty Life filed any notice of circumstances with Chubb regarding potential claims?** (Pre-claim notice preserves coverage)

## IX. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment
✓ All relevant E&O policy provisions researched (wrongful act, exclusions, SIR, notice, tail coverage)
✓ Nebraska duty to defend standards analyzed (Allstate v. Novak precedent)
✓ Coverage analysis completed for both IUL class action and FINRA arbitrations
✓ M&A tail coverage requirements and costs quantified
✓ Cross-referenced with IUL Class Action report (T4) and FINRA Arbitrations report (T5)
✓ Identified gaps requiring data room verification (policy documents, notice letters, internal communications)

### Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| IUL class action likely covered (subject to exclusions) | HIGH | Standard E&O policy covers misrepresentation; IUL not a security |
| FINRA arbitrations entirely within $5M SIR | HIGH | Total exposure $1.03M-$1.13M well below SIR |
| Tail coverage cost $3M-$6.25M for 36 months | HIGH | Industry standard 200%-250% of annual premium |
| Nebraska follows duty to defend with investigation (Allstate v. Novak) | HIGH | Binding Nebraska Supreme Court precedent from 1981 |
| Prior knowledge exclusion risk requires data room verification | MEDIUM | Cannot assess without reviewing internal communications 2015-2023 |
| Late notice prejudice not required under Nebraska claims-made policy law | MEDIUM | Based on general principles; no specific Nebraska case law identified |

### Known Limitations
- E&O policy terms not provided; analysis based on industry-standard policy language
- Notice compliance status unknown; requires data room access to correspondence with Chubb
- Prior knowledge risk cannot be assessed without reviewing internal Liberty Life communications regarding IUL performance
- Defense cost allocation (within vs. outside SIR) not specified; assumes within SIR per industry standard
- Chubb coverage position (acceptance, reservation of rights, denial) not provided
