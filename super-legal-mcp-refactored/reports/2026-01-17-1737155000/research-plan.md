## RESEARCH QUALITY STANDARDS

### For Each Specialist Report:
- [ ] Executive Summary: 2,000-5,000 words, self-contained
- [ ] All critical issues from checklist addressed (or noted as N/A with reason)
- [ ] Quantified exposure ranges for material findings
- [ ] Cross-domain impacts flagged with target section references
- [ ] Bluebook citations with database provenance (U.S.C., CFR, case reporters, state statutes)
- [ ] Recommendations: specific, actionable, tied to legal authority

### Citation Density Targets:
| Report Type | Target Citations | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Regulatory | 60-100 | Heavy CFR/statutory (NAIC Model Acts, Nebraska statutes) |
| Case Law | 40-80 | Focus on holdings (Nebraska Consumer Protection Act, suitability precedents) |
| Tax | 50-90 | IRC + regulations + cases (interest deductibility, surplus notes treatment) |
| Commercial | 30-60 | Contract + statutory (reinsurance treaty terms, recapture provisions) |

## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| NAIC databases accessible | User instruction "assume NAIC databases accessible" | Would require alternative sources for RBC ratios, statutory filings |
| Nebraska DOI examination reports available | User instruction "assume state insurance department databases accessible" | Would limit market conduct findings to publicly available information |
| SEC/FINRA databases accessible | User instruction "assume SEC/FINRA databases accessible" | Would limit separate account registration verification, FINRA exam findings |
| All LLIC documents in data room | User instruction "assume all LLIC documents available in data room" | Would require client to provide reinsurance agreements, RBC workpapers, litigation files |
| $150M capital injection approved by Nebraska DOI | User states "approval likely" | If DOI rejects or requires >$150M, RBC ratio remains <200%, alternative remediation needed |
| IUL class action settles within $25M-$45M range | Insurance defense counsel estimate | If settlement >$45M or trial verdict adverse, may exceed E&O coverage $50M |
| Vermont captive structure acceptable to Nebraska DOI | 50-60% probability per user | If Nebraska disallows reserve credit (10-15% probability), $730M surplus reduction → RBC 114% |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual Nebraska DOI 2024 market conduct exam final report not yet issued (expected Q1 2025, using preliminary findings)
- IUL class action Thompson v. Liberty Life discovery ongoing (settlement negotiations confidential, using defense counsel estimates)
- Vermont captive Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC financial statements (using parent company disclosures + Vermont DFR public filings)

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:** Financial modeling (T8) depends on T1-T7 completion (RBC components, captive scenarios, IUL settlement amounts, reinsurance terms, tax efficiency analysis)

**Potential Issues:**
- If RBC Plan rejected by Nebraska DOI → cannot close without alternative remediation (increase reinsurance, reduce new sales, asset sale)
- If Vermont captive disallowed → $730M surplus reduction → RBC 114% regulatory action level → may trigger seizure risk
- If IUL class action settlement >$45M → exceeds E&O coverage → purchase price adjustment

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If any specialist finds deal-blocking issue (regulatory approval impossible, RBC seizure risk, litigation >$100M uncovered)
- If Nebraska DOI RBC Plan approval timeline exceeds Q3 2025 closing target
- If captive reinsurance requires >$500M LOC (cost prohibitive)

**RESEARCH PLAN STATUS:** READY FOR EXECUTION

**NEXT STEP:** Spawn T1-T7 specialists in parallel (Phase 1)
