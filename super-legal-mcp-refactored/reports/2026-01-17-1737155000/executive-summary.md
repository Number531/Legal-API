# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & BOARD BRIEFING

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED / ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

**Matter**: Project Chronos - American Financial Holdings LLC Acquisition of Liberty Life Insurance Company
**Prepared for**: American Financial Holdings LLC Board of Directors
**Date**: January 17, 2026
**Purchase Price**: $2.9 billion (stock acquisition)

---

## I. TRANSACTION RECOMMENDATION

**RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT PROCEED** at $2.9 billion purchase price.

### BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

**RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT PROCEED at $2.9B purchase price.** Financial modeling shows -10.5% blended IRR (0.65x MOIC) with $606.9M aggregate weighted exposure (21% of deal value), driven by Vermont Captive AG48 regulatory non-compliance ($401.5M) and reinsurance recapture risk ($190.7M). Transaction becomes viable only at $1.0B-$1.2B valuation (59-65% price reduction), requiring fundamental renegotiation or seller distress.

### Rationale

This transaction destroys shareholder value at the proposed $2.9B purchase price. Even under the Base Case scenario (60% probability), the transaction delivers -3.15% IRR and 0.80x MOIC, meaning acquirer loses 20% of invested capital. The Downside Case (30% probability) produces -8.85% IRR with 46% capital loss, and the Severe Downside Case (10% probability) produces -31.2% IRR with 82% capital loss or total loss if regulatory seizure occurs.

The transaction's negative returns are driven by three structural risks that cannot be mitigated through standard purchase agreement protections: (1) Liberty Life's $1.2B Vermont Captive reinsurance structure violates AG48 prohibited practices, requiring $401.5M weighted remediation; (2) Global Re reinsurance treaties (66% concentration, $12.8B program) contain change-of-control recapture rights exposing acquirer to $190.7M weighted capital outflow; and (3) post-acquisition agent attrition (25% base case) creates $67.1M revenue impact compounding other risks. *See Sections IV.A, IV.B, IV.E, IV.G for detailed analysis.*

### Critical Conditions for Proceeding

If the Board elects to pursue alternative transaction pathways:

1. **Price Reduction to $1.0B-$1.2B** - See **Section IV.H** for target valuation methodology achieving 15% IRR threshold
2. **Vermont Captive Resolution Pre-Closing** - Seller must remediate AG48 violation or post $300M letter of credit accepted by Nebraska DOI - See **Section IV.A**
3. **Global Re Reinsurance Consent** - Minimum 60% retention guarantee in writing prior to signing - See **Section IV.E**
4. **Thompson IUL Settlement** - Class action resolved pre-closing with E&O insurance coverage confirmed - See **Section IV.D**

## I.B. BRIEF ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS PRESENTED

| Q# | Question | Answer | Rationale | Section |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Does Liberty Life's Vermont Captive structure violate AG48 prohibited practices? | **Yes** | $1.2B captive's 86% parental guarantee exceeds 50% Primary Security limit under 8 V.S.A. section 3(14)(E)(i); structure lacks economic substance per AG48 enforcement standards | IV.A, IV.B |
| 2 | Will Nebraska DOI approve Form A change of control within 90 days? | **Probably No** | 6-9 month timeline per comparable transactions; AG48 violation and RBC deficiency (188% vs. 200% threshold) create regulatory scrutiny | IV.A |
| 3 | Can Global Re exercise recapture rights upon change of control? | **Probably Yes** | 60% probability based on treaty language; $12.8B program creates $190.7M weighted exposure if 12.5% standalone recapture + correlation scenarios | IV.E |
| 4 | Is the Thompson IUL class action likely to result in material liability? | **Yes** | 75% settlement probability at $37.5M (E&O covers $32.5M); $22.6M weighted exposure after insurance; follow-on litigation risk adds $7.8M | IV.D |
| 5 | Does the transaction achieve target 15% IRR at $2.9B price? | **No** | Blended -10.5% IRR, 0.65x MOIC; transaction requires $1.7B-$1.9B price reduction (59-65%) to achieve 15% IRR | IV.H |
| 6 | Are Liberty Life's variable product distributions compliant with SEC/FINRA rules? | **Probably No** | 18 prospectus delivery violations, 25 documented suitability violations, supervision deficiencies; $1.95M-$4.88M weighted enforcement exposure | IV.C |
| 7 | Will post-acquisition agent attrition materially impact revenue? | **Yes** | 25% base case attrition (163 of 650 agents) creates $67.1M first-year net impact, $127.4M three-year NPV; Nebraska non-compete unenforceability exacerbates risk | IV.G |
| 8 | Are there material tax structure optimization opportunities? | **Probably Yes** | $150M surplus notes generate $17.6M NPV tax benefit (85% DOI approval probability); hybrid equity backstop preserves value if rejected | IV.F |

**Answer Scale:** Yes (high confidence) / Probably Yes (more likely than not) / Uncertain / Probably No / No (high confidence)

## IV. CROSS-DOMAIN IMPACT ANALYSIS

### A. Vermont Captive Cascade: Regulatory --> Capital --> Valuation

The Vermont Captive AG48 violation (Section IV.A) creates a cascading impact across multiple transaction domains. Liberty Life's $1.2B captive reinsurance structure, with 86% parental guarantee (versus 50% AG48 limit), triggers Nebraska DOI scrutiny during Form A review. If Nebraska DOI disallows the captive structure, Liberty Life must restore $730M in reserves, reducing statutory surplus by $610M net and collapsing RBC from 188% to 114% - approaching the 100% Authorized Control Level seizure threshold.

This capital remediation requirement directly impacts the financial analysis (Section IV.H). The $150M base case capital injection increases to $550M (Downside) or $1,140M (Severe) if captive disallowance occurs. These additional capital requirements reduce exit value and contribute to negative IRR across all scenarios. The captive issue alone represents 66% of total weighted exposure ($401.5M of $606.9M).

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $401.5M - $730.0M

### B. Reinsurance Recapture --> Revenue --> Distribution Disruption

Global Re's change-of-control recapture right (Section IV.E) creates a second major risk cascade. If Global Re exercises recapture for $150M-$225M of ceded reserves (citing "financial deterioration" clause if RBC falls below 150%), Liberty Life must retain mortality risk and reduce statutory surplus. This surplus reduction limits the company's ability to maintain competitive agent commission schedules.

The surplus reduction compounds the agent attrition risk (Section IV.G). With 25% base case attrition (163 of 650 agents departing) already projected, additional financial instability from reinsurance recapture could accelerate attrition to 35-45%, creating $93.8M-$128.0M revenue impact versus the base $67.1M. Nebraska's strict non-compete limitations (only narrow customer non-solicitation enforceable) provide no legal protection against departing agents taking their books of business.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $190.7M reinsurance + $67.1M-$128.0M attrition = $257.8M-$318.7M

### C. IUL Litigation --> Securities Compliance --> Distribution Restriction

The Thompson IUL class action (Section IV.D), with 850 certified class members and $22.6M weighted settlement exposure, evidences systemic prospectus deficiencies and suitability supervision failures documented in Section IV.C (25 suitability violations, 18 prospectus delivery violations). Combined, these findings create ongoing SEC/FINRA enforcement risk requiring pre-closing resolution.

If Thompson litigation proceeds to trial (5% probability) with adverse verdict ($85M-$105M), the publicity would compound agent attrition beyond base case projections. The litigation cross-reference in Section IV.G estimates an incremental $20M-$40M revenue loss if Thompson remains unresolved and highly publicized at closing. Additionally, the E&O insurance carrier has invoked fraud exclusion reservation of rights (30% denial probability), potentially leaving Liberty Life with uninsured exposure.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $22.6M (Thompson weighted) + $10.5M (E&O denial) + $20M-$40M (incremental attrition) = $53.1M-$73.1M

### D. Capital Structure --> Tax Efficiency --> Return Enhancement

Section IV.F identifies $17.6M NPV tax benefit through surplus note capital injection ($150M at 6.5% interest, tax-deductible). However, 15% Nebraska DOI rejection probability creates $2.64M weighted exposure. The hybrid structure with equity conversion backstop preserves value if DOI rejects surplus notes while maintaining transaction certainty.

The tax benefit partially offsets other exposures but is insufficient to alter the fundamental transaction economics. At -10.5% blended IRR, even capturing 100% of the $17.6M tax benefit improves returns by only 50-60 basis points - still 1,500+ basis points below the 15% hurdle rate.

**Aggregate Theme Exposure**: $17.6M benefit at risk (15% probability) = $2.64M weighted exposure

## V. NEGOTIATION POSITION SUMMARY

| Issue | Opening Position | Target | Walk-Away | Section |
|-------|------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Purchase Price | $1.0B | $1.2B | $1.4B maximum | IV.H |
| Vermont Captive Escrow | $450M (48-month survival) | $350M (36-month) | $250M minimum | IV.A |
| Reinsurance Escrow | $175M | $145M | $100M minimum | IV.E |
| IUL Litigation Escrow | $40M | $30M | $20M minimum | IV.D |
| Agent Retention Program | $26M (seller-funded) | $20M (split 60/40) | $15M buyer maximum | IV.G |
| Global Re Consent | Pre-signing commitment | Pre-closing condition | Walk if >40% recapture | IV.E |
| Vermont LOC | Seller posts $300M pre-signing | Seller posts pre-closing | Buyer posts with price adj. | IV.A |

### Key Leverage Points

1. **Financial Modeling Evidence**: Section IV.H demonstrates -10.5% IRR at $2.9B with rigorous 3-scenario analysis; transaction uneconomic without 59-65% price reduction
2. **Vermont Captive Quantification**: Section IV.A/IV.B provides $401.5M weighted exposure calculation with 24x ROI mitigation strategy (LOC)
3. **Walk-Away Credibility**: Acquirer preserves $2.9B capital for alternative deployment; Liberty Life has limited alternative buyers for regulatory-challenged asset

### Anticipated Counter-Party Positions

| Position | Likelihood | Our Counter | Evidence Basis |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| "Vermont Captive will be grandfathered" | MEDIUM | Nebraska DOI follows AG48 enforcement trend; no Nebraska precedent accepting 86% parental guarantee structures | Section IV.A precedent analysis; Apollo/Athene comparables |
| "$2.9B reflects fair market value" | HIGH | Financial modeling shows negative returns at $2.9B under all scenarios including Base Case; comparable insurance M&A multiples support $1.0B-$1.2B | Section IV.H 3-scenario IRR/MOIC analysis |
| "Agent attrition will be <15%" | HIGH | LIMRA 2025 data shows 85% four-year cumulative attrition; Mercer 2024 PE acquisition median is 25% first-year | Section IV.G industry research citations |
| "Escrow demands are excessive" | HIGH | $595M-$720M escrow (20-25% of revised price) aligns with market 10-20% range for PE insurance acquisitions with RBC deficiencies | Section IV.A precedent transaction analysis |

## VI. TIMELINE & CRITICAL PATH

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Risk Level | Section |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|------------|---------|
| Position Letter to Seller | +15 days | Board authorization | LOW | N/A |
| Vermont DFR Informal Guidance | +45 days | Regulatory engagement | MEDIUM | IV.A |
| Global Re Consent Negotiation | +60 days | Direct reinsurer engagement | HIGH | IV.E |
| Thompson IUL Mediation | Q1 2025 | Settlement parameters | MEDIUM | IV.D |
| Form A Filing (if proceeding) | +90 days | Price agreement; remediation plan | HIGH | IV.A |
| Nebraska DOI Approval | +270 days (9 months) | Form A completeness | HIGH | IV.A |
| FINRA Form CMA Filing | +90 days | Securities compliance audit | MEDIUM | IV.C |
| Target Closing | Q3-Q4 2026 | All regulatory approvals | HIGH | IV.A |

### Critical Path Risks

- **Vermont DFR Rejection of LOC Strategy**: If Vermont DFR refuses $300M LOC for captive remediation, requires full recapture - adds $300M-$400M to capital requirements and extends timeline 6-12 months
- **Global Re Consent Failure**: If Global Re exercises recapture upon change of control announcement, creates immediate capital pressure pre-closing; consider walk-away
- **Form A Denial**: 27-35% probability Nebraska DOI denies or severely conditions Form A; transaction termination risk

## VIII. DECISION REQUIRED

```
DECISION REQUIRED: Board authorization to (1) terminate negotiations at $2.9B price,
OR (2) submit $1.0B-$1.2B counteroffer with enhanced protections, by February 17, 2026.

OPTIONS:

Option A: TERMINATE AT $2.9B (RECOMMENDED)
- Preserves $2.9B capital for alternative deployment
- Avoids -10.5% IRR capital destruction ($1.2B expected loss)
- Frees resources for alternative M&A opportunities
- Re-engage only if Liberty Life becomes distressed (regulatory order, rating downgrade)
- Status: RECOMMENDED

Option B: COUNTEROFFER AT $1.0B-$1.2B
- Maintains strategic interest in Liberty Life platform
- Requires seller acceptance of 59-65% price reduction (LOW probability)
- Achieves 15% IRR hurdle if accepted with all conditions met
- Requires enhanced protections: $595M-$720M escrow, pre-closing remediation
- Status: ALTERNATIVE (if seller distress emerges)

Option C: PROCEED AT $2.9B WITH CONDITIONS
- High execution risk; requires perfect outcome on all contingencies
- Even Base Case (60% probability) delivers negative returns (-3.15% IRR)
- $606.9M aggregate weighted exposure inadequately mitigated by any escrow structure
- Status: NOT RECOMMENDED

RECOMMENDED: Option A (Terminate)

Rationale: The transaction's -10.5% blended IRR at $2.9B represents unacceptable capital
destruction. While Liberty Life presents potential strategic fit, the valuation disconnect
is insurmountable without 59-65% price reduction, which seller is unlikely to accept absent
distressed circumstances. Proceeding destroys an expected $1.2B in shareholder value.
