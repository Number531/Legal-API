## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This memorandum analyzes the Joint Commission accreditation compliance status of Mercy Regional Health System's four acute care hospitals in connection with National Healthcare Partners LLC's proposed $2.4 billion acquisition. The research focuses on Mercy Regional Medical Center's October 2024 Joint Commission triennial survey, which identified eight (8) standards deficiencies resulting in an accreditation decision requiring follow-up verification in March 2025. The critical legal issue is whether these deficiencies threaten the hospital's "deemed status" under 42 CFR § 488.5—the regulatory mechanism by which Joint Commission accreditation substitutes for direct CMS surveys to certify Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoPs) compliance.

**Bottom Line:** The risk of Mercy Regional losing Joint Commission accreditation and deemed status is **LOW (10-20% probability)**, but if it occurs, the financial consequences are **CATASTROPHIC** ($864 million in annual Medicare revenue at risk, representing 48% of system-wide net patient revenue). Corrective actions implemented October-December 2024 are comprehensive and sustainable, including engineering controls (automated medication dispensing, magnetic fire door hold-opens, electronic hand hygiene monitoring) and software systems (credentialing management). The March 2025 follow-up survey will likely result in full accreditation restoration (75-85% probability), eliminating deemed status risk for the next three years until the 2027-2028 triennial survey cycle.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Deemed Status - The Critical Regulatory Gatekeeper

**What is "Deemed Status"?** Under 42 CFR § 488.5, hospitals accredited by Joint Commission-approved national accrediting organizations are "deemed" to meet Medicare Conditions of Participation without undergoing separate CMS surveys. The Joint Commission received CMS approval for continued deemed status authority on May 2, 2022 (87 Fed. Reg. 26,261), valid for six years through May 2, 2028. Approximately 4,000 U.S. hospitals (~70% of all acute care hospitals) rely on Joint Commission accreditation for deemed status.

**Why Deemed Status Matters:** Hospitals WITH deemed status undergo Joint Commission triennial surveys (every 3 years) and are subject to Joint Commission's standards enforcement, which emphasizes continuous improvement and corrective action plans. Hospitals WITHOUT deemed status must undergo direct CMS validation surveys conducted by state health departments, which apply Medicare CoPs (42 CFR Part 482) with zero tolerance for condition-level deficiencies and use stricter immediate jeopardy standards. Loss of deemed status exposes hospitals to:

- **More frequent surveys:** CMS resurveys every 12-36 months vs. Joint Commission's 3-year cycle
- **Stricter enforcement:** CMS issues immediate jeopardy findings (life/safety threats) more readily than Joint Commission, triggering 23-day termination timelines
- **Provider agreement termination risk:** If CMS cites condition-level deficiencies not corrected within 90 days, Medicare provider agreement can be terminated under 42 CFR § 489.53, resulting in loss of all Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement ($1.26 billion annually for Mercy system = 70% of net patient revenue)
- **Commercial payer contract termination:** Many commercial insurance contracts (Humana MA, UnitedHealthcare MA, Anthem, Aetna) require Joint Commission accreditation as condition of network participation; loss of accreditation triggers contract review and potential termination ($270-400 million commercial revenue at risk, 15-22% of net patient revenue)

**Recent 2024 CMS Proposal (Not Yet Final):** In February 2024, CMS proposed a rule (89 Fed. Reg. 10,618) that would allow deemed status loss after a **single condition-level citation** on a CMS validation survey, with hospitals subject to "ongoing review by the state survey agency" until compliance demonstrated. The American Hospital Association opposed this proposal as "overly punitive," arguing it treats hospitals as "guilty until proven innocent" and that short-term deemed status loss could be "devastating" because many states and commercial payers require deemed status for participation. As of January 2026, CMS has not finalized this rule, but the proposal signals heightened regulatory scrutiny of deemed status arrangements.

#### 2. October 2024 Survey Deficiencies - Detailed Assessment

**Survey Context:** Joint Commission surveyors conducted Mercy Regional Medical Center's triennial survey October 14-16, 2024 (3-day on-site visit). The survey covered all Joint Commission Hospital Accreditation Program standards across seven domains: patient care, medication management, infection prevention, environment of care, medical staff, quality improvement, and patient rights. The survey team reviewed 30-50 patient medical records, interviewed physicians/nurses/pharmacists, toured operating rooms/pharmacy/emergency department/patient care units, and observed patient care in real-time.

**Eight Deficiencies Identified (Requirements for Improvement):**

**Deficiency #1 - Medication Management (MM.05.01.09): Expired Medications in Operating Room Pharmacy**
- **Finding:** 12 expired medications discovered during surveyor inspection of OR pharmacy (expired 2-6 months prior)
- **Risk:** If expired medications inadvertently administered during surgery, reduced efficacy (especially critical for anesthetics, antibiotics, vasopressors) or chemical degradation producing toxic byproducts (e.g., tetracycline → nephrotoxic)
- **Root Cause:** Inadequate monthly inspections; manual pharmacy cart checks failed to identify expired medications
- **Corrective Action:** Implemented Pyxis automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) with automatic expiration alerts, monthly pharmacist-led inspections documented in compliance logs, OR nurse/pharmacist training on expiration date checking (October 2024)
- **Sustainability Assessment:** ✅ STRONG - Automated system (Pyxis) provides ongoing control less dependent on human vigilance; alerts lock out expired medications from selection menu
- **CMS CoPs Comparison:** 42 CFR § 482.25 (pharmaceutical services) requires hospitals to ensure medications are "prepared and administered according to established policies and procedures." CMS would likely cite this as a condition-level deficiency if validation survey occurred before corrective action verified.

**Deficiency #2 - Infection Prevention (IC.01.04.01): Hand Hygiene Compliance Below Target**
- **Finding:** Hand hygiene compliance rate 78% (surveyors observed 100 hand hygiene opportunities, staff performed hand hygiene correctly 78 times)
- **Benchmark:** Joint Commission does not mandate specific numerical target, but CDC recommends ≥95% and industry standard is 90%+
- **Risk:** Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) directly linked to hand hygiene compliance - MRSA, *C. difficile*, surgical site infections (SSIs), central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). CMS Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program penalizes hospitals in worst-performing 25% with 1% Medicare payment reduction (~$8-9 million annually for Mercy Regional). Mercy already penalized -0.8% ($6.9 million annually) for excess readmissions; additional HAC penalty would compound financial impact.
- **Corrective Action:** Deployed hand hygiene coaches (RNs observe/educate in real-time), electronic monitoring system (sensors on dispensers track usage by unit/shift), leadership rounding (CNO/CMO weekly rounds emphasizing hand hygiene). Result: Compliance increased 78% → 88% December 2024, target 90% by March 2025.
- **Sustainability Assessment:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - 88% compliance as of December 2024 still below 90% target. If not achieved by March 2025, Joint Commission may require additional 6-month follow-up (but would NOT deny accreditation). Electronic monitoring provides objective data; leadership engagement signals organizational priority. Risk: Hand hygiene coaches are resource-intensive; compliance may decline if coaches reassigned after survey.
- **CMS CoPs Comparison:** 42 CFR § 482.42 (infection prevention and control) requires hospitals to "provide a sanitary environment to avoid sources and transmission of infections." CMS interpretive guidance expects ongoing surveillance and compliance targets, but does not mandate specific percentage. 88% trending toward 90% may satisfy CMS if improvement trajectory documented.

**Deficiency #3 - Environment of Care (EC.02.01.01): Fire Door Propped Open**
- **Finding:** 3rd floor stairwell fire door propped open with trash can (manual obstruction preventing self-closure)
- **Violation:** NFPA 101 Life Safety Code § 7.2.1.8.2 - "Fire doors shall be self-closing or automatic-closing and shall not be blocked open"
- **Risk:** Fire safety violation; if fire occurs, smoke/fire spreads to stairwell (critical evacuation route), trapping patients/staff. State Fire Marshal can independently cite (separate from Joint Commission) with civil penalties $500-$10,000 per violation per day (Ohio Revised Code § 3737.99).
- **Corrective Action:** Facilities management inspected all fire doors hospital-wide, removed obstructions, installed magnetic hold-opens connected to fire alarm system (doors held open for convenience but automatically release when fire alarm activated, compliant with NFPA 101 Exception 2 for automatic-closing devices), staff training on fire door importance, monthly inspections documenting self-closing mechanisms functional.
- **Sustainability Assessment:** ✅ STRONG - Magnetic hold-opens provide permanent engineering control eliminating incentive to prop doors. However, devices must be tested annually to verify fire alarm activation releases doors (NFPA 72 compliance). If magnetic hold-open malfunctions or fire alarm test fails, life safety deficiency persists.
- **CMS CoPs Comparison:** 42 CFR § 482.41(b) requires hospitals to comply with NFPA 101 Life Safety Code. CMS applies identical standard as Joint Commission; no difference in enforcement.

**Deficiency #4 - Medical Staff (MS.06.01.05): Credentialing File Incomplete**
- **Finding:** Dr. James Wilson's credentialing file missing primary source verification of medical school graduation (file dated 2021 reappointment, verification should have been conducted within 2 years)
- **Requirement:** Joint Commission and 42 CFR § 482.12(a)(7) require primary source verification for: medical school graduation, residency/fellowship completion, board certification, state medical license, DEA registration, malpractice claims history (NPDB National Practitioner Data Bank query)
- **Risk:** If unqualified physician practices without proper verification, medical errors, patient harm, malpractice claims. Hospital faces negligent credentialing liability if physician's credentials were falsified and not verified.
- **Corrective Action:** Obtained Dr. Wilson's medical school diploma copy, verified with FSMB (Federation of State Medical Boards), updated credentialing file. Conducted system-wide audit of all 1,850 physicians (650 employed + 1,200 privileged), ensured primary source verification current within 2 years (completed November 2024). Implemented VerityStream credentialing software with automated alerts (reappointment due, primary source verification expiration approaching), reducing human error.
- **Sustainability Assessment:** ✅ STRONG - VerityStream software provides automated controls preventing future lapses. System-wide audit of 1,850 files demonstrates comprehensive correction (not just Dr. Wilson). Risk: Software relies on accurate data entry; if medical staff office fails to input expiration dates correctly, alerts will not trigger.
- **CMS CoPs Comparison:** 42 CFR § 482.12 requires medical staff bylaws specify qualifications for privileges but does not explicitly mandate primary source verification in regulation text (though CMS State Operations Manual interpretive guidance recommends). Joint Commission standard is MORE stringent - explicit 2-year reappointment cycle and primary source verification requirements. If CMS surveyed Mercy Regional before November 2024 system-wide audit, would likely cite as condition-level deficiency.

**Deficiencies #5-8 (Lower Risk, Corrected):**
- **#5 Pain Assessment Documentation:** Nursing staff not consistently documenting pain reassessment after medication. Corrected via EHR (Epic) hard-stop alert requiring documentation within 60 minutes.
- **#6 Patient Education Materials:** Some materials not available in Spanish for limited English proficiency patients. Corrected via translation of all materials, medical interpreter services expanded.
- **#7 Emergency Management Drills:** ED staff participation 85% (target 95%). Corrected via mandatory drill participation policy, participation increased to 92% December 2024.
- **#8 Quality Improvement Data Review:** Some quality metrics not reviewed by Board quarterly. Corrected via revised Board Quality Committee meeting schedule, dashboard created for Board access.

**Overall Deficiency Profile Assessment:**
- **None were immediate jeopardy level** (life/safety threats requiring 23-day correction timelines)
- **4 significant deficiencies** (medication management, infection prevention, life safety, credentialing) + **4 minor** (pain assessment, patient education, drills, Board review)
- **All addressed with corrective actions October-December 2024** using engineering controls, software systems, electronic monitoring, documented policies
- **Comparable to Mercy South Hospital's 2021 deficiency profile** (medication management + infection prevention), which was successfully corrected January 2022 → full accreditation restored February 2022

**Accreditation Decision:** Based on the deficiency profile and corrective actions, Mercy Regional's October 2024 accreditation decision most likely was **"Accreditation"** (full accreditation with Requirements for Improvement) or **"Accreditation with Follow-up Survey"** (full accreditation maintained, but on-site follow-up required within 6 months to verify sustained compliance). The March 2025 follow-up survey scheduled 5 months after October 2024 suggests the latter decision category.

#### 3. March 2025 Follow-Up Survey - Predicted Outcome

**What Joint Commission Will Verify:** Surveyors will conduct focused follow-up survey (1-2 days on-site) specifically targeting the 8 deficiencies cited in October 2024. Verification methods:
- **Medication Management:** Inspect OR pharmacy, verify no expired medications present, review Pyxis alert logs
- **Infection Prevention:** Observe 50-100 hand hygiene opportunities, calculate compliance rate (target ≥90%)
- **Life Safety:** Conduct fire alarm activation test, verify all fire doors release and close automatically upon smoke detector activation
- **Credentialing:** Sample 20-30 credentialing files, verify primary source verification current within 2 years, review VerityStream automated alerts

**Predicted Outcomes:**

| Outcome | Probability | Implications |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Full Accreditation Restored** | **75-85%** | Next triennial survey 2027-2028 (3 years); deemed status maintained; no further follow-up required |
| **Accreditation with Additional Follow-Up** (6 months) | **10-15%** | If hand hygiene <90% OR fire alarm test fails; full accreditation maintained, but follow-up required September 2025 |
| **Preliminary Denial of Accreditation** | **<5%** | Only if multiple deficiencies not corrected OR new immediate jeopardy finding discovered; 60-day window to demonstrate substantial compliance or appeal; deemed status at risk |

**Rationale for 75-85% Probability of Full Accreditation:**
- 7 of 8 deficiencies have strong, sustainable corrective actions (engineering controls, software systems, documented policies)
- Only uncertainty: hand hygiene compliance 88% vs. 90% target (trending upward, but not yet at target)
- Mercy South Hospital precedent: Nearly identical deficiency profile (medication management + infection prevention) corrected January 2022 → full accreditation restored February 2022
- Joint Commission emphasizes continuous improvement and corrective action sustainability; rarely denies accreditation if hospital demonstrates good faith effort and systems-level remediation (preliminary denial rate <5% of all surveys)

**Trigger for Alternative Outcome (Additional Follow-Up):** If hand hygiene compliance remains 88-89% in March 2025 OR if fire alarm activation test reveals magnetic hold-opens fail to release doors properly, Joint Commission may grant full accreditation but require 6-month follow-up (September 2025) to verify further improvement. This would maintain deemed status but extend survey scrutiny.

**Trigger for Worst-Case Outcome (Preliminary Denial):** Only if surveyors discover (1) multiple October 2024 deficiencies not corrected, (2) new immediate jeopardy findings during follow-up (e.g., expired medications still present, fire doors still propped), or (3) evidence of systemic quality/safety failures beyond the original 8 deficiencies. Given comprehensive corrective actions and system-wide audits (1,850 physician files, all fire doors, hand hygiene monitoring system), this outcome is highly unlikely (<5% probability).

#### 4. Financial Risk Quantification

**Expected Value Analysis:**

| Scenario | Probability | Financial Impact | Expected Value |
|----------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Base Case:** March 2025 full accreditation restored | 80% | $0 | $0 |
| **Alternative:** 6-month follow-up required | 12.5% | $375K (consultant costs) | $47K |
| **Downside:** Preliminary denial → CMS validation survey → condition-level citations | 7.5% | $500K-$1M survey costs + $270M-$400M commercial payer contract risk (assume 50% probability payers terminate = $185M midpoint) | $13.9M |
| **Catastrophic:** Medicare provider agreement terminated | 2% | $864M Medicare + $396M Medicaid = $1.26B annual revenue | $25.2M |
| **TOTAL EXPECTED RISK** | | | **$39.2M** |

**As Percentage of Purchase Price:** $39.2M ÷ $2.4B = **1.6%** (within acceptable M&A risk tolerance for healthcare regulatory issues)

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- **Best Case (90% probability full accreditation):** Expected risk = $17M (0.7% of purchase price)
- **Worst Case (20% probability preliminary denial):** Expected risk = $87M (3.6% of purchase price)

**Recommended Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanisms:**
- **Escrow Holdback:** $50-100 million (2-4% of purchase price) held for 12 months post-closing, released upon verification that (a) March 2025 JC follow-up resulted in full accreditation, (b) no CMS validation surveys citing condition-level deficiencies, (c) deemed status maintained, (d) no commercial payer contracts terminated due to JC accreditation concerns.
- **Adjustment Formula:** If Mercy Regional receives preliminary denial or denial of accreditation, purchase price reduced by $400M-$700M (reflecting estimated reduction in Regional's value due to deemed status loss, commercial payer contract risk, and CMS survey compliance costs).
- **Material Adverse Change Clause:** Explicitly define loss of Joint Commission accreditation or Medicare provider agreement termination as **per se MAC**, giving Buyer right to terminate transaction or renegotiate purchase price.

#### 5. Other Hospitals - System-Wide Accreditation Health

**Mercy Northwest Hospital (Dublin, 285 beds):**
- Joint Commission accredited 2019 (opened 2019, initial survey full accreditation)
- No deficiencies cited; 4-star Medicare Hospital Compare rating (above average)
- Next triennial survey due 2028
- **Deemed Status Risk:** VERY LOW (<5%) - newest facility, state-of-the-art design, no compliance concerns

**Mercy East Hospital (Reynoldsburg, 185 beds):**
- Joint Commission accredited 2001 (most recent survey 2022, full accreditation)
- Minor deficiencies 2022 (emergency management, patient rights) corrected within 60 days
- Next triennial survey due 2031
- **Deemed Status Risk:** LOW (5-10%) - well-managed facility, minor deficiencies corrected promptly

**Mercy South Hospital (Lancaster, 290 beds):**
- Joint Commission accredited 1975 (most recent survey 2021)
- Accreditation with Follow-up Survey 2021 (similar deficiencies to Regional 2024: medication management, infection prevention)
- Corrective action January 2022, follow-up February 2022 satisfactory → full accreditation restored
- Next triennial survey due 2030
- **Deemed Status Risk:** LOW (5-10%) - successfully corrected similar deficiency profile, strong precedent for Regional's March 2025 follow-up

**System-Wide Assessment:** 3 of 4 hospitals have full accreditation with no pending follow-ups. Only Regional has March 2025 follow-up pending. System accreditation health is strong; Regional's issues are isolated to one hospital and mirror South's 2021 deficiencies (which were successfully corrected).

#### 6. Cross-Domain Implications for Other Specialists

**Impact on Medicare Provider Agreements (Target: T9 - securities-researcher):**
If Mercy Regional loses Joint Commission accreditation, CMS must conduct CoPs validation survey within 60-90 days. Risk of condition-level citations for deficiencies Joint Commission identified: medication management (42 CFR § 482.25), infection prevention (42 CFR § 482.42), life safety (42 CFR § 482.41), credentialing (42 CFR § 482.12). If condition-level deficiencies not corrected within 90 days, CMS may terminate Medicare provider agreement (42 CFR § 489.53), resulting in loss of CCN 360001 (Regional's provider number) and $354 million annual Medicare revenue for Regional alone. Appeal rights under 42 CFR Part 498 available but termination remains effective during appeal unless ALJ grants stay (rare).

**Impact on Commercial Contracts (Target: T11 - commercial-contracts-analyst):**
Many commercial payer contracts (Humana MA, UnitedHealthcare MA, Anthem, Aetna) require Joint Commission accreditation as condition of network participation. Loss of JC accreditation could trigger (a) termination for cause provisions, (b) material breach allowing payer to renegotiate rates, or (c) "quality/safety" review clauses requiring additional documentation/audits. Estimated $270M-$400M commercial revenue at risk if payers terminate. Research question: Do Mercy's payer contracts contain "Joint Commission accreditation" as material representation? What are grace periods for cure? Are alternative accreditors (DNV, HFAP) acceptable substitutes?

**Impact on Representations & Warranties / Closing Conditions (Target: Memorandum synthesis):**
- **R&W:** Seller must represent all 4 hospitals are Joint Commission-accredited with deemed status as of Closing Date, with full disclosure of October 2024 Regional survey and corrective actions.
- **Closing Condition:** March 2025 follow-up survey completed with outcome of (a) full accreditation restored OR (b) accreditation with follow-up deemed acceptable to Buyer (excluding preliminary denial).
- **MAC Clause:** Explicitly define JC accreditation loss as per se Material Adverse Change.
- **Indemnification:** Healthcare regulatory representations should have 20-30% indemnification cap (higher than typical 10% general reps) with 18-24 month survival period.

### Risk Mitigation Recommendations

**1. Transaction Timing:** Structure closing to occur **AFTER** March 2025 follow-up survey results known (target closing April-May 2025). This eliminates accreditation uncertainty and allows Buyer to proceed with confidence or renegotiate/terminate if preliminary denial occurs.

**2. Robust Closing Conditions:** Require Mercy Regional to achieve (a) ≥90% hand hygiene compliance verified by independent audit pre-closing, (b) successful fire alarm activation test with all magnetic hold-opens releasing doors, (c) Joint Commission follow-up survey resulting in full accreditation or accreditation with follow-up acceptable to Buyer.

**3. Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanisms:** Implement tiered adjustment formula:
- Preliminary Denial: $400M-$500M reduction (reflects increased CMS survey risk and commercial payer contract uncertainty)
- Denial of Accreditation: $800M-$1B reduction OR exclude Regional from transaction entirely (proceed with 3-hospital acquisition: Northwest + East + South = 760 beds, 60% of system capacity)

**4. Escrow Holdback:** $50M-$100M (2-4% of purchase price) held for 12 months post-closing, released upon verification that (a) deemed status maintained at all 4 hospitals, (b) no CMS validation surveys citing condition-level deficiencies, (c) no commercial payer contracts terminated due to JC accreditation concerns, (d) hand hygiene compliance sustained ≥90% for 6 consecutive months.

**5. Post-Acquisition Compliance Program:** Invest $500K-$750K annually in ongoing Joint Commission compliance monitoring (quarterly mock surveys, electronic hand hygiene monitoring, automated medication dispensing system maintenance, credentialing software, fire door testing). ROI: 73:1 to 110:1 (every $1 invested mitigates $73-$110 of expected deemed status loss risk).

**6. Contingency Planning:** If Regional receives preliminary denial March 2025, immediately engage alternative accreditors (DNV Healthcare, HFAP) for expedited initial survey (3-6 months) to preserve deemed status with minimal disruption. While alternative accreditors perceived as less prestigious than Joint Commission, they provide CMS-approved deemed status and can prevent Medicare provider agreement termination during interim period.

### Conclusions

Mercy Regional Health System's Joint Commission accreditation status presents a **manageable regulatory risk** for National Healthcare Partners' $2.4 billion acquisition, with expected financial exposure of $39 million (1.6% of purchase price). The October 2024 survey deficiencies were **not immediate jeopardy level** and have been addressed with **comprehensive, sustainable corrective actions** including engineering controls and automated systems. The March 2025 follow-up survey will likely result in **full accreditation restoration (75-85% probability)**, eliminating deemed status risk for the next three years.

However, the **catastrophic downside scenario** (loss of Medicare provider agreement due to CMS condition-level citations) carries $1.26 billion annual revenue risk (70% of system total), warranting **robust transaction protections**: (1) closing after March 2025 survey results known, (2) strong representations & warranties with enhanced indemnification caps, (3) explicit Material Adverse Change clause for accreditation loss, (4) tiered purchase price adjustment mechanisms, (5) escrow holdback released upon verification of sustained compliance.

The system-wide accreditation health is **strong** - 3 of 4 hospitals have full accreditation with no concerns. Mercy South Hospital's 2021-2022 precedent (similar deficiencies successfully corrected) provides confidence that Regional will achieve full accreditation by March 2025. National Healthcare Partners should proceed with acquisition contingent on satisfactory March 2025 follow-up survey outcome, with fallback options to (a) exclude Regional from transaction, (b) reduce purchase price commensurate with increased regulatory risk, or (c) terminate transaction if deemed status loss deemed unacceptable.

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Deemed Status Under 42 CFR § 488.5 - Critical Regulatory Framework

#### 1. Legal Definition and Authority

**"Deemed status"** is the Medicare regulatory mechanism by which CMS recognizes accreditation by approved national accrediting organizations as satisfying Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoPs), eliminating the need for direct CMS surveys.¹

**Statutory Authority:**
- Section 1865(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395bb(a)(1)²
- 42 CFR § 488.5 (Approved accreditation programs)³
- 42 CFR Part 489 (Provider agreements)⁴

**Regulatory Standard:**
"If a provider entity demonstrates through accreditation by a CMS-approved national accrediting organization that all applicable Medicare requirements are met or exceeded, CMS will deem those provider entities as having met such requirements."⁵

#### 2. Joint Commission as CMS-Approved Accreditor

**Current Approval Status [VERIFIED]:**
- **Federal Register Notice:** 87 Fed. Reg. 26261 (May 2, 2022) - CMS approved continued deemed status authority for The Joint Commission (TJC) Hospital Accreditation Program⁶
- **Reapproval Cycle:** 6-year renewal cycle per 42 CFR § 488.5(e)(2)(i)⁷
- **Most Recent Application:** TJC application determined complete December 17, 2024 for continued approval⁸
- **Next Renewal:** TJC must reapply by May 2, 2028 (6 years from 2022 approval)

**CMS Evaluation Criteria:**
CMS's evaluation of TJC's deemed status authority includes:⁹
1. Comparing TJC standards with Medicare Conditions of Participation (42 CFR Part 482)
2. Reviewing TJC survey processes for comparability with state agency surveys
3. Ensuring TJC standards meet or exceed CoPs requirements
4. Validating TJC survey findings through CMS validation surveys (10% sample)

#### 3. What Deemed Status Protects Against

**For Hospitals WITH Joint Commission Accreditation + Deemed Status:**
- **No routine CMS surveys**: CMS does not conduct independent CoPs compliance surveys¹⁰
- **No state health department surveys**: State agencies do not survey for Medicare certification¹¹
- **Accept JC findings**: CMS relies on Joint Commission survey findings for Medicare participation¹²
- **Less frequent oversight**: Triennial Joint Commission surveys (every 3 years) vs. potential annual CMS scrutiny¹³

**For Hospitals WITHOUT Deemed Status (Lost JC Accreditation):**
- **Direct CMS surveys required**: CMS must conduct comprehensive validation surveys for initial certification and recertification¹⁴
- **More stringent enforcement**: CMS applies 42 CFR Part 482 CoPs with zero tolerance for condition-level deficiencies¹⁵
- **Immediate Jeopardy standard**: CMS uses Immediate Jeopardy findings (life/safety threat) more frequently than Joint Commission¹⁶
- **Termination threat**: CMS can terminate Medicare provider agreement under 42 CFR § 489.53 if condition-level deficiencies not corrected within specified timeframes¹⁷
- **Loss of Medicare payments**: If provider agreement terminated, hospital cannot bill Medicare/Medicaid (typically 48% of revenue for Mercy Regional: $864M annually)¹⁸

#### 4. Comparison: Joint Commission Standards vs. Medicare CoPs

| Domain | Joint Commission Standard | Medicare CoP | Alignment |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Medication Management** | MM.05.01.09 (labeling, storage, expired medications) | 42 CFR § 482.25 (Pharmaceutical services) | JC ≥ CMS (more detailed) |
| **Infection Prevention** | IC.01.04.01 (hand hygiene compliance, surveillance) | 42 CFR § 482.42 (Infection prevention and control) | JC ≥ CMS (more prescriptive) |
| **Life Safety** | EC.02.01.01 (NFPA 101 Life Safety Code compliance, fire doors) | 42 CFR § 482.41 (Physical environment, Life Safety Code) | JC = CMS (both require NFPA 101) |
| **Medical Staff Credentialing** | MS.06.01.05 (primary source verification, privileging) | 42 CFR § 482.12 (Medical staff, credentialing, privileging) | JC ≥ CMS (more specific timelines) |

**Critical Finding:** Joint Commission standards are generally MORE stringent than Medicare CoPs, meaning JC-accredited hospitals should theoretically exceed minimum Medicare requirements.¹⁹ However, if JC accreditation is lost, CMS will apply CoPs standards which may cite deficiencies JC identified but not yet corrected.²⁰

### B. Joint Commission Accreditation Decision Categories

#### 1. Accreditation Decision Framework [VERIFIED via Joint Commission Standards]

The Joint Commission uses six accreditation decision categories based on the severity and number of standards deficiencies identified during surveys:²⁵

| Decision Category | Definition | Follow-Up Required | Deemed Status |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **1. Accreditation** | Full compliance with all standards OR successful correction of all Requirements for Improvement (RFIs) within 60 days | None (next triennial survey in 3 years) | ✅ Maintained |
| **2. Accreditation with Follow-up Survey** | Compliance achieved via Evidence of Standards Compliance (ESC) submission, but sustained compliance must be verified | Follow-up survey within 6 months | ✅ Maintained |
| **3. Limited Temporary Accreditation** | Satisfactory compliance with limited set of standards assessed in first of two Early Survey Policy surveys | Second survey within timeframe | ✅ Maintained (conditional) |
| **4. Preliminary Accreditation** | For organizations seeking initial accreditation | Full survey after 90 days-1 year | ⏳ Pending |
| **5. Preliminary Denial of Accreditation** | One or more of: (a) immediate threat to health/safety, (b) falsified documents, (c) lack of required license, (d) failure to resolve prior follow-up deficiencies, (e) significant noncompliance | 60 days to demonstrate substantial compliance or appeal | ⚠️ At Risk of Loss |
| **6. Denial of Accreditation** | Final denial after all review/appeal opportunities exhausted | None (accreditation terminated) | ❌ Lost |

#### 2. "Accreditation with Requirements for Improvement" - NOT a Formal Category

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION:**
The phrase "Accreditation with Requirements for Improvement" used in the user's prompt is **NOT** an official Joint Commission decision category.²⁶ Based on the deficiency profile (8 deficiencies, none life-threatening, corrective actions implemented), Mercy Regional's October 2024 accreditation decision most likely falls under:

**"Accreditation" (Category 1) - WITH pending Requirements for Improvement (RFIs)**²⁷

**What This Means:**
- Mercy Regional received **full accreditation** (not preliminary denial)²⁸
- The hospital must submit **Evidence of Standards Compliance (ESC)** within 60 days addressing all 8 RFIs²⁹
- If ESC is accepted, accreditation continues uninterrupted (deemed status maintained)³⁰
- If ESC is inadequate OR Joint Commission questions sustainability, the decision may convert to **"Accreditation with Follow-up Survey"** (Category 2), requiring an on-site follow-up within 6 months³¹

**March 2025 Follow-Up Survey Context:**
- If scheduled for March 2025 (5 months after October 2024), this suggests the accreditation decision was likely **"Accreditation with Follow-up Survey"** to verify sustained compliance with corrective actions³²
- This is still full accreditation with deemed status maintained, but requires on-site validation³³

#### 3. Requirements for Improvement (RFIs) - Process and Consequences

**Definition:**
"Areas of noncompliance with the standards are aggregated on the Survey Analysis for Evaluating Risk® (SAFER®) Matrix as Requirements for Improvement (RFIs)."³⁴

**SAFER Matrix Risk Assessment:**
Each RFI is plotted on a matrix according to:³⁵
- **Likelihood of harm** to patients, staff, and/or visitors (Low, Medium, High)
- **Scope of observation** (Limited, Pattern, Widespread)

**Higher-risk RFIs** (High likelihood + Widespread scope) trigger more scrutiny and may result in Preliminary Denial if not corrected.³⁶

**ESC Submission Requirements:**
- **Deadline:** 60 days after posting of Accreditation Survey Findings Report³⁷
- **Content:** Must identify specific corrective actions demonstrating compliance with each cited standard³⁸
- **Sustainability evidence:** Must show systems in place to prevent recurrence (policies, training, monitoring)³⁹

**If ESC Rejected or Incomplete:**
- Joint Commission may request additional information or clarification⁴⁰
- If still inadequate, accreditation decision may downgrade to **Preliminary Denial**⁴¹
- Hospital has 60 days from Preliminary Denial to demonstrate substantial compliance or file appeal⁴²
- If unsuccessful, accreditation is **Denied** → deemed status lost⁴³

---

### C. October 2024 Survey Deficiencies - Detailed Analysis

#### Deficiency #1: Medication Management (MM.05.01.09) - Expired Medications

**Joint Commission Standard:**
MM.05.01.09: "The hospital safely manages high-alert and hazardous medications. The hospital safely manages medications, including expired medications."⁴⁴

**Finding:**
- **Location:** Operating room pharmacy (Mercy Regional Medical Center)
- **Observation:** 12 expired medications discovered during surveyor inspection⁴⁵
- **Expiration status:** Expired 2-6 months prior (suggests inadequate monthly inspections)⁴⁶
- **Risk:** Expired medications could be inadvertently administered during surgery, potentially reducing efficacy or causing adverse effects⁴⁷

**Regulatory Requirement:**
- Hospitals must inspect medication storage areas **monthly** to identify and remove expired medications⁴⁸
- Expired medications must be segregated and disposed of according to state/federal regulations⁴⁹
- Automated alerts or manual checklists must prevent expired medication administration⁵⁰

**Patient Safety Risk:**
If expired medications are administered:⁵¹
- Reduced potency (especially critical for antibiotics, anesthetics, vasopressors in OR)
- Chemical degradation may produce toxic byproducts (e.g., tetracycline → nephrotoxic)
- Failure to treat condition adequately (e.g., expired epinephrine in anaphylaxis)
- Malpractice liability if patient harmed

**Corrective Action Implemented (October-December 2024):**
1. **Automated Dispensing Cabinets (ADCs):** Deployed Pyxis machines in all OR pharmacy areas⁵²
   - Automatic alerts when medications approach/reach expiration
   - System locks out expired medications from selection menu
   - Replaced manual pharmacy cart checks (which failed)
2. **Monthly Pharmacy Inspections:** Pharmacist-led inspections of all storage areas, removing expired medications, documenting in compliance log⁵³
3. **Staff Training:** All OR nurses and pharmacists trained on expiration date checking protocols (October 2024)⁵⁴

**Sustainability Assessment:**
- ✅ Automated system (Pyxis) provides ongoing controls less dependent on human vigilance
- ✅ Monthly inspections documented (verifiable audit trail)
- ⚠️ Risk: ADC malfunction or alert fatigue could allow expired medications to remain accessible
- **Recommendation:** March 2025 follow-up survey should verify ADC alerts functional and no expired medications present

#### Deficiency #2: Infection Prevention (IC.01.04.01) - Hand Hygiene Compliance

**Joint Commission Standard:**
IC.01.04.01: "The hospital follows evidence-based national guidelines to prevent infections. The organization implements a hand hygiene program that follows current CDC and/or WHO hand hygiene guidelines, sets goals for improving compliance with hand hygiene guidelines, and improves compliance based on established goals."⁵⁵

**Finding:**
- **Observation:** Hand hygiene compliance rate 78% (surveyor observed 100 hand hygiene opportunities, staff performed hand hygiene correctly 78 times)⁵⁶
- **Benchmark:** Joint Commission does not mandate specific numerical target, but 90%+ compliance is industry standard⁵⁷
- **Gap:** 78% falls significantly below best practice; 22 missed opportunities per 100 increase infection transmission risk⁵⁸

**Regulatory Context:**
- CDC recommends ≥95% compliance for optimal infection prevention⁵⁹
- Joint Commission requires organizations to set improvement goals but does not prescribe specific percentage⁶⁰
- CMS Conditions of Participation 42 CFR § 482.42 require infection prevention program but do not specify hand hygiene compliance targets⁶¹

**Patient Safety Risk:**
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) directly linked to hand hygiene compliance:⁶²
- MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) - skin/wound infections
- *Clostridioides difficile* (C. diff) - severe diarrhea, colitis
- Surgical site infections (SSIs) - post-operative wound infections
- Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs)

**CMS Financial Penalties:**
- Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program: Hospitals in worst-performing quartile for HAIs receive 1% Medicare payment reduction⁶³
- Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program: Infections leading to readmissions reduce Medicare payments⁶⁴
- Mercy Regional already penalized -0.8% ($6.9M annually) for excess readmissions; additional HAC penalty would compound⁶⁵

**Corrective Action Implemented (October-December 2024):**
1. **Hand Hygiene Coaches:** Designated RNs observe staff in real-time, provide immediate feedback and education⁶⁶
   - Result: Compliance increased from 78% → 88% by December 2024⁶⁷
   - Target: 90% by March 2025 (in time for follow-up survey)⁶⁸
2. **Electronic Monitoring System:** Sensors on hand sanitizer/soap dispensers track usage by unit/shift, generate automated compliance reports⁶⁹
3. **Leadership Rounding:** CNO (Chief Nursing Officer) and CMO (Chief Medical Officer) conduct weekly rounds emphasizing hand hygiene, demonstrating visible commitment⁷⁰

**Sustainability Assessment:**
- ✅ Electronic monitoring provides objective data (reduces observer bias)
- ✅ Leadership engagement signals organizational priority
- ⚠️ Risk: 88% compliance still below 90% target; if not achieved by March 2025, follow-up survey may require additional corrective action
- ⚠️ Sustainability concern: Hand hygiene coaches are resource-intensive; compliance may decline if coaches reassigned after survey

#### Deficiency #3: Environment of Care (EC.02.01.01) - Fire Door Propped Open

**Joint Commission Standard:**
EC.02.01.01: "The hospital manages fire risks. The hospital complies with the applicable provisions of the Life Safety Code® (NFPA 101)."⁷¹

**Finding:**
- **Location:** 3rd floor stairwell fire door⁷²
- **Observation:** Fire door propped open with trash can (manual obstruction preventing self-closure)⁷³
- **Violation:** NFPA 101 Life Safety Code § 7.2.1.8.2 - "Fire doors shall be self-closing or automatic-closing and shall not be blocked open."⁷⁴

**Regulatory Context:**
- **Life Safety Code (NFPA 101):** National Fire Protection Association standard adopted by reference in 42 CFR § 482.41(b)⁷⁵
- **CMS CoPs:** Hospitals must comply with Life Safety Code applicable to occupancy type (hospitals = healthcare occupancy, NFPA 101 Chapter 18/19)⁷⁶
- **State enforcement:** Ohio Fire Marshal can cite Life Safety Code violations independently of Joint Commission⁷⁷

**Fire Safety Purpose of Self-Closing Fire Doors:**
- **Smoke compartmentalization:** Prevents smoke/fire from spreading between compartments (stairwells = critical evacuation routes)⁷⁸
- **Passive fire protection:** Doors rated for 20-90 minutes fire resistance when closed⁷⁹
- **Life Safety:** Propped doors allow smoke to fill stairwells, trapping patients/staff during evacuation⁸⁰

**Potential Consequences if Fire Occurred:**
- Smoke inhalation injuries (stairwell unusable for evacuation)
- Failure to contain fire to origin compartment (spreads to occupied patient care areas)
- State Fire Marshal citation (separate from Joint Commission, could result in fines or operations restrictions)
- Liability: If patients/staff injured due to propped door, hospital faces wrongful death/injury claims

**Corrective Action Implemented (October-December 2024):**
1. **Immediate Removal:** Facilities management inspected all fire doors hospital-wide, removed all obstructions⁸¹
2. **Magnetic Hold-Opens:** Installed magnetic door holders connected to fire alarm system⁸²
   - Doors held open for convenience (staff workflow)
   - Automatically release when fire alarm activated (doors close immediately)
   - Compliant with NFPA 101 § 7.2.1.8.2 Exception 2 (automatic-closing devices)⁸³
3. **Staff Education:** All staff trained on fire door importance, prohibition on manual propping (October 2024)⁸⁴
4. **Monthly Inspections:** Facilities management inspects all fire doors, verifies self-closing mechanisms functional, documents⁸⁵

**Sustainability Assessment:**
- ✅ Magnetic hold-opens provide permanent engineering control (eliminates incentive to prop doors)
- ✅ Monthly inspections provide ongoing monitoring
- ⚠️ Risk: Magnetic hold-open malfunction could result in door remaining open during fire alarm activation (requires regular testing)

#### Deficiency #4: Medical Staff (MS.06.01.05) - Credentialing File Incomplete

**Joint Commission Standard:**
MS.06.01.05: "The organized medical staff participates in performance improvement activities. The hospital verifies staff qualifications, including licensure, education, training, and competence."⁸⁶

**Finding:**
- **Physician:** Dr. James Wilson (staff physician)⁸⁷
- **Deficiency:** Credentialing file missing primary source verification of medical school graduation⁸⁸
- **Timing:** File dated 2021 (reappointment cycle), verification should have been conducted within 2 years⁸⁹
- **Regulatory requirement:** 42 CFR § 482.12(a)(7) - "The medical staff conducts ongoing professional practice evaluation (OPPE) and focused professional practice evaluation (FPPE), and verifies credentials of all medical staff members."⁹⁰

**Primary Source Verification Requirements:**
Joint Commission and CMS require **primary source verification** for:⁹¹
- Medical school graduation (contact medical school registrar or use FSMB Federation Credentials Verification Service)
- Residency/fellowship completion (contact program director or ACGME)
- Board certification (contact ABMS American Board of Medical Specialties or AOA)
- State medical license (contact State Medical Board or use FSMB)
- DEA registration (contact DEA or verify at https://apps.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/)
- Malpractice claims history (query National Practitioner Data Bank NPDB)

**Why Primary Source Verification Matters:**
- **Fraud prevention:** Verifies physician did not falsify credentials on application
- **Patient safety:** Ensures physician has required training/competence for privileges granted
- **Regulatory compliance:** CMS CoPs § 482.12 mandates verification; failure can result in condition-level deficiency
- **Liability:** If unqualified physician harms patient, hospital faces negligent credentialing claim

**Corrective Action Implemented (October-November 2024):**
1. **Dr. Wilson File Completed:** Obtained copy of medical school diploma, verified with FSMB Federation of State Medical Boards, updated credentialing file⁹²
2. **System-Wide Audit:** Medical staff office reviewed **all 1,850 physicians** (650 employed + 1,200 privileged), ensured primary source verification current within 2 years⁹³
   - Completed November 2024 (massive undertaking for 1,850 files)
3. **Credentialing Software:** Implemented VerityStream credentialing software with automated reminders⁹⁴
   - Alerts when reappointment due (every 2 years)
   - Alerts when primary source verification expiration approaching
   - Reduces risk of human error (manual spreadsheet tracking replaced)

**Sustainability Assessment:**
- ✅ VerityStream software provides automated controls (prevents future lapses)
- ✅ System-wide audit demonstrates corrective action was comprehensive (not just Dr. Wilson)
- ✅ All 1,850 files reviewed = strong evidence for March 2025 follow-up survey
- ⚠️ Risk: Software relies on accurate data entry; if medical staff office fails to input expiration dates correctly, alerts will not trigger

#### Deficiencies #5-8: Other Minor Deficiencies (Lower Risk)

**Deficiency #5: Pain Assessment Documentation**
- **Finding:** Nursing staff not consistently documenting pain reassessment after pain medication administration⁹⁵
- **Standard:** PC.01.02.07 - "The hospital assesses and manages the patient's pain."⁹⁶
- **Corrective Action:** EHR (Epic) updated with hard-stop alert requiring pain reassessment documentation within 60 minutes of PRN pain medication administration⁹⁷

**Deficiency #6: Patient Education Materials**
- **Finding:** Some patient education materials not available in Spanish for limited English proficiency (LEP) patients⁹⁸
- **Standard:** PC.02.01.21 - "The hospital provides patient education and training based on each patient's needs and abilities."⁹⁹
- **Corrective Action:** All patient education materials translated into Spanish and posted on patient portal; medical interpreter services expanded¹⁰⁰

**Deficiency #7: Emergency Management Drill Participation**
- **Finding:** Emergency Department staff participation in emergency management drills 85% (target 95%)¹⁰¹
- **Standard:** EM.03.01.03 - "The hospital evaluates the effectiveness of its emergency management program."¹⁰²
- **Corrective Action:** Mandatory drill participation policy implemented; managers track participation; ED staff participation increased to 92% by December 2024¹⁰³

**Deficiency #8: Quality Improvement Data Review**
- **Finding:** Some quality metrics not reviewed by Board of Directors quarterly as required¹⁰⁴
- **Standard:** LD.04.04.05 - "The governing body receives and acts on reports of quality and safety activities."¹⁰⁵
- **Corrective Action:** Board Quality Committee meeting schedule revised to ensure quarterly quality metric review; dashboard created for Board access¹⁰⁶

### D. Deemed Status Loss - Consequences and Risk Assessment

#### 1. CMS Validation Survey Process [VERIFIED]

**What Are Validation Surveys?**
CMS conducts validation surveys of Joint Commission-accredited hospitals to verify that TJC's accreditation process accurately assesses compliance with Medicare Conditions of Participation.¹⁰⁷

**Authority:** CMS State Operations Manual (SOM) Chapter 1 & Chapter 2¹⁰⁸

**Two Types of Validation Surveys:**¹⁰⁹
1. **Representative Sample Surveys:** CMS selects random sample of JC-accredited hospitals (approximately 5-10% annually) for validation; may be comprehensive (all CoPs) or focused (specific conditions)
2. **Substantial Allegations of Noncompliance (Complaint Surveys):** State survey agency investigates specific complaints even if hospital is JC-accredited; surveys only conditions related to allegations

**New 2024 Pilot Process:**¹¹⁰
- CMS now contracts with two national organizations to conduct validation surveys
- Surveyors directly observe Joint Commission surveyors during on-site surveys (real-time validation)
- Designed to prevent need for separate follow-up survey of healthcare organization
- Focus shifts to evaluating Joint Commission's survey process rather than hospital compliance directly
- CMS expects fewer "look back" validation surveys under new model

**Critical 2024 CMS Proposal - Enhanced Consequences:**¹¹¹
In February 2024, CMS proposed rule "Strengthening Oversight of Accrediting Organizations (AOs)" (89 Fed. Reg. 10618, Feb. 15, 2024) includes:¹¹²
- **Deemed status loss trigger:** Hospitals receiving one or more **condition-level citation** on validation survey could **lose deemed status**¹¹³
- **Ongoing state survey oversight:** Provider subject to "ongoing review by the state survey agency…until [it] demonstrates compliance"¹¹⁴
- **No appeals during review period:** Hospital remains under state agency jurisdiction pending compliance demonstration¹¹⁵

**American Hospital Association Opposition:**¹¹⁶
AHA submitted comments April 12, 2024 calling the proposal "overly punitive":¹¹⁷
- Treats hospitals as "guilty until proven innocent"
- Short-term loss of deemed status could be "devastating" - many states and commercial payers require deemed status for participation in contracts¹¹⁸
- Adjudication process can take months, raising concerns about hospitals' ability to sustain access to care for communities¹¹⁹

**Status of Proposal:** As of January 2026, CMS has not finalized this rule; deemed status loss consequences remain governed by existing 42 CFR § 488.5 standards.¹²⁰

#### 2. Medicare Provider Agreement Termination - 42 CFR § 489.53

**Termination Authority:**
If a hospital loses Joint Commission accreditation (and thus deemed status), CMS may terminate the hospital's Medicare provider agreement under 42 CFR § 489.53 if the hospital fails to meet Conditions of Participation during subsequent CMS surveys.¹²¹

**Termination Scenarios:**¹²²

| Scenario | Timeframe | Process |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Immediate Jeopardy** (life/safety threat) | 23 days | CMS issues preliminary notice of termination; final notice 2-4 days before effective date; provider may correct deficiencies within 23 days or appeal |
| **Condition-Level Deficiency** (no immediate jeopardy) | 90 days | CMS requires plan of correction; resurvey within 90 days; if not corrected, termination notice issued |
| **Multiple Standard-Level Deficiencies** | Variable | CMS may impose civil monetary penalties ($100-$10,000 per day per deficiency) but typically does not terminate unless deficiencies rise to condition-level |

**2024 Example - Stanislaus Surgical Hospital (California):**¹²³
- **Termination Date:** September 30, 2024
- **Reason:** Noncompliance with three Medicare CoPs: pharmaceutical services, infection prevention control, and [third not specified]
- **Consequence:** Hospital could no longer bill Medicare/Medicaid; forced closure of Medicare/Medicaid services
- **Public Notice:** CMS concurrently published public notice of termination per 42 CFR § 489.53(a)(3)

**Appeal Rights:** 42 CFR Part 498 - Provider may request hearing before Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) within 60 days of termination notice.¹²⁴ However, termination remains effective during appeal unless ALJ grants stay (rare).¹²⁵

#### 3. Financial Impact of Deemed Status Loss - Mercy Regional Health System

**Revenue at Risk:**

| Hospital | Total Net Patient Revenue (FY2024) | Medicare Portion (48%) | Immediate Revenue Impact if Provider Agreement Terminated |
|----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Mercy Regional Medical Center | $1.8B (system-wide) | $864M | $864M annually ($72M monthly) |
| Per facility breakdown (estimated): | | | |
| Regional (525 beds, 41% of system) | $738M | $354M | $354M annually |
| Northwest (285 beds, 22%) | $396M | $190M | $190M annually |
| East (185 beds, 14%) | $252M | $121M | $121M annually |
| South (290 beds, 23%) | $414M | $199M | $199M annually |

**Operational Consequences if Mercy Regional Loses Deemed Status:**¹²⁶
1. **Direct CMS surveys required:** Ohio Department of Health (acting as CMS state survey agency) conducts comprehensive CoPs validation survey within 30-60 days
2. **Stricter enforcement:** CMS surveyors apply zero-tolerance standard for condition-level deficiencies (Joint Commission more lenient with corrective action plans)
3. **Higher citation risk:** Deficiencies Joint Commission identified in October 2024 (medication management, infection prevention, life safety, credentialing) likely cited as CoPs violations by CMS
4. **Potential immediate jeopardy findings:** If CMS determines any deficiency poses life/safety threat (e.g., expired medications in OR), may issue immediate jeopardy citation → 23-day termination timeline
5. **Commercial payer contract implications:** Many commercial insurance contracts require Joint Commission accreditation as condition of network participation¹²⁷
   - Loss of JC accreditation could trigger **change of control** or **material adverse change** provisions in payer contracts
   - Commercial insurance revenue: $432M annually (24% of net patient revenue) also at risk¹²⁸

#### 4. NFPA 101 Life Safety Code - Fire Door Compliance [VERIFIED]

**Regulatory Authority:**
- **NFPA 101 (2012 edition):** National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code¹²⁹
- **CMS adoption:** 42 CFR § 482.41(b) requires hospitals to comply with NFPA 101 (CMS continues to require 2012 edition as of 2024)¹³⁰
- **Joint Commission standard:** EC.02.01.01 incorporates NFPA 101 by reference¹³¹

**Fire Door Requirements - NFPA 101 § 7.2.1.8:**¹³²
- Fire doors must be **self-closing** or **automatic-closing**
- Fire doors **shall not be blocked open** (manual propping prohibited)
- Exception: Automatic-closing doors with hold-open devices permitted if:¹³³
  - Hold-open device releases upon smoke detector activation (NFPA 72 compliant)
  - Door becomes self-closing upon release
  - Manual release available for immediate closing

**Magnetic Hold-Open Devices - Compliance Requirements:**¹³⁴

| Requirement | NFPA Standard | Mercy Regional Implementation (Post-October 2024) |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Activation trigger** | NFPA 72 smoke detector activation | ✅ Magnetic holders release when fire alarm activates |
| **Smoke detector placement** | Within 5 feet of door header (localized detection) OR 30-foot spacing (complete area detection) | [Requires verification during March 2025 survey] |
| **Both sides of door?** | Depends on header depth (NFPA 72 § 17.7.5.6) | [Requires verification] |
| **Annual inspection** | NFPA 80 § 5.2 (annual fire door inspection required) | ✅ Monthly facilities management inspections documented |
| **Testing** | Hold-open release must be tested annually | [Requires verification during March 2025 survey] |

**2024 NFPA 101 Edition Updates (Not Yet Adopted by CMS):**¹³⁵
- Smoke compartment sizes increased from 22,500 sq ft → 40,000 sq ft (under certain conditions)
- Patient sleeping suite sizes increased
- Enhanced flexibility for door locking arrangements (patient safety vs. elopement prevention)
- **Note:** CMS has not yet adopted 2024 edition; hospitals must continue to comply with 2012 edition for Medicare compliance¹³⁶

**State Fire Marshal Enforcement:**
Ohio Fire Marshal can independently cite NFPA 101 violations under Ohio Fire Code (Ohio Administrative Code Chapter 1301:7-7) even if Joint Commission does not cite deficiency.¹³⁷ Propped fire doors could result in:
- Immediate closure order if fire marshal determines imminent hazard
- Civil penalties $500-$10,000 per violation per day (Ohio Revised Code § 3737.99)
- Corrective action order with reinspection required

#### 5. Medical Staff Credentialing - Comparison of Joint Commission vs. CMS CoPs

**Joint Commission Standard MS.06.01.05:**¹³⁸
- Primary source verification required for: medical school, residency, board certification, state license, DEA registration
- Reappointment every **2 years**
- NPDB (National Practitioner Data Bank) query required at initial appointment and reappointment

**CMS Conditions of Participation 42 CFR § 482.12:**¹³⁹
- Medical staff bylaws must specify qualifications for medical staff membership and clinical privileges
- Primary source verification not explicitly required in regulation (but implied in CMS State Operations Manual interpretive guidance)¹⁴⁰
- No specific reappointment timeframe mandated (hospital bylaws determine frequency)

**Why Joint Commission Standard is Stricter:**
- JC explicitly requires 2-year reappointment cycle; CMS does not specify
- JC requires primary source verification for ALL credentialing elements; CMS regulation text is silent (though SOM interpretive guidance recommends)
- JC NPDB query required at reappointment; CMS only requires at initial credentialing (42 CFR § 482.12(a)(9))

**Implications for Mercy Regional:**
- October 2024 deficiency (Dr. Wilson missing primary source verification) would likely be cited by CMS as CoPs violation if CMS conducted survey¹⁴¹
- Corrective action (VerityStream software + system-wide audit of 1,850 physicians) demonstrates substantial compliance¹⁴²
- If CMS survey occurs before March 2025 follow-up, must demonstrate all 1,850 files have current primary source verification (completed November 2024)¹⁴³

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Deemed Status Risk Assessment

#### 1. Probability of Losing Deemed Status - Three Pathways

**Pathway 1: Joint Commission Denies Accreditation**

**Probability:** **LOW (10-15%)**

**Rationale:**
- Mercy Regional's October 2024 deficiencies were **NOT** immediate jeopardy level¹⁴⁴
- All 8 deficiencies addressed with corrective actions October-December 2024¹⁴⁵
- Corrective actions include engineering controls (Pyxis ADCs, magnetic hold-opens, VerityStream software) providing sustainability¹⁴⁶
- Mercy South Hospital had similar deficiency profile in 2021 (medication management, infection prevention) and successfully corrected → full accreditation restored February 2022¹⁴⁷
- Joint Commission rarely denies accreditation outright; preliminary denial rate <5% of all surveys¹⁴⁸

**Risk Factors Increasing Probability:**
- Hand hygiene compliance only 88% as of December 2024 (target 90% by March 2025) - if not achieved, follow-up survey may require additional corrective action¹⁴⁹
- Magnetic hold-opens must be tested and verified functional by March 2025; if fire alarm activation test fails, life safety deficiency persists¹⁵⁰
- If additional deficiencies discovered during March 2025 follow-up (not anticipated but possible), cumulative deficiency count could trigger preliminary denial¹⁵¹

**Pathway 2: CMS Validation Survey Cites Condition-Level Deficiencies**

**Probability:** **LOW-MEDIUM (15-25%)**

**Rationale:**
- CMS validation surveys are random sample (5-10% of JC-accredited hospitals annually)¹⁵²
- Mercy Regional not on CMS "targeted" list (no complaints, no adverse events reported)¹⁵³
- **However:** Proposed 2024 CMS rule would allow deemed status loss after single condition-level citation on validation survey¹⁵⁴
- If CMS validation survey occurs **before** March 2025 JC follow-up, CMS may cite same deficiencies Joint Commission identified (medication management, infection prevention, life safety) as CoPs violations¹⁵⁵
- CMS surveyors less lenient than Joint Commission; may interpret deficiencies as condition-level even if Joint Commission classified as standard-level¹⁵⁶

**Risk Mitigation:**
- CMS validation surveys typically occur after Joint Commission survey (6-12 month lag)¹⁵⁷
- By time CMS validates (summer 2025 earliest), corrective actions will have been sustained for 6+ months → lower citation risk¹⁵⁸

**Pathway 3: Joint Commission Loses CMS Deemed Status Authority**

**Probability:** **VERY LOW (<1%)**

**Rationale:**
- Joint Commission's deemed status authority renewed May 2, 2022 for 6-year term (expires May 2, 2028)¹⁵⁹
- CMS completed evaluation of TJC's December 17, 2024 reapplication; public comment period closes August 22, 2025¹⁶⁰
- No indication CMS intends to revoke TJC's authority (TJC is largest and most established accreditor)¹⁶¹
- If CMS did revoke TJC authority, all ~4,000 JC-accredited hospitals would lose deemed status → CMS lacks capacity to survey all hospitals → extremely unlikely scenario¹⁶²

#### 2. Financial Exposure if Deemed Status Lost

**Scenario A: Loss of Deemed Status Only (JC Accreditation Denied, but Medicare Provider Agreement Continues During CMS Resurvey)**

**Immediate Consequences:**
- CMS conducts validation survey within 60-90 days¹⁶³
- During survey period, Medicare provider agreement remains active (payments continue)¹⁶⁴
- If CMS survey cites no condition-level deficiencies, Medicare participation continues without JC deemed status¹⁶⁵
- Hospital subject to CMS resurveys every 12-36 months (instead of JC triennial surveys every 3 years)¹⁶⁶

**Financial Impact:** **$500K-$1M annually** (incremental cost of CMS survey compliance vs. JC accreditation)
- CMS survey preparation/consultant costs: $250K-$500K per survey cycle
- Ongoing compliance monitoring: $250K-$500K annually
- Staff time diverted to CMS survey prep: Estimated 5,000-10,000 hours per year

**Commercial Payer Contract Risk:**
Many payer contracts require Joint Commission accreditation. Estimated impact:
- **Humana Medicare Advantage contract:** Requires JC accreditation (10% of Mercy system revenue = $180M at risk)¹⁶⁷
- **UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage:** Requires JC accreditation (estimated $90M at risk)¹⁶⁸
- **Total commercial payer risk:** $270M-$400M (15-22% of net patient revenue) could be at risk if payers terminate contracts¹⁶⁹

**Scenario B: Medicare Provider Agreement Terminated (CMS Cites Condition-Level Deficiencies, Hospital Fails to Correct Within 90 Days)**

**Catastrophic Consequences:**
- **Immediate revenue loss:** $864M Medicare revenue annually ($72M monthly)¹⁷⁰
- **Medicaid revenue loss:** $396M Medicaid revenue annually (typically terminated concurrently with Medicare)¹⁷¹
- **Total federal reimbursement loss:** $1.26B annually (70% of net patient revenue)¹⁷²
- **Hospital closure risk:** Cannot operate sustainably on 30% revenue (commercial + self-pay only)¹⁷³

**Likelihood of Scenario B:** **VERY LOW (1-3%)**
- Requires multiple failures: (1) JC accreditation denied, (2) CMS survey cites condition-level deficiencies, (3) hospital fails to correct within 90 days
- Mercy Regional's corrective actions (October-December 2024) make condition-level citation unlikely¹⁷⁴
- Even if cited, 90-day correction window allows time to remediate¹⁷⁵

#### 3. Other Hospitals in Mercy System - Comparative Risk

**Mercy Northwest Hospital (Dublin, 285 beds):**
- **JC Accreditation:** Full accreditation, no deficiencies (2019 initial survey)¹⁷⁶
- **Deemed Status Risk:** **VERY LOW (<5%)**
- **Next Triennial Survey:** 2028
- **Medicare Hospital Compare Rating:** 4-star (above average)¹⁷⁷
- **Assessment:** Newest facility in system, state-of-the-art design, no accreditation concerns

**Mercy East Hospital (Reynoldsburg, 185 beds):**
- **JC Accreditation:** Full accreditation (2022 triennial survey)¹⁷⁸
- **Deficiencies 2022:** Emergency management, patient rights (minor, corrected within 60 days)¹⁷⁹
- **Deemed Status Risk:** **LOW (5-10%)**
- **Next Triennial Survey:** 2031
- **Assessment:** Well-managed facility, minor deficiencies corrected promptly

**Mercy South Hospital (Lancaster, 290 beds):**
- **JC Accreditation:** Full accreditation (restored February 2022)¹⁸⁰
- **2021 Survey:** Accreditation with Follow-up Survey (similar deficiencies to Regional 2024: medication management, infection prevention)¹⁸¹
- **Corrective Action:** January 2022 (all deficiencies corrected, follow-up satisfactory)¹⁸²
- **Deemed Status Risk:** **LOW (5-10%)**
- **Next Triennial Survey:** 2030
- **Assessment:** Demonstrated successful correction of similar deficiency profile; strong precedent for Regional's ability to correct by March 2025¹⁸³

**System-Wide Implications:**
- 3 of 4 hospitals have full accreditation with no pending follow-ups (Northwest, East, South)¹⁸⁴
- Only Regional has March 2025 follow-up pending¹⁸⁵
- Acquisition should proceed contingent on Regional's successful March 2025 follow-up¹⁸⁶
- If Regional loses accreditation, acquisition could proceed with 3-hospital system (exclude Regional) or price adjustment reflecting Regional's reduced value¹⁸⁷

### B. Cross-Domain Impacts Flagged for Other Specialists

#### Impact 1: Medicare Provider Agreements (Target: T9 - securities-researcher)

| Finding | Impact | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|--------|---------------------------|----------|
| Mercy Regional October 2024 JC survey - 8 deficiencies, follow-up March 2025 | If JC accreditation denied, CMS must conduct CoPs validation survey; potential condition-level citations could threaten Regional's CCN 360001 provider agreement | What is the process and timeline for CMS to terminate a Medicare provider agreement if Joint Commission deemed status is lost? What are the appeal rights under 42 CFR Part 498? | **HIGH** |
| Medication management deficiency (expired meds in OR) | CMS CoPs § 482.25 (pharmaceutical services) - if CMS surveys Regional before March 2025 follow-up, may cite as condition-level deficiency | How does CMS distinguish between standard-level and condition-level deficiencies for pharmaceutical services? What is the typical correction timeframe? | **MEDIUM** |
| Infection prevention deficiency (hand hygiene 78% → 88%, target 90%) | CMS CoPs § 482.42 (infection prevention) - 88% compliance may not satisfy CMS standard if validation survey occurs before 90% achieved | Does CMS require specific hand hygiene compliance percentage, or is 88% sufficient if trending toward improvement? What is CMS enforcement pattern for infection prevention deficiencies? | **MEDIUM** |

#### Impact 2: Commercial Contracts (Target: T11 - commercial-contracts-analyst)

| Finding | Impact | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|--------|---------------------------|----------|
| Joint Commission accreditation required for many commercial payer contracts | Humana MA, UnitedHealthcare MA, Anthem, Aetna contracts likely require JC accreditation as condition of network participation; loss of JC accreditation could trigger termination or renegotiation clauses | Do Mercy's payer contracts contain "Joint Commission accreditation" as material representation? If so, what are grace periods for cure? What is termination process? | **HIGH** |
| Estimated $270M-$400M commercial revenue at risk if JC accreditation lost | Commercial payers may terminate contracts if hospital not JC-accredited (perceived quality/safety risk); renegotiation could result in reduced reimbursement rates | What percentage of Mercy's commercial payer contracts explicitly require JC accreditation? Are there alternative accreditors accepted (DNV, HFAP)? | **MEDIUM** |

#### Impact 3: Representations & Warranties / Closing Conditions (Target: All specialists → Memorandum synthesis)

| Finding | Recommended R&W/Closing Condition | Rationale |
|---------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| March 2025 JC follow-up survey pending | **Closing Condition:** Joint Commission follow-up survey completed by [date], with outcome of (a) full accreditation restored OR (b) continued accreditation with requirements for improvement deemed acceptable to Buyer | Cannot close transaction with uncertain JC accreditation status; follow-up outcome must be known and satisfactory |
| Hand hygiene compliance 88% (target 90%) | **R&W:** Seller represents that hand hygiene compliance rate ≥90% as of Closing Date | 90% threshold is industry standard; 88% creates risk of CMS citation if validation survey occurs |
| Magnetic hold-opens installed but not yet tested in fire alarm activation scenario | **Closing Condition:** All magnetic hold-open devices tested and verified compliant with NFPA 72 requirements (smoke detector activation releases doors) | Untested engineering control does not satisfy NFPA 101 § 7.2.1.8 compliance |
| Dr. Wilson credentialing file corrected, but system-wide audit of 1,850 physicians completed November 2024 | **R&W:** Seller represents all medical staff credentialing files current, with primary source verification conducted within 24 months as of Closing Date | System-wide audit demonstrates comprehensive correction, but Buyer should verify no additional gaps emerged between November 2024 audit and Closing |

### C. Sustainability of Corrective Actions - March 2025 Follow-Up Survey Predictions

**What Joint Commission Will Verify in March 2025:**¹⁸⁸

| Deficiency | Corrective Action | JC Verification Method | Predicted Outcome |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **MM.05.01.09** (expired meds) | Pyxis automated dispensing cabinets installed | Inspect OR pharmacy, verify no expired meds present, review Pyxis alert logs | ✅ **PASS** (automated system provides ongoing control) |
| **IC.01.04.01** (hand hygiene 78%) | Hand hygiene coaches, electronic monitoring, leadership rounding (88% December 2024) | Observe 50-100 hand hygiene opportunities, calculate compliance rate | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS** (if ≥90% achieved by March; if 88-89%, may require additional follow-up in 6 months) |
| **EC.02.01.01** (fire door propped) | Magnetic hold-opens installed, monthly inspections | Conduct fire alarm activation test, verify doors release and close, inspect all fire doors | ✅ **PASS** (assuming fire alarm test successful; if doors fail to release, immediate re-citation) |
| **MS.06.01.05** (credentialing) | Dr. Wilson file completed, 1,850 files audited, VerityStream software | Sample 20-30 credentialing files, verify primary source verification current, review VerityStream alerts | ✅ **PASS** (system-wide audit demonstrates comprehensive correction) |
| **Minor deficiencies** (#5-8) | EHR alerts, Spanish translations, drill participation, Board dashboard | Document review, policy verification, Board meeting minutes | ✅ **PASS** (low-risk deficiencies, straightforward corrections) |

**Overall Prediction for March 2025 Follow-Up:**

**Outcome: Full Accreditation Restored**
**Probability: 75-85%**

**Rationale:**
- 7 of 8 deficiencies have strong, sustainable corrective actions (engineering controls, software systems, documented policies)¹⁸⁹
- Only uncertainty: hand hygiene compliance 88% vs. 90% target¹⁹⁰
- If 90% achieved by March 2025, full accreditation highly likely¹⁹¹
- If 88-89%, Joint Commission may grant full accreditation with recommendation for continued monitoring (not requiring additional follow-up survey)¹⁹²
- Mercy South precedent (2021-2022) demonstrates successful correction of similar deficiency profile¹⁹³

**Alternative Outcome: Accreditation with Additional Follow-Up (6 months)**
**Probability: 10-15%**

**Trigger:** Hand hygiene compliance <90% OR magnetic hold-open fire alarm test fails¹⁹⁴
**Consequence:** Full accreditation maintained, but 6-month follow-up required (September 2025)¹⁹⁵
**Deemed Status:** Maintained throughout follow-up period¹⁹⁶

**Worst-Case Outcome: Preliminary Denial of Accreditation**
**Probability: <5%**

**Trigger:** Multiple deficiencies not corrected OR new immediate jeopardy finding during follow-up survey¹⁹⁷
**Consequence:** 60-day window to demonstrate substantial compliance or file appeal¹⁹⁸
**Deemed Status:** At risk of loss if preliminary denial not overturned¹⁹⁹

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Overall Risk Assessment - Mercy Regional Health System Joint Commission Accreditation

**Conclusion:** The risk of Mercy Regional Health System losing deemed status due to Joint Commission accreditation issues is **LOW (10-20% probability)**, but the financial consequences if it occurs are **CATASTROPHIC ($864M-$1.26B annual revenue at risk)**.²⁰⁰

**Key Findings:**

1. **October 2024 Survey Deficiencies Were Not Immediate Jeopardy Level**²⁰¹
   - 8 deficiencies cited: 4 significant (medication management, infection prevention, life safety, credentialing) + 4 minor (pain assessment, patient education, emergency drills, Board quality review)
   - No patient harm occurred; all deficiencies represent systems/process gaps rather than active patient safety threats
   - Joint Commission classified as Requirements for Improvement (RFIs), not Preliminary Denial triggers

2. **Corrective Actions October-December 2024 Are Comprehensive and Sustainable**²⁰²
   - Engineering controls implemented: Pyxis automated dispensing cabinets (medication management), magnetic hold-opens with fire alarm integration (life safety)
   - Software systems: VerityStream credentialing software with automated alerts (medical staff compliance)
   - Electronic monitoring: Hand hygiene sensor tracking system (infection prevention)
   - System-wide audit: All 1,850 physician credentialing files reviewed and updated (November 2024)
   - These are not "paper compliance" fixes; they are infrastructure investments providing ongoing controls less dependent on human vigilance

3. **Mercy South Precedent (2021-2022) Demonstrates Successful Correction of Similar Deficiencies**²⁰³
   - Mercy South had nearly identical deficiency profile in 2021: medication management + infection prevention
   - Corrective action January 2022 → Follow-up survey February 2022 → Full accreditation restored
   - This demonstrates Mercy system's ability to implement effective corrective actions and sustain compliance

4. **March 2025 Follow-Up Survey - Predicted Outcome: Full Accreditation (75-85% probability)**²⁰⁴
   - 7 of 8 deficiencies have strong, sustainable corrective actions in place
   - Only uncertainty: Hand hygiene compliance 88% vs. 90% target (may require additional 6-month follow-up if not achieved, but would NOT result in accreditation denial)
   - If full accreditation restored March 2025, deemed status risk becomes negligible (<5%) for next 3 years until 2027-2028 triennial survey

5. **Three Other Hospitals Have No Accreditation Concerns**²⁰⁵
   - Northwest (Dublin): Full accreditation, 4-star Medicare quality rating, no deficiencies
   - East (Reynoldsburg): Full accreditation, minor deficiencies corrected 2022
   - South (Lancaster): Full accreditation, successfully corrected similar deficiencies 2021-2022
   - System-wide accreditation health is strong; Regional's issues are isolated to one hospital

**Risk Quantification:**

| Scenario | Probability | Financial Impact | Timeframe |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Base Case:** March 2025 follow-up successful, full accreditation restored | 75-85% | $0 (no impact) | March 2025 |
| **Alternative:** March 2025 follow-up requires additional 6-month follow-up (hand hygiene <90%) | 10-15% | $250K-$500K (consultant costs for additional survey prep) | September 2025 |
| **Downside:** JC preliminary denial of accreditation → CMS validation survey → condition-level citations | 5-10% | $500K-$1M survey compliance costs + $270M-$400M commercial payer contract risk | 6-12 months |
| **Catastrophic:** Medicare provider agreement terminated (CMS cites condition-level deficiencies, 90-day correction fails) | 1-3% | $864M Medicare + $396M Medicaid = $1.26B annual revenue loss (70% of total) | 12-18 months |

**Expected Value of Risk:**
- Base case: $0 × 80% = $0
- Alternative: $375K × 12.5% = $47K
- Downside: $400M × 7.5% = $30M
- Catastrophic: $1.26B × 2% = $25M
- **Total expected risk:** $55M (2.3% of $2.4B purchase price)

### B. Representations & Warranties - Draft Language

**Recommendation:** Include the following representations in the Purchase Agreement:

**Section X.X - Joint Commission Accreditation**

(a) **Accreditation Status.** Each Hospital Facility (Mercy Regional Medical Center, Mercy Northwest Hospital, Mercy East Hospital, Mercy South Hospital) is currently accredited by The Joint Commission ("Joint Commission") with deemed status for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs under 42 CFR § 488.5. Copies of the most recent Joint Commission accreditation letters and survey reports for each Hospital Facility for the last five (5) years are included in Schedule X.X(a).²⁰⁶

(b) **Mercy Regional October 2024 Survey.** Mercy Regional Medical Center received an accreditation decision of [**Accreditation** / **Accreditation with Follow-up Survey**] from the Joint Commission following a triennial survey conducted October 14-16, 2024. The Joint Commission identified eight (8) Requirements for Improvement (RFIs), which are fully disclosed in Schedule X.X(b) along with the Seller's Evidence of Standards Compliance submission dated [date].²⁰⁷

(c) **Corrective Actions Implemented.** Seller has implemented corrective actions addressing all eight (8) RFIs identified in the October 2024 survey, including but not limited to: (i) automated dispensing cabinets (Pyxis systems) in all operating room pharmacies, (ii) hand hygiene electronic monitoring system and coaching program achieving 88% compliance as of December 31, 2024, (iii) magnetic hold-open devices on all fire doors integrated with fire alarm systems, and (iv) VerityStream credentialing software with system-wide audit of all 1,850 medical staff credentialing files completed November 30, 2024.²⁰⁸

(d) **Follow-Up Survey Scheduled.** The Joint Commission has scheduled a follow-up survey of Mercy Regional Medical Center for March 2025 to verify sustained compliance with corrective actions. As of the date of this Agreement, Seller has not received any indication from the Joint Commission that the follow-up survey will result in a preliminary denial of accreditation or any other adverse accreditation decision.²⁰⁹

(e) **No Other Accreditation Issues.** Except as disclosed in Schedule X.X(e), no Hospital Facility has received any notice of preliminary denial of accreditation, loss of deemed status, or any CMS validation survey findings citing condition-level deficiencies under 42 CFR Part 482 within the last five (5) years.²¹⁰

(f) **Compliance with Standards.** Each Hospital Facility is in material compliance with all applicable Joint Commission standards, Medicare Conditions of Participation (42 CFR Part 482), and NFPA 101 Life Safety Code requirements as of the date of this Agreement.²¹¹

(g) **Hand Hygiene Compliance Target.** Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve hand hygiene compliance of at least ninety percent (90%) at Mercy Regional Medical Center by the March 2025 Joint Commission follow-up survey date, measured in accordance with Joint Commission standard IC.01.04.01 methodology.²¹²

### C. Closing Conditions - Draft Language

**Recommendation:** Include the following closing conditions:

**Section Y.Y(x) - Joint Commission Follow-Up Survey**

The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is conditioned upon Mercy Regional Medical Center receiving, on or before [**Closing Date** or **specified date 30 days after March 2025 survey**], one of the following accreditation decisions from the Joint Commission as a result of the March 2025 follow-up survey:²¹³

(i) **Full Accreditation** (with no additional follow-up survey required); or

(ii) **Accreditation with Follow-up Survey** (provided that the follow-up survey is scheduled no earlier than six (6) months after Closing and Seller provides Buyer with a written corrective action plan reasonably acceptable to Buyer addressing any remaining Requirements for Improvement); or

(iii) **Accreditation** with continued Requirements for Improvement deemed acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion (provided that such RFIs do not include any deficiencies classified by the Joint Commission as Immediate Jeopardy or any deficiencies that would reasonably be expected to result in a CMS validation survey citing condition-level deficiencies under 42 CFR Part 482).²¹⁴

If Mercy Regional Medical Center receives a **Preliminary Denial of Accreditation** or **Denial of Accreditation** as a result of the March 2025 follow-up survey, Buyer may, in its sole discretion: (a) terminate this Agreement and receive a full refund of any deposits paid, (b) proceed to Closing with a purchase price adjustment as set forth in Section Z.Z(y) below, or (c) exclude Mercy Regional Medical Center from the transaction and proceed with acquisition of the three (3) remaining Hospital Facilities (Mercy Northwest, Mercy East, Mercy South) with a purchase price adjustment of [**$800M-$1B**] (reflecting Mercy Regional's estimated value of 40-45% of total system value).²¹⁵

**Section Y.Y(x+1) - Medicare Provider Agreements**

The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is conditioned upon each Hospital Facility maintaining its Medicare provider agreement and deemed status under 42 CFR § 488.5 as of the Closing Date, with no termination notices, condition-level deficiency citations, or CMS validation survey findings that would reasonably be expected to result in termination of the provider agreement within twelve (12) months after Closing.²¹⁶

**Section Y.Y(x+2) - Fire Door Compliance Verification**

Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with written certification from a qualified fire safety engineer that all magnetic hold-open devices installed on fire doors at Mercy Regional Medical Center have been tested in accordance with NFPA 72 requirements, including successful fire alarm activation testing demonstrating that all fire doors release and close automatically upon smoke detector activation.²¹⁷

### D. Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanisms - Draft Language

**Recommendation:** Include the following purchase price adjustment provisions:

**Section Z.Z(y) - Joint Commission Accreditation Adjustment**

If Mercy Regional Medical Center receives a **Preliminary Denial of Accreditation** or **Denial of Accreditation** from the Joint Commission at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, and Buyer elects to proceed to Closing pursuant to Section Y.Y(x)(b) above, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to:²¹⁸

(i) **Base Adjustment:** [**$400M-$500M**] (reflecting the estimated reduction in value of Mercy Regional Medical Center due to loss of Joint Commission accreditation and increased risk of Medicare provider agreement termination); plus

(ii) **Commercial Payer Contract Risk Adjustment:** An additional amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of Mercy Regional Medical Center's annual commercial insurance revenue (estimated at **$135M-$200M**, calculated as 50% × [Regional's commercial payer revenue of $270M-$400M]), reflecting the increased probability that commercial payers will terminate or renegotiate contracts due to loss of Joint Commission accreditation; plus

(iii) **CMS Survey Compliance Cost Adjustment:** **$2M** (estimated present value of incremental costs to prepare for and respond to CMS validation surveys and ongoing state survey agency oversight over a five-year period, calculated as $500K per year × 4 surveys over 5 years).²¹⁹

**Total Estimated Purchase Price Reduction:** $537M-$702M (22-29% of $2.4B purchase price)

**Section Z.Z(y+1) - Medicare Provider Agreement Termination Adjustment**

If any Hospital Facility receives a notice of termination of its Medicare provider agreement under 42 CFR § 489.53 at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, and Buyer elects to proceed to Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to:²²⁰

(i) For the affected Hospital Facility, an amount equal to [**90%**] of the estimated value of such Hospital Facility (reflecting near-total loss of value due to loss of 70% of revenue from Medicare/Medicaid and inability to operate sustainably); or

(ii) If the termination notice relates to Mercy Regional Medical Center and Buyer elects to exclude Mercy Regional from the transaction, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by [**$800M-$1B**] (40-45% of total system value).²²¹

### E. Recommended Ongoing Compliance Monitoring (Post-Acquisition)

**Recommendation:** National Healthcare Partners should implement the following compliance monitoring program for all four Mercy hospitals post-acquisition:

**1. Quarterly Joint Commission Mock Surveys**²²²
- Engage external Joint Commission consultant (e.g., The Greeley Company, HCPro) to conduct mock surveys quarterly
- Focus on highest-risk standards: medication management (MM), infection prevention (IC), environment of care (EC), medical staff credentialing (MS)
- Cost: $50K-$75K per mock survey × 4 per year = $200K-$300K annually (system-wide)
- ROI: Reduces risk of deficiencies on triennial surveys; early identification of compliance gaps

**2. Hand Hygiene Compliance Dashboard**²²³
- Maintain electronic monitoring system deployed October-December 2024
- Real-time dashboard accessible to CNO, CMO, Board Quality Committee
- Target: ≥90% compliance sustained monthly (never fall below 90% after March 2025)
- Intervention triggers: If any unit falls below 85% compliance for two consecutive months, implement immediate coaching/education

**3. Automated Medication Management System**²²⁴
- Continue Pyxis automated dispensing cabinet deployment system-wide (all 4 hospitals, all pharmacy locations)
- Monthly pharmacy inspections documented (no expired medications present)
- Annual audit: Random sample 100 medications across all storage locations (ORs, patient care units, emergency departments)

**4. Fire Door Inspection and Testing Program**²²⁵
- Monthly facilities management inspections: All fire doors checked for proper closure, magnetic hold-opens functional
- Annual fire alarm activation test: Verify all magnetic hold-opens release upon smoke detector activation (NFPA 72 compliance)
- Documentation: Maintain inspection logs for review during Joint Commission surveys

**5. Credentialing Software Maintenance**²²⁶
- Continue VerityStream credentialing software subscription ($50K-$100K annually system-wide)
- Automated alerts: 90 days before reappointment due, 60 days before primary source verification expiration
- Annual audit: Random sample 50 credentialing files (across all 1,850 physicians) verify primary source verification current

**6. Board Quality Committee Oversight**²²⁷
- Quarterly Board presentations: Joint Commission compliance status, RFIs tracking, corrective action sustainability
- Annual strategic review: Accreditation risk assessment, survey preparation timeline (18 months before next triennial survey)
- Executive compensation tied to quality metrics: Include Joint Commission accreditation status in CEO/CNO/CMO performance evaluations

**7. CMS Validation Survey Preparedness**²²⁸
- Assume 5-10% probability of CMS validation survey annually (random sample + complaint-driven)
- Maintain "survey-ready" posture: All corrective actions sustained, documentation current, policies up-to-date
- Crisis response plan: If CMS validation survey announced, activate 48-hour preparation protocol (document review, staff briefings, policy verification)

**Total Annual Cost of Ongoing Compliance Program:** $500K-$750K (system-wide, all 4 hospitals)²²⁹
- Mock surveys: $200K-$300K
- VerityStream software: $50K-$100K
- External consultant retainer: $100K-$150K
- Fire door testing: $50K-$75K
- Hand hygiene monitoring system maintenance: $50K-$75K
- Staff training/education: $50K-$75K

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- Investment: $500K-$750K annually
- Risk mitigated: $55M expected value of deemed status loss (see Section VI.A above)
- ROI: 73:1 to 110:1 (every $1 invested in compliance program mitigates $73-$110 of expected risk)²³⁰

### F. Material Adverse Change (MAC) Clause Considerations

**Finding:** Loss of Joint Commission accreditation at Mercy Regional Medical Center would likely constitute a **Material Adverse Change** under standard M&A purchase agreement provisions, giving Buyer the right to terminate the transaction or renegotiate purchase price.²³¹

**Legal Standard for MAC:**²³²
- Courts require changes to be **substantial threat to overall earnings potential** measured from a **long-term perspective** (years, not months)
- Changes must be both **severe** (significant financial impact) and **lasting** (not temporary or readily curable)
- MAC clauses appear in 95% of M&A agreements; burden of proof on Buyer to demonstrate true material adverse change occurred

**Analysis - Would JC Accreditation Loss Qualify as MAC?**

| Factor | Application to Mercy Regional JC Accreditation Loss | MAC Standard Met? |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Severity** | Loss of deemed status → CMS direct surveys → potential Medicare provider agreement termination → $864M Medicare revenue (48% of system total) at risk | ✅ YES (threatens nearly half of revenue) |
| **Duration** | If Medicare provider agreement terminated, revenue loss is permanent until/unless provider agreement reinstated (typically 12-24 months minimum) | ✅ YES (lasting impact, not temporary) |
| **Earnings Potential** | $864M Medicare + $396M Medicaid = $1.26B annual revenue at risk (70% of net patient revenue); cannot operate sustainably on 30% revenue | ✅ YES (substantial threat to earnings) |
| **Operational Disruption** | Loss of deemed status → mandatory CMS surveys → diverts management time/resources; commercial payers may terminate contracts → additional revenue loss | ✅ YES (affects critical operational capacity) |
| **Regulatory/License Impact** | Joint Commission accreditation is key regulatory approval; many commercial payer contracts require JC accreditation as condition of network participation | ✅ YES (affects key licenses/market access) |

**Conclusion:** Loss of Joint Commission accreditation at Mercy Regional Medical Center would **LIKELY** qualify as a Material Adverse Change under standard M&A legal standards.²³³

**Recommendation:** Purchase Agreement should explicitly define loss of Joint Commission accreditation (or Medicare provider agreement termination) as a **per se MAC**, eliminating need for Buyer to prove severity/duration:²³⁴

**Illustrative MAC Clause Language:**

"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute a Material Adverse Change for purposes of Section [X]: (i) any Hospital Facility receives a Preliminary Denial of Accreditation or Denial of Accreditation from The Joint Commission, (ii) any Hospital Facility loses deemed status under 42 CFR § 488.5, (iii) any Hospital Facility receives a notice of termination of its Medicare provider agreement under 42 CFR § 489.53, or (iv) CMS conducts a validation survey of any Hospital Facility and cites one or more condition-level deficiencies under 42 CFR Part 482 that are not corrected within ninety (90) days."²³⁵

### G. Key Takeaways for Transaction Structuring

1. **Timing Risk:** March 2025 follow-up survey creates timeline uncertainty
   - **Recommendation:** Structure closing to occur **AFTER** March 2025 survey results known (target closing April-May 2025)
   - **Alternative:** Close earlier with robust purchase price adjustment mechanism and escrow holdback ($50M-$100M held for 12 months pending JC accreditation sustainability)²³⁶

2. **Risk Allocation:** Seller should bear risk of JC accreditation loss pre-closing
   - **Recommendation:** Strong representations & warranties (Section VI.B above) with survival period of 18-24 months post-closing
   - Indemnification cap: 20-30% of purchase price for healthcare regulatory representations (higher than typical 10% for general reps)²³⁷

3. **Contingency Planning:** If Regional loses accreditation, structure alternative deals
   - **Option A:** Exclude Regional, proceed with 3-hospital acquisition (Northwest + East + South = 760 beds, 60% of system capacity)
   - **Option B:** Include Regional at reduced price ($400M-$700M discount) with Buyer accepting risk of CMS surveys and provider agreement termination threat
   - **Option C:** Terminate entire transaction if Regional deemed critical to system strategy²³⁸

4. **Post-Closing Integration:** Prioritize Joint Commission compliance in first 100 days
   - Retain Mercy's Chief Quality Officer and Joint Commission compliance staff (minimize disruption to accreditation-related personnel)
   - Delay major operational changes (staffing reductions, service line closures, IT system conversions) until after March 2025 follow-up survey successfully completed
   - Engage external Joint Commission consultant for integration planning (ensure National Healthcare Partners' management practices compatible with JC standards)²³⁹

### H. Comparison to Other Accreditation Organizations

**Note:** If Mercy Regional were to lose Joint Commission accreditation, the hospital could seek accreditation from alternative CMS-approved accreditors to regain deemed status:²⁴⁰

| Accreditor | CMS Deemed Status Authority | Accreditation Cycle | Market Share | Notes |
|------------|----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| **The Joint Commission** | Approved (expires May 2028) | 3 years (triennial) | ~70% of U.S. hospitals | Most established; highest brand recognition |
| **DNV Healthcare** | Approved | Annual (ISO 9001 integration) | ~15% of U.S. hospitals | More frequent surveys but perceived as less stringent |
| **HFAP** (Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program) | Approved | 3 years (triennial) | ~10% of U.S. hospitals | AOA-affiliated; strong osteopathic hospital presence |
| **Center for Improvement in Healthcare Quality** (CIHQ) | Approved | 3 years (triennial) | <5% of U.S. hospitals | Smallest market share; newest accreditor |

**Strategic Consideration:** If Joint Commission denies accreditation March 2025, Mercy Regional could immediately apply for DNV or HFAP accreditation (estimated 3-6 months for initial survey and decision), potentially preserving deemed status with minimal disruption.²⁴¹ However:
- Alternative accreditors perceived as less prestigious than Joint Commission (may affect commercial payer contract negotiations)
- Switching accreditors signals quality/compliance concerns to regulators and payers
- DNV's annual survey cycle more burdensome than JC's triennial cycle²⁴²

Preliminary Denial (2022) (Joint Commission cited hospital for posing "threat to patients," issued preliminary denial subject to appeal), Johns Hopkins Hospital's accreditation is at risk because it 'poses a threat to patients,' accreditor says, Baltimore Banner (Oct. 18, 2022), https://www.thebanner.com/community/public-health/johns-hopkins-hospitals-accreditation-is-at-risk-because-it-poses-a-threat-to-patients-accreditor-says-U2YHYNXI3RFJDAYNSKWOPBYDIE/.

**Note on Case Law:** Joint Commission accreditation denials are administrative decisions subject to internal review/appeal within Joint Commission's processes. Judicial review is limited; federal courts generally lack jurisdiction over Joint Commission's private accreditation decisions unless CMS is directly involved (e.g., challenging CMS's reliance on Joint Commission deemed status findings). As a result, there is limited formal case law on Joint Commission accreditation disputes in federal court reporters.

### Appendix D: Corrective Action Sustainability Matrix

| Deficiency | Corrective Action Type | Sustainability Score | Rationale |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **MM.05.01.09** (Expired Meds) | Engineering Control (Pyxis ADC) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) | Automated system with alerts, less dependent on human vigilance |
| **IC.01.04.01** (Hand Hygiene) | Electronic Monitoring + Coaching | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) | Electronic monitoring objective, but coaching resource-intensive; compliance 88% vs. 90% target |
| **EC.02.01.01** (Fire Doors) | Engineering Control (Magnetic Hold-Opens) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) | Permanent engineering control, but requires annual fire alarm activation testing |
| **MS.06.01.05** (Credentialing) | Software System (VerityStream) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) | Automated alerts, system-wide audit of 1,850 files completed |
| **Pain Assessment** | EHR Hard-Stop Alert | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) | Automated EHR control prevents documentation omission |
| **Patient Education** | Translation + Interpreter Services | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) | Materials translated, services expanded, but requires ongoing translation updates |
| **Emergency Drills** | Mandatory Participation Policy | ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) | Policy-based (compliance 92% vs. 95% target), requires ongoing manager tracking |
| **Board Quality Review** | Dashboard + Meeting Schedule | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) | Dashboard automated, meeting schedule revised, but requires Board engagement |

**Overall Corrective Action Sustainability Score: 4.4/5 (STRONG)**

### Appendix E: Research Quality Attestation

#### Completeness Assessment (Verified)

✅ All relevant Federal Register notices reviewed (Joint Commission deemed status approval, reapplication, CMS proposed rule)
✅ All relevant CFR sections reviewed (42 CFR § 488.5, § 489.53, Part 482, Part 498)
✅ All Joint Commission standards cited in deficiency summary researched (MM.05.01.09, IC.01.04.01, EC.02.01.01, MS.06.01.05)
✅ CMS guidance documents reviewed (State Operations Manual, validation survey procedures, HAC Reduction Program)
✅ NFPA Life Safety Code standards reviewed (NFPA 101, NFPA 72, fire door requirements)
✅ M&A transaction documentation standards researched (reps/warranties, closing conditions, MAC clauses)
✅ Multiple search strategies employed (regulatory databases, Federal Register, Joint Commission resources, industry publications, case law)
✅ Cross-referenced findings across sources (verified consistency of deemed status framework, Joint Commission accreditation categories, CMS CoPs requirements)
✅ Identified gaps clearly documented (survey report not publicly available, corrective action plan in JC possession, commercial payer contracts proprietary)

#### Confidence Levels by Finding

| Finding | Confidence | Basis | Corroborating Sources |
|---------|------------|-------|----------------------|
| Deemed Status Framework (42 CFR § 488.5) | **HIGH** | Statutory/regulatory certainty | CFR, Federal Register, CMS guidance (4 sources) |
| Joint Commission Approval Through May 2028 | **HIGH** | Federal Register verified | 87 Fed. Reg. 26,261 (2022 approval notice) |
| October 2024 Deficiency Summary | **MEDIUM** | User-provided summary (survey report not reviewed) | Consistent with Joint Commission standards framework |
| Corrective Actions Implemented | **MEDIUM** | User-provided summary (corrective action plan not reviewed) | Consistent with industry best practices |
| March 2025 Follow-Up Predicted Outcome | **MEDIUM** | Expert judgment based on Mercy South precedent + corrective action quality | Mercy South 2021-2022 precedent, Joint Commission preliminary denial rate <5% |
| CMS Validation Survey Risk | **MEDIUM** | CMS guidance + proposed rule (not yet final) | CMS SOM, 89 Fed. Reg. 10,618 (2024 proposal) |
| Commercial Payer Contract Risk | **LOW-MEDIUM** | Industry patterns (contracts not reviewed) | Healthcare M&A industry standards (no Mercy-specific verification) |
| Financial Exposure Quantification | **MEDIUM** | User-provided revenue data + probability estimates | Revenue figures user-provided; probability based on expert judgment |

#### Known Limitations

1. **October 2024 Joint Commission Survey Report:** Not reviewed (proprietary, in hospital possession). Reliance on user-provided 8-deficiency summary. Risk: Additional deficiencies may exist not disclosed in summary.

2. **Mercy Regional Corrective Action Plan (ESC):** Not reviewed (proprietary, in Joint Commission possession). Reliance on user-provided corrective action summary (Pyxis, hand hygiene monitoring, magnetic hold-opens, VerityStream). Risk: Corrective actions may be incomplete or inadequately documented.

3. **Commercial Payer Contracts:** Not reviewed (proprietary). Assessment of "Joint Commission accreditation required" based on industry standards, not Mercy-specific contract language. Risk: Payer contracts may not actually require JC accreditation OR may accept alternative accreditors (DNV, HFAP).

4. **Medicare Provider Agreements:** Not reviewed (requires CMS data room access or FOIA). Reliance on user-provided CCN numbers and Hospital Compare public data. Risk: Provider agreements may contain conditions/restrictions not publicly disclosed.

5. **Credentialing Files:** Not reviewed (1,850 physician files). Reliance on user-provided representation that system-wide audit completed November 2024. Risk: Audit may have been incomplete or additional credentialing gaps may exist.

6. **Fire Alarm Activation Testing:** No verification that magnetic hold-opens successfully release doors upon fire alarm activation. User-provided representation that magnetic hold-opens installed, but testing not yet conducted as of December 2024. Risk: March 2025 JC survey may discover hold-opens malfunction during fire alarm test.

7. **Hand Hygiene Compliance Rate:** User-provided 88% as of December 2024. No independent verification via observation or electronic monitoring data review. Risk: Actual compliance may be lower if measurement methodology flawed.
