## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Critical Finding: Ohio Does NOT Require CON for Acute Care Hospital Beds

**This analysis reveals a fundamental discrepancy between the scenario facts and Ohio law.** The scenario describes a Certificate of Need (CON) application filed with the Ohio Department of Health for Mercy Regional Medical Center's 50-bed acute care hospital expansion, with $125 million in project value at risk pending regulatory approval. However, **Ohio does not require Certificate of Need for acute care hospital beds.**¹

Ohio's CON program applies exclusively to **long-term care facilities** (nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, and hospital-based skilled nursing beds).² Ohio regulates only **one service** under CON laws, making it one of the least restrictive CON states in the nation.³ Recent amendments to Ohio's CON statute (House Bill 33, effective September 30, 2024) did not reinstate CON requirements for acute care beds — they relate only to the existing long-term care CON program.⁴

**Implication for Transaction:** If Mercy Regional Medical Center is located in Columbus, Ohio (as stated in the scenario), the 50-bed medical/surgical expansion does **NOT require CON approval**, the $125M project is **NOT at risk** from CON denial, and the transaction team should **eliminate CON risk** from the transaction risk registry.

**Alternative Interpretation:** The scenario facts may describe a hypothetical hospital in a different state requiring CON for acute care beds (e.g., North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia), or may be a hypothetical demonstration scenario. This report addresses **both possibilities:**

- **Track 1 (Section IV.A):** Ohio-specific analysis — actual regulatory requirements absent CON (hospital licensure, Medicare certification, construction permits, Joint Commission survey)
- **Track 2 (Section IV.B):** Hypothetical CON jurisdiction analysis — assuming scenario facts apply to a CON state

### Track 1: Ohio-Specific Findings (Actual Regulatory Framework)

**Regulatory Requirements for 50-Bed Expansion in Ohio:**

1. **Hospital Licensure (Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.07):**
   - Ohio adopted hospital licensure requirements in 2021 (effective July 1, 2022)⁵
   - Mercy must notify Ohio Department of Health of bed capacity increase (525→575 beds)
   - **No pre-approval required** for bed additions; routine licensing compliance
   - **Risk: LOW** (routine administrative process)

2. **Medicare Certification (42 CFR § 488):**
   - Adding 50 beds to existing Medicare-certified hospital (CCN 360001)
   - Must notify CMS Region 5; state survey agency inspects new tower post-construction for Conditions of Participation compliance
   - **No pre-approval required**; certification follows construction
   - **Risk: LOW** (Mercy's existing provider agreement remains valid; routine survey process)

3. **Local Construction Permits:**
   - Columbus/Franklin County zoning approval, building permits, fire marshal approval
   - **Cost:** $50K-$150K permit fees
   - **Timeline:** Q3 2025 (concurrent with hypothetical CON timeline)
   - **Risk: LOW** ($95M construction project provides substantial economic development; routine permitting)

4. **Joint Commission Accreditation:**
   - New construction triggers Joint Commission Life Safety Code survey
   - October 2024 survey found **8 deficiencies** (requirements for improvement status)
   - **Risk: MEDIUM** (must complete corrective actions from October 2024 survey before new tower construction; if JC downgrades to provisional, could impact deemed status)
   - **Mitigation:** Complete March 2025 follow-up survey successfully; engage JC consultant for Life Safety Code compliance (see T7 specialist report)

**Recommendations (Ohio-Specific):**

1. **Verify jurisdiction within 48 hours:** Confirm Mercy Regional is in Ohio (vs. CON state)
2. **Eliminate $125M CON risk:** If Ohio confirmed, remove CON denial risk from transaction waterfall
3. **Revise purchase agreement:** Remove or clarify Section 6.1(g) CON closing condition (not applicable in Ohio)
4. **Focus on actual regulatory requirements:** Hospital licensure, Medicare certification, JC survey, local permitting

**Exposure (Ohio):** **$0 CON risk** + **Low-Medium risk** from Joint Commission survey (see T7 specialist report for JC deficiency remediation costs/timeline)

### Track 2: Hypothetical CON Jurisdiction Analysis (If Scenario Facts Control)

**For the remainder of this Executive Summary, I assume the scenario describes a hospital in a state requiring CON for acute care hospital beds.**

### CON Application Merits: Strong

**Need for Services (STRONG):**

Mercy Regional demonstrates compelling need for 50-bed expansion:

- **Occupancy:** 88% average annual occupancy **exceeds 80% minimum threshold** established by HHS National Guidelines for Health Planning⁶
- **Peak demand:** 95-100% occupancy during October-March flu season **exceeds 90% optimal threshold**⁷
- **Capacity constraints documented:** 12 emergency department diversions in 2023 when no beds available; patient transfers to competitors (OhioHealth/Mount Carmel) when Mercy at capacity
- **Population growth:** Franklin County +1.8% annually (2020-2024); Columbus metro suburban expansion (Dublin/Reynoldsburg)
- **National context:** Total U.S. hospitalizations projected to increase from 36.2M (2025) to 40.2M (2035) due to population aging; national hospital occupancy expected to reach **85% by 2032**⁸

**Occupancy 88% significantly exceeds CON approval thresholds** used in most states (80% minimum). Peak occupancy 95-100% demonstrates system operates at full capacity during flu season, creating access barriers (ED diversions, patient transfers).

**Cost-Effectiveness and Financial Feasibility (STRONG):**

Pro forma financial projections demonstrate viability:

- **Year 1:** 75% occupancy, 13,700 patient days, revenue $32M, operating costs $28M, **EBITDA $4M**
- **Year 5:** 90% occupancy, 16,400 patient days, revenue $42M, operating costs $30M, **EBITDA $12M**
- **Debt service coverage ratio:** 1.5× (exceeds 1.2× minimum standard)⁹
- **Financing:** National Healthcare Partners equity commitment $125M OR refinance tax-exempt bonds (feasible given $2.4B acquisition)
- **Operating costs:** Nurse-to-patient ratios 1:5 (competitive with national benchmarks); labor costs $18M annually (sustainable)

**Projections are conservative:** 75% Year 1 occupancy is achievable given current 88% systemwide occupancy and demonstrated unmet demand (ED diversions, transfers). Debt service coverage 1.5× provides adequate cushion above 1.2× minimum.

**Quality of Care (ADEQUATE):**

Quality metrics meet CON approval standards:

- **Joint Commission accredited:** Continuous accreditation since 1955 (October 2024 survey with requirements for improvement, but accreditation maintained)
- **Medicare Hospital Compare:** 3-star overall rating (national average; stable performance)
- **Charity care:** $45M annually (11.2% of operating expenses; demonstrates mission to serve low-income populations)
- **Payer mix:** 70% Medicare/Medicaid (serves government programs; not cherry-picking commercially insured patients)
- **Private rooms:** New tower will feature all private rooms (vs. current semi-private 2-bed rooms) — improves **infection control and patient satisfaction** (quality improvement, not cosmetic enhancement)

**Note:** October 2024 JC survey found 8 deficiencies (requirements for improvement). Mercy must demonstrate successful corrective action (March 2025 follow-up survey) to strengthen quality case for CON approval.

**Geographic Access (STRONG):**

Columbus-area hospital capacity is geographically concentrated:

- **OhioHealth:** Downtown Columbus (1,200 beds)
- **Mount Carmel:** East side Columbus (1,100 beds)
- **Mercy Regional:** Northwest/south corridors (525 beds → 575 beds)

Mercy serves **distinct geographic service area** (Dublin/Reynoldsburg/Lancaster suburbs) with longer travel times to competing hospitals. 50-bed expansion fills **geographic access gap**, not systemwide duplication.

### Competitor Opposition: OhioHealth's Arguments and Mercy Rebuttal

**OhioHealth Opposition (Expected):**

OhioHealth will likely argue:

1. **Market excess capacity:** Columbus market has 4,185 total beds (population 2.8M = **1.5 beds per 1,000 residents exceeds national average 1.3**) — sufficient capacity exists
2. **Duplication of services:** Mercy expansion duplicates services available at OhioHealth Grant (downtown) and Mount Carmel (east side) — creates "medical arms race" wasteful spending¹⁰
3. **Higher healthcare costs:** Excess capacity leads to higher systemwide costs (hospitals compete via amenities/technology, not price)
4. **Self-interest:** OhioHealth competes with Mercy for commercially insured patients; expansion threatens OhioHealth market share/revenue

**Mercy Rebuttal (Critical to Approval):**

Mercy must rebut OhioHealth arguments at public hearing (January 22, 2025) and in written submissions:

1. **Geographic access vs. systemwide capacity:**
   - Columbus may have 1.5 beds/1,000 on average, but **geographically concentrated** (OhioHealth downtown, Mount Carmel east)
   - Mercy serves **northwest/south corridors** (50 beds fill geographic gap, not duplication)
   - Patients face 20-30 minute longer travel times to OhioHealth/Mount Carmel from Mercy service area

2. **Peak demand vs. average occupancy:**
   - OhioHealth cites average capacity (1.5 beds/1,000), but Mercy operates at **95-100% peak occupancy** flu season
   - **12 ED diversions in 2023** demonstrate system at full capacity during peak periods
   - National projections: Hospital occupancy reaching **85% by 2032** — need to build capacity now to meet future demand¹¹

3. **Competition benefits patients:**
   - OhioHealth opposes to protect **market share**, not community interest
   - Competition improves quality, access, pricing (antitrust principles favor competition)
   - **850 medical staff support expansion** (letters from physicians documenting clinical need, not competitor claims)

4. **Demonstrated unmet need:**
   - OhioHealth claims no need, but **Mercy transferred patients to OhioHealth** when full — OhioHealth **benefits** from Mercy's capacity constraints
   - ED diversions harm patients (delays in care for acutely ill)
   - Private rooms improve **infection control** (not cosmetic) — COVID-19 demonstrated need for isolation capacity

**Assessment:** OhioHealth opposition creates **political risk** (competitor is politically connected, may influence Director decision despite application merits). Effective rebuttal at public hearing and political engagement (state legislators, Governor, DOH Director) are **critical** to counter OhioHealth influence.

### CON Approval Process and Timeline

**Timeline (Based on Scenario Facts):**

| Phase | Date | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Application filed | November 15, 2024 | ✓ Completed |
| Completeness review | December 2024-January 2025 | In progress |
| Public hearing | January 22, 2025 | **2 days away (as of Jan 24, 2026)** |
| Staff review | February-March 2025 | Pending |
| Director decision | Q2 2025 (April-May expected) | Pending |
| Appeal (if denied) | Within 30 days of decision | Contingent |

**Timeline is consistent with typical CON process:** 4-6 months from application to decision (if no objections) or 6-9 months (if competitor opposition).¹² Public hearing January 22, 2025 (68 days after November 15 filing) aligns with standard 60-90 day public notice period.

### Approval Probability Assessment

**Base Case (No Advocacy): 60-70%**

**Factors supporting approval:**
- ✓ Occupancy 88% exceeds 80% threshold
- ✓ Peak occupancy 95-100% exceeds 90% optimal
- ✓ Demonstrated capacity constraints (ED diversions, patient transfers)
- ✓ Population growth +1.8% annually
- ✓ Financial feasibility (EBITDA $4M-$12M, DSCR 1.5×)
- ✓ Quality metrics adequate (JC accredited, 3-star Medicare, charity care $45M)

**Factors creating risk:**
- ⚠ OhioHealth opposition (politically connected competitor)
- ⚠ Market capacity arguments (1.5 beds/1,000 vs. 1.3 national average)
- ⚠ Medical arms race concerns (duplication/excess capacity narrative)
- ⚠ Regulatory discretion (Director has discretion to deny despite meeting criteria)

**With Comprehensive Advocacy: 75-85%**

**Enhanced probability factors:**
- ✓ Political engagement (state legislators letters of support, Governor's office meeting, DOH Director direct presentation)
- ✓ Physician testimony (850 medical staff letters, clinical need demonstration)
- ✓ Community testimony (employers, patient advocates, unions — 150 FTEs + 500 construction jobs)
- ✓ Effective rebuttal to OhioHealth (geographic access, peak demand, competition benefits)
- ✓ Staff engagement (supplemental data, answer questions, accept reasonable conditions)

**Methodology Disclosure:** [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on: (1) Application merits (occupancy exceeds thresholds, financial feasibility demonstrated, quality adequate) = baseline 60-70%, (2) Competitor opposition (reduces probability 10-15% absent effective rebuttal), (3) Political advocacy (increases probability 10-20% when includes legislative support, Governor engagement, Director meetings), (4) Regulatory precedent (hospital bed expansions with 88% occupancy and demonstrated need approved 65-80% without advocacy, 75-90% with comprehensive advocacy in CON jurisdictions with similar criteria)]¹³

### Risk Quantification and Purchase Price Impact

**Scenario Analysis:**

| Scenario | Probability | Purchase Price Impact | Exposure (Weighted) |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **CON Approved (Full)** | 75% | $0 | $0 |
| **CON Approved (Conditions)** | 15% | -$10M (phased construction reduces NPV, or reduced scope 40 vs. 50 beds reduces EBITDA $2M-$4M annually) | -$1.5M |
| **CON Denied, Appeal Successful** | 5% | -$1M (appeal costs $500K-$1M legal fees) | -$50K |
| **CON Denied (Final)** | 5% | -$70M (midpoint of $60M-$125M range; see calculation below) | -$3.5M |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | — | **-$5.05M** |

**Purchase Price Adjustment Calculation (If CON Denied):**

**Method 1: Project Value at Risk**
- Total project cost: **$125M** (construction $95M + equipment $18M + financing $12M)
- If CON denied, cannot proceed with project
- **Exposure: $125M** (full project value)

**Method 2: Lost EBITDA Capitalization**
- Foregone EBITDA over 10 years (discounted at 8.5% WACC):
  - Year 1: $4M
  - Year 2: $6M
  - Year 3: $8M
  - Year 4: $10M
  - Years 5-10: $12M annually
- **10-year NPV:** $60M-$75M (depending on discount rate and growth assumptions)
- **Exposure: $60M-$75M** (lost earnings)

**Recommended Purchase Price Adjustment:**
- **Lesser of $125M (project cost) or $60M-$75M (lost EBITDA NPV) = $60M-$75M**
- **Expected value (probability-weighted): $5M-$10M** (5% probability × $70M midpoint = $3.5M, plus $1.5M from conditions scenario)

**Purchase Agreement Provisions (Recommended):**

1. **Closing Condition (Section 6.1(g)):**
   - CON approval (full or with acceptable conditions) required by **August 31, 2025** (Outside Date)
   - If not satisfied: Buyer may terminate, waive, or negotiate purchase price adjustment

2. **Purchase Price Adjustment (Section 2.3(c)):**
   - If CON denied (final), purchase price reduced by **lesser of $125M or $60M-$75M lost EBITDA NPV**
   - **Cap:** 5% of purchase price ($120M maximum)
   - **Alternative:** $75M escrow for 2 years (released to Seller if alternative project approved, Buyer if not)

3. **Material Adverse Change (Section 3.6):**
   - CON denial is **NOT** a MAC if purchase price adjustment invoked (prevents double-counting)

4. **Seller's Covenant (Section 5.8):**
   - Seller must use "commercially reasonable efforts" to obtain CON approval
   - Includes: timely DOH responses, public hearing testimony, political engagement, OhioHealth rebuttal, staff engagement
   - Buyer may participate but Seller retains decision-making authority

### Political Engagement and Advocacy Strategy (URGENT — Public Hearing January 22, 2025)

**Immediate Actions (By January 20, 2025 — 2 days):**

**State Legislators:**
- Schedule meetings with 5-10 Columbus-area state representatives/senators (districts covering Mercy service area)
- **Deliverable:** Letters of support to Ohio DOH Director
- **Talking points:** Job creation (150 FTEs + 500 construction), tax revenue, community need (88% occupancy, ED diversions), healthcare access

**Governor's Office:**
- Meeting with Governor's Chief of Staff or healthcare policy advisor
- **Deliverable:** Governor's statement of support (press release or letter to DOH Director)
- **Talking points:** $125M capital investment, healthcare access, charity care $45M (aligns with administration priorities), economic development

**Ohio DOH Director:**
- Schedule meeting with Director (final decision-maker)
- **Deliverable:** Present application merits directly; answer questions; provide supplemental data
- **Talking points:** Occupancy 88%, financial feasibility EBITDA $4M-$12M, quality metrics, community letters (850 physicians, employers, patient advocates)

**Public Hearing (January 22, 2025):**

**Mercy testimony (proponents):**
- CEO (10-15 min): Occupancy data, financial projections, community benefit, letters of support
- CFO (5-10 min): Pro forma Year 1-5, financing, debt service coverage 1.5×
- CMO (5-10 min): Clinical need, quality improvement (private rooms/infection control), medical staff support, peak demand
- Physicians (3-5 physicians, 3-5 min each): Patient transfer examples, ED diversion impacts
- Community (5-10 witnesses, 2-3 min each): Patient advocates, employers (Business Roundtable, Chamber), unions (Teamsters/SEIU), local government

**Rebuttal to OhioHealth (CRITICAL):**
- Assign rebuttal speaker (CEO or CON consultant) to respond immediately after OhioHealth testimony
- **Rebuttal points (5-7 min):**
  1. Geographic access vs. systemwide capacity (Mercy northwest/south distinct from OhioHealth downtown)
  2. Peak demand 95-100% vs. average 88% (ED diversions demonstrate need)
  3. Competition benefits patients (OhioHealth self-interest, not community interest)
  4. Demonstrated unmet need (patient transfers to OhioHealth when Mercy full — OhioHealth benefits from Mercy's constraints)

**Staff Engagement (February-March 2025):**

- Respond to staff questions within **5-7 days** of request
- Provide supplemental data proactively: patient origin maps, physician survey (850 medical staff), employer letters, construction jobs analysis
- Accept reasonable conditions if offered: phased construction (25+25 beds), reduced scope (40 vs. 50 beds if EBITDA positive), charity care commitment ($45M annually)

### Alternative Scenarios and Contingency Planning

**Scenario A: CON Approved (Full) — 75% Probability**

- **Next steps:** Commence construction Q3 2025; complete 2027-2028; begin operations
- **Transaction impact:** Satisfies closing condition; National Healthcare Partners proceeds with $2.4B acquisition
- **No purchase price adjustment**

**Scenario B: CON Approved (Conditions) — 15% Probability**

- **Possible conditions:** Phased construction (25 beds Phase 1, 25 beds Phase 2 if occupancy >90%), reduced scope (40 beds vs. 50), charity care commitment ($45M annually for 5 years)
- **Next steps:** Evaluate whether conditions acceptable (likely yes — any approval enables project); modify construction plans if needed
- **Transaction impact:** Purchase price adjustment **$0-$20M** (depending on condition severity: phasing reduces NPV, reduced scope reduces EBITDA $2M-$4M annually × 10-year multiple = $20M-$40M, but capped at $20M if buyer accepts conditions)

**Scenario C: CON Denied (Final) — 5-10% Probability**

**Immediate: Appeal to Court (within 30 days)**
- **Forum:** Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (if Ohio) or equivalent state court
- **Standard of review:** Arbitrary and capricious (highly deferential to agency)
- **Success probability:** 10-20% (judicial review rarely overturns CON decisions absent procedural errors or clear legal errors)
- **Cost:** $500K-$1M legal fees
- **Timeline:** 12-24 months for court decision
- **Recommendation:** File appeal to preserve rights, but do not rely on appeal success or delay transaction

**Alternative Projects (If Appeal Fails):**

1. **Physician office building:** Outpatient primary care/specialty clinics (10-15 physicians, $15M-$25M investment, NOT subject to CON)
   - **Revenue:** $5M-$10M annually (vs. $32M-$42M from 50-bed expansion)
   - **Limitation:** Does not address inpatient capacity need (88% occupancy remains unresolved)

2. **Ambulatory surgery center expansion:** Add 2-3 ORs to existing ASC ($8M-$12M investment; may be subject to CON — verify)
   - **Revenue:** $3M-$6M annually
   - **Limitation:** Shifts outpatient surgeries from hospital to ASC (cannibalizes existing revenue)

3. **Imaging center:** Freestanding MRI/CT/PET facility ($8M-$12M investment, NOT subject to CON in most states)
   - **Revenue:** $2M-$4M annually
   - **Limitation:** Limited strategic value vs. 50-bed expansion

4. **Reapply in 2-3 years:** Wait for population growth to demonstrate need (Franklin County +1.8% annually = +140K population over 3 years)
   - **Cost:** Foregone revenue $4M-$12M annually (lost EBITDA during delay)
   - **Risk:** Market dynamics may change (OhioHealth could expand, reducing Mercy's competitive position)

**Recommendation (If Denied):** Pursue **appeal** + **physician office building** concurrently. Appeal preserves 50-bed expansion option (10-20% success); physician office building provides immediate capital deployment ($15M-$25M) and outpatient revenue growth ($5M-$10M annually) to partially offset lost inpatient revenue.

**Transaction impact:** Purchase price adjustment **$60M-$125M** OR **deal termination** (buyer invokes Section 6.1(g) closing condition failure).

### Finding Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Ohio does NOT require CON for acute care hospital beds** | **HIGH** | Multiple authoritative sources (Institute for Justice, Ohio Rev. Code § 3702.52-3702.593, NCSL, academic studies) consistently confirm Ohio CON applies only to long-term care beds [VERIFIED via WebSearch Jan. 24, 2026] |
| **Occupancy 88% exceeds CON approval thresholds (80% minimum)** | **HIGH** | HHS National Guidelines for Health Planning (1977) established 80% minimum; peer-reviewed studies confirm 80-85% standard [VERIFIED via academic sources] |
| **Financial feasibility (EBITDA $4M-$12M, DSCR 1.5×) meets CON criteria** | **HIGH** | Pro forma projections provided in scenario; DSCR 1.5× exceeds 1.2× minimum standard cited in CON literature [VERIFIED via healthcare finance benchmarks] |
| **CON approval probability 75-85% with comprehensive advocacy** | **MEDIUM** | [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on application merits (strong occupancy/financial/quality), competitor opposition (political risk), advocacy effectiveness (legislative/Governor/Director engagement)] — No specific Ohio CON hospital bed precedent available (Ohio doesn't require CON for hospitals) |
| **Purchase price adjustment $60M-$75M (lost EBITDA NPV)** | **MEDIUM** | Calculation based on scenario-provided pro forma projections ($4M-$12M annual EBITDA), discounted at 8.5% WACC (standard healthcare M&A discount rate) — Actual adjustment subject to purchase agreement negotiation |
| **OhioHealth opposition reduces approval probability 10-15%** | **LOW** | [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment; no specific data on OhioHealth's political influence or prior CON opposition success in Ohio (Ohio doesn't have hospital CON)] — Hypothetical assessment based on competitor opposition patterns in other CON states |

### Summary and Recommendations

**1. CRITICAL: Verify Jurisdiction Within 48 Hours**

The transaction team must confirm whether Mercy Regional Medical Center is located in Ohio (no CON required) or a CON state (CON required for hospital beds). This single determination controls:
- Whether $125M project is at risk from CON denial
- Whether purchase price adjustment provisions are necessary
- Whether advocacy strategy must be implemented urgently (public hearing January 22, 2025 is **2 days away**)

**2. If Ohio Confirmed: Eliminate CON Risk ($125M Exposure Removed)**

- Remove "$125M CON risk" from transaction risk waterfall
- Revise purchase agreement to remove CON closing condition
- Focus on actual regulatory requirements: hospital licensure (Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.07), Medicare certification (42 CFR § 488), Joint Commission survey (address October 2024 deficiencies), local construction permits

**3. If CON State Confirmed: Implement Advocacy Strategy Immediately**

- **Political engagement (by January 20, 2025):** State legislators letters, Governor's office meeting, DOH Director presentation
- **Public hearing (January 22, 2025):** CEO/CFO/CMO testimony, physician/community witnesses, effective rebuttal to OhioHealth
- **Purchase agreement provisions (by January 31, 2025):** Closing condition, purchase price adjustment ($60M-$75M if denied), escrow alternative, seller's covenant
- **Staff engagement (February-March 2025):** Respond to questions within 5-7 days, supplemental data, accept reasonable conditions

**4. Risk-Adjusted Purchase Price Recommendation**

- **Expected value approach:** Reduce purchase price by **$5M-$10M** (reflects 75-85% approval probability)
- **Escrow approach:** Place **$75M in escrow** for 2 years (released to Seller if CON approved, Buyer if denied)
- **Contingent earnout approach:** Structure **$75M as earnout** payable upon CON approval within 24 months post-closing

**5. Exposure Summary**

| Risk Category | Probability | Gross Exposure | Weighted Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **CON Denied (Final)** | 5-10% (with advocacy) | $60M-$125M | **$3.5M-$7.5M** | Comprehensive advocacy (reduces probability from 30% to 5-10%); purchase price adjustment; alternative projects |
| **CON Approved (Conditions)** | 10-15% | $10M-$20M | **$1.5M-$3M** | Accept reasonable conditions (phasing, reduced scope, charity care commitment) |
| **Appeal Costs (If Denied)** | 5-10% | $500K-$1M | **$50K-$100K** | Budget contingency; evaluate cost-benefit before filing |
| **Total CON Risk** | — | — | **$5M-$11M** | — |

**NOTE:** If Mercy Regional is in Ohio, **total CON risk = $0** (no CON required). The $5M-$11M exposure applies only if hospital is in a CON state.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. CRITICAL FINDING: Ohio Does NOT Require CON for Acute Care Hospital Beds

**[VERIFIED: Multiple authoritative sources, January 2024]**

#### 1. Ohio's Current CON Scope (Long-Term Care Only)

Ohio's Certificate of Need program **applies only to long-term care facilities**, not acute care hospital beds.¹ Specifically, Ohio Revised Code Chapter 3702 and Ohio Administrative Code Chapter 3701-12 limit CON requirements to:

- Nursing home beds
- Skilled nursing facility beds
- Long-term care beds within hospitals²
- Replacement or relocation of long-term care beds³

**Statutory Authority:**
- Ohio Revised Code § 3702.51-3702.62 (Certificate of Need definitions and administration) [VERIFIED via https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3702.52]
- Ohio Revised Code § 3702.593 (CON for long-term care facility beds) [VERIFIED via https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-3702.593]
- Ohio Administrative Code § 3701-12 (Certificate of Need regulations) [VERIFIED via https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/chapter-3701-12]

#### 2. National Context: Ohio Among Least Restrictive CON States

As of 2024:
- **35 states + DC** maintain CON programs nationwide⁴
- **34 states** require CON for nursing home beds (most common requirement)⁵
- **29 states** require CON for new hospitals⁶
- **Ohio regulates only ONE service** under CON (long-term care beds), making it one of the least restrictive CON states in the nation⁷

Recent amendments to Ohio's CON statute (House Bill 33, effective October 3, 2023 and September 30, 2024) did **not** reinstate CON requirements for acute care beds — they relate only to the existing long-term care CON program.⁸

#### 3. What This Means for Mercy Regional's 50-Bed Expansion

**IMPLICATION:** If Mercy Regional Medical Center is located in Columbus, Ohio (as stated in the scenario), the proposed 50-bed medical/surgical expansion would **NOT require Certificate of Need approval** from the Ohio Department of Health.

**Alternative Regulatory Requirements in Ohio (Absent CON):**

The hospital expansion would instead require:

a) **Hospital Licensure** (Ohio Revised Code § 3701.07):
   - Ohio adopted hospital licensure requirements in House Bill 110 (2021 budget bill), effective July 1, 2022⁹
   - Requires hospitals to obtain and maintain state licensure from Ohio Department of Health
   - Licensure includes capacity review, but no pre-approval requirement for bed additions

b) **Building/Construction Permits:**
   - Local zoning approval (Columbus city/county)
   - Building permits for $95M construction project
   - Fire marshal approval
   - Environmental permits (if applicable)

c) **Medicare Certification** (42 CFR § 488):
   - If adding beds to existing Medicare-certified hospital (CCN 360001), must notify CMS
   - State survey agency inspects new tower for Conditions of Participation compliance
   - No pre-approval required; certification follows construction

d) **Joint Commission Accreditation Review** (if applicable):
   - New construction/substantial renovation triggers JC Life Safety Code survey
   - Not a government approval; voluntary accreditation process

#### 4. Reconciliation with Scenario Facts

**DISCREPANCY IDENTIFIED:**

The scenario states:
- "CON application filed November 15, 2024"
- "Ohio Department of Health review"
- "Public hearing January 22, 2025"
- "OhioHealth opposition"

**Possible Explanations:**

**A) Hypothetical Scenario for Demonstration Purposes:**
The facts may represent a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate CON analysis methodology in states that DO require CON for hospital beds (e.g., North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, etc.).

**B) Scenario Applies to Different State:**
The facts may describe a hospital in a different state with similar demographics (growing metropolitan area, competing health systems, 500+ bed flagship hospital).

**C) Long-Term Care Component:**
The expansion MAY include long-term care beds (skilled nursing/rehab beds) in addition to medical/surgical beds, triggering Ohio CON requirements for the LTC portion only.

**D) Historical Scenario:**
Ohio previously had broader CON requirements before legislative repeal. The scenario may be set in an earlier time period when Ohio required CON for hospital beds.

#### 5. Analysis Methodology Going Forward

**For purposes of this analysis, I will proceed with TWO parallel tracks:**

**Track 1: Ohio-Specific (Current Law)**
- Analyze what regulatory approvals ARE required in Ohio (licensure, Medicare, construction)
- Quantify risks under actual Ohio regulatory framework
- Assess competitive dynamics absent CON constraints

**Track 2: CON State Hypothetical (If Scenario Facts Control)**
- Assume scenario facts are accurate for a different CON jurisdiction
- Analyze CON application merits, opposition strategy, approval probability
- Provide advocacy recommendations and purchase price adjustment mechanisms
- Note "[HYPOTHETICAL — Not applicable in Ohio]" for all CON-specific findings

**Recommendation for Transaction Team:**
- **Verify jurisdiction:** Confirm whether Mercy Regional is in Ohio or another state
- **If Ohio:** Eliminate $125M "CON denial risk" from risk registry; address actual regulatory requirements (licensure, Medicare, construction permits)
- **If CON state:** Confirm statutory citations and tailor analysis to specific state's CON criteria

### B. Hypothetical CON Analysis (If Scenario Facts Apply to a CON Jurisdiction)

**[HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO — Analysis assumes facts describe hospital in a state requiring CON for acute care hospital beds]**

For the remainder of this analysis, I will assume the scenario describes a hospital expansion in a state that requires Certificate of Need approval for hospital bed additions (e.g., North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, or similar CON jurisdiction).¹⁰

#### 1. Typical CON Review Criteria for Hospital Bed Expansion

States requiring CON for hospital beds typically evaluate applications against the following criteria:

**a) Need for Services**

Applicants must demonstrate an unmet community need by showing that the current supply is inadequate, often by demonstrating that the **occupancy rate of existing facilities is at or above a specific threshold, such as 90%**.¹¹ The National Guidelines for Health Planning issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (1977) set an **80-percent occupancy rate as the minimum standard** for community hospitals.¹²

**Application to Mercy Regional:**
- Average annual occupancy: **88%** (exceeds 80% minimum threshold ✓)
- Peak period occupancy: **95-100%** during October-March flu season (exceeds 90% optimal threshold ✓)
- ED diversions: **12 days in 2023** when no beds available (demonstrates capacity constraint ✓)
- Patient transfers: Transferred patients to OhioHealth/Mount Carmel when capacity full (demonstrates unmet need ✓)

**b) Population Growth and Demographic Trends**

Common determinants of the required number of hospital beds include **demographic changes, average length of stay, admission rates, and bed occupancy rates**.¹³ State agencies project bed need five to ten years into the future using age-specific population projections.¹⁴

**Application to Mercy Regional:**
- Franklin County population growth: **+1.8% annually 2020-2024** (Columbus metro growing)
- Suburban expansion: Dublin/Reynoldsburg service areas (increasing demand)
- National context: Total annual hospitalizations projected to increase from 36.2M in 2025 to 40.2M in 2035 due to population aging; national hospital occupancy expected to reach **85% by 2032**.¹⁵

**c) Cost-Effectiveness and Financial Feasibility**

Financial feasibility is based on expenses, projected revenues, current financial status and capacity to retire debt. Applicants must submit **detailed five-year operating and capital budgets** that clearly outline anticipated revenues, expenses, and sources of funding, demonstrating that the project is financially viable.¹⁶

**Application to Mercy Regional:**
- **Pro forma projections:**
  - Year 1: 75% occupancy, 13,700 patient days, revenue $32M, operating costs $28M, **EBITDA $4M**
  - Year 5: 90% occupancy, 16,400 patient days, revenue $42M, **EBITDA $12M**
  - Debt service coverage ratio: **1.5× (exceeds 1.2× minimum) ✓**
- **Financing:** National Healthcare Partners equity commitment $125M OR refinance tax-exempt bonds (feasible ✓)
- **Operating costs:** Nurse-to-patient ratios 1:5 (competitive with benchmarks), labor costs $18M annually (sustainable ✓)

**d) Quality of Care**

Quality considerations focus on adherence to care standards and the applicant's past performance, including **staff qualifications, quality improvement measures, accreditation status, and outcomes data**.¹⁷

**Application to Mercy Regional:**
- **Joint Commission accredited:** Continuous since 1955 (October 2024 survey with requirements for improvement, but accreditation maintained ✓)
- **Medicare Hospital Compare:** 3-star overall (national average, stable ✓)
- **Charity care:** $45M annually (11.2% community benefit, demonstrates mission to serve low-income ✓)
- **Payer mix:** 70% Medicare/Medicaid (serves government programs, not cherry-picking commercial ✓)

**e) Impact on Existing Providers and Competition**

Virginia, for example, mandates consideration of factors including whether the project will foster healthy competition, how it will affect the healthcare system including the **utilization and efficiency of existing facilities**, and the project's feasibility including financial costs and benefits.¹⁸

#### 2. Competitor Opposition: OhioHealth's Arguments and Mercy Rebuttal

**a) OhioHealth's Typical Opposition Arguments**

**Argument #1: Market Excess Capacity**

Opponents argue that competition often encourages **excess capacity and duplication of services**, leading to supplier-induced increases in demand.¹⁹ OhioHealth would likely argue:

- Columbus market has sufficient beds (OhioHealth 1,200 + Mount Carmel 1,100 + Nationwide Children's 600 + Mercy 1,285 = **4,185 total beds**)
- Population 2.8M = **1.5 beds per 1,000 residents exceeds national average 1.3**
- Adding 50 beds will create excess capacity and higher healthcare costs systemwide

**Argument #2: Medical Arms Race / Costly Duplication**

Research using data prior to the mid-1980s found that hospitals typically entered into a **"medical arms race"** when confronted with competitors, spending unnecessarily on cosmetic quality improvements, cost-enhancing technologies, and duplicate facilities.²⁰ OhioHealth would argue:

- Mercy expansion duplicates services already available at OhioHealth Grant (competitor downtown)
- Medical arms race raises costs without improving access
- Competing by duplicating services reduces market share and raises possibility of price war²¹

**Argument #3: Self-Interest / Competitive Advantage**

OhioHealth likely competes with Mercy Regional for commercially insured patients. Opposition may be motivated by:

- Market share protection (Mercy expansion could capture patients from OhioHealth)
- Revenue impact (reduced census at OhioHealth facilities if Mercy expands)
- Competitive positioning (OhioHealth politically connected, may influence state regulators)

**b) Mercy Regional's Rebuttal Arguments**

**Rebuttal #1: Geographic Access, Not Systemwide Capacity**

- Columbus area may have capacity **on average**, but geographically concentrated (OhioHealth downtown, Mount Carmel east side)
- Mercy serves **northwest/south corridors** (50 beds fill geographic gap, not duplication)
- Patients face longer travel times to access competing hospitals (geographic barriers to care)

**Rebuttal #2: Peak Demand vs. Average Occupancy**

- Average occupancy 88% masks **peak periods 95-100%** during flu season (October-March)
- System operates at **full capacity** during peak demand (ED diversions demonstrate need)
- National projections: Hospital occupancy reaching **85% by 2032** due to aging population²²
- 50 beds provide necessary surge capacity for public health emergencies

**Rebuttal #3: Competition Benefits Patients**

- OhioHealth opposes to protect market share, **not community interest**
- Competition improves quality, access, and pricing (antitrust principles favor competition)
- **850 medical staff support expansion** (letters from physicians, community groups, employer coalitions)
- Private rooms improve **infection control and patient satisfaction** (quality improvement, not cosmetic)

**Rebuttal #4: Demonstrated Community Need**

- **12 ED diversions in 2023** when no beds available (patients turned away)
- Patient transfers to competitors when Mercy full (unmet demand documented)
- Population growth **+1.8% annually** (increasing demand for services)
- Charity care **$45M annually** (demonstrates commitment to underserved populations)

#### 3. CON Approval Process and Timeline (Hypothetical Jurisdiction)

**Typical CON Timeline:**²³

| Phase | Activity | Duration | Application to Mercy |
|-------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Application Filing** | Submit application with supporting documentation | — | November 15, 2024 ✓ |
| **Completeness Review** | State health department reviews for completeness; may request additional information (up to 2 requests, 30 days each) | 30-90 days | December 2024-January 2025 |
| **Public Notice** | Public notice published; public comment period opens | 30 days | December 2024 |
| **Public Hearing** | State conducts public hearing; applicant presents evidence; competitors may oppose; community testimony | 1 day | January 22, 2025 ✓ |
| **Staff Review** | Health department staff evaluates application against CON criteria; prepares recommendation | 60-90 days | February-March 2025 |
| **Director Decision** | Health department director issues final decision (approve/deny/approve with conditions) | Within 60 days of completeness notice (or 4-6 months total if no objections) | April-May 2025 (Q2 2025) ✓ |
| **Appeal (if denied)** | Applicant may appeal to state court (typically 30 days) | 30 days to file | — |
| **Adjudication Hearing (if appealed)** | State conducts adjudication hearing; issues final order | 60-120 days | — |
| **Judicial Review (if still denied)** | Appeal to state court of appeals | 12-24 months | — |

**Application to Mercy Regional:**

Based on scenario facts, Mercy appears to be on the typical timeline:
- Application filed November 15, 2024 ✓
- Public hearing January 22, 2025 (68 days after filing — typical) ✓
- Decision expected Q2 2025 (April-May) — **consistent with 4-6 month standard timeline** ✓

#### 4. Approval Probability Assessment

**Base Case Probability (Without Advocacy): 60-70%**

**Factors Supporting Approval:**
- ✓ Occupancy 88% exceeds 80% threshold
- ✓ Peak occupancy 95-100% exceeds 90% optimal threshold
- ✓ Demonstrated capacity constraints (ED diversions, patient transfers)
- ✓ Population growth +1.8% annually
- ✓ Financial feasibility (EBITDA $4M-$12M, DSCR 1.5×)
- ✓ Quality metrics (JC accredited, 3-star Medicare, charity care $45M)
- ✓ Community benefit (serves 70% Medicare/Medicaid, not cherry-picking)

**Factors Creating Risk:**
- ⚠ OhioHealth opposition (politically connected competitor)
- ⚠ Market capacity arguments (1.5 beds per 1,000 vs. 1.3 national average)
- ⚠ Excess capacity/duplication narrative (medical arms race concerns)
- ⚠ Regulatory discretion (director has discretion to deny despite meeting criteria)

**With Comprehensive Advocacy: 75-85%**

**Enhanced Probability Factors:**
- ✓ Political engagement (state legislators, Governor's office, health department director)
- ✓ Physician testimony (850 medical staff letters of support, clinical need demonstration)
- ✓ Community testimony (employers, patient advocates, union representatives — 150 FTEs + 500 construction jobs)
- ✓ Rebuttal to OhioHealth (geographic access, peak demand, competition benefits)
- ✓ Supplemental data (staff engagement, answer questions, address concerns)

**Methodology Disclosure:** [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on: (1) application merits (occupancy exceeds thresholds, financial feasibility demonstrated, quality metrics adequate), (2) competitor opposition mitigation (rebuttal arguments, community support, political engagement), (3) regulatory precedent (typical approval rates for hospital bed expansions with 88% occupancy and demonstrated need range 65-80% without advocacy, 75-90% with advocacy)]²⁴

#### 5. Political Engagement and Advocacy Strategy

**a) State Legislators**

**Target:** Columbus-area state representatives and senators (district representatives for Mercy Regional service area)

**Talking Points:**
- Job creation: **150 FTEs** new positions ($12M annual wages) + **500 construction jobs** temporary
- Tax revenue: Property tax (construction) + payroll tax (employees)
- Community need: ED diversions, patient transfers, 88% occupancy demonstrates need
- Patient access: Geographic gap in northwest/south corridors

**Requested Action:**
- Letters of support to Ohio Department of Health Director
- Meeting with Director to advocate for approval
- Testify at public hearing (if willing)

**b) Governor's Office**

**Target:** Governor's healthcare policy advisor / Chief of Staff

**Talking Points:**
- Healthcare access priority (Mercy expansion supports administration goals)
- Economic development: $125M capital investment + 150 permanent jobs
- Charity care: $45M annually serves low-income (aligns with state priorities)
- Private rooms: Infection control improvement (quality/patient safety)

**Requested Action:**
- Meeting with Mercy CEO to present application
- Governor's statement of support (if politically feasible)
- Governor's office communicates support to Ohio DOH Director

**c) Ohio Department of Health Director

**Target:** Director of Health (final decision-maker)

**Talking Points:**
- Occupancy data: 88% average, 95-100% peak demonstrates need
- Financial projections: Conservative (75% Year 1, 90% Year 5), feasible (EBITDA $4M-$12M)
- Quality metrics: JC accredited, 3-star Medicare, charity care 11.2%
- Community letters: 850 physicians, employer coalitions, patient advocates support

**Requested Action:**
- Schedule meeting to present application directly
- Answer questions about application merits
- Provide supplemental data as requested during staff review

#### 6. Public Hearing Strategy (January 22, 2025)

**a) Mercy Testimony (Proponents)**

**CEO Testimony (10-15 minutes):**
- Occupancy data: 88% average, 95-100% peak, 12 ED diversions
- Financial projections: $125M investment, EBITDA $4M-$12M, feasible
- Community benefit: Charity care $45M, 70% Medicare/Medicaid payer mix
- Letters of support: 850 physicians, employer coalitions, community groups

**CFO Testimony (5-10 minutes):**
- Detailed pro forma: Year 1-5 projections, revenue/cost assumptions
- Financing plan: National Healthcare Partners equity OR bond refinancing
- Debt service coverage: 1.5× exceeds minimum 1.2×
- Conservative assumptions: 75% Year 1, 90% Year 5 (achievable occupancy targets)

**CMO Testimony (5-10 minutes):**
- Clinical need: Patient transfers when no beds, ED diversions impact patient care
- Quality improvement: Private rooms reduce infection risk, improve patient satisfaction
- Medical staff support: Physicians document need for additional capacity
- Peak demand: Flu season (October-March) operates at 95-100% capacity

**Physician Testimony (Medical Staff President, Department Chairs):**
- Clinical examples: Patients transferred to competitors when Mercy full
- Quality of care impacts: ED diversions delay care for acutely ill patients
- Physician recruitment: Additional capacity needed to recruit specialists
- Private rooms: Infection control (COVID-19 demonstrated need for isolation capacity)

**Community Testimony:**
- **Patient advocates:** Personal stories of transfer experiences, access barriers
- **Employer coalitions:** Ohio Business Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce (workforce health, economic development)
- **Union representatives:** Teamsters/SEIU (150 FTEs + 500 construction jobs, wages $12M annually)
- **Local government:** Columbus City Council, Franklin County Commissioners (tax revenue, job creation)

**b) OhioHealth Testimony (Opponents) — Expected Arguments**

OhioHealth will likely testify:
- **Overcapacity:** Columbus market has 1.5 beds per 1,000 (exceeds national 1.3)
- **Duplication:** Mercy expansion duplicates services at OhioHealth Grant, Mount Carmel
- **Higher costs:** Excess capacity leads to higher healthcare costs systemwide
- **Alternative solutions:** Mercy should improve efficiency at existing 525 beds, not build new tower

**c) Mercy Rebuttal to OhioHealth (Critical)**

Mercy must rebut OhioHealth's arguments immediately after opponent testimony:

**Rebuttal #1: Geographic Access vs. Systemwide Capacity**
- "OhioHealth measures capacity **across entire Columbus metro**, but patients don't travel across the city for routine care"
- "Mercy serves **northwest/south corridors** (Dublin, Reynoldsburg, Lancaster) — geographically distinct from OhioHealth downtown"
- "50 beds fill **geographic gap**, not systemwide duplication"

**Rebuttal #2: Peak Demand vs. Average Occupancy**
- "OhioHealth cites **1.5 beds per 1,000** average, but this masks **peak demand 95-100%** during flu season"
- "**12 ED diversions in 2023** demonstrate system operates at full capacity during peak periods"
- "National projections: Hospital occupancy reaching **85% by 2032** — need to build capacity **now** to meet future demand"

**Rebuttal #3: Competition Benefits Patients**
- "OhioHealth opposes to protect **market share**, not community interest"
- "Competition improves quality, access, pricing — **antitrust principles favor competition**"
- "**850 medical staff** support expansion — physicians document clinical need, not competitor claims"

**Rebuttal #4: Demonstrated Unmet Need**
- "OhioHealth claims no need, but **Mercy transferred patients to OhioHealth** when full — OhioHealth **benefits** from Mercy's capacity constraints"
- "ED diversions harm patients — **delays in care** for acutely ill"
- "Private rooms improve **infection control** (not cosmetic) — COVID-19 demonstrated need for isolation capacity"

#### 7. Staff Review and Engagement (February-March 2025)

**Ohio DOH Staff Recommendation Process:**

State health department staff will:
1. Evaluate application against CON criteria (need, cost, quality, financial feasibility)
2. Review public hearing testimony and written comments
3. Analyze competitor opposition arguments
4. Prepare staff recommendation: **Approve / Deny / Approve with Conditions**
5. Submit recommendation to Director for final decision

**Mercy's Staff Engagement Strategy:**

- **Answer staff questions promptly:** Provide supplemental data within 5-7 days of request
- **Demonstrate application meets all criteria:** Occupancy, financial feasibility, quality, need
- **Address staff concerns proactively:** If staff raises concerns (e.g., financing, occupancy assumptions), provide additional evidence
- **Possible conditions staff may recommend:**
  - **Phased construction:** 25 beds Phase 1, 25 beds Phase 2 if occupancy exceeds 90% (accept if necessary)
  - **Reduced scope:** 40 beds vs. 50 (negotiate, but 50 beds preferred based on need)
  - **Charity care commitment:** Maintain $45M annually (agree — already providing)
  - **Private room commitment:** All new beds private rooms (agree — already planned)

#### 8. Final Decision Scenarios (April-May 2025)

**Scenario A: Approved (75-85% probability with advocacy)**

**Decision:** Ohio Department of Health Director issues Certificate of Need approving 50-bed expansion

**Next Steps:**
- Commence construction Q3 2025
- Complete construction 2027-2028
- Begin operations (licensing, Medicare certification, Joint Commission survey)
- National Healthcare Partners proceeds with $2.4B acquisition (CON approval satisfies closing condition)

**Scenario B: Approved with Conditions (10-15% probability)**

**Possible Conditions:**
- **Phased construction:** 25 beds Phase 1 (2027), 25 beds Phase 2 (2029) if occupancy >90%
- **Reduced scope:** 40 beds approved (vs. 50 requested)
- **Charity care commitment:** Maintain $45M annually for 5 years post-completion

**Next Steps:**
- Evaluate whether conditions acceptable (likely yes — any approval enables project)
- Modify construction plans if needed (phasing, reduced scope)
- Proceed with acquisition (CON approval with conditions likely satisfies closing condition, but confirm with buyer)

**Scenario C: Denied (5-10% probability with advocacy, 30-40% without advocacy)**

**Decision:** Director denies CON application (finding: market excess capacity, inadequate need demonstration, or competitor opposition prevails)

**Next Steps:**
- **Appeal to Franklin County Court of Common Pleas** (30-day deadline):
  - Standard of review: **Arbitrary and capricious** (highly deferential to agency)
  - Burden on applicant: Prove Director's decision not supported by reliable, probative, substantial evidence
  - **Success probability: 10-20%** (judicial review rarely overturns agency decisions absent procedural errors or clear legal errors)
  - Timeline: 12-24 months for court decision

- **Alternative: Pursue Smaller Project Not Subject to CON:**
  - Physician office building (outpatient services, not inpatient beds)
  - Ambulatory surgery center expansion (may be subject to CON depending on state)
  - **Does NOT address inpatient capacity need** (88% occupancy remains unresolved)

- **Purchase Agreement Implications:**
  - **Cannot proceed with $125M project** if CON denied and appeal unsuccessful
  - Buyer (National Healthcare Partners) may invoke **purchase price adjustment** or **closing condition failure**
  - See Section IV.B.9 below for purchase price adjustment mechanisms

#### 9. Purchase Price Adjustment Mechanisms (If CON Denied)

**[METHODOLOGY: Standard M&A purchase agreement provisions for regulatory approval conditions precedent]**

**a) Closing Condition Approach**

**Draft Provision:**

> **Section 6.1(g) — Conditions Precedent to Buyer's Obligations**
>
> The obligations of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Buyer) of the following conditions on or before the Closing Date:
>
> **(g) Certificate of Need.** With respect to the CON Application filed by Mercy Regional Medical Center on November 15, 2024, with the Ohio Department of Health for the addition of fifty (50) medical/surgical beds (the "**CON Application**"), one of the following conditions shall have been satisfied:
>
> (i) **Approval Received.** The Director of the Ohio Department of Health shall have issued a Certificate of Need approving the CON Application in full or with conditions acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion;
>
> (ii) **Approval with Acceptable Modifications.** The Director shall have issued a Certificate of Need approving the CON Application with modifications (including phased construction, reduced bed count, or operational conditions), and Buyer shall have determined in its reasonable discretion that such modifications do not materially impair the economic value of the proposed expansion or the financial projections underlying the Purchase Price;
>
> (iii) **Denial with Alternative Plan.** The Director shall have denied the CON Application, and Seller and Buyer shall have mutually agreed upon an alternative capital project of comparable value and strategic benefit to replace the 50-bed expansion; **or**
>
> (iv) **Waiver.** Buyer shall have waived this condition in writing.
>
> If the condition in this Section 6.1(g) is not satisfied or waived by **[Outside Date: August 31, 2025]**, Buyer may, in its sole discretion: (A) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) without liability, (B) waive this condition and proceed to Closing, or (C) negotiate with Seller a **Purchase Price Adjustment** pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

**b) Purchase Price Adjustment Formula**

**Draft Provision:**

> **Section 2.3(c) — Purchase Price Adjustment for CON Denial**
>
> If the CON Application is denied by the Ohio Department of Health and such denial becomes final (after exhaustion of administrative appeals or expiration of the appeal period), and Buyer elects to proceed to Closing notwithstanding such denial, the Purchase Price shall be reduced as follows:
>
> **(i) Project Value Reduction.** The Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the lesser of: (A) **One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($125,000,000)** (the total capital cost of the 50-bed expansion project), or (B) the amount calculated pursuant to subsection (ii) below.
>
> **(ii) Lost EBITDA Capitalization.** The Purchase Price reduction shall be calculated as the present value of foregone EBITDA from the 50-bed expansion over a **ten (10) year** period, discounted at Buyer's weighted average cost of capital (**8.5%**), calculated as follows:
>
> Purchase Price Reduction = Σ (Year 1-10) [Foregone Annual EBITDA / (1 + 0.085)^n]
>
> Where:
> - **Year 1 Foregone EBITDA** = $4,000,000 (based on Seller's pro forma projections)
> - **Year 2 Foregone EBITDA** = $6,000,000
> - **Year 3 Foregone EBITDA** = $8,000,000
> - **Year 4 Foregone EBITDA** = $10,000,000
> - **Year 5-10 Foregone EBITDA** = $12,000,000 annually
>
> **Example Calculation:**
> - 10-year NPV of foregone EBITDA = **$60,000,000 - $75,000,000** (depending on discount rate and growth assumptions)
> - Purchase Price Reduction = **Lesser of $125M or $60M-$75M = $60M-$75M**
>
> **(iii) Cap.** Notwithstanding subsections (i) and (ii), the Purchase Price reduction pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) shall not exceed **Five Percent (5%)** of the Purchase Price (i.e., **$120,000,000** cap on reduction from $2.4B purchase price).
>
> **(iv) Escrow Alternative.** In lieu of an immediate Purchase Price reduction, the Parties may mutually agree to place an amount equal to the calculated reduction in an **escrow account** for a period of **two (2) years** post-Closing, to be released to Buyer if Seller does not obtain CON approval for an alternative expansion project of comparable value within such period, or released to Seller if such approval is obtained.

**c) Material Adverse Change (MAC) Clause**

**Draft Provision:**

> **Section 3.6 — No Material Adverse Change**
>
> Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.6, since December 31, 2024, there has not been any Material Adverse Change with respect to Seller's business, operations, financial condition, or prospects. For purposes of this Agreement, "**Material Adverse Change**" includes, but is not limited to:
>
> (viii) The denial of any **Certificate of Need** application filed by Seller for capital projects with an aggregate value exceeding **Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000)**, unless Seller has obtained alternative regulatory approval for a substitute project of comparable strategic and economic value acceptable to Buyer.
>
> Notwithstanding the foregoing, the denial of the CON Application for the 50-bed expansion shall **not** constitute a Material Adverse Change if Buyer elects to invoke the Purchase Price Adjustment mechanism in Section 2.3(c) in lieu of terminating this Agreement.

**d) Seller's Covenant to Pursue CON Diligently**

**Draft Provision:**

> **Section 5.8 — CON Application**
>
> From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) termination of this Agreement:
>
> (a) Seller shall use **commercially reasonable efforts** to obtain approval of the CON Application, including: (i) timely responding to all information requests from the Ohio Department of Health, (ii) presenting testimony and evidence at the public hearing scheduled for January 22, 2025, (iii) engaging with state legislators, the Governor's office, and the Director of Health to advocate for approval, (iv) rebutting competitor opposition (including OhioHealth's opposition), and (v) providing supplemental data and analysis as requested by Department staff during the review process.
>
> (b) Seller shall keep Buyer **reasonably informed** of the status of the CON Application, including providing copies of all communications with the Department, notices of hearings, staff recommendations, and the final decision.
>
> (c) If the CON Application is denied, Seller shall **consult with Buyer** before filing any administrative appeal or pursuing alternative projects, and shall obtain Buyer's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) before incurring legal fees exceeding **One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000)** in connection with any appeal.
>
> (d) Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the CON Application process, including attending hearings, reviewing draft testimony and submissions, and engaging with state regulators, provided that Seller retains ultimate decision-making authority over the CON Application strategy unless and until Closing occurs.

#### 10. Risk Quantification Summary

| Scenario | Probability | Purchase Price Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **CON Approved (Full)** | 60-70% baseline / 75-85% with advocacy | $0 (no adjustment) | Comprehensive advocacy (legislators, Governor, DOH Director, public hearing, staff engagement) |
| **CON Approved with Conditions** | 10-15% | $0 - $20M (depending on conditions: phased construction reduces NPV, reduced scope 40 vs. 50 beds reduces EBITDA $2M-$4M annually) | Accept reasonable conditions; negotiate phasing/scope if economically viable |
| **CON Denied, Appeal Successful** | 5-10% (if denied) | $0 (no adjustment if appeal succeeds) + **$500K-$1M appeal costs** | Appeal to Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (30-day deadline); judicial review standard: arbitrary/capricious |
| **CON Denied, Appeal Unsuccessful** | 20-30% (if no advocacy) / 5-10% (with advocacy) | **$60M-$125M purchase price reduction** OR **deal termination** | Purchase price adjustment (lesser of $125M project cost or $60M-$75M lost EBITDA NPV); alternative project negotiation; escrow for 2 years |

**Expected Value Calculation (Probability-Weighted):**

| Scenario | Probability | Impact | Weighted Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Approved (full) | 75% | $0 | $0 |
| Approved (conditions) | 15% | -$10M | -$1.5M |
| Denied (appeal successful) | 5% | -$1M | -$50K |
| Denied (final) | 5% | -$70M | -$3.5M |
| **Expected Reduction** | **100%** | — | **-$5.05M** |

**Recommendation:** Price reduction of **$5M-$10M** reflects expected value of CON risk, OR negotiate **escrow of $75M** (full lost EBITDA NPV) for 2 years pending CON decision, released to Seller if approved or to Buyer if denied.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Risk Factors (Ohio-Specific — Actual Regulatory Framework)

**CRITICAL FINDING:** If Mercy Regional is located in Ohio, **NO CON risk exists** because Ohio does not require CON for acute care hospital beds.

**Actual Regulatory Risks in Ohio:**

1. **Hospital Licensure (Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.07):**
   - Risk: Low (routine licensing process, no pre-approval required for bed additions)
   - Mitigation: Ensure compliance with Ohio hospital licensure regulations

2. **Medicare Certification (42 CFR § 488):**
   - Risk: Low (adding beds to existing Medicare-certified hospital, routine survey process)
   - Mitigation: Notify CMS, ensure new tower meets Conditions of Participation

3. **Construction Permits (Local):**
   - Risk: Low (routine building permits, zoning approval)
   - Mitigation: Engage early with Columbus/Franklin County zoning and building departments

4. **Joint Commission Survey:**
   - Risk: Medium (October 2024 survey found requirements for improvement; new construction triggers Life Safety Code survey)
   - Mitigation: Complete corrective actions from October 2024 survey before new tower construction; engage JC consultant for Life Safety Code compliance

**Recommendation:** **Eliminate $125M "CON denial risk" from transaction risk registry** if Mercy Regional is confirmed to be in Ohio. Reallocate resources to actual regulatory risks (Joint Commission follow-up, Medicare certification, local permitting).

### B. Risk Factors (Hypothetical CON Jurisdiction)

**If scenario describes hospital in a CON state:**

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy | Residual Risk |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **CON Denied (No Advocacy)** | **CRITICAL** ($125M project value at risk) | 30-40% | Comprehensive advocacy (legislators, Governor, DOH Director, public hearing, rebuttal to OhioHealth) | **5-10%** (with advocacy) |
| **CON Approved with Unfavorable Conditions** | **HIGH** (Phased construction delays revenue, reduced scope reduces EBITDA $2M-$4M annually) | 10-15% | Negotiate conditions, accept phasing if economically viable, model financial impact | **10-15%** |
| **Appeal Costs (If Denied)** | **MEDIUM** ($500K-$1M legal fees, 12-24 month delay) | 5-10% (only if denied) | Budget contingency for appeal, evaluate cost-benefit before filing | **5-10%** |
| **OhioHealth Political Influence** | **MEDIUM** (Competitor may influence Director decision despite merits) | 15-25% | Political engagement to counter OhioHealth influence, community grassroots support, physician testimony | **10-15%** |
| **Market Perception / Financing Impact** | **LOW** (CON denial could signal market weakness, impact National Healthcare Partners' financing) | 5-10% (only if denied) | Purchase price adjustment mechanisms, alternative project planning | **5%** |

### C. Cross-Domain Impacts (Flagged for Other Specialists)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| CON decision expected Q2 2025 (April-May) | **Closing Timeline** | commercial-contracts-analyst | Does Q2 2025 CON decision timeline delay expected Q2-Q3 2026 closing? What closing conditions should address CON timing? | **MEDIUM** |
| $125M project value at risk if CON denied | **Purchase Price Adjustment** | commercial-contracts-analyst / financial-analyst | What purchase price adjustment mechanism addresses $60M-$125M CON denial risk? Escrow vs. immediate reduction? | **HIGH** |
| National Healthcare Partners for-profit acquirer | **Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption** | tax-structure-analyst | Does CON denial affect $420M tax-exempt bond redemption requirement (Mercy Northwest bonds)? | **LOW** |
| 50-bed expansion increases capacity 9.5% (525→575 beds) | **Medicare Provider Agreement** | regulatory-rulemaking-analyst (Medicare) | Does 9.5% capacity increase trigger CMS substantial change review for CCN 360001? | **LOW** |
| Joint Commission requirements for improvement (October 2024) | **CON Approval Probability** | regulatory-rulemaking-analyst (JC) | Does JC "requirements for improvement" status reduce CON approval probability (quality metrics factor)? | **MEDIUM** |

### D. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Jurisdiction Verification (CRITICAL):**
   - **Confirm whether Mercy Regional is in Ohio or another state**
   - If Ohio: Eliminate CON risk, focus on actual regulatory requirements (licensure, Medicare, construction)
   - If CON state: Tailor analysis to specific state's CON criteria and process

2. **OhioHealth Opposition Strength:**
   - Research OhioHealth's political connections (board members, donors, legislative relationships)
   - Assess whether OhioHealth has successfully opposed prior CON applications in jurisdiction
   - Evaluate OhioHealth's market share and competitive positioning vs. Mercy

3. **Alternative Capital Projects (If CON Denied):**
   - Identify substitute projects NOT subject to CON (outpatient facilities, physician office building, ASC expansion)
   - Model whether alternative projects provide comparable strategic/economic value to 50-bed expansion
   - Assess buyer's willingness to accept alternative if CON denied

4. **Historical CON Approval Rates:**
   - Research jurisdiction's historical CON approval rates for hospital bed expansions (past 5 years)
   - Identify comparable applications (occupancy >85%, competitor opposition, population growth)
   - Assess whether jurisdiction favors incumbents or new entrants

5. **Purchase Agreement CON Provisions:**
   - Review whether existing purchase agreement addresses CON approval (closing condition, purchase price adjustment, termination right)
   - If not addressed: Draft provisions urgently (CON decision Q2 2025, closing expected Q2-Q3 2026)
   - Align buyer and seller expectations on CON risk allocation

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Primary Conclusion: Jurisdiction Verification Required

**The single most critical finding of this analysis is that Ohio does NOT require Certificate of Need for acute care hospital beds.** Ohio's CON program applies exclusively to long-term care facilities (nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities).²⁵ Therefore:

**IF Mercy Regional Medical Center is located in Columbus, Ohio:**
- The 50-bed medical/surgical expansion does **NOT require CON approval**
- The $125M project is **NOT at risk** from CON denial
- The transaction team should **eliminate CON risk** from the risk registry
- Focus instead on actual regulatory requirements: hospital licensure (Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.07), Medicare certification (42 CFR § 488), local construction permits, Joint Commission survey

**IF the scenario describes a different jurisdiction (CON state):**
- Proceed with Track 2 hypothetical analysis (Section IV.B)
- CON approval probability: 75-85% with comprehensive advocacy
- Risk exposure: $60M-$125M if denied (purchase price adjustment)
- Implement advocacy strategy immediately (public hearing January 22, 2025)

### B. Recommendations (Ohio-Specific — If Mercy Regional is in Ohio)

**Recommendation 1: Confirm Jurisdiction and Eliminate CON Risk**

**Action:** Transaction team must confirm Mercy Regional's jurisdiction within 48 hours.

**If Ohio confirmed:**
- Remove "$125M CON risk" from transaction risk waterfall
- Eliminate "CON decision Q2 2025" from closing conditions timeline
- Reallocate legal resources from CON advocacy to actual regulatory compliance

**Rationale:** Continuing to analyze CON risk for an Ohio hospital wastes resources and creates unnecessary deal uncertainty. Ohio's CON statute is unambiguous — acute care hospital beds are NOT subject to CON.²⁶

**Recommendation 2: Address Actual Regulatory Requirements in Ohio**

**Ohio Hospital Licensure (Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.07):**
- **Action:** Notify Ohio Department of Health of 50-bed expansion; ensure new tower meets state licensure standards
- **Timeline:** Concurrent with construction; no pre-approval required
- **Risk:** Low (routine licensing process)

**Medicare Certification (42 CFR § 488):**
- **Action:** Notify CMS Region 5 of capacity increase (525→575 beds); state survey agency will inspect new tower for Conditions of Participation compliance post-construction
- **Timeline:** Survey scheduled after construction completion (2027-2028)
- **Risk:** Low (routine survey; Mercy's existing Medicare provider agreement CCN 360001 remains valid)

**Local Construction Permits:**
- **Action:** Obtain Columbus/Franklin County zoning approval, building permits, fire marshal approval
- **Timeline:** Q3 2025 (concurrent with CON timeline in hypothetical scenario)
- **Cost:** $50K-$150K permit fees
- **Risk:** Low (routine permitting; $95M construction project is substantial economic development)

**Joint Commission Accreditation:**
- **Action:** Complete corrective actions from October 2024 survey (requirements for improvement) **before** new tower construction; engage JC consultant for Life Safety Code compliance review
- **Timeline:** March 2025 follow-up survey (address deficiencies), then new tower survey post-construction
- **Risk:** **Medium** (October 2024 survey found 8 deficiencies; new construction triggers Life Safety Code survey; if JC downgrades to provisional, could impact deemed status)
- **Mitigation:** See specialist report on Joint Commission accreditation (T7)

**Recommendation 3: Revise Purchase Agreement**

**Action:** Remove or revise Section 6.1(g) (CON closing condition) if purchase agreement currently includes CON approval as condition precedent.

**Rationale:** If Mercy Regional is in Ohio, CON approval is **not applicable**. Including a CON closing condition creates legal ambiguity and potential closing delay.

**Revised Provision (Suggested):**

> **Section 6.1(g) — Regulatory Approvals**
>
> Seller shall have obtained all required regulatory approvals for the 50-bed expansion project, including: (i) Ohio Department of Health hospital licensure approval (to the extent required for bed additions), (ii) local zoning and building permits, and (iii) compliance with Medicare Conditions of Participation for the new tower. **Certificate of Need approval is not required under Ohio law** and shall not be a condition precedent to Closing.

### C. Recommendations (Hypothetical CON Jurisdiction — If Scenario Facts Control)

**IF the scenario describes a hospital in a CON state, implement the following advocacy strategy immediately:**

**Recommendation 4: Comprehensive Political Engagement (Immediate — Prior to January 22, 2025 Public Hearing)**

**State Legislators (Columbus-area representatives/senators):**
- **Action:** Schedule meetings with 5-10 key legislators (districts covering Mercy service area) **by January 15, 2025**
- **Deliverable:** Letters of support to Ohio DOH Director
- **Talking points:** Job creation (150 FTEs + 500 construction), tax revenue, community need (88% occupancy, ED diversions)
- **Responsible party:** Mercy CEO + Government Affairs VP

**Governor's Office:**
- **Action:** Meeting with Governor's Chief of Staff or healthcare policy advisor **by January 18, 2025**
- **Deliverable:** Governor's statement of support (press release or letter to DOH Director)
- **Talking points:** $125M capital investment, healthcare access, charity care $45M (aligns with administration priorities)
- **Responsible party:** Mercy CEO + Board Chair

**Ohio Department of Health Director:**
- **Action:** Schedule meeting with Director **by January 20, 2025** (2 days before public hearing)
- **Deliverable:** Present application merits directly; answer Director's questions; provide supplemental data
- **Talking points:** Occupancy 88%, financial feasibility EBITDA $4M-$12M, quality metrics, community letters of support
- **Responsible party:** Mercy CEO + CFO + external CON consultant

**Recommendation 5: Public Hearing Strategy (January 22, 2025)**

**Mercy Testimony — Proponents:**
- **CEO (10-15 min):** Occupancy data, financial projections, community benefit, letters of support
- **CFO (5-10 min):** Pro forma Year 1-5, financing plan, debt service coverage 1.5×
- **CMO (5-10 min):** Clinical need, quality improvement (private rooms/infection control), medical staff support, peak demand
- **Physicians (3-5 physicians, 3-5 min each):** Patient transfer examples, ED diversion impacts, physician recruitment needs
- **Community (5-10 witnesses, 2-3 min each):** Patient advocates, employer coalitions (Business Roundtable, Chamber), union reps (Teamsters/SEIU), local government (City Council, County Commissioners)

**Rebuttal to OhioHealth (CRITICAL):**
- **Assign rebuttal speaker:** CEO or external CON consultant with authority to respond immediately after OhioHealth testimony
- **Anticipated OhioHealth arguments:** Overcapacity (1.5 beds/1,000), duplication, higher costs
- **Mercy rebuttal (5-7 min):**
  1. Geographic access vs. systemwide capacity (Mercy northwest/south corridors distinct from OhioHealth downtown)
  2. Peak demand 95-100% vs. average 88% (ED diversions demonstrate need)
  3. Competition benefits patients (OhioHealth self-interest, not community interest)
  4. Demonstrated unmet need (patient transfers to OhioHealth when Mercy full — OhioHealth benefits from Mercy's constraints)

**Recommendation 6: Staff Engagement (February-March 2025)**

**Ohio DOH Staff Review:**
- **Action:** Respond to staff questions within **5-7 days** of request
- **Anticipate staff concerns:**
  - Financing: Provide National Healthcare Partners equity commitment letter OR bond refinancing plan
  - Occupancy assumptions: Provide 3-year historical occupancy data (trend analysis showing 88% is sustainable)
  - Quality: Address October 2024 JC requirements for improvement (corrective action plan, March 2025 follow-up)
  - Competition: Provide rebuttal to OhioHealth (geographic market analysis, patient origin data showing Mercy serves distinct corridors)
- **Provide supplemental data proactively:**
  - Patient origin maps (demonstrate geographic service area distinct from OhioHealth)
  - Physician survey (850 medical staff support expansion — clinical need documentation)
  - Employer letters (Ohio Business Roundtable, Chamber — workforce health/economic development)
  - Construction timeline/jobs analysis (500 construction jobs, $95M local economic impact)

**Accept Reasonable Conditions (If Offered by Staff):**
- **Phased construction:** Acceptable (25 beds Phase 1, 25 beds Phase 2 if occupancy >90%)
- **Reduced scope:** Negotiate (40 beds vs. 50 — model financial impact; accept if EBITDA still positive)
- **Charity care commitment:** Acceptable (maintain $45M annually — already providing)
- **Private room commitment:** Acceptable (already planned)

**Recommendation 7: Purchase Agreement Provisions (Immediate — Draft by January 31, 2025)**

**Closing Condition:**
- Implement Section 6.1(g) draft provision (see Section IV.B.9.a)
- **Outside Date:** August 31, 2025 (allows 4 months post-decision for appeal if denied)
- **Buyer discretion:** Terminate, waive, or negotiate purchase price adjustment

**Purchase Price Adjustment Formula:**
- Implement Section 2.3(c) draft provision (see Section IV.B.9.b)
- **Reduction amount:** Lesser of $125M (project cost) or $60M-$75M (lost EBITDA NPV)
- **Cap:** 5% of purchase price ($120M maximum)
- **Escrow alternative:** $75M escrow for 2 years (released to Seller if alternative project approved, Buyer if not)

**Material Adverse Change Exclusion:**
- Clarify that CON denial is **NOT** a MAC if purchase price adjustment invoked
- Prevents double-counting (buyer cannot both reduce price AND terminate for MAC)

**Seller's Covenant:**
- Seller must use "commercially reasonable efforts" to obtain CON approval
- Includes: timely responses to DOH, public hearing testimony, political engagement, rebuttal to OhioHealth, staff engagement
- Buyer has right to participate but Seller retains decision-making authority

**Recommendation 8: Risk Quantification for Financial Modeling**

**Expected Value of CON Risk (Probability-Weighted):**

| Scenario | Probability | Purchase Price Impact | Weighted Impact |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Approved (full) | 75% | $0 | $0 |
| Approved (conditions) | 15% | -$10M | -$1.5M |
| Denied (appeal succeeds) | 5% | -$1M (appeal costs) | -$50K |
| Denied (final) | 5% | -$70M (NPV midpoint) | -$3.5M |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | — | **-$5.05M** |

**Recommendation for Purchase Price Adjustment:**
- **Option 1 (Expected Value):** Reduce purchase price by **$5M-$10M** to reflect expected value of CON risk
- **Option 2 (Escrow):** Place **$75M in escrow** for 2 years pending CON decision; released to Seller if approved, Buyer if denied
- **Option 3 (Contingent Earnout):** Structure $75M of purchase price as **contingent earnout** payable upon CON approval within 24 months post-closing

**Justification:** Expected value approach ($5M-$10M) reflects 75-85% approval probability with advocacy. Escrow/earnout approach ($75M) provides downside protection if denied while allowing Seller to realize full value if approved.

**Recommendation 9: Alternative Project Planning (Contingency)**

**If CON Denied (5-10% probability with advocacy):**

**Alternative 1: Appeal to Franklin County Court of Common Pleas**
- **Timeline:** 30-day deadline to file appeal
- **Standard of review:** Arbitrary and capricious (highly deferential to agency)
- **Success probability:** 10-20% (judicial review rarely overturns CON decisions absent procedural errors)
- **Cost:** $500K-$1M legal fees
- **Duration:** 12-24 months for court decision
- **Recommendation:** File appeal to preserve rights, but do not delay transaction or rely on appeal success

**Alternative 2: Substitute Non-CON Project**
- **Physician office building:** Outpatient primary care/specialty clinics (10-15 physicians, $15M-$25M investment, NOT subject to CON)
- **Ambulatory surgery center expansion:** Add 2-3 ORs to existing ASC (may be subject to CON depending on state — verify)
- **Imaging center:** Freestanding MRI/CT/PET facility ($8M-$12M investment, NOT subject to CON in most states)
- **Limitation:** None of these alternatives address **inpatient capacity need** (88% occupancy remains unresolved)

**Alternative 3: Reapply in 2-3 Years**
- **Rationale:** If denied due to market timing (e.g., perceived excess capacity), wait 2-3 years for population growth to demonstrate need
- **Supporting data:** Franklin County +1.8% annual growth = +140,000 population over 3 years; national hospital occupancy reaching 85% by 2032
- **Limitation:** Delays revenue $4M-$12M annually (foregone EBITDA); does not address current capacity constraints

**Recommendation:** If CON denied, pursue **Alternative 1 (appeal)** + **Alternative 2 (physician office building)** concurrently. Appeal preserves 50-bed expansion option if successful (10-20% chance); physician office building provides immediate capital deployment and outpatient revenue growth to partially offset lost inpatient revenue.

### D. Summary of Key Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Priority | Responsible Party | Timeline |
|---|----------------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **1** | **Confirm jurisdiction** (Ohio vs. CON state) | **CRITICAL** | Transaction team lead | **Within 48 hours** |
| **2** | **Eliminate CON risk** if Ohio confirmed; focus on actual regulatory requirements (licensure, Medicare, JC) | **CRITICAL** | Legal team | **Within 1 week** |
| **3** | Revise purchase agreement to remove/clarify CON closing condition if Ohio | HIGH | Transaction counsel | Within 2 weeks |
| **4** | Political engagement (legislators, Governor, DOH Director) **if CON state** | **CRITICAL** | Mercy CEO + Gov't Affairs | **By Jan 15-20, 2025** |
| **5** | Public hearing strategy **if CON state** (testimony, rebuttal to OhioHealth) | **CRITICAL** | Mercy CEO/CFO/CMO + CON consultant | **January 22, 2025** |
| **6** | Staff engagement **if CON state** (respond to questions, supplemental data, accept reasonable conditions) | HIGH | Mercy CON team | Feb-March 2025 |
| **7** | Draft purchase agreement provisions (closing condition, price adjustment, escrow, MAC, seller covenant) **if CON state** | HIGH | Transaction counsel | By January 31, 2025 |
| **8** | Risk quantification (expected value $5M-$10M OR escrow $75M) **if CON state** | MEDIUM | Financial analyst | February 2025 |
| **9** | Alternative project planning (appeal, physician office building, reapply) **if CON denied** | MEDIUM | Strategy team | Contingency (activate if denied) |

### Appendix B: State-by-State CON Requirements for Hospital Beds (2024)

**States Requiring CON for Hospital Beds (29 states + DC):**¹⁴

Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, (others vary by specific service)

**States with Limited CON (Long-Term Care Only):**

- **Ohio** (long-term care beds only)
- Indiana (nursing homes only)
- South Carolina (transitioning to nursing homes only)

**States with NO CON:**

Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida (repealed 2019), Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming

### Appendix C: CON Review Criteria Comparison (Selected States)

| State | Occupancy Threshold | Population Methodology | Financial Feasibility | Quality Metrics |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **New York** | **90%** (hospitals must demonstrate occupancy >90% to show need) | 5-year population projection by age/gender; normalized discharge rate per 1,000 | 5-year operating/capital budgets; debt service coverage | Accreditation, outcomes, past performance |
| **Virginia** | **80-85%** (depends on service area) | Age-specific population projections; migration factors | Pro forma projections; debt capacity | Competition impact; quality standards |
| **North Carolina** | **75-80%** (acute care beds) | County-level need determination; population growth | Financial statements; reimbursement analysis | Past compliance; quality improvement |
| **Tennessee** | **80%** (general medical/surgical) | Regional bed need calculation | 3-year pro forma; financing plan | Accreditation; patient safety |
| **Maryland** | **80%** (acute care) | Bed-to-population ratios; use rates | Cost-benefit analysis; charity care commitment | State Health Plan alignment; quality metrics |

**Note:** Ohio is **not included** in this comparison because Ohio does not require CON for acute care hospital beds.¹⁵

### Appendix D: Purchase Price Adjustment Formula — Worked Example

**Scenario:** CON application denied (final); Buyer elects to proceed to Closing with purchase price adjustment.

**Method 1: Project Value at Risk**
- Total project cost: $125,000,000
- Purchase price reduction (full project cost): **$125,000,000**

**Method 2: Lost EBITDA Capitalization (NPV)**

| Year | Foregone EBITDA | Discount Factor (8.5%) | Present Value |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|---------------|
| 1 | $4,000,000 | 0.9217 | $3,686,800 |
| 2 | $6,000,000 | 0.8495 | $5,097,000 |
| 3 | $8,000,000 | 0.7829 | $6,263,200 |
| 4 | $10,000,000 | 0.7216 | $7,216,000 |
| 5 | $12,000,000 | 0.6650 | $7,980,000 |
| 6 | $12,000,000 | 0.6129 | $7,354,800 |
| 7 | $12,000,000 | 0.5649 | $6,778,800 |
| 8 | $12,000,000 | 0.5207 | $6,248,400 |
| 9 | $12,000,000 | 0.4799 | $5,758,800 |
| 10 | $12,000,000 | 0.4423 | $5,307,600 |
| **TOTAL (10-year NPV)** | — | — | **$61,691,400** |

**Purchase Price Reduction:** Lesser of $125M (Method 1) or $61.7M (Method 2) = **$61,691,400** (rounded to **$62M**)

**Alternative Calculation (Perpetuity Method):**
- Steady-state EBITDA (Years 5-10): $12M annually
- Capitalization rate (WACC): 8.5%
- Terminal value (Year 5): $12M / 0.085 = $141.2M
- Discounted to present (Year 0): $141.2M × 0.6650 = $93.9M
- **Purchase price reduction (perpetuity method): $93.9M**

**Recommendation:** Use **10-year NPV method ($62M)** as conservative estimate. Perpetuity method ($94M) may overstate value (assumes 50-bed expansion operates in perpetuity without need for future capital investment, which is unrealistic). Full project cost method ($125M) does not account for financing already expended (sunk costs for application, architectural plans, etc.).

## X. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)

✓ **All relevant legal frameworks researched**
- Ohio Revised Code Chapter 3702 (Certificate of Need) — COMPLETE
- Ohio Administrative Code Chapter 3701-12 (CON Regulations) — COMPLETE
- Federal regulations (42 C.F.R. Part 488 — Medicare Conditions of Participation) — COMPLETE
- National CON landscape (NCSL, Institute for Justice, academic studies) — COMPLETE
- Typical CON review criteria (need, cost, quality, financial feasibility) — COMPLETE
- Competitor opposition strategies (medical arms race, excess capacity) — COMPLETE
- M&A transaction provisions (conditions precedent, purchase price adjustments) — COMPLETE

✓ **Multiple search strategies employed**
- 14 distinct WebSearch queries executed
- Targeted searches: Ohio-specific statutes/regulations, national CON data, review criteria, competitor opposition, M&A provisions
- Cross-referenced sources: government (Ohio codes, NCSL), academic (peer-reviewed studies), legal (law firm analyses), industry (healthcare news)

✓ **Cross-referenced findings across sources**
- Ohio CON scope (long-term care only): Verified via 4 independent sources (Ohio Rev. Code § 3702.593, Institute for Justice, NCSL, academic study)
- 80% occupancy threshold: Verified via 3 sources (HHS National Guidelines per Schuhmann 2010, New York DOH, LegalClarity)
- National CON landscape (35 states + DC): Verified via 2 authoritative sources (NCSL, Mitchell 2024 peer-reviewed study)
- Hospital occupancy projections (85% by 2032): Verified via news report citing research (Fierce Healthcare 2025)

✓ **Identified gaps clearly documented**
- **Gap #1: Ohio vs. CON state jurisdiction unclear** — Scenario states "Ohio Department of Health review" but Ohio does NOT require CON for hospital beds (flagged as CRITICAL finding requiring verification within 48 hours)
- **Gap #2: OhioHealth political connections** — Scenario mentions "OhioHealth opposition, politically connected" but no public data available on lobbying/board affiliations (flagged as "Red Flag Requiring Further Investigation")
- **Gap #3: Mercy Regional financial statements** — Pro forma projections provided in scenario ($4M-$12M EBITDA) not independently verified (scenario-based analysis only)
- **Gap #4: Historical CON approval rates (Ohio)** — Cannot research Ohio hospital CON approval precedent because Ohio does not require CON for hospital beds (hypothetical analysis based on comparable CON states)

### Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | # of Corroborating Sources |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Ohio does NOT require CON for acute care hospital beds** | **HIGH** | 6 sources (Ohio Rev. Code § 3702.52-3702.593, Ohio Admin. Code § 3701-12, Institute for Justice, NCSL, Mitchell 2024 study, Research and Planning Consultants) |
| **80% occupancy is standard CON approval threshold** | **HIGH** | 4 sources (HHS National Guidelines per Schuhmann 2010, New York DOH, Virginia/Tennessee/Maryland criteria comparison, LegalClarity) |
| **CON approval probability 75-85% with advocacy** | **MEDIUM** | Expert judgment based on application merits (strong occupancy/financial/quality), competitor opposition mitigation, political advocacy effectiveness — NO Ohio hospital CON precedent available (Ohio doesn't require CON for hospitals) |
| **Purchase price adjustment $60M-$75M (lost EBITDA NPV)** | **MEDIUM** | Calculation based on scenario-provided pro forma projections (not independently verified); standard M&A practice per 6 sources (Lane & Waterman, Goulston & Storrs, Calfee, SGR Law, Weightmans, ABA) |
| **"Medical arms race" competitor opposition arguments** | **HIGH** | 3 peer-reviewed academic sources (Shen & Yu 2020, DOJ 2012 hospital competition analysis, Bailey 2020 systematic review) |
| **National hospital occupancy to reach 85% by 2032** | **MEDIUM** | 1 news source citing research (Fierce Healthcare 2025) — projection not independently verified via primary research source |

### Known Limitations

**Limitation 1: Scenario Jurisdiction Ambiguity**
- **Issue:** Scenario states "Ohio Department of Health review" but Ohio does NOT require CON for acute care hospital beds (only long-term care)
- **Impact:** Analysis provides TWO tracks: (1) Ohio-specific (no CON risk), (2) Hypothetical CON state (75-85% approval probability)
- **Recommendation:** Transaction team must verify jurisdiction within 48 hours to determine which track applies

**Limitation 2: No Access to Mercy Regional Financial Statements**
- **Issue:** Pro forma projections ($4M-$12M EBITDA) provided in scenario not independently verified
- **Impact:** Financial feasibility analysis relies on scenario-provided data; cannot verify conservative/aggressive assumptions
- **Mitigation:** Flagged assumptions; recommended CFO testimony at public hearing to defend projections

**Limitation 3: No Access to OhioHealth Political Connections Data**
- **Issue:** Scenario mentions "OhioHealth politically connected" but no public lobbying/board affiliation data researched
- **Impact:** Cannot quantify political risk from competitor opposition (10-15% probability reduction is expert judgment, not data-driven)
- **Mitigation:** Flagged as "Red Flag Requiring Further Investigation" in Section V.D; recommended political engagement to counter OhioHealth influence

**Limitation 4: Hypothetical CON Analysis (Ohio Doesn't Require CON for Hospitals)**
- **Issue:** Detailed CON application analysis (Section IV.B) is hypothetical because Ohio does NOT require CON for acute care beds
- **Impact:** Analysis useful only if (a) scenario describes different state, or (b) scenario is hypothetical demonstration
- **Mitigation:** Clearly labeled all CON analysis as "[HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO]"; provided Ohio-specific recommendations (Section VI.B) for actual regulatory requirements

**Limitation 5: No Historical CON Approval Data (Ohio)**
- **Issue:** Cannot research Ohio hospital CON approval precedent because Ohio repealed hospital CON requirements (retains only long-term care CON)
- **Impact:** Approval probability assessment (75-85%) based on comparable CON states (North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland) not Ohio-specific precedent
- **Mitigation:** Disclosed methodology; flagged as expert judgment based on comparable jurisdictions with similar review criteria

**DISCLAIMER:** This research memorandum is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice. Findings are based on publicly available information accessed through web search and legal databases. The **critical finding** that Ohio does not require Certificate of Need for acute care hospital beds is based on current Ohio Revised Code (as of September 30, 2024) and multiple authoritative secondary sources. If Mercy Regional Medical Center is located in a different state, or if the scenario describes a hypothetical jurisdiction, the CON analysis in Section IV.B (hypothetical CON state) applies instead of Section IV.A (Ohio-specific). All conclusions should be independently verified with transaction counsel before reliance.
