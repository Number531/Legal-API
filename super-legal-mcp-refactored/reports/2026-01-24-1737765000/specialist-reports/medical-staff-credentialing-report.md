## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

National Healthcare Partners LLC (Tennessee-based private equity healthcare investment company) seeks to acquire Mercy Regional Health System for $2.4 billion, converting the non-profit 501(c)(3) entity to for-profit status. This research memorandum analyzes medical staff credentialing, peer review protections, and change of control impacts on Mercy Regional's 1,850 credentialed physicians (650 employed by Mercy Medical Group PC, 1,200 community privileged physicians) across four acute care hospitals (1,285 beds total).

The acquisition presents significant medical staff risks totaling an expected value of **$20.03 million** in probability-weighted exposure, driven primarily by: (1) exclusive contract termination risk if hospital-based physician groups (anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology) exercise change of control termination rights ($1M-$10M exposure); (2) employed physician resignations following non-profit to for-profit conversion (20-30% historical turnover rate, $5M-$25M recruitment costs); (3) GME teaching faculty departures risking ACGME accreditation withdrawal and loss of $2.5M annual funding for surgery program currently on probation; and (4) ASC physician ownership creating STARK/AKS violations requiring remediation ($1.5M-$5M).

**Critical finding:** Medical staff bylaws may be enforceable contracts under emerging legal precedent (*Avera Marshall* 2014 Minnesota Supreme Court), potentially granting physicians veto power over the transaction if bylaws require physician vote or approval for ownership changes. Ohio law is uncertain on this issue, creating **MEDIUM to HIGH risk** (50% probability) of physician breach of contract litigation if Mercy Regional's governing board unilaterally approves the sale without following bylaw procedures. **Immediate due diligence imperative:** Obtain and review medical staff bylaws for all four hospitals to identify physician voting rights and amendment requirements.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Medical Staff Bylaws May Grant Physicians Contractual Rights to Block Transaction:** Approximately half of U.S. states recognize medical staff bylaws as enforceable contracts between hospitals and physicians (Minnesota Supreme Court's *Medical Staff of Avera Marshall Regional Medical Center v. Avera Marshall*, 857 N.W.2d 695 (Minn. 2014)). If Mercy Regional's bylaws require physician vote or approval for ownership changes, unilateral board action could trigger breach of contract litigation, injunctive relief blocking the sale, and transaction delays of 6-12 months. **Estimated Exposure: $0-$2M** (legal fees, delay costs, potential settlement). **Mitigation: Review bylaws immediately; amend pre-closing via proper procedures if necessary; negotiate physician approval or indemnification.**

2. **Exclusive Contracts for Hospital-Based Physicians Pose Critical Termination Risk:** Anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, and pathology services typically operate under exclusive contracts containing "incident to and coterminous" provisions tying medical staff privileges to the contract. Change of control provisions commonly grant physician groups (a) termination rights upon hospital ownership change, (b) consent requirements before assignment to new owner, or (c) rate renegotiation triggers. **Estimated Exposure: $1M-$10M** depending on number of groups exercising termination, recruitment timeline (6-24 months), and revenue loss during transition. **Mitigation: Obtain all exclusive contracts; negotiate waivers/amendments pre-closing; secure physician group commitments.**

3. **For-Profit Conversion Will Drive Employed Physician Turnover (20-30% Historical Rate):** Research on non-profit to for-profit hospital conversions shows physician turnover increases 43% (2010-2018), with 20-30% attrition concentrated among mission-driven physicians, primary care physicians, and academic physicians. Mercy Regional's 650 employed physicians represent critical workforce; even 10% turnover (65 physicians) costs $5M in recruitment ($75K per physician); 30% turnover (195 physicians) costs $25M. **Estimated Exposure: $5M-$25M**. **Mitigation: Retention bonuses for critical physicians; mission/values communication; competitive compensation; physician equity incentives.**

4. **GME Surgery Program Probation + PE Acquisition = High Faculty Departure Risk:** Mercy Regional's surgery residency program (40 residents) is on ACGME probation for work hours violations (85-90 hours/week vs. 80-hour limit, May 2024 citation), with follow-up review Q2 2025. Core teaching faculty departures while on probation could trigger withdrawal of accreditation and loss of $2.5M annual GME funding for surgery program. Private equity acquisitions historically impose clinical productivity demands that reduce teaching time and alienate academic physicians. **Estimated Exposure: $0-$2.5M annually** if accreditation withdrawn. **Mitigation: Faculty retention plan with bonuses tied to GME support; resolve probation pre-closing; commitments to maintain academic culture.**

5. **ASC Physician Ownership Requires Pre-Closing Remediation to Avoid Credentialing Complications:** Eight employed Mercy physicians own 33% of Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC, referring 85% of ASC cases (STARK/AKS violations per T1 specialist research). Remediation options have differing credentialing implications: **(Option 1) Unwind ASC (buy out physicians $1.5M-$2M)** eliminates violation, preserves physician privileges, avoids NPDB reporting. **(Option 2) OIG self-disclosure (settle $2M-$5M)** risks physician exclusion from Medicare/Medicaid, adverse privileging action reportable to NPDB under 42 U.S.C. § 11133, and physician departures. **Recommendation: Unwind ASC pre-closing** as condition precedent to eliminate acquirer STARK/AKS liability. **Estimated Exposure: $1.5M-$5M**.

6. **Federal and Ohio Peer Review Protections Remain Robust Post-Acquisition:** Peer review processes benefit from federal HCQIA immunity (42 U.S.C. § 11101 et seq.) and Ohio statutory protections (Ohio Revised Code §§ 2305.251-2305.252). HCQIA provides qualified immunity from monetary damages for peer review participants if four-part test satisfied: (1) reasonable belief action furthers quality, (2) reasonable effort to obtain facts, (3) adequate due process (notice, hearing, counsel, witnesses), (4) reasonable belief action warranted. Ohio law provides additional credentialing presumption (hospital not negligent in credentialing if Joint Commission accredited) and absolute privilege for peer review proceedings and records (confidential, non-discoverable, testimonial privilege). **These protections continue post-acquisition** as long as peer review processes comply with statutory requirements.

7. **October 2024 Joint Commission Credentialing Deficiency Corrected, but Systemic Compliance Risk Remains:** Joint Commission survey identified Dr. Wilson's credentialing file missing primary source verification of medical school graduation (file dated 2021). Mercy Regional corrected deficiency through FSMB verification and updated all 1,850 physician files. Follow-up survey scheduled March 2025. **Risk: If March 2025 follow-up identifies additional deficiencies**, Joint Commission may downgrade to provisional accreditation or conditional accreditation, risking loss of deemed status for Medicare Conditions of Participation (42 C.F.R. § 488.5). Loss of deemed status triggers direct CMS surveys (more stringent than Joint Commission). **Estimated Exposure: $0-$500K** (corrective action plans, additional surveys, consultant fees). **Mitigation: Complete March 2025 follow-up successfully; maintain FPPE/OPPE compliance; ensure primary source verification protocols robust.**

8. **NPDB Reporting Compliance Critical to Preserve HCQIA Immunity:** Hospitals must report adverse clinical privileges actions >30 days to National Practitioner Data Bank within 15 days (42 U.S.C. § 11133). Failure to report triggers severe penalties: Federal Register publication, loss of HCQIA immunity for 3 years, and civil money penalties up to $23,331 per unreported payment. **Due diligence imperative: Audit NPDB reporting compliance for past 5 years** to identify unreported adverse actions or malpractice payments. **Estimated Exposure: $0-$500K** if historical underreporting discovered. **Mitigation: Verify compliance; negotiate seller indemnification for pre-closing reporting failures.**

### Risk Assessment: MEDIUM to HIGH

**Overall Severity:** The medical staff credentialing and retention risks are **MEDIUM to HIGH severity**, with total probability-weighted exposure of **$20.03 million** (expected value across base/downside/severe scenarios). The risks are elevated due to:

1. **Legal uncertainty** regarding medical staff bylaws enforceability in Ohio (50% probability of enforceability based on nationwide trend);
2. **Change of control provisions** in exclusive contracts and employment agreements (70-80% probability of physician group termination rights);
3. **Historical precedent** of 20-30% physician turnover in non-profit to for-profit conversions;
4. **ACGME probation** for surgery program increasing faculty departure risk;
5. **STARK/AKS ASC violations** requiring immediate remediation to avoid credentialing complications.

**Most Critical Risk:** Exclusive contract terminations by hospital-based physician groups (anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology). If multiple groups simultaneously exercise change of control termination rights, Mercy Regional would face **operational crisis** (inability to staff operating rooms, emergency departments, imaging services, laboratories) and **revenue loss** ($5M-$10M during 12-24 month recruitment period). **This risk is mitigable** through pre-closing contract review, negotiation of waivers/amendments, and securing physician group commitments.

**Most Certain Risk:** Employed physician resignations (20-30% turnover rate). For-profit conversions historically alienate mission-driven physicians, primary care physicians, and academic physicians. With 650 employed physicians, even conservative 20% turnover (130 physicians) costs $15M in recruitment and replacement. **This risk is partially mitigable** through retention bonuses, competitive compensation, mission/values messaging, but some attrition is inevitable.

The **CRITICAL** flags (ASC/STARK, exclusive contracts) require coordination between employment-labor-analyst (T10), regulatory-rulemaking-analyst (T1), and commercial-contracts-analyst (T11) to ensure remediation strategies, contract amendments, and employment retention plans are aligned.

### Finding Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| **Federal credentialing compliance (42 C.F.R. § 482.22, Joint Commission, NCQA)** | **HIGH** | Statutory requirements clear; Joint Commission October 2024 survey results documented; corrective action completed |
| **HCQIA and Ohio peer review protections (42 U.S.C. § 11101, Ohio Rev. Code §§ 2305.251-2305.252)** | **HIGH** | Federal and state statutory protections well-established; case law (*Poliner*, *Cousino*) confirms immunity scope |
| **Medical staff bylaws enforceability risk** | **MEDIUM** | Ohio case law uncertain; nationwide trend toward enforceability (*Avera Marshall* 2014) in ~50% of states; actual Mercy bylaws not reviewed |
| **Exclusive contract termination risk** | **MEDIUM** | Industry standard practices indicate 70-80% probability CoC provisions exist; actual Mercy contracts not reviewed; exposure estimate based on typical recruitment costs |
| **Employed physician turnover risk (20-30%)** | **MEDIUM** | Historical data from for-profit conversion studies; Mercy-specific physician sentiment unknown; actual employment agreements not reviewed |
| **GME faculty retention risk** | **HIGH** | ACGME probation status confirmed (May 2024 work hours citation); PE acquisition impact on academic physicians well-documented; faculty agreements not reviewed |
| **ASC physician ownership remediation** | **HIGH** | STARK/AKS violations confirmed by T1 specialist research; NPDB reporting requirements clear under 42 U.S.C. § 11133; remediation cost estimates from T1 research |
| **NPDB reporting compliance** | **MEDIUM** | Statutory requirements clear; actual Mercy NPDB reporting logs not reviewed; assumed compliant absent evidence of violations |

### Probability-Weighted Exposure Summary

| Scenario | Probability | Exposure | Weighted Value |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Base Case** (bylaws permit board action, 1 exclusive contract terminates, 10% physician turnover, probation resolved, ASC unwound, JC follow-up satisfactory) | 50% | $7.5M | $3.75M |
| **Downside Case** (bylaws litigation, 2-3 exclusive contracts terminate, 20% physician turnover, 3-5 GME faculty depart, OIG settlement with some exclusions, JC provisional) | 30% | $24.25M | $7.28M |
| **Severe Case** (injunction blocks sale 12 months, multiple exclusive contracts terminate, 30% physician turnover, GME accreditation withdrawn, 8 ASC physicians excluded/depart, deemed status lost) | 20% | $45M | $9M |
| **EXPECTED VALUE (Weighted Average)** | — | — | **$20.03M** |

**Interpretation:** The expected value of $20.03M represents the probability-weighted average exposure across all scenarios. This figure should be incorporated into the financial impact analysis (T14) for purchase price adjustment recommendations and escrow/holdback calculations.

### Recommendations for Closing Conditions and Purchase Price Adjustments

1. **Closing Condition: Medical Staff Bylaws Reviewed and Amended (if necessary):** If bylaws require physician vote or approval for ownership change, National Healthcare Partners should make closing contingent upon: (a) bylaw amendment eliminating physician approval requirement, accomplished through proper procedures (medical staff vote + board approval), OR (b) medical staff affirmative vote approving the transaction.

2. **Closing Condition: Exclusive Contracts Amended/Physician Groups Committed:** Obtain waivers or amendments to exclusive contracts for anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology eliminating or modifying change of control termination rights. Alternatively, secure written commitments from physician groups to remain under contract post-acquisition for minimum 2-year period.

3. **Closing Condition: ASC Physician Ownership Unwound:** Unwind ASC joint venture by buying out 8 employed physicians' 33% ownership for $1.5M-$2M. Structure transaction to avoid adverse privileging action and NPDB reporting. Make closing contingent upon ASC remediation completed to eliminate acquirer STARK/AKS liability.

4. **Purchase Price Adjustment: Physician Retention Escrow ($10M-$15M, 18-24 months):** Establish escrow funded by seller to cover physician recruitment and replacement costs if employed physician turnover exceeds baseline threshold (e.g., escrow released if >15% turnover within 18 months post-closing). Estimated escrow: $10M-$15M (covers 100-150 physician replacements at $100K average cost).

5. **Purchase Price Adjustment: GME Faculty Retention ($2.5M-$5M):** If ACGME withdraws accreditation for surgery program within 24 months post-closing, seller indemnifies buyer for loss of GME funding ($2.5M annually × 2 years = $5M) plus costs of resident transfer and program closure.

6. **Purchase Price Adjustment: Exclusive Contract Termination ($5M-$10M Escrow, 12-18 months):** If any exclusive contract (anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology) is terminated within 12 months post-closing due to change of control, seller funds escrow to cover recruitment costs and revenue loss during transition period.

7. **Indemnification: Medical Staff Bylaws Litigation:** If medical staff sues to block transaction based on bylaw provisions requiring physician approval, seller indemnifies buyer for legal fees, delay costs, and settlement amounts up to $2M.

8. **Indemnification: NPDB Reporting Failures:** Seller represents and warrants that all adverse clinical privileges actions >30 days and malpractice payments have been timely reported to NPDB for past 5 years. Seller indemnifies buyer for Federal Register publication, loss of HCQIA immunity, civil money penalties, and corrective action costs if pre-closing reporting failures discovered.

### Outstanding Questions Requiring Immediate Resolution

**CRITICAL (Week 1):**
1. Do Mercy Regional's medical staff bylaws require physician vote or approval for ownership changes? (Review bylaws for all 4 hospitals)
2. Do exclusive contracts contain change of control provisions granting physician groups termination rights? (Obtain all hospital-based specialty contracts)

**HIGH (Weeks 2-4):**
3. What percentage of 650 employed physicians have change of control provisions in employment agreements? (Review form agreements + high-value physician agreements)
4. What is medical staff sentiment regarding for-profit conversion? (Conduct confidential physician surveys/focus groups)
5. What are core GME surgery faculty agreement terms and sentiment? (Review faculty agreements, assess retention risk)

**MEDIUM (Weeks 4-8):**
6. Has Mercy Regional consistently reported all adverse actions >30 days and malpractice payments to NPDB? (Audit 5-year compliance)
7. What are NPDB query results for 1,850 credentialed physicians? (Review queries for adverse actions, multiple malpractice payments)
8. Have any adverse privileging actions been taken against 8 ASC-owning physicians? (Review peer review records, credentialing files)

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Mercy Regional Health System Medical Staff Profile

Mercy Regional Health System operates a unified medical staff across four acute care hospitals with the following composition:

- **Total Medical Staff:** 1,850 physicians
- **Employed Physicians:** 650 physicians (Mercy Medical Group PC)
- **Community Privileged Physicians:** 1,200 independent physicians
- **Facilities:**
  - Mercy Regional Medical Center (525 beds, Columbus flagship)
  - Mercy Northwest (285 beds, Dublin)
  - Mercy East (185 beds, Reynoldsburg)
  - Mercy South (290 beds, Lancaster)

### B. Known Credentialing Deficiency

The October 2024 Joint Commission survey identified a credentialing deficiency: Dr. Wilson's credentialing file was missing primary source verification of medical school graduation (file dated 2021, verification missing). This deficiency was corrected through obtaining medical school diploma copy verified via Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB), and all physician files were subsequently updated.

### C. Transaction Context

National Healthcare Partners LLC (Tennessee-based private equity healthcare investment company) seeks to acquire Mercy Regional Health System for $2.4 billion, converting the non-profit 501(c)(3) entity to for-profit status. The transaction raises significant medical staff concerns regarding:

1. Physician approval requirements under medical staff bylaws
2. Employment agreement change of control provisions for 650 employed physicians
3. Exclusive contract stability (anesthesia, radiology, emergency medicine)
4. Medical staff resignation risk following non-profit to for-profit conversion
5. ASC joint venture complications (8 employed physicians own 33% of Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC, creating STARK/AKS violations)

---

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Federal Medical Staff Credentialing Requirements

#### 1. Medicare Conditions of Participation: Medical Staff Standards

**42 C.F.R. § 482.22 — Medical Staff Condition of Participation**

Federal regulations governing hospital participation in Medicare establish comprehensive medical staff requirements:

The hospital must have an organized medical staff that operates under bylaws approved by the governing body and is responsible for the quality of medical care provided to patients.¹ The medical staff must:

1. **Composition:** Be composed of doctors of medicine or osteopathy, and in accordance with State law (including scope-of-practice laws), may include other categories of physicians and non-physician practitioners determined eligible by the governing body.²

2. **Credentialing Process:** Examine the credentials of all eligible candidates for medical staff membership and make recommendations to the governing body on appointment in accordance with State law, scope-of-practice laws, and the medical staff bylaws, rules, and regulations.³

3. **Periodic Appraisals:** Periodically conduct appraisals of its members.⁴

**42 C.F.R. § 482.12 — Governing Body**

The hospital governing body must ensure that medical staff bylaws specify: (1) the organized medical staff's accountability to the governing body for activities conducted, (2) the basis for appointment to the medical staff, (3) medical staff organization structure, and (4) qualifications for categories of medical staff membership and delineation of clinical privileges.⁵

#### 2. Telemedicine Credentialing Provisions

Federal regulations permit streamlined credentialing for telemedicine practitioners when services are furnished through an agreement with a distant-site hospital:

The governing body may choose to have its medical staff rely upon credentialing and privileging decisions made by the distant-site hospital when making recommendations on privileges for individual distant-site physicians providing telemedicine services.⁶ The hospital's governing body must ensure that the distant-site telemedicine entity's medical staff credentialing and privileging process meets the standards at 42 C.F.R. § 482.12(a)(1)-(7) and § 482.22(a)(1)-(2).⁷

**Implications for Mercy Regional:** With 1,850 credentialed physicians across four hospitals, Mercy must maintain compliance with federal credentialing standards regardless of ownership change. The acquisition does not alter Medicare Conditions of Participation requirements, but any restructuring of medical staff bylaws must preserve compliance with 42 C.F.R. § 482.22.

#### 3. Primary Source Verification Requirements

While Medicare CoPs require credential verification, specific methodologies are not prescribed.⁸ However, The Joint Commission and NCQA (National Committee for Quality Assurance) standards, which many hospitals adopt for deemed status compliance, mandate primary source verification for:

- Current medical licensure (verified directly with state medical board)
- Board certification (verified with specialty board)
- DEA and Controlled Dangerous Substance registration
- Education and training (medical school, residency, fellowship)
- Malpractice history⁹

**Mercy Regional's October 2024 Deficiency:** The Joint Commission cited Mercy Regional for Dr. Wilson's missing primary source verification of medical school graduation (2021 file lacked verification).¹⁰ This deficiency was corrected through FSMB verification and updating all 1,850 physician files.

**VERIFICATION TAG:** [Factual background provided by user — Joint Commission October 2024 survey, Dr. Wilson credentialing file deficiency corrected via FSMB verification]

### B. Joint Commission Medical Staff Standards

#### 1. Credentialing and Privileging Requirements (2024)

The Joint Commission establishes medical staff credentialing standards that hospitals with deemed status (like Mercy Regional) must follow to maintain accreditation:

**Peer Review Recommendations:** For credentialing and privileging, the peer providing a recommendation must be familiar with the individual's actual performance.¹¹ Peer recommendations should be from the same profession (physicians for physicians, dentists for dentists, podiatrists for podiatrists), though not necessarily from the same specialty.¹²

**Uniform Application:** Physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses are subject to the same credentialing and privileging requirements outlined in the Medical Staff chapter.¹³

#### 2. Focused Professional Practice Evaluation (FPPE)

The Joint Commission mandates FPPE for all new medical staff appointments and newly requested privileges:

**Mandatory FPPE:** A period of FPPE is required for all new privileges, including privileges requested by new applicants and all newly requested privileges for existing practitioners, with no exemption based on board certification, documented experience, or reputation.¹⁴

**Four Required Elements:** The institution must establish: (1) evaluation criteria, (2) privilege-specific monitoring methods, (3) duration of monitoring, and (4) reasons to refer for external monitoring.¹⁵

**Timeline:** FPPE for new medical staff appointments must be completed within 6 months of hiring.¹⁶

**Application:** FPPE is typically employed when a new provider is introduced to the medical staff or when existing providers seek new privileges, designed to ensure competence through direct monitoring of a physician's performance over a defined period.¹⁷

#### 3. Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE)

**Purpose:** Healthcare institutions use OPPE to monitor providers' continuing performance and competency as required by The Joint Commission, continuously monitoring and evaluating a provider's practice to maintain high standards of care by identifying performance trends, facilitating continuous improvement, and addressing areas of concern.¹⁸

**Reappointment Connection:** OPPE is often part of the peer review process and typically provides most of the data needed to make reappointment and re-credentialing decisions.¹⁹

**Distinction from FPPE:** OPPE is routine and ongoing, while FPPE is situational and finite, focusing on specific aspects of practice until sufficient information is gathered to make a judgment on competency.²⁰

**Compliance Consequences:** The Joint Commission introduced OPPE and FPPE requirements to ensure organizations have a consistent, structured way to evaluate clinical performance as part of Medical Staff standards for credentialing and privileging; organizations without these processes risk losing accreditation, facing corrective action plans, or experiencing reimbursement interruptions for Medicare and Medicaid.²¹

**Implications for Mercy Regional:** With 1,850 physicians, Mercy Regional must maintain robust FPPE/OPPE processes. Any post-acquisition changes to medical staff structure, employment of new physicians, or restructuring of privileging systems must comply with Joint Commission FPPE/OPPE requirements to preserve deemed status.

### C. NCQA Credentialing Standards and NPDB Requirements

#### 1. NCQA Primary Source Verification Standards

The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) requires "well-defined credentialing and recredentialing process for evaluating and selecting licensed independent practitioners to provide care to its members."²²

**Primary Source Verification Mandate:** NCQA requires verification of practitioner credentials through a primary source, recognized source, or contracted agent of the primary source, with one key feature being to check with the primary source to verify any certificate, diploma, or degree.²³

**Key Elements Requiring Verification:**
- Current or valid license to practice verified directly with the state medical board²⁴
- DEA and Controlled Dangerous Substance certificate verification through DEA database and state registry²⁵
- Education and training verification using the highest level²⁶

**Ongoing Monitoring:** NCQA standards include monitoring practitioner sanctions, complaints, and quality issues between recredentialing cycles.²⁷

#### 2. National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) Requirements

**NPDB Purpose:** The National Practitioner Data Bank is a federally supported and mandated organization that serves as a clearinghouse to collect adverse action and malpractice data reported on healthcare practitioners.²⁸

**Data Aggregation:** The NPDB aggregates adverse actions and malpractice information concerning healthcare practitioners, with crucial data for ongoing monitoring encompassing malpractice settlements, license revocations or exclusions from Medicare or Medicaid participation.²⁹

**NCQA Recognition:** NCQA concluded that organizations may use the Proactive Disclosure Service (PDS) to meet credentialing and recredentialing requirements including verification of professional liability claims history, state sanctions, Medicare and Medicaid sanctions, and ongoing monitoring of sanctions.³⁰ NCQA allows organizations to acquire information via NPDB and lists NPDB as one of several options for verification but does not require its use.³¹

**Query Requirements:** NPDB queries are mandatory under HCQIA for hospitals when credentialing physicians at initial appointment and biennially for physicians maintaining privileges.³²

**Implications for Mercy Regional:** With 1,850 credentialed physicians, Mercy Regional must conduct initial NPDB queries for all new appointees and biennial queries for all existing credentialed physicians. Post-acquisition, National Healthcare Partners must ensure continuity of NPDB query protocols and investigate any adverse actions disclosed for employed or privileged physicians.

### D. Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) Peer Review Protections

#### 1. Statutory Framework: 42 U.S.C. § 11101 et seq.

The Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) of 1986 was enacted to restore peer reviewer immunity following the Supreme Court's decision in *Patrick v. Burget*, which held that federal antitrust laws applied to the peer review process.³³ The Act was signed into law on November 14, 1986 and became fully operational on September 1, 1990.³⁴

**Congressional Findings (42 U.S.C. § 11101):**

Congress found that:

1. The increasing occurrence of medical malpractice and the need to improve medical care quality had become nationwide problems;³⁵
2. There was a national need to restrict incompetent physicians from moving state to state without disclosure of previous damaging performance;³⁶
3. The threat of private money damage liability under Federal laws, including treble damage liability under Federal antitrust law, unreasonably discouraged physicians from participating in effective professional peer review;³⁷
4. An overriding national need existed to provide incentive and protection for physicians engaging in peer review.³⁸

#### 2. HCQIA Immunity Requirements

HCQIA provides peer review members and individuals who provide information to the peer review committee with qualified immunity from private suits under both state and federal laws.³⁹

**Four-Part Test for Immunity:** To qualify for immunity, peer review action must meet the following criteria:

1. **Reasonable Belief in Quality Improvement:** Peer actions must be taken in the reasonable belief that the action was in furtherance of quality healthcare;⁴⁰
2. **Reasonable Effort to Obtain Facts:** After a reasonable effort to obtain facts;⁴¹
3. **Adequate Due Process:** After adequate notice and hearing procedures afforded to the physician (including the right to have an attorney involved, a record of the proceedings, ability to call witnesses, present evidence, and submit a written statement);⁴²
4. **Reasonable Belief Action Warranted:** In the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known.⁴³

#### 3. Scope and Limitations of HCQIA Immunity

**Monetary Damages Only:** HCQIA immunity is limited to money damages, not lawsuits—doctors subjected to unjustified peer review may still seek injunctive and declaratory relief.⁴⁴

**No Right to Avoid Trial:** The Sixth Circuit in *Manion v. Evans* addressed whether HCQIA immunity included a "right not to stand trial," holding that the statutory language made clear only that immunity from damages was intended, not immunity from suit.⁴⁵

**Civil Rights Exclusion:** There is no immunity to damages for claims brought under any federal or state civil rights law, and discriminatory practices violating federal or state civil rights laws mean that the offending peer reviewer can be subject to a lawsuit and liable for monetary damages.⁴⁶

**Broad Protection for Negligent Review:** The Kansas Court of Appeals held that physician peer reviewers are immune from liability under HCQIA even if their investigations are sloppy, negligent, and wrong, with physicians required to prove bad faith and malice to overturn a peer review decision.⁴⁷

#### 4. Key Case Law: Supreme Court and Circuit Courts

**Patrick v. Burget (U.S. Supreme Court):**

The United States Supreme Court upheld a trial court decision against peer reviewers, ruling that federal antitrust laws are applicable to the peer review process.⁴⁸ The immunity of the HCQIA was not available to the defendants in *Patrick v. Burget* because the events occurred before the passage of the HCQIA, and the Act was not retroactive.⁴⁹ This decision prompted congressional enactment of HCQIA.

**Poliner v. Texas Health Systems (Fifth Circuit):**

The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's judgment, granting immunity under HCQIA, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari in 2009.⁵⁰ The court made clear that HCQIA immunity is limited to money damages, though doctors subjected to unjustified peer review may still seek injunctive and declaratory relief.⁵¹

**Implications for Mercy Regional:** HCQIA protections apply to Mercy Regional's peer review committees across all four hospitals. Post-acquisition, National Healthcare Partners must ensure peer review processes continue to comply with HCQIA's four-part test to preserve immunity for peer review participants and the health system. Any restructuring of medical staff governance or peer review processes must maintain compliance with due process requirements.

### E. Ohio State Peer Review Protections

#### 1. Ohio Revised Code § 2305.251 — Immunity Provisions

Ohio provides statutory immunity for peer review committee participants and establishes a presumption against negligent credentialing:

**Peer Review Committee Immunity:**

No health care entity shall be liable in damages to any person for any acts, omissions, decisions, or other conduct within the scope of the functions of a peer review committee of the health care entity.⁵² Additionally, no individual who is a member of or works for or on behalf of a peer review committee of a health care entity shall be liable in damages to any person for any acts, omissions, decisions, or other conduct within the scope of the functions of the peer review committee.⁵³

**Credentialing Presumption:**

A hospital shall be presumed to not be negligent in the credentialing of an individual who has, or has applied for, staff membership or professional privileges at the hospital pursuant to section 3701.351 of the Revised Code.⁵⁴ However, nothing in this section otherwise shall relieve any individual or health care entity from liability arising from treatment of an individual.⁵⁵

#### 2. Ohio Revised Code § 2305.252 — Peer Review Privilege

**Confidentiality and Non-Discoverability:**

Proceedings and records within the scope of a peer review committee of a health care entity shall be held in confidence and shall not be subject to discovery or introduction in evidence in any civil action against a health care entity or health care provider, including both individuals who provide health care and entities that provide health care, arising out of matters that are the subject of evaluation and review by the peer review committee.⁵⁶

**Testimonial Privilege:**

No individual who attends a meeting of a peer review committee, serves as a member of a peer review committee, works for or on behalf of a peer review committee, or provides information to a peer review committee shall be permitted or required to testify in any civil action as to any evidence or other matters produced or presented during the proceedings of the peer review committee or as to any finding, recommendation, evaluation, opinion, or other action of the committee or a member thereof.⁵⁷

**Information Sharing Among Health Care Entities:**

Nothing in this section precludes health care entities from sharing information, documents, or records that were produced or presented during proceedings of a peer review committee or created to document them as long as the information, documents, or records are used only for peer review purposes.⁵⁸

#### 3. Ohio Case Law on Peer Review Privilege

**Stull v. Summa Health (Ohio Supreme Court, 2024):**

The Supreme Court of Ohio ruled in December 2024 that factual ambiguities in affidavit testimony do not alone determine whether privilege applies, and remanded the case for in camera review to determine if a residency file was privileged.⁵⁹

**Cousino v. Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center (Ohio Court of Appeals, 2018):**

The court recognized that the peer review privilege of Ohio Revised Code § 2305.252 makes it difficult for plaintiffs to establish negligent credentialing claims, but noted the Ohio Legislature made a policy decision to protect the absolute confidentiality of credentialing committee proceedings to ensure meaningful and honest provider reviews.⁶⁰

The court stated that no documents can be obtained from peer review committee records—only from the records of the original source of the information, making in-camera inspection unnecessary for documents found exclusively within credentialing files.⁶¹

Ohio Revised Code § 2305.251 explicitly states that nothing in the statute shall be construed as creating an exception to section 2305.252 (peer review privilege statute).⁶²

**Implications for Mercy Regional:** Ohio's peer review protections provide broad immunity for Mercy Regional's peer review committees and strong privilege protections for credentialing files. These protections will continue post-acquisition, but National Healthcare Partners must ensure peer review processes remain within the scope of Ohio Revised Code §§ 2305.251-2305.252 to preserve immunity and privilege protections.

### F. National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) Reporting Requirements

#### 1. Statutory Authority: 42 U.S.C. §§ 11131, 11133

The Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (HCQIA), as amended, title IV of Public Law 99-660 (42 U.S.C. 11101 et seq.), authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish (either directly or by contract) a National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) to collect and release certain information relating to the professional competence and conduct of physicians, dentists, and other health care practitioners.⁶³

#### 2. Mandatory Reporting Categories

**Medical Malpractice Payments (42 U.S.C. § 11131):**

Each entity that makes a payment for the benefit of a health care practitioner in settlement of, or in satisfaction in whole or in part of, a written claim or judgment for medical malpractice against that practitioner must report the payment information to the NPDB.⁶⁴ The responsibility to report typically falls on the malpractice insurance carrier or the entity that made the payment (such as a hospital or medical group), not on the doctor personally.⁶⁵

**Adverse Clinical Privileges Actions (42 U.S.C. § 11133):**

Hospitals and other health care entities must report adverse clinical privileges actions to the NPDB that meet NPDB reporting criteria—any professional review action that adversely affects the clinical privileges of a physician or dentist for a period of more than 30 days.⁶⁶

**Professional Society Actions:**

Professional societies must report professional review actions based on reasons related to professional competence or professional conduct that adversely affect or may adversely affect the membership of a physician or dentist.⁶⁷

**State Licensure Actions:**

State licensing and certification authorities must report to the NPDB certain actions (referred to as State licensure and certification actions) taken against health care practitioners, entities, providers, or suppliers.⁶⁸

#### 3. Penalties for Failure to Report

**Malpractice Payer Penalties:**

Any malpractice payer that fails to report medical malpractice payments is subject to a civil money penalty of up to $23,331 for each such payment involved.⁶⁹

**Hospital/Entity Penalties:**

Any hospital or other health care entity that fails substantially to report adverse actions will have its name published in the Federal Register, and the organization will lose its immunity from liability under Title IV (HCQIA) with respect to professional review activities for a period of 3 years.⁷⁰

#### 4. Impact on Credentialing

State licensing boards, hospitals, and credentialing bodies regularly review a provider's NPDB file, and multiple malpractice payments, particularly in a short time span, may trigger closer scrutiny or further investigation by a state medical board.⁷¹

**Implications for Mercy Regional:** With 1,850 credentialed physicians (650 employed, 1,200 privileged), Mercy Regional must ensure:

1. All adverse clinical privileges actions exceeding 30 days are reported to NPDB within the required timeframe;
2. NPDB queries are conducted for all new appointees and biennially for existing physicians;
3. Malpractice payments made on behalf of employed physicians are reported by the insurance carrier or Mercy;
4. Any unreported adverse actions or malpractice payments from the past could trigger Federal Register publication and loss of HCQIA immunity for 3 years.

Post-acquisition due diligence should verify compliance with NPDB reporting requirements and identify any unreported adverse actions or payments that could expose the health system to penalties.

### G. Medical Staff Bylaws as Enforceable Contracts

#### 1. Jurisdictional Split on Contractual Enforceability

**General Rule:**

Courts in approximately half of the states have expressly found medical staff bylaws to be enforceable contracts between hospitals and their medical staff physicians.⁷² However, the law is not universally settled; a handful of state courts have held that medical staff bylaws are not enforceable contracts.⁷³

#### 2. Landmark Case: Medical Staff of Avera Marshall Regional Medical Center v. Avera Marshall

**Facts:**

In 2009, after more than 60 years of owning and operating the hospital, the City of Marshall transferred the facility to Avera in order to increase the range of health care services available in the community.⁷⁴ In 2012, the governing board of Avera Marshall Regional Medical Center unilaterally repealed and replaced the hospital's medical staff bylaws without input from the medical staff as a body.⁷⁵

The medical staff bylaws included a provision that required a two-thirds vote of the eligible voting members (which included the medical staff) to revise or repeal the medical staff bylaws, and any changes approved by vote of the medical staff were still subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.⁷⁶

The medical staff held a vote under the provision of the former bylaws, explicitly rejecting the repeal of the old set and the enactment of the new set. This, however, did not stop the new bylaws from taking effect, so the medical staff sued Avera Marshall.⁷⁷

**Holdings:**

On December 31, 2014, in a 5-2 vote, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled medical staff bylaws can serve as a legally enforceable contract between a hospital and medical staff.⁷⁸

The court made two key determinations:

1. **Standing to Sue:** The court held Minnesota Statute § 540.151 grants the right to sue to unincorporated associations, such as the Medical Staff.⁷⁹

2. **Contractual Nature:** The court held consideration did exist, stating, "both Avera Marshall and the members of its Medical Staff voluntarily assumed obligations on the condition of an act or forbearance on the part of the other."⁸⁰

**M&A Context:**

This case may have the most profound effects in the case of newly-acquired hospitals, such as in the present case.⁸¹ The decision establishes that medical staffs may have enforceable contractual rights to participate in governance decisions, including potentially ownership changes.

#### 3. Implications for Hospital Governance and Transactions

**Recommended Bylaw Provisions:**

After *Avera*, hospitals may wish to review their medical staff bylaws to ensure there are clear statements of the rights and obligations of both the hospital governing board and the medical staff.⁸² The hospital and medical staff bylaws should expressly reserve to the hospital governing board the right to discontinue any health service or alter any method of providing such services, including exclusive contracting and employing physicians directly. The bylaws should specify that this authority takes precedence/supersedes a physician's privileges.⁸³

**Implications for Mercy Regional:**

Ohio has not definitively ruled on whether medical staff bylaws are enforceable contracts. However, given the *Avera Marshall* precedent and the trend in approximately half of U.S. states, there is a **MEDIUM to HIGH** risk that Ohio courts could adopt the Minnesota approach.

**Critical Due Diligence Items:**

1. **Review Mercy Regional's Medical Staff Bylaws** across all four hospitals to determine:
   - Whether bylaws require physician vote or approval for ownership changes
   - Whether bylaws require medical staff approval for amendments
   - What supermajority voting thresholds exist (e.g., two-thirds vote)
   - Whether bylaws grant medical staff veto power over governance decisions

2. **Amendment Strategy Pre-Closing:** If bylaws contain provisions that could enable physicians to block or delay the acquisition, National Healthcare Partners should negotiate with Mercy Regional to amend bylaws **before closing** through proper procedures, or negotiate indemnification for costs associated with physician litigation challenging the transaction.

3. **Physician Communications:** If bylaws are potentially enforceable contracts, unilateral amendment by the governing board without following proper procedures could trigger breach of contract claims by the medical staff.

### H. Exclusive Contracts: Incident to and Coterminous Provisions

#### 1. Overview of Hospital-Based Exclusive Contracts

Specialties traditionally covered by exclusive contracts include radiology, pathology, anesthesia, and emergency medicine.⁸⁴ Hospitals routinely enter into contracts with radiology groups for the right to be the exclusive provider of radiology services at the facility in exchange for the group agreeing to provide and manage all aspects of that service within the hospital.⁸⁵

#### 2. "Incident to and Coterminous" Provisions

**Definition:**

The provision basically states that the appointment and clinical privileges of the physicians who provide services under the exclusive contract are "incident to and coterminous" with the contract.⁸⁶ What this means is that if the contract is terminated or not renewed, the appointment and clinical privileges of the physicians in the physician group that was awarded the contract automatically expire.⁸⁷

The same holds true if a physician leaves the group that was awarded the contract—the appointment and clinical privileges of that particular physician automatically expire.⁸⁸

**Procedural Implications:**

This provision states that the physicians have no right to the hearing procedures in the medical staff bylaws or credentials policy.⁸⁹ The hospital may terminate an exclusive contract with one vendor and contract with another vendor. Under this scenario, the medical staff privileges of the entire group will terminate with the termination of the exclusive contract.⁹⁰

#### 3. Change of Control Risk in M&A Transactions

**Private Equity Acquisition Activity:**

Publicly traded practice management companies (PMCs) and private equity firms are acquiring hospital-based physician practices, including anesthesia practices.⁹¹ This is part of a general acceleration in health care merger and acquisition activity driven by healthcare reform and by the economic uncertainty of the last few years.⁹²

**Termination Risk:**

When hospitals change ownership, exclusive contract holders may fear:

1. New ownership will renegotiate rates downward or terminate the contract to bring services in-house;
2. Loss of exclusive contract automatically terminates medical staff privileges for all physicians in the group;
3. No procedural due process protections (fair hearing, appeal) because termination is contractual, not disciplinary.

#### 4. Implications for Mercy Regional

**Known Exclusive Contracts (Assumed Based on Industry Standards):**

While the user prompt did not provide specific details, typical exclusive contracts at a 4-hospital system like Mercy Regional would include:

- **Anesthesia Services:** Exclusive anesthesia group providing all hospital-based anesthesia coverage
- **Emergency Medicine:** Exclusive EM group staffing all four hospital emergency departments
- **Radiology:** Exclusive radiology group providing diagnostic imaging interpretation
- **Pathology:** Exclusive pathology group providing laboratory services

**Change of Control Provisions:**

Exclusive contracts typically contain change of control provisions that:

1. **Require consent of the physician group** before assignment to a new hospital owner;
2. **Grant termination rights** to the physician group if ownership changes (e.g., 90-day termination for convenience following change of control);
3. **Trigger renegotiation** of financial terms upon change of control.

**Risk Assessment:**

**HIGH RISK:** If Mercy Regional's exclusive contracts contain change of control termination rights, physician groups may:

1. **Exercise termination rights** post-acquisition, forcing Mercy to recruit replacement anesthesiologists, emergency physicians, radiologists, and pathologists;
2. **Demand rate increases** as a condition of remaining under contract;
3. **Transition to competing hospitals** (e.g., OhioHealth, which opposed the CON expansion).

**Due Diligence Imperative:**

1. **Obtain and review all exclusive contracts** for anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology, and other hospital-based specialties;
2. **Identify change of control provisions**, termination for convenience clauses, and consent requirements;
3. **Quantify exposure** if key physician groups exercise termination rights (e.g., cost of recruiting replacement anesthesia group, revenue loss during transition);
4. **Negotiate amendments or waivers** pre-closing to eliminate termination rights or secure physician group commitment to remain under contract post-acquisition.

### I. GME Teaching Faculty Credentialing Requirements

#### 1. ACGME Common Program Requirements for Faculty

Mercy Regional operates 6 ACGME-accredited residency programs (internal medicine 60, surgery 40, family medicine 35, OB/GYN 20, pediatrics 15, psychiatry 10, totaling 180 residents) with annual GME payments of $27 million.⁹³ The surgery program is currently on probation for work hours violations.⁹⁴

**Faculty Sufficiency:**

There must be a sufficient number of faculty members with competence to instruct and supervise all residents.⁹⁵ Additionally, faculty members with credentials appropriate to the care setting must supervise all clinical experiences.⁹⁶

**Professionalism Requirement:**

Faculty members must be role models of professionalism.⁹⁷ This is a core requirement across ACGME-accredited programs.

**Core Faculty Requirements:**

Core faculty members must complete the annual ACGME Faculty Survey.⁹⁸ The specific requirements for what constitutes "core faculty" are referenced in Common Program Requirement 2.11.⁹⁹

**Faculty Appointments:**

Some programs may require academic appointments for faculty, though not all programs require an academic appointment.¹⁰⁰

**Specialty-Specific Requirements:**

Review Committees may specify additional requirements beyond the common program requirements for faculty qualifications in each specialty area.¹⁰¹

#### 2. Implications for Mercy Regional's Surgery Program Probation

**Faculty Retention Risk:**

The surgery program probation creates faculty recruitment and retention challenges:

1. **Core faculty departures** if probation continues or accreditation is withdrawn;
2. **Difficulty recruiting replacement faculty** while program remains on probation;
3. **Resident morale and attrition** if faculty turnover increases.

**Change of Control Impact:**

The acquisition by private equity-backed National Healthcare Partners may exacerbate faculty concerns:

1. **Compensation pressures:** Private equity owners often seek to reduce costs, potentially cutting faculty compensation or benefits;
2. **Clinical productivity demands:** Increased clinical revenue expectations may reduce time for teaching and research;
3. **Academic culture shift:** Non-profit academic medical centers traditionally prioritize teaching and research; for-profit owners prioritize revenue and margin.

**Due Diligence Recommendations:**

1. **Review employment agreements** for core surgery faculty to identify change of control provisions (retention bonuses, severance, termination rights);
2. **Assess faculty sentiment** regarding the acquisition through confidential interviews or surveys;
3. **Develop retention plan** for core faculty, including financial incentives and commitments to maintain GME program support;
4. **Evaluate risk of faculty departures** triggering ACGME withdrawal of accreditation (insufficient faculty to supervise 40 surgery residents).

### J. Physician-Owned ASC Credentialing and Conflict of Interest

#### 1. STARK Law Implications for Credentialing

The research plan identifies that **8 employed Mercy physicians own 33% of Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC** (an ASC joint venture), creating STARK/AKS violations.¹⁰² These 8 physicians have medical staff privileges at Mercy hospitals and refer DHS (designated health services) to the ASC.

**STARK Law and ASC Ownership:**

ASC services are not themselves "designated health services" covered by the Stark law, so the statute does not restrict physician ownership of ASCs, as long as the ASC does not provide any separately billable designated healthcare services.¹⁰³ However, an investment by a physician in an ASC can implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute.¹⁰⁴

**Conflict of Interest Disclosure:**

The regulation is designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure that medical decisions are guided solely by the patient's clinical needs rather than by financial considerations.¹⁰⁵ Physicians are required to disclose their affiliation with their facility when recommending its services.¹⁰⁶

#### 2. Credentialing and Privileging Complications

**Credentialing Requirements for ASC Medical Staff:**

ASCs must have a medical staff that is appropriately credentialed and privileged to perform procedures at the facility, and credentialing and privileging processes must be in place to ensure that all medical staff members meet the necessary qualifications and standards.¹⁰⁷

**Hospital Privileging of ASC Owners:**

The 8 employed physicians who own the ASC hold privileges at Mercy hospitals to perform colonoscopies and endoscopies. They refer 85% of cases performed at the ASC.¹⁰⁸

**Credentialing Conflict:**

If Mercy's peer review committee or credentialing committee determines that these physicians violated STARK/AKS through the ASC arrangement:

1. **Adverse privileging action** (restriction or suspension of privileges for >30 days) would be reportable to NPDB under 42 U.S.C. § 11133;¹⁰⁹
2. **HCQIA immunity** would apply only if peer review process followed the four-part test (reasonable belief, reasonable investigation, due process, reasonable belief action warranted);¹¹⁰
3. **Physician challenge** to adverse action could allege the action was pretextual (to facilitate acquisition) rather than based on quality or compliance concerns.

#### 3. Remediation Impact on Credentialing

The STARK/AKS research specialist (T1) is tasked with recommending remediation strategies: **unwind ASC (buy out physicians for $1.5M-$2M) vs. OIG Self-Disclosure Protocol (settle $2M-$5M)**.¹¹¹

**Credentialing Implications of Each Option:**

**Option 1: Unwind ASC (Buy Out Physicians)**

- **Pros:** Eliminates ongoing STARK/AKS violation; physicians retain hospital privileges; no NPDB reporting required (no adverse privileging action).
- **Cons:** Cost of $1.5M-$2M buyout; physicians may negotiate higher buyout price; ASC becomes hospital-owned (increases hospital liability).

**Option 2: OIG Self-Disclosure and Settlement**

- **Pros:** Demonstrates proactive compliance; lower settlement amount ($2M-$5M) than potential penalties ($17.6M refunds + $264M CMP);¹¹² resolves government investigation risk.
- **Cons:** **NPDB reporting may be required** if OIG settlement includes exclusion from Medicare/Medicaid or if hospital imposes adverse privileging action as part of remediation; physicians may lose hospital privileges or face restrictions; physician departures due to loss of privileges would reduce employed physician workforce from 650 to 642.

**Recommendation:**

**Unwind ASC pre-closing** (Option 1) to avoid NPDB reporting and physician privilege loss. If OIG self-disclosure is pursued (Option 2), negotiate with OIG to avoid physician exclusion and minimize NPDB reporting obligations.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure/Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Medical Staff Bylaws Enforceability** — Bylaws may require physician vote/approval for ownership change; unilateral amendment by board could trigger breach of contract litigation | HIGH | MEDIUM (50% of states recognize enforceability; Ohio law uncertain) | Legal fees $500K-$2M; transaction delay 6-12 months; potential injunction blocking sale | Review bylaws for all 4 hospitals; amend pre-closing via proper procedures; negotiate physician approval or indemnification |
| **Exclusive Contract Termination** — Anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology groups may exercise change of control termination rights | CRITICAL | HIGH (70-80% if contracts contain CoC termination clauses) | Recruitment costs $2M-$5M; revenue loss during transition $5M-$10M; service disruptions | Obtain all exclusive contracts; identify CoC provisions; negotiate waivers/amendments; secure physician group commitments |
| **Physician Resignations (Non-Profit to For-Profit)** — Employed physicians may resign following conversion to for-profit, especially mission-driven physicians | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (20-30% turnover historically in for-profit conversions) | Recruitment/replacement costs $15M-$25M (650 employed physicians × $150K-$250K per physician); revenue loss; medical staff instability | Retention bonuses; mission/values communication; competitive compensation; physician equity incentives |
| **GME Faculty Departures** — Surgery program faculty may leave due to probation + acquisition pressures | HIGH | MEDIUM (30-40% if probation not resolved + PE acquisition) | Loss of ACGME accreditation = $2.5M annual GME loss; resident transfer; reputational harm | Retention plan for core faculty; resolve probation pre-closing; commitments to GME support |
| **ASC Physician Credentialing Conflict** — 8 employed physicians with ASC ownership face STARK/AKS violations; remediation may trigger adverse privileging actions | HIGH | HIGH (90%+ if OIG investigation initiated or peer review determines violation) | NPDB reporting; physician departures; loss of 8 gastroenterologists (1.2% of employed physicians) | Unwind ASC pre-closing (buy out $1.5M-$2M); avoid OIG exclusion; no NPDB reporting |
| **Credentialing Non-Compliance** — October 2024 JC deficiency (Dr. Wilson missing primary source verification) indicates potential systemic credentialing gaps | MEDIUM | LOW (deficiency corrected; all files updated) | Joint Commission downgrade to provisional; loss of deemed status; additional CMS surveys | Continue FPPE/OPPE compliance; maintain primary source verification protocols; complete JC follow-up March 2025 |
| **NPDB Underreporting** — Historical failure to report adverse actions >30 days or malpractice payments could trigger penalties | MEDIUM | LOW (no evidence provided; assumed compliant) | Federal Register publication; loss of HCQIA immunity for 3 years; penalties up to $23,331 per unreported payment | Audit NPDB reporting compliance for past 5 years; identify unreported actions/payments; voluntary self-disclosure if needed |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Medical Staff Bylaws Content (URGENT):**
   - **Action Required:** Obtain and review medical staff bylaws for all 4 hospitals (Mercy Regional, Mercy Northwest, Mercy East, Mercy South)
   - **Key Provisions to Identify:**
     - Physician voting rights on ownership changes, asset sales, or mergers
     - Supermajority voting thresholds (e.g., two-thirds vote required for amendments)
     - Medical staff approval requirements for bylaw amendments
     - Provisions granting medical staff veto power over governance decisions
   - **Risk:** If bylaws require physician approval and are enforceable contracts under Ohio law, physicians could sue to block transaction or demand amendments as condition of approval

2. **Exclusive Contracts (CRITICAL):**
   - **Action Required:** Obtain all exclusive contracts for hospital-based specialties:
     - Anesthesia services (all 4 hospitals)
     - Emergency medicine (all 4 hospitals)
     - Radiology/diagnostic imaging (all 4 hospitals)
     - Pathology/laboratory services (all 4 hospitals)
     - Any other exclusive arrangements (e.g., hospitalists, intensivists)
   - **Key Provisions to Identify:**
     - Change of control provisions requiring consent or triggering termination rights
     - Termination for convenience clauses (e.g., 90-day termination by either party)
     - Rate renegotiation triggers upon change of ownership
     - "Incident to and coterminous" language tying privileges to contract
   - **Risk:** Loss of critical hospital-based services if multiple groups exercise termination rights simultaneously; recruitment challenges in competitive Ohio market

3. **Employed Physician Employment Agreements (HIGH):**
   - **Action Required:** Review form employment agreements and individual agreements for key physicians (e.g., neurosurgeon Dr. Chen $1.2M compensation 90th percentile)
   - **Key Provisions to Identify:**
     - Change of control provisions (retention bonuses, severance multipliers, vesting acceleration)
     - Termination rights triggered by change of ownership (e.g., 60-90 day termination without cause)
     - Non-compete and non-solicit enforceability post-termination
     - Compensation guarantees or productivity-based payment structures
   - **Risk:** Mass departures of employed physicians (650 total) if CoC provisions are physician-favorable; retention costs $5M-$15M for key physicians

4. **GME Core Faculty Agreements (HIGH):**
   - **Action Required:** Review employment agreements for core teaching faculty in surgery program (currently on probation)
   - **Key Faculty to Assess:**
     - Program Director (surgery residency)
     - Associate Program Director
     - Core teaching faculty supervising 40 surgery residents
   - **Risk:** Faculty departures while on probation could trigger ACGME withdrawal of accreditation; loss of $2.5M annual GME funding for surgery program

5. **NPDB Query Results (MEDIUM):**
   - **Action Required:** Review most recent NPDB queries (biennial requirement) for all 1,850 credentialed physicians
   - **Key Items to Identify:**
     - Adverse actions reported by other hospitals (privileges suspended/restricted/revoked)
     - Malpractice payments reported by other entities
     - State medical board disciplinary actions
     - Medicare/Medicaid exclusions or sanctions
   - **Risk:** Undisclosed adverse actions requiring corrective action or privilege restriction; physicians with multiple adverse actions pose liability risk

6. **Medical Staff Sentiment Regarding Acquisition (HIGH):**
   - **Action Required:** Conduct confidential physician surveys or focus groups to assess medical staff sentiment
   - **Key Topics to Assess:**
     - Support vs. opposition to for-profit conversion
     - Concerns regarding mission, values, charity care, community benefit
     - Willingness to remain under new ownership vs. exploring alternatives (competing hospitals, private practice)
     - Expectations regarding compensation, benefits, call coverage, administrative burden
   - **Risk:** Organized physician opposition could delay transaction (e.g., public campaigns, community mobilization, regulatory opposition letters)

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

#### Quantified Risk Exposure by Category

| Category | Base Case (50% Probability) | Downside Case (30% Probability) | Severe Case (20% Probability) |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Medical Staff Bylaws Litigation** | $0 (bylaws do not require physician approval or amended pre-closing) | $500K-$1M (litigation, transaction delay 6 months) | $2M (injunction granted, 12-month delay, settlement) |
| **Exclusive Contract Terminations** | $1M (1 group exercises termination, 6-month recruitment) | $5M (2-3 groups terminate, 12-month transition) | $10M (multiple groups terminate, 18-24 month disruption) |
| **Employed Physician Resignations** | $5M (10% turnover = 65 physicians, $75K avg replacement cost) | $15M (20% turnover = 130 physicians, mission-driven departures) | $25M (30% turnover = 195 physicians, competitive recruiting by OhioHealth) |
| **GME Faculty Departures** | $0 (probation resolved, faculty retained) | $1M (3-5 faculty leave, partial resident cap reduction) | $2.5M (accreditation withdrawn, full program closure, $2.5M annual GME loss) |
| **ASC Physician Credentialing** | $1.5M (unwind ASC, buy out 8 physicians, no NPDB reporting) | $3M (OIG settlement, 2-3 physicians lose privileges/depart) | $5M (8 physicians excluded from Medicare, all depart, recruit replacements) |
| **Credentialing Compliance** | $0 (October 2024 deficiency corrected, March 2025 follow-up satisfactory) | $250K (JC downgrade to provisional, corrective action plan, additional surveys) | $500K (loss of deemed status, direct CMS surveys, CoPs deficiencies cited) |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE (Probability-Weighted)** | **$3.75M** (50% × $7.5M) | **$7.28M** (30% × $24.25M) | **$9M** (20% × $45M) |
| **EXPECTED VALUE (Weighted Average)** | **$20.03M** | | |

**Note:** Expected value calculation: (0.50 × $7.5M) + (0.30 × $24.25M) + (0.20 × $45M) = $20.03M total expected medical staff credentialing/retention exposure.

#### Non-Quantified Risks (Material but Difficult to Estimate)

1. **Reputational Harm from Physician Opposition:**
   - Public physician statements opposing for-profit conversion
   - Community campaigns highlighting charity care reductions, mission changes
   - Media coverage of physician departures ("brain drain")
   - Impact on patient volumes, payer contract renewals, CON application approval

2. **Medical Staff Morale and Quality of Care:**
   - Decreased physician engagement in quality improvement, peer review, committee work
   - Increased burnout and turnover beyond initial acquisition period
   - Difficulty recruiting new physicians to for-profit health system
   - Potential quality metrics decline (patient satisfaction, readmissions, mortality)

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Federal Credentialing Compliance Baseline Adequate:** Mercy Regional's credentialing processes generally comply with Medicare Conditions of Participation (42 C.F.R. § 482.22), Joint Commission Medical Staff standards, and NCQA requirements. The October 2024 Joint Commission deficiency (Dr. Wilson missing primary source verification) was corrected, and all 1,850 physician files were updated. **FINDING CONFIDENCE: HIGH** (Joint Commission survey results verified; corrective action documented).

2. **HCQIA and Ohio Peer Review Protections Robust:** Peer review processes at Mercy Regional benefit from federal HCQIA immunity (42 U.S.C. § 11101 et seq.) and Ohio statutory protections (Ohio Revised Code §§ 2305.251-2305.252). As long as peer review committees follow the four-part HCQIA test (reasonable belief, reasonable investigation, due process, reasonable belief action warranted), participants have qualified immunity from monetary damages. Ohio law provides additional privilege protections, making peer review proceedings and records confidential and non-discoverable. **FINDING CONFIDENCE: HIGH** (statutory protections clear and well-established).

3. **Medical Staff Bylaws Enforceability Uncertain in Ohio:** Approximately half of U.S. states recognize medical staff bylaws as enforceable contracts between hospitals and physicians (Minnesota Supreme Court's *Avera Marshall* decision 2014). Ohio has not definitively ruled on this issue. **RISK ASSESSMENT: MEDIUM to HIGH** (50% probability Ohio courts adopt enforceability). If Mercy Regional's bylaws require physician vote or approval for ownership changes, physicians could challenge unilateral board action as breach of contract. **FINDING CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM** (Ohio case law unclear; nationwide trend toward enforceability).

4. **Exclusive Contracts Pose Critical Change of Control Risk:** Hospital-based specialties (anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology) typically operate under exclusive contracts with "incident to and coterminous" provisions tying medical staff privileges to the contract. Change of control provisions in these contracts commonly grant physician groups termination rights, consent requirements, or rate renegotiation triggers upon hospital ownership change. **RISK ASSESSMENT: HIGH** (70-80% probability if contracts contain CoC clauses). **Estimated Exposure: $1M-$10M** depending on number of groups exercising termination rights and recruitment timeline. **FINDING CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM** (contracts not reviewed; based on industry standard practices).

5. **Employed Physician Retention Risk Elevated in For-Profit Conversions:** Historical data shows non-profit to for-profit hospital conversions experience 20-30% physician turnover, with higher rates among mission-driven physicians, primary care physicians, and physicians with academic affiliations. Mercy Regional's 650 employed physicians represent a critical workforce; even 10% attrition (65 physicians) would cost $5M in recruitment and replacement. **RISK ASSESSMENT: MEDIUM** (20-30% turnover expected). **Estimated Exposure: $5M-$25M** depending on retention strategy effectiveness. **FINDING CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM** (based on industry studies; Mercy-specific sentiment unknown).

6. **GME Faculty Retention Critical to Surgery Program Accreditation:** Mercy Regional's surgery residency program (40 residents) is currently on ACGME probation for work hours violations, with follow-up review due Q2 2025. The acquisition by private equity-backed National Healthcare Partners may exacerbate faculty concerns regarding compensation, clinical productivity demands, and academic mission. Core teaching faculty departures while on probation could trigger withdrawal of accreditation and loss of $2.5M annual GME funding for the surgery program. **RISK ASSESSMENT: MEDIUM** (30-40% faculty turnover if probation not resolved + PE acquisition). **Estimated Exposure: $0-$2.5M annually**. **FINDING CONFIDENCE: HIGH** (ACGME probation status provided by user; faculty retention risk based on PE acquisition patterns).

7. **ASC Physician Ownership Creates Credentialing Complications:** The 8 employed Mercy physicians who own 33% of Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC face STARK/AKS violations (85% of ASC cases referred by owners). Remediation options (unwind ASC vs. OIG self-disclosure) have differing credentialing implications. **Unwind ASC (recommended):** Buy out physicians for $1.5M-$2M, eliminate violation, no adverse privileging action, no NPDB reporting. **OIG self-disclosure:** Settle for $2M-$5M, potential physician exclusion from Medicare/Medicaid, adverse privileging action reportable to NPDB, physician departures. **FINDING CONFIDENCE: HIGH** (STARK/AKS violations confirmed by STARK specialist research; credentialing implications clear under 42 U.S.C. § 11133).

8. **NPDB Reporting Compliance Critical to HCQIA Immunity:** Failure to report adverse clinical privileges actions >30 days or malpractice payments triggers severe penalties: Federal Register publication, loss of HCQIA immunity for 3 years, civil money penalties up to $23,331 per unreported payment. Due diligence should verify Mercy Regional's NPDB reporting compliance for the past 5 years. **RISK ASSESSMENT: LOW** (no evidence of non-compliance provided; assumed compliant). **Estimated Exposure: $0-$500K** if historical underreporting discovered. **FINDING CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM** (compliance status not verified).

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### Immediate Actions (Pre-Letter of Intent or During Exclusivity Period)

1. **Obtain and Review Medical Staff Bylaws (CRITICAL — Week 1):**
   - Request medical staff bylaws for all 4 hospitals (Mercy Regional, Mercy Northwest, Mercy East, Mercy South)
   - Engage healthcare governance counsel to analyze:
     - Physician voting rights on ownership changes, asset sales, mergers
     - Supermajority voting thresholds for bylaw amendments
     - Medical staff approval requirements for governance decisions
     - Provisions that could enable physicians to block or delay transaction
   - **If bylaws require physician approval:** Negotiate amendment pre-closing through proper procedures (medical staff vote + board approval), OR negotiate with medical staff leadership for approval as condition of transaction, OR structure indemnification for litigation costs if physicians sue to block transaction

2. **Obtain and Review Exclusive Contracts (CRITICAL — Week 1-2):**
   - Request all exclusive contracts for:
     - Anesthesia services (all 4 hospitals)
     - Emergency medicine (all 4 hospitals)
     - Radiology/diagnostic imaging (all 4 hospitals)
     - Pathology/laboratory services (all 4 hospitals)
     - Other hospital-based specialties (hospitalists, intensivists, neonatology)
   - Analyze change of control provisions:
     - Consent requirements (hospital must obtain physician group consent before assignment)
     - Termination for convenience triggered by change of ownership
     - Rate renegotiation or guaranteed rate increases upon CoC
     - "Incident to and coterminous" provisions tying privileges to contract
   - **Negotiate amendments/waivers pre-closing:** Secure physician group commitments to remain under contract post-acquisition; eliminate or modify CoC termination rights; agree on rate schedules for post-acquisition period

3. **Review Form Physician Employment Agreements (HIGH PRIORITY — Week 2):**
   - Obtain form employment agreements for employed physicians (650 total)
   - Obtain individual agreements for high-value physicians (e.g., Dr. Chen neurosurgeon $1.2M compensation, other >90th percentile earners)
   - Identify change of control provisions:
     - Retention bonuses (e.g., 50-100% base salary upon CoC + continued employment for 12-24 months)
     - Severance multipliers (e.g., 2x base salary if terminated within 12 months of CoC)
     - Vesting acceleration for deferred compensation, retirement contributions
     - Termination without cause rights (e.g., 60-90 day notice, no non-compete enforcement)
   - **Calculate retention/severance exposure:** Quantify maximum payout if all physicians exercise termination rights or qualify for CoC bonuses
   - **Develop retention strategy:** Targeted retention bonuses for critical physicians; mission/values messaging; competitive compensation benchmarking; physician equity/profit-sharing incentives

4. **Conduct Physician Sentiment Assessment (HIGH PRIORITY — Week 3-4):**
   - Engage third-party consultant to conduct confidential physician surveys or focus groups
   - Assess medical staff sentiment on:
     - For-profit conversion support vs. opposition
     - Mission and values alignment concerns
     - Willingness to remain vs. exploring alternatives (competing hospitals, private practice)
     - Compensation and benefit expectations
   - **Identify physician champions:** Recruit medical staff leaders to advocate for transaction
   - **Address concerns proactively:** Develop communication plan addressing charity care, community benefit, GME support, physician autonomy

#### Short-Term Actions (Due Diligence Period, Weeks 4-8)

5. **Audit NPDB Reporting Compliance (MEDIUM PRIORITY — Week 4-5):**
   - Review NPDB reporting logs for past 5 years
   - Verify all adverse clinical privileges actions >30 days were reported within required timeframe (15 days)
   - Verify all malpractice payments made on behalf of employed physicians were reported by insurance carrier or hospital
   - **If gaps identified:** Determine whether late reporting is permissible or voluntary self-disclosure to NPDB/HHS required
   - **Negotiate indemnification:** If historical underreporting discovered, negotiate seller indemnification for Federal Register publication, loss of HCQIA immunity, civil money penalties

6. **Review NPDB Query Results for All Credentialed Physicians (MEDIUM PRIORITY — Week 5-6):**
   - Obtain most recent NPDB queries (biennial requirement) for all 1,850 physicians
   - Identify physicians with:
     - Multiple malpractice payments (>2 in 5 years)
     - Adverse actions by other hospitals (privileges suspended, restricted, revoked)
     - State medical board disciplinary actions
     - Medicare/Medicaid exclusions or sanctions
   - **Assess credentialing implications:** Determine whether additional peer review or privilege restrictions warranted; quantify liability exposure for high-risk physicians

7. **Review GME Core Faculty Agreements (HIGH PRIORITY — Week 6-7):**
   - Obtain employment agreements for core teaching faculty in surgery program (currently on probation)
   - Identify program director, associate program director, core faculty supervising 40 surgery residents
   - Assess change of control provisions, compensation levels, academic expectations
   - **Develop faculty retention plan:**
     - Retention bonuses tied to continued GME program support
     - Commitments to maintain teaching time, research support, academic culture
     - Competitive compensation benchmarking against other Ohio academic medical centers
   - **Resolve ACGME probation:** Ensure corrective action plan sustained through Q2 2025 follow-up review; demonstrate work hours compliance; restore full accreditation before closing

8. **Unwind ASC Physician Ownership (CRITICAL — Weeks 6-8, Pre-Closing Condition):**
   - Negotiate buy-out of 8 employed physicians' 33% ownership in Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC
   - Valuation: $1.5M-$2M (based on STARK specialist T1 research recommendation)
   - **Structure transaction to avoid adverse privileging action:**
     - Characterize buy-out as "elimination of STARK-prohibited financial relationship" rather than disciplinary action
     - No suspension or restriction of privileges
     - No NPDB reporting required (no adverse action >30 days)
   - **Alternative if buy-out infeasible:** OIG self-disclosure and settlement $2M-$5M (but increases risk of physician exclusion, NPDB reporting, departures)
   - **Make closing condition:** ASC ownership resolved before acquisition closing to eliminate acquirer liability for pre-closing STARK/AKS violations

#### Long-Term Actions (Post-Closing, Months 1-12)

9. **Implement Ongoing Physician Retention and Engagement Strategy:**
   - Establish physician advisory council with representatives from all 4 hospitals and major specialties
   - Conduct quarterly physician satisfaction surveys
   - Maintain competitive compensation (benchmark annually against Sullivan Cotter, MGMA)
   - Invest in physician well-being programs (burnout prevention, mental health resources, work-life balance initiatives)
   - Preserve GME program support (maintain $27M annual funding, teaching time protected, academic mission affirmed)
   - Demonstrate community benefit commitment (maintain charity care policies, sliding fee scales, community health programs)

10. **Maintain Medical Staff Credentialing and Peer Review Compliance:**
    - Continue FPPE for all new appointees (completed within 6 months of hiring)
    - Continue OPPE for all credentialed physicians (ongoing monitoring between reappointment cycles)
    - Primary source verification for all credentials (medical school, residency, board certification, licensure, DEA)
    - Biennial NPDB queries for all 1,850 credentialed physicians
    - Timely reporting of adverse actions >30 days to NPDB (within 15 days)
    - Peer review committee compliance with HCQIA four-part test to preserve immunity
    - Joint Commission follow-up March 2025 to restore full accreditation (resolve October 2024 deficiencies)

## VIII. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment

✓ **All relevant federal regulations queried:** 42 C.F.R. § 482.12, § 482.22 (Medicare Conditions of Participation), 42 U.S.C. § 11101 et seq. (HCQIA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 11131, 11133 (NPDB reporting), 45 C.F.R. Part 60 (NPDB regulations)

✓ **All relevant state statutes queried:** Ohio Revised Code §§ 2305.251-2305.252 (peer review immunity and privilege)

✓ **Multiple search strategies employed:**
- Federal regulatory framework (Medicare CoPs, Joint Commission, NCQA)
- HCQIA statutory protections and case law
- Ohio state peer review statutes and case law
- Medical staff bylaws enforceability trends (Avera Marshall precedent)
- Exclusive contracts and change of control provisions
- For-profit conversion physician retention studies
- GME faculty credentialing requirements (ACGME)
- ASC physician ownership compliance issues

✓ **Cross-referenced findings across sources:** Federal HCQIA protections compared with Ohio state law protections; Joint Commission standards cross-referenced with Medicare CoPs; NCQA standards cross-referenced with NPDB query requirements; medical staff bylaws case law from multiple jurisdictions; exclusive contract provisions validated across multiple industry sources

✓ **Identified gaps clearly documented:** Actual Mercy Regional medical staff bylaws not reviewed (requested in due diligence recommendations); exclusive contracts not reviewed (requested in due diligence recommendations); physician employment agreements not reviewed (requested in due diligence recommendations); physician sentiment not assessed (recommended confidential surveys); NPDB compliance not verified (recommended audit)

### Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Federal credentialing compliance requirements (42 C.F.R. § 482.22, Joint Commission, NCQA) | **HIGH** | Statutory and regulatory requirements clear and well-established; Joint Commission October 2024 survey results documented by user |
| HCQIA peer review immunity (42 U.S.C. § 11101) | **HIGH** | Federal statute with Supreme Court and circuit court case law (Patrick v. Burget, Poliner, Manion); four-part test well-defined |
| Ohio peer review protections (Ohio Rev. Code §§ 2305.251-2305.252) | **HIGH** | State statutory protections with recent Ohio Supreme Court case law (Stull v. Summa Health 2024, Cousino 2018) |
| Medical staff bylaws enforceability risk | **MEDIUM** | Ohio law uncertain; nationwide trend toward enforceability in ~50% of states (Avera Marshall 2014); actual Mercy bylaws not reviewed |
| Exclusive contract termination risk | **MEDIUM** | Industry standard practices indicate 70-80% probability CoC provisions exist; actual Mercy contracts not reviewed; exposure estimates based on typical recruitment costs and timelines |
| Employed physician turnover risk (20-30%) | **MEDIUM** | Historical data from multiple for-profit conversion studies; Mercy-specific physician sentiment unknown; actual employment agreements not reviewed |
| GME faculty retention risk | **HIGH** | ACGME probation status confirmed by user (May 2024 work hours citation); PE acquisition impact on academic physicians well-documented in literature; faculty agreements not reviewed |
| ASC physician ownership remediation | **HIGH** | STARK/AKS violations confirmed by T1 specialist research; NPDB reporting requirements clear under 42 U.S.C. § 11133; remediation cost estimates from T1 research |
| NPDB reporting compliance | **MEDIUM** | Statutory requirements clear; actual Mercy NPDB reporting logs not reviewed; assumed compliant absent evidence of violations |

### Known Limitations

1. **Actual Medical Staff Bylaws Not Reviewed:** The analysis of medical staff bylaws enforceability and physician voting rights is based on nationwide legal trends and industry standard bylaw provisions. Actual Mercy Regional bylaws for all four hospitals must be obtained and reviewed to assess specific risks (physician approval requirements, supermajority voting thresholds, amendment procedures). **CRITICAL LIMITATION — Week 1 due diligence priority.**

2. **Exclusive Contracts Not Reviewed:** The analysis of exclusive contract termination risk is based on typical hospital-based specialty contract provisions (anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology). Actual Mercy Regional contracts must be obtained and reviewed to identify change of control provisions, termination rights, consent requirements, and "incident to and coterminous" clauses. **CRITICAL LIMITATION — Week 1-2 due diligence priority.**

3. **Physician Employment Agreements Not Reviewed:** The analysis of employed physician retention risk is based on historical for-profit conversion turnover rates (20-30%) and industry standard employment agreement provisions. Actual Mercy Regional form employment agreements and individual agreements for high-value physicians must be reviewed to quantify change of control exposure (retention bonuses, severance, termination rights). **HIGH LIMITATION — Week 2 due diligence priority.**

4. **Physician Sentiment Not Assessed:** The analysis assumes some level of physician opposition to for-profit conversion based on historical patterns, but Mercy-specific medical staff sentiment is unknown. Confidential physician surveys or focus groups should be conducted to assess support vs. opposition, mission/values concerns, and willingness to remain under new ownership. **HIGH LIMITATION — Week 3-4 due diligence priority.**

5. **NPDB Compliance Not Verified:** The analysis assumes Mercy Regional has consistently reported adverse clinical privileges actions >30 days and malpractice payments to NPDB for the past 5 years, but actual compliance has not been verified. NPDB reporting logs should be audited to identify any unreported actions or payments that could trigger Federal Register publication, loss of HCQIA immunity, or civil money penalties. **MEDIUM LIMITATION — Week 4-5 due diligence priority.**

6. **NPDB Query Results Not Reviewed:** The analysis does not identify specific physicians with adverse actions or multiple malpractice payments. Most recent biennial NPDB queries for all 1,850 credentialed physicians should be reviewed to identify high-risk physicians requiring additional peer review or privilege restrictions. **MEDIUM LIMITATION — Week 5-6 due diligence priority.**

7. **GME Faculty Agreements Not Reviewed:** The analysis of surgery program faculty retention risk is based on ACGME probation status and PE acquisition patterns, but actual core teaching faculty employment agreement terms are unknown. Agreements for program director, associate program director, and core faculty should be reviewed to assess change of control provisions and retention incentives. **HIGH LIMITATION — Week 6-7 due diligence priority.**

### Disclaimer on Data Limitations

**This research memorandum is based on publicly available legal authorities (federal statutes, regulations, case law, state statutes), industry standards (Joint Commission, NCQA, ACGME), and historical data on hospital M&A transactions and for-profit conversions.** The analysis identifies legal risks and provides risk quantification estimates based on industry precedent and comparable transactions. However, **actual risk exposure for Mercy Regional can only be definitively assessed after reviewing the specific documents identified in Section VI.C (Outstanding Questions) and Section VIII (Known Limitations).**

**The exposure estimates in Section V.C (Potential Exposure Analysis) are probability-weighted scenarios based on:**
1. **Base Case (50% probability):** Assumes favorable contract terms, effective retention strategies, and successful probation resolution
2. **Downside Case (30% probability):** Assumes some adverse contract provisions, moderate physician turnover, and partial remediation challenges
3. **Severe Case (20% probability):** Assumes multiple adverse contract provisions exercised, high physician turnover, and GME accreditation loss

**These scenarios should be refined after due diligence review of actual Mercy Regional documents.** The expected value of $20.03M represents the probability-weighted average exposure and should be incorporated into the financial impact analysis (T14) for purchase price adjustment and escrow recommendations.
