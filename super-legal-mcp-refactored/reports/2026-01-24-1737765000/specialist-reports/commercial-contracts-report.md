## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

National Healthcare Partners LLC's proposed $2.4 billion acquisition of Mercy Regional Health System (4 hospitals, 1,285 beds, $1.8B net patient revenue) presents substantial commercial contract change of control risks requiring comprehensive consent solicitation, physician retention strategies, and payer renegotiation. This specialist research identifies **$1.05B-$1.19B in annual contract value (52% weighted average of material contracts) requiring third-party consent** for assignment or triggering termination rights upon change of control.

The non-profit to for-profit conversion compounds these risks, as payers may eliminate "charity care premium" rates, physicians may depart due to cultural misalignment with private equity ownership, and vendors may exploit change of control leverage to demand rate increases or enhanced terms.

**Aggregate Exposure (Probability-Weighted NPV, 10-Year, 8% Discount):** $680M-$920M expected loss (28-38% of $2.4B purchase price), comprising:
- **Base Case (60% probability):** $392M-$528M NPV
- **Adverse Case (30% probability):** $1.01B-$1.37B NPV
- **Severe Case (10% probability):** $2.05B-$2.83B NPV

### Critical Findings

#### 1. Physician Retention Represents Most Critical Deal Risk: $140M-$370M Exposure

**Finding:** 650 employed physicians at Mercy Medical Group PC face significant retention risk post-acquisition. Industry data demonstrates private equity acquisitions increase physician turnover by **13 percentage points (from 9% baseline to 22%)**, driven by administrative burdens, loss of clinical autonomy, and financial performance pressures.

**Quantified Exposure:**
- **Base Case (13% turnover):** 85 physician departures × $1M replacement cost = $85M + $55M revenue disruption = $140M total exposure
- **Adverse Case (22% turnover):** 143 physician departures × $1M replacement cost = $143M + $77M revenue disruption = $220M total exposure
- **Severe Case (35% turnover):** 228 physician departures × $1M replacement cost = $228M + $142M revenue disruption = $370M total exposure

**Root Cause:** Physicians view private equity acquisitions as threats to clinical autonomy, driven by concerns over productivity metrics, cost reduction mandates, and departure of physician leadership. Post-announcement retention efforts have substantially lower success rates than pre-announcement retention agreements.

**Critical Mitigation:** Execute retention agreements with **all 650 physicians BEFORE public announcement**, structured as:
- **Retention bonus:** 50% of base salary (total pool: $113.75M)
- **Vesting:** 50% at closing, 50% at 36-month anniversary
- **Acceleration:** 100% vesting if terminated without cause or material adverse change to compensation/autonomy
- **Alternative tiered approach:** $96M-$145M pool (Tier 1: 75% salary for 50 high-value specialists, Tier 2: 50% for 200 specialists, Tier 3: 25% for 400 primary care)

**Supporting Authority:** Medical Economics, *Physician Turnover Surges in Private Equity-Acquired Practices* (2024) (reporting 13 percentage point turnover increase in PE-acquired practices); DailyPay, *Healthcare Turnover Rates [2024 Update]* (noting $1M average physician replacement cost).

**Ohio Non-Compete Limitation:** Ohio courts enforce physician non-competes only if no greater than necessary for employer's legitimate business interests, no undue hardship on employee, and not injurious to public. Recent Ohio appellate decisions refuse enforcement when "against public interest." **Retention strategy must assume non-competes unenforceable** for high-value specialists who can immediately compete in Columbus market. BMD LLC, *Status Update: Physician Noncompete Agreements in Ohio* (2024).

#### 2. Payer Contract Rate Renegotiation: $45M-$360M Annual Revenue Exposure

**Finding:** Mercy Regional's $1.8B net patient revenue (48% Medicare, 22% Medicaid, 24% commercial, 6% self-pay) faces rate renegotiation upon non-profit to for-profit conversion. An estimated **40-60% of payer contracts (midpoint 50%) require change of control consent**, representing $900M annual revenue subject to renegotiation.

The current healthcare payer contracting environment (2024-2025) is characterized by "contentious negotiations" as payers resist provider demands for 5-8% annual rate increases. Mercy's non-profit to for-profit conversion eliminates "charity care premium" justification for higher reimbursement rates.

**Quantified Exposure:**
- **Base Case (60% probability):** 2-3% rate reduction across 50% of contracts = $45M annual revenue loss
- **Adverse Case (30% probability):** 5-7% rate reduction across 60% of contracts = $108M annual revenue loss
- **Severe Case (10% probability):** Major payer (Anthem BCBS or UnitedHealthcare) terminates contract = $270M-$360M annual revenue loss (15-20% patient volume)

**Payer-Specific Risks:**
- **Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield:** Estimated $300M-$400M annual revenue (largest payer); anticipated demand: 3-5% rate reduction + 3-year rate lock
- **UnitedHealthcare:** Estimated $200M-$300M annual revenue; anticipated demand: 2-4% rate reduction + enhanced utilization management
- **Medicare Advantage (8 plans):** $180M annual revenue; CMS 2024 Final Rule establishes 45-day notice for primary care/behavioral health terminations, 30 days for other providers
- **Medicaid MCOs (5 plans):** $396M annual revenue; rates 85-95% of commercial, tightly regulated by Ohio Department of Medicaid

**Mercy Regional Negotiation Leverage:** As "must-have" hospital system with 4 facilities, 1,285 beds, and estimated 25-30% Columbus market share, Mercy maintains substantial negotiation leverage. Payers cannot easily exclude Mercy from networks without alienating employer groups and members. However, payers may accept narrow networks or tiered products disadvantaging Mercy.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Serve change of control notices to top 5 payers immediately following announcement (60-90 day notice periods commence)
- Negotiate consent terms Day 30-90: Offer 2% rate reduction + 5-year term extension + enhanced quality reporting
- **Acceptable concessions:** 2-3% rate reduction, 3-year rate lock, enhanced quality reporting, utilization management collaboration
- **Unacceptable concessions:** >5% rate reduction, network tier demotion (preferred → standard), exclusive network restrictions
- **Walk-away threshold:** Major payer termination requires litigation/arbitration or accept out-of-network status

**Supporting Authority:** AJMC, *Facts About Hospital-Insurer Contracting* (2024) (hospitals contract with 35-82 payers, mean 52 contracts); Healthcare Dive, *Why Medicare Advantage Contract Negotiations Are Getting Heated* (2024) ("spike" in contentious negotiations since 2022; typical health system needs 5-8% annual increase but sees 1-3%); Haas-Wilson & Garmon, *Hospitals Negotiating Leverage with Health Plans* (2011) ("must-have" hospitals with brand identity maintain strong leverage).

#### 3. Exclusive Service Contract Termination: $50M-$83M Contract Value at Risk

**Finding:** Exclusive physician service agreements covering anesthesia ($15M-$25M annually), radiology ($10M-$18M annually), emergency medicine ($12M-$20M annually), pathology ($5M-$8M annually), and hospitalist services ($8M-$12M annually) represent **$50M-$83M total annual contract value**. An estimated **70-90% (midpoint 80%) of exclusive service contracts require change of control consent**, representing $40M-$66M annual spend subject to renegotiation or termination.

Industry standard: "Medical staff privileges are tied to exclusive contracts; if physician leaves group providing exclusive services, privileges automatically terminate." Change of control triggers assignment provisions: "The issuance or transfer of a controlling interest in Center shall be deemed an assignment of this Agreement, unless the transferee has been first approved by Group, in writing."

**Quantified Exposure:**
- **Base Case (60% probability):** Exclusive service groups consent with 10% rate increase = $4M-$6.6M annual cost increase
- **Adverse Case (30% probability):** Exclusive service groups demand 15% rate increase OR one group terminates requiring replacement = $6.75M-$11.2M annual cost increase + 90-120 day service disruption
- **Severe Case (10% probability):** 3 of 5 groups terminate = $30M-$50M contract value at risk + 120-day service disruption + locum tenens coverage at 150-200% permanent staffing cost

**Replacement Timeline:** 90-120 days for recruiting national provider groups (TeamHealth, USPI, Envision for anesthesia; Radiology Partners for radiology; Vituity, Envision for ER; Sound Physicians, IPC for hospitalist), credentialing, and onboarding.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Serve change of control notices to all 5 exclusive service groups Day 0-30 (60-90 day notice periods)
- Negotiate consent terms Day 30-90: Offer 5-10% rate increase + 5-year term extension
- **Acceptable concessions:** 5-10% rate increase (fair market value adjustment), 5-year term, enhanced medical director fees
- **Unacceptable concessions:** >15% rate increase, reduced exclusivity, termination without cause rights
- **Replacement contingency:** Pre-identify national groups; overlap coverage for 30-60 days (both incumbent and replacement groups)

**Supporting Authority:** PYA, *Professional Services Agreements Between Physicians and Hospitals* (2024) (PSAs cover anesthesia, radiology, ER, pathology, hospitalist with 3-5 year terms); Credentialing Resource Center, *Synchronize Medical Staff Processes and Exclusive Contracts* (2024) (privileges tied to exclusive contracts terminate automatically); Progressive Surgical Solutions, *Anesthesia Agreement* (2016) (change of control deemed assignment requiring consent).

#### 4. 340B Contract Pharmacy Agreements: $4M-$20.5M Annual Savings at Risk

**Finding:** Mercy South Hospital qualifies as 340B covered entity (DSH hospital, $8.5M annual Medicare DSH payments, 28% Medicaid utilization, 32% low-income patient percentage), generating $12M annual 340B savings (purchasing $28M at ceiling price vs. $40M at WAC). Mercy South operates 8 contract pharmacy locations (CVS, Walgreens, Kroger), but faces **dual threats from manufacturer restrictions and change of control**.

**Manufacturer Restrictions (2024):**
- **Eli Lilly:** Effective July 1, 2024, single contract pharmacy limit (Ohio not exempt from policy); November 1, 2024, rebate/cash replenishment model implementation; November 15, 2024, lawsuit against HRSA
- **Sanofi:** October 1, 2024, requires claims data sharing via Second Sight Solutions' 340B ESP platform; ceases replenishment to non-participating contract pharmacies
- **HRSA proposed rule:** 6-pharmacy maximum (Mercy South currently has 8, must terminate 2)

**Change of Control Risk:** Contract pharmacy agreements may contain termination provisions triggered by hospital ownership change. HRSA compliance: "When contract pharmacy changes ownership, covered entity must submit new contract pharmacy registration to OPA, requiring termination of old contract arrangement and new registration using new ownership."

**Quantified Exposure:**
- **Base Case (70% probability):** Manufacturer restrictions ($3M-$5M) + reduce to 6 pharmacies ($1M-$2M) = **$4M-$7M annual savings loss**
- **Adverse Case (20% probability):** Contract pharmacies terminate due to change of control; 6-12 month renegotiation period = **$6M-$8M loss (50% of annual savings)**
- **Severe Case (10% probability):** Mercy South loses DSH eligibility due to for-profit conversion changing community benefit reporting = **$20.5M annual loss ($12M 340B savings + $8.5M Medicare DSH payments)**

**DSH Eligibility Preservation:** For-profit hospitals CAN qualify as DSH hospitals if Medicaid utilization thresholds met. Mercy South's 28% Medicaid utilization substantially exceeds 15% threshold, supporting continued eligibility.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Proactively reduce from 8 to 6 contract pharmacies before closing (terminate 2 lowest-volume pharmacies)
- Amend remaining 6 pharmacy agreements: Add change of control consent waiver ("Covered entity's change in ownership does not constitute assignment requiring pharmacy consent")
- Register new ownership with HRSA within 30 days of closing
- Confirm Medicaid utilization will remain ≥15% post-acquisition (Mercy South current: 28%)

**Supporting Authority:** HRSA, *Contract Pharmacy Services* (2024) (change of pharmacy ownership requires new registration); Jones Day, *Current Legal Landscape of 340B Drug Pricing Program* (Dec. 2025) (Eli Lilly July 1 and Nov. 1, 2024 restrictions, Nov. 15 HRSA lawsuit); NCSD, *340B Contract Pharmacy Guide* (Oct. 2021) (Sanofi Oct. 1 claims data requirement; Ohio not exempt from Lilly policy).

#### 5. ASC Joint Venture Operating Agreement: $1.5M-$2M Buyout + STARK/AKS Remediation

**Finding:** Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC joint venture (50% Mercy Regional, 50% physician-owners including 8 employed physicians) **violates STARK Law and Anti-Kickback Statute**. Task T1 (STARK/AKS compliance report) recommends unwinding via physician buyout ($1.5M-$2M) or OIG voluntary disclosure ($2M-$5M settlement).

**Change of Control Compounds Risk:** National Healthcare Partners' acquisition triggers ASC operating agreement change of control provisions, giving physician partners leverage to demand premium buyout pricing or withhold consent. ASC operating agreements typically provide: "The issuance or transfer of a controlling interest in [hospital partner] shall be deemed an assignment of this Agreement, unless the transferee has been first approved by [physician partners], in writing."

**Quantified Exposure:**
- **Base Case (50% probability):** Physician partners consent with retention bonuses ($50K-$100K per physician × 12 gastroenterologists = $600K-$1.2M) + buyout employed physician owners (8 physicians, 33% ownership = $1M-$1.3M FMV) = **$1.6M-$2.5M total**
- **Adverse Case (30% probability):** Physician partners demand premium buyout (10-20% above FMV = $1.65M-$2.4M) = **$2.25M-$3.6M total**
- **Severe Case (20% probability):** Physician partners refuse consent and terminate JV = Loss of $500K-$800K annual ASC profits + 85% of ASC case volume + $5M buyout dispute litigation = **$5.5M-$5.8M total**

**ASC Valuation:** Independent FMV appraisal required (ASA credentialed appraiser). Gastroenterology ASCs typically valued at 4x-6x EBITDA. Estimated total ASC value: $3M-$4M. Physician 50% interest: $1.5M-$2M.

**Two-Step Remediation Strategy (CRITICAL: Execute Before Announcement):**

**Step 1: Amend Operating Agreement (Consent to Change of Control)**
- Schedule Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC member meeting (Day -45)
- Propose amendment: "Change of control of hospital partner to National Healthcare Partners LLC is deemed approved by physician partners and does not constitute assignment requiring consent"
- Obtain written consent (requires supermajority 75% vote per operating agreement)
- Inducement: Retention bonuses to 12 gastroenterologists ($50K-$100K per physician, $600K-$1.2M total)

**Step 2: Buyout Employed Physician Owners (STARK Remediation)**
- 8 employed physicians hold 33% ownership ($1M-$1.3M FMV)
- Payment terms: Lump sum at closing OR installments over 3-5 years (reduces cash outlay)
- Replacement owners: 4 community (non-employed) gastroenterologists purchase divested interests at FMV
- **Eliminates STARK violation (employed physician ownership + referrals) AND change of control holdout risk**

**Alternative (if physician partners refuse consent):** Buyout ALL physician partners (50% = $1.5M-$2M), convert to 100% Mercy ownership, risk loss of physician alignment and referrals.

**Supporting Authority:** ACC, *Key Considerations for Hospital-Physician Joint Venture ASCs* (2024) (contributed assets must be appraised for FMV not taking into account referral volume; physicians must pay FMV based on recent and projected earnings); Becker's ASC, *9 ASC Joint Venture Operating Agreement Issues* (2024) (balancing governance requires supermajority board vote 75%); McGuireWoods, *OIG Advisory Opinion Allows ASC Joint Venture* (May 2021) (variable buy-in prices may generate prohibited remuneration).

#### 6. Epic EHR License Assignment: $1.5M-$100M Exposure (Low Probability, High Severity)

**Finding:** Epic Systems licenses are non-transferable without consent. Mercy Regional likely uses Epic (250+ million patient records housed in Epic globally). Annual maintenance/support: $15M-$25M. Change of control triggers assignment provisions requiring Epic consent.

**Quantified Exposure:**
- **Base Case (70% probability):** Epic consents with 5-10% pricing increase = **$750K-$2.5M annual cost increase**
- **Adverse Case (20% probability):** Epic demands 15-20% pricing increase + enterprise license surcharge (if National Healthcare Partners owns multiple Epic customers) = **$2.25M-$5M annual cost increase**
- **Catastrophic Case (10% probability):** Epic withholds consent and terminates license = Must migrate to Cerner, Meditech, or AllScripts = **$50M-$100M implementation cost + 18-24 month disruption**

**Epic Negotiation Leverage:** Epic has strong incentive to consent (retaining $15M-$25M annual recurring revenue customer). However, Epic may use consent leverage to:
- Renegotiate pricing (10-20% increase)
- Impose enterprise license terms (if National Healthcare Partners owns multiple health systems using Epic)
- Charge interfacility data sharing fees (exchange between Mercy Regional and other portfolio companies)

**Mitigation Strategy (CRITICAL: Engage Epic 90 Days Pre-Announcement):**
- Schedule meeting with Epic account executive (Day -90)
- Disclose planned acquisition under NDA
- Negotiate change of control consent terms:
  - **Objective:** Lock in current rates for 5 years OR accept 5-10% increase
  - **Acceptable concessions:** 5-10% rate increase, enterprise license with capped surcharge, interfacility data sharing fees
  - **Unacceptable concessions:** >20% rate increase, license termination
- Obtain written consent to assignment 60 days before closing
- **Budget $1.5M-$3M annual price increase as acceptable cost of consent**

**Catastrophic Scenario Contingency (if Epic terminates):**
- **Litigation:** Sue Epic for breach of contract (implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing), seek preliminary injunction preventing termination during litigation (6-12 months)
- **Settlement (likely outcome):** Epic consents with 15-20% rate increase vs. 10-20% without litigation (3-6 months)
- **EHR Migration (last resort):** Select Cerner, Meditech, or AllScripts; $50M-$100M implementation; 18-24 months timeline
- **This scenario is HIGHLY UNLIKELY** (Epic consent refusal would create precedent risk for Epic's entire M&A customer base)

**Supporting Authority:** SEC, *Exhibit 10.17 – Epic Systems License Agreement* (Oscar Health Form S-1) (Epic license "non-exclusive and non-transferable"; Epic will not materially reduce functionality without consent); Bacula Systems, *Epic in Healthcare* (2024) (250+ million patient records in Epic globally).

#### 7. GPO Membership Transition: $7.5M-$25M One-Time Cost (If Non-Profit GPO)

**Finding:** Mercy Regional's group purchasing organization participation provides access to negotiated pricing for medical supplies ($200M-$400M annual spend). GPO market leaders: Vizient (35% market share, 468,000+ staffed beds) and Premier (20% market share, 333,000+ staffed beds).

**For-Profit Conversion Risk:** "Some GPOs serve only not-for-profit hospitals, while others serve just proprietary facilities, and some serve a mix of the two." If Mercy participates in non-profit-only GPO (e.g., hospital-owned cooperative), conversion to for-profit status may require switching to different GPO.

**Quantified Exposure:**
- **Base Case (75% probability):** Mercy participates in Premier or Vizient (for-profit compatible); change of control notice required (30-60 days), consent not required = **$0 cost**
- **Adverse Case (25% probability):** Mercy participates in non-profit-only GPO; must switch to Premier or Vizient; transition timeline 90-120 days; loss of GPO pricing for transition period increases supply costs 15-25% = **$7.5M-$25M one-time cost**

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Identify Mercy Regional's primary GPO (Day -75)
- If non-profit-only GPO, pre-negotiate Premier or Vizient membership 90 days before closing
- Transition timeline: Premier transitions members within 90-120 days (industry standard)
- **Budget $10M-$15M one-time supply cost increase during transition if GPO switch required**

**Supporting Authority:** HSCA, *A Primer on Group Purchasing Organizations* (2018) (97% of non-profit hospitals participate in group purchasing; some GPOs serve only non-profit hospitals); Definitive Healthcare, *Top 10 GPOs by Staffed Beds* (2024) (Vizient 35% market share, Premier 20%); HSCA FAQ (2024) (hospitals commonly use multiple GPOs; Premier transitions members within 90-120 days).

#### 8. Medical Device/Pharmaceutical Vendor Contracts: $2.6M-$10M Annual Cost Increase

**Finding:** Medical device vendors ($50M-$100M annually) and pharmaceutical suppliers ($80M-$150M annually excluding 340B) represent $130M-$250M total annual spend. An estimated **30-50% (midpoint 40%) of vendor contracts require change of control consent**, representing $52M-$100M annual spend subject to renegotiation.

Healthcare vendor contract best practices: "Counsel should consider including language addressing possibility of change of control or assignment during contract negotiations." Vendors may use change of control as opportunity to renegotiate pricing upward.

**Quantified Exposure:**
- **Base Case (60% probability):** 40% of vendors renegotiate 5% pricing increase = **$2.6M-$5M annual cost increase**
- **Adverse Case (30% probability):** 50% of vendors renegotiate 10% pricing increase = **$6.5M-$12.5M annual cost increase**
- **Severe Case (10% probability):** Multiple key vendors (surgical equipment, implants) terminate contracts; must renegotiate at adverse terms or switch to alternative suppliers = **$10M-$15M one-time disruption cost**

**Vendor Categories Requiring Consent:**
- High-value medical device vendors (surgical equipment, implants, diagnostic devices): 50-70% require consent
- Pharmaceutical suppliers: 30-50% require consent
- Commodity suppliers (disposables, linens, food service): 10-20% require consent (typically notice only)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Serve change of control notices to vendors with contracts >$5M annually (Day 0-30)
- Negotiate consent terms: Offer 3-5 year term extensions in exchange for locked pricing
- **Acceptable concessions:** 5% pricing increase, 3-5 year term lock
- **Unacceptable concessions:** >10% pricing increase, shortened payment terms, enhanced indemnification

**Supporting Authority:** Holt Law, *Healthcare Vendor Agreements* (2024) (counsel should address change of control during contract negotiations); TAG Inc., *6 Essential Healthcare Supplier Contract Clauses* (2024) (contracts should include regulatory compliance, liability/indemnification, termination clauses).

**Probability-Weighted Expected Loss: $680M-$920M (28-38% of $2.4B purchase price)**

### Purchase Price Adjustment Recommendations

**Escrow for Contract Change of Control Risks:**
- **Amount:** $150M-$250M (6-10% of $2.4B purchase price)
- **Term:** 24-36 months post-closing
- **Release triggers:**
  - 80% of material payer contracts consented or renewed at rates within 5% of pre-closing rates
  - Physician turnover <15% in first 24 months post-closing
  - Exclusive service contracts consented or replaced without service disruption >30 days
  - Epic license assigned with pricing increase <15%
  - 340B program maintained with savings loss <$10M annually

**Purchase Price Reduction Negotiation:**
- **Base Case Adjustment:** $200M-$300M reduction (reflecting $392M-$528M NPV base case exposure, discounted 50% for probability-weighting and mitigation efforts)
- **Walk-Away Threshold:** If adverse case materializes during due diligence (e.g., Anthem BCBS indicates termination intent, Epic refuses consent, 20%+ physician departures announced), consider $400M-$600M price reduction or transaction termination

**Indemnification for Pre-Closing Contract Breaches:**
- Mercy Regional represents and warrants:
  - All material contracts (>$1M annual value) disclosed
  - No material contracts in default or breach
  - No material contracts contain change of control provisions prohibiting assignment (or list of exceptions provided)
  - All payer contracts in good standing with rates at or above market
- Indemnification cap: $100M (uncapped for fraud)
- Survival period: 24-36 months post-closing (extended to statute of limitations for tax and environmental)

### Critical Path Timeline

**Phase 1: Pre-Announcement (Days -90 to 0) - MOST CRITICAL**
- Day -90: Engage healthcare M&A counsel, Epic account executive
- Day -75: Identify GPO, conduct payer revenue concentration analysis
- Day -60: Draft physician retention agreements, conduct 340B contract pharmacy compliance review
- Day -45: Execute ASC operating agreement amendment and physician buyout
- Day -30: **Execute physician retention agreements with all 650 physicians** (THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION)
- Day 0: **PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT**

**Phase 2: Consent Solicitation (Days 0 to 90)**
- Day 0-30: Serve change of control notices (payers, exclusive service groups, Epic, GPO, vendors, contract pharmacies)
- Day 30-90: Negotiate consent terms with payers (target: 2-3% rate reduction, 3-year rate lock)
- Day 30-90: Negotiate consent terms with exclusive service groups (target: 5-10% rate increase, 5-year term)
- Day 60-90: Obtain written consents or negotiate contract amendments

**Phase 3: Consent Failures - Remediation (Days 90-180)**
- If major payer refuses: Arbitration/mediation (60-90 days) OR accept out-of-network status OR renegotiate at adverse terms
- If exclusive service group refuses: Recruit replacement providers (90-120 days credentialing) + locum tenens interim coverage
- If Epic refuses: Litigation + preliminary injunction (6-12 months) OR settle at adverse terms OR EHR migration (18-24 months)

**Expected Closing Timeline:**
- **Best case:** 120 days (if 90% consents obtained by Day 90)
- **Base case:** 150-180 days (if 10-20% consents require negotiation/remediation)
- **Worst case:** 270-365 days (if major payer or Epic withholds consent requiring litigation or alternative arrangements)

### Outstanding Questions Requiring Data Room Review

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISIONS IN HEALTHCARE CONTRACTS

#### 1. Prevalence in Healthcare Transactions

Change of control provisions are ubiquitous in healthcare commercial contracts, with significant implications for M&A transactions. Healthcare M&A due diligence requires careful attention to contract assignment rights, as overlooking anti-assignment, change-of-control, or "deemed assignment" provisions can derail a purchaser's integration strategy or force costly renegotiation under adverse conditions.¹

**State Regulatory Oversight (2024-2025):** At least 35 states mandate notification of proposed mergers, closures, or affiliations, with an increasing number requiring pre-closing approval for healthcare transactions affecting cost, quality, access, need, and competition.² States define "material transactions" broadly to include:
- Mergers with healthcare entities
- Acquisitions of healthcare entities
- Affiliation agreements or contracts
- Formation of partnerships, joint ventures, accountable care organizations, or management services organizations³

**Key Risk:** Where third-party contracts contain a change of control provision, one potential consequence is that following the purchase of the target, the supplier or customer chooses to terminate the contract and will no longer be required to perform its obligations.⁴ This creates substantial transaction risk in the Mercy Regional acquisition context, where a non-profit to for-profit conversion may trigger termination rights in multiple contract categories.

#### 2. Effective Change of Control Clause Components

Industry best practices for change of control provisions include:⁵
- **Clear Definitions:** Specifying the events that constitute a change of control (e.g., direct ownership transfer, indirect parent company sale, merger, asset sale)
- **Notice Periods:** Allowing adequate time for parties to adapt or respond (typically 30-90 days)
- **Consent Requirements:** Determining if prior approval is needed for certain changes
- **Termination Rights:** Including options for termination without liability if change of control occurs

**Physician Employment Context:** Retention bonuses tied to change of control events are increasingly common in healthcare M&A transactions. Example provisions include: "The Retention Bonus will vest and become non-forfeitable on the earlier of [date] or a Change of Control" and "The Executive will be eligible to receive a 'Retention Bonus' equal to 50% of their Base Salary due to a planned or unplanned Change in Control."⁶

#### 3. Contract Categories Requiring Third-Party Consent

Based on healthcare industry practice and legal precedent, the following contract categories typically contain change of control provisions requiring third-party consent:

**A. Payer Contracts (HIGH RISK - Estimated 40-60% Require Consent)**

Hospitals contract with many payers, ranging from 35 to 82 across sample hospitals, with a mean of 52 different contracts and 33 distinct payers.⁷ Payer contracts frequently contain assignment restrictions and change of control clauses, particularly:

- **Medicare Advantage contracts:** 8 plans with Mercy Regional (Humana, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Anthem, WellCare)
  - CMS 2024 Final Rule establishes 45-day notice period for primary care and behavioral health contract terminations, and 30 days for other providers⁸
  - Medicare Advantage plans are "basically pegged" to traditional Medicare payments, limiting negotiation leverage⁹
  - Material risk: Payers may use change of control as leverage to renegotiate rates downward

- **Medicaid Managed Care contracts:** 5 Ohio MCOs (CareSource, Molina, Paramount, Buckeye, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan)
  - Rates typically 85-95% of commercial rates⁹
  - State oversight: Ohio Department of Medicaid approval may be required for assignment

- **Commercial insurance contracts:** Blue Cross, Anthem, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare
  - Reimbursement rates 100-110% of Medicare FFS for facilities with market power⁹
  - Change of control provisions may allow termination or rate renegotiation
  - "Must-have" hospitals with strong brand identity have greater negotiation leverage¹⁰

**Exposure Analysis for Mercy Regional:**
- $1.8B net patient revenue: 48% Medicare ($864M), 22% Medicaid ($396M), 24% commercial ($432M)
- If 40-60% of payer contracts require consent, Mercy must obtain consent for contracts representing $720M-$1.08B in annual revenue
- Non-profit to for-profit conversion risk: Payers may demand rate reductions of 2-5% in exchange for consent, representing $14M-$54M annual revenue impact
- Renegotiation timeline: 60-90 days typical notice period may extend closing timeline

**[METHODOLOGY: Percentage estimates based on healthcare industry practice, absence of specific statistical data in public sources]**

**B. Physician Employment Agreements (CRITICAL - 100% Subject to Review)**

650 employed physicians at Mercy Medical Group PC represent the most critical retention risk. Industry data shows:

- **Private equity acquisition turnover:** Physician turnover increased by 13 percentage points (265% relative increase) post-acquisition in PE-backed healthcare transactions¹¹
- **Baseline turnover:** Non-PE-acquired practices experience ~9% annual physician turnover; PE-acquired practices see ~22% turnover post-acquisition¹¹
- **Turnover costs:** Averaging $1 million per physician departure (recruitment, credentialing, productivity ramp-up)¹²
- **Notice periods:** Healthcare industry standard is 60-90 days for termination without cause, with 90 days most common for physician employment agreements¹³

**Mercy Regional Physician Retention Exposure:**
- 650 employed physicians × 22% potential post-acquisition turnover = 143 physician departures
- 143 physicians × $1M turnover cost = $143M replacement cost
- Revenue impact: If high-value specialists depart (neurosurgery, orthopedics, cardiology), revenue loss could exceed $200M annually

**Retention Strategy Requirements:**
- **Retention bonuses:** Industry practice is 50% of base salary tied to change of control¹⁴
- 650 physicians × $350K average salary × 50% = $113.75M retention bonus pool
- **Acceleration provisions:** Sign-on bonus forgiveness clauses should not require repayment if employer terminates without cause or due to change in control¹⁴
- **Non-compete enforceability:** Ohio enforces physician non-competes only if: (1) no greater than necessary for employer's legitimate business interests, (2) no undue hardship on employee, (3) not injurious to public¹⁵
- **Public policy limitation:** Ohio courts refuse to enforce non-competes against physicians if "against public interest," and recent Ohio appellate decisions favor narrow geographic and temporal restrictions¹⁵

**Critical Finding:** Mercy Regional must execute retention agreements with key physicians BEFORE announcement to prevent departures. Without retention agreements, 13-22% physician turnover is probable, resulting in $140M-$220M in replacement costs and revenue disruption.

**C. Exclusive Service Contracts (HIGH RISK - Estimated 70-90% Require Consent)**

Exclusive physician service agreements covering anesthesia, radiology, emergency medicine, pathology, and hospitalist services are "sticky" contracts designed to maintain long-term relationships but contain significant change of control vulnerabilities.¹⁶

**Industry Standards:**
- **Covered specialties:** Radiology, pathology, anesthesia, emergency medicine (traditional exclusive services), plus hospitalists and intensivists¹⁷
- **Contract terms:** Initial terms 3-5 years with renewal and termination provisions closely scrutinized¹⁷
- **Termination linkage:** Medical staff privileges are tied to exclusive contracts; if physician leaves the group providing exclusive services, privileges automatically terminate¹⁸
- **Assignment restrictions:** "The issuance or transfer of a controlling interest in Center shall be deemed an assignment of this Agreement, unless the transferee has been first approved by Group, in writing."¹⁹

**Mercy Regional Estimated Exclusive Service Commitments:**
Based on $1.8B net patient revenue and industry standards:
- Anesthesia services: $15M-$25M annually
- Radiology services: $10M-$18M annually
- Emergency medicine: $12M-$20M annually
- Pathology services: $5M-$8M annually
- Hospitalist services: $8M-$12M annually
- **Total exclusive service contracts: $50M-$83M annually**

**Change of Control Risk:** If National Healthcare Partners (for-profit acquirer) triggers change of control provisions:
- Exclusive service groups may terminate contracts and seek alternative hospital affiliations
- Service disruption: 60-120 days to recruit replacement providers
- Rate renegotiation: Exclusive service groups may demand 10-20% rate increases in exchange for consent to assignment
- Stark Law/AKS compliance: New arrangements must comply with fair market value and commercial reasonableness standards

**Exposure:** $5M-$16.6M annual cost increase if exclusive service groups demand 10-20% rate increases; $50M-$83M total contract value at risk if groups terminate and cannot be replaced timely.

**D. Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) Agreements (MEDIUM RISK - Estimated 20-30% Require Notice)**

GPO agreements provide Mercy Regional with access to negotiated pricing for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and equipment. Industry data shows:

- **GPO participation:** 97% of not-for-profit, non-governmental hospitals participate in some form of group purchasing²⁰
- **Annual purchases:** Mercy Regional estimated $200M-$400M annually through GPO contracts
- **Market leaders:** Vizient (35% market share, 468,000+ staffed beds) and Premier (20% market share, 333,000+ staffed beds)²¹
- **Membership flexibility:** Hospitals commonly use multiple GPOs simultaneously and negotiate high-spend drugs directly with manufacturers²²

**GPO Contract Provisions:**
- **Termination grounds:** GPO agreements stipulate grounds for terminating member participation²³
- **Term and renewal:** Agreements specify duration, automatic renewal provisions, and notice requirements for voluntary termination²³
- **Rights upon termination:** GPO receives release of liability from member upon termination²³
- **Assignment restrictions:** If member hospital is acquired, GPO contracts may require notice but typically do not require affirmative consent (distinguishing GPOs from payer/physician contracts)

**For-Profit Conversion Impact:**
- **Non-profit GPO restrictions:** "Some GPOs serve only not-for-profit hospitals, while others serve just proprietary facilities, and some serve a mix of the two."²⁰
- **Mercy Regional risk:** If Mercy participates in non-profit-only GPO (e.g., hospital-owned cooperatives), conversion to for-profit status may require switching to different GPO
- **Transition timeline:** Premier transitions members within 90-120 days of contract execution²²
- **Pricing disruption:** Loss of GPO pricing for 90-120 days could increase supply costs by 15-25%, representing $7.5M-$25M one-time cost increase

**Exposure:** $7.5M-$25M one-time supply cost increase during GPO transition period if Mercy must switch from non-profit-only GPO to for-profit-compatible GPO.

**E. IT/EHR Contracts (MEDIUM RISK - Estimated 50% Require Consent)**

Electronic health record systems are mission-critical infrastructure, and EHR contracts contain restrictive assignment provisions. Mercy Regional likely uses Epic Systems (250+ million patient records housed in Epic globally).²⁴

**Epic Contract Provisions:**
- **Non-transferable license:** User rights described as "non-exclusive and non-transferable"²⁵
- **Consent requirement:** Epic will not materially reduce functionality without customer consent, but change of control likely triggers consent requirement for license assignment²⁵
- **Annual cost:** Epic implementations range $15M-$25M annually for maintenance, support, and licensing

**Change of Control Risk:**
- If National Healthcare Partners triggers change of control under Epic license agreement, Epic may:
  - Require consent and renegotiate pricing (potential 10-20% increase)
  - Impose additional terms related to multi-facility enterprise licensing
  - Require recredentialing and security reviews

**Exposure:** $1.5M-$5M annual cost increase if Epic renegotiates pricing; $15M-$25M total contract value at risk if Epic terminates license (forcing migration to alternative EHR, estimated $50M-$100M implementation cost).

**F. Medical Device and Pharmaceutical Vendor Contracts (MEDIUM RISK - Estimated 30-50% Require Consent)**

Healthcare vendor contracts increasingly address change of control scenarios:

**Industry Best Practices:**
- **Change of control language:** Healthcare counsel should consider including language addressing possibility of change of control or assignment during contract negotiations²⁶
- **Regulatory compliance:** Vendor agreements must adhere to HIPAA, Stark Law, and Anti-Kickback Statute to ensure transactions don't violate fraud and abuse laws²⁷
- **Liability and indemnification:** Contracts should make clear vendor assumes responsibility for defective products or subpar services²⁷
- **Termination clauses:** Every contract should include termination clause to protect organization from vendors not meeting expectations²⁷

**Mercy Regional Estimated Vendor Commitments:**
- Medical device vendors: $50M-$100M annually (surgical equipment, implants, diagnostic devices)
- Pharmaceutical suppliers: $80M-$150M annually (excluding 340B purchases, addressed separately below)

**Change of Control Risk:**
- 30-50% of vendor contracts require change of control consent (estimated 40% midpoint)
- Affected contracts: $52M-$100M annual spend requiring consent
- Vendor leverage: Suppliers may use change of control as opportunity to renegotiate pricing upward by 5-10%
- Consent timeline: 30-60 days typical notice and consent period

**Exposure:** $2.6M-$10M annual cost increase if 40% of vendors renegotiate pricing upward by 5-10% in exchange for change of control consent.

### B. NON-PROFIT TO FOR-PROFIT CONVERSION: CONTRACT IMPACTS

#### 1. Regulatory Framework

Multiple states require non-profit hospitals to apply for approval before converting to for-profit status, with over 20 states specifically addressing non-profit hospital conversions.²⁸ The attorney general typically reviews these transactions, and in some states, the health department must also review them.²⁸

**Conversion Process Considerations:**
- **Continued charity care:** Most hospitals include provisions for continued charity care and services in conversion agreements²⁸
- **Valuation transparency:** In most cases, neither non-profit nor for-profit parties provide complete contractual agreements or documents to support valuation estimates or proceeds²⁸
- **Material transactions:** Can include acquisition, assignment, sale or conveyance of assets, voting securities, membership/partnership interests, or transfer of control²⁹
- **Rate disclosure:** States may require disclosure when contracted commercial payer rate increases are anticipated²⁹

#### 2. Payer Contract Rate Renegotiation Risk

**Market Power and Negotiation Leverage:**

Large health systems with dominant market positions can negotiate rates 2-4 times higher than smaller competitors, while independent practices may receive reimbursements less than half of what hospital-owned practices earn for the same services.³⁰

"Must-have" hospitals with brand name identity serve as strong antidote to selective contracting and price competition, maintaining leverage in payer negotiations.³⁰

**Current Negotiation Climate (2024-2025):**
- **Contentious environment:** "Spike" in contentious negotiations since 2022 as providers demand higher reimbursements for workforce shortages, rising labor costs, and administrative expenses³¹
- **Rate increase needs:** Typical health system needs 5-8% annual rate increase across all payers to break even by 2027, but providers typically only see 1-3% increases over multi-year contracts³¹
- **Network exits:** Some providers reaching "breaking point" and severing ties with specific plans due to pandemic-induced inflation³¹

**Non-Profit to For-Profit Conversion Specific Risks:**

Payers may view for-profit conversion as opportunity to:
1. **Renegotiate preferential non-profit rates:** Some managed care agreements contain rate provisions tied to tax-exempt status
2. **Demand rate reductions:** Arguing for-profit entity should not receive "charity care premium" pricing
3. **Impose utilization management:** More aggressive prior authorization and utilization review
4. **Restrict network participation:** Move from "preferred" to "standard" network tier

**Mercy Regional Rate Renegotiation Exposure:**
- **Base scenario (60% probability):** Payers accept change of control with 2-3% rate reduction
  - $1.8B revenue × 2.5% average reduction = $45M annual revenue loss
- **Adverse scenario (30% probability):** Payers demand 5-7% rate reduction
  - $1.8B revenue × 6% average reduction = $108M annual revenue loss
- **Severe scenario (10% probability):** Major payer (e.g., Anthem Blue Cross) terminates contract
  - Loss of 15-20% patient volume = $270M-$360M annual revenue at risk

**[METHODOLOGY: Scenario probabilities based on expert judgment considering: (1) Mercy Regional's "must-have" status in Columbus market (4 hospitals, 1,285 beds, market share estimated 25-30%), (2) current contentious payer negotiation environment, (3) precedent of payers using M&A as leverage for rate concessions, (4) for-profit conversion eliminating charity care justification for rate premiums]**

#### 3. 340B Contract Pharmacy Agreements

**Background:** Mercy South Hospital qualifies as 340B covered entity (DSH hospital, $8.5M annual Medicare DSH payments, 28% Medicaid utilization, 32% low-income patient percentage). Mercy South operates 8 contract pharmacy locations (CVS, Walgreens, Kroger) registered with HRSA OPAIS. Annual 340B savings: $12M (purchasing $28M at 340B ceiling price vs. $40M at WAC).

**Change of Control Requirements:**

**HRSA Compliance:** "When a contract pharmacy changes ownership, the covered entity is required to submit a new contract pharmacy registration to OPA if the contract pharmacy arrangement is to be continued. This requires the termination in the database of the old contract arrangement and a new registration using the new ownership."³²

**Critical Distinction:** The HRSA requirement applies to contract pharmacy ownership changes, not covered entity (hospital) ownership changes. However, change of control of Mercy South Hospital may trigger:
1. **Contractual termination rights:** Contract pharmacy agreements may contain change of control clauses allowing pharmacy to terminate
2. **Manufacturer restrictions:** Eli Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and other manufacturers restrict 340B discounts to contract pharmacies
3. **For-profit eligibility:** Covered entity must maintain DSH status; for-profit conversion does not automatically disqualify DSH eligibility, but community benefit reporting changes may affect qualification

**Manufacturer Restrictions (2024 Update):**

**Eli Lilly:**
- Effective July 1, 2024: Lilly provides 340B priced products to only single contract pharmacy if entity lacks in-house pharmacy (requires claims data sharing)³³
- Effective November 1, 2024: Lilly implements rebate via cash replenishment model instead of upfront discounts³³
- November 15, 2024: Lilly sued HRSA over purported rejection of Lilly's plan³³
- **Ohio status:** Ohio is NOT exempt from Lilly's contract pharmacy policy (only AR, LA, MD, MN, MS, MO, KS exempt)³⁴

**Sanofi:**
- Sanofi ceased replenishment to contract pharmacy locations for entities not participating by October 1 in claims data sharing program via Second Sight Solutions' 340B ESP platform³⁴
- Requires covered entities share contract pharmacy claims data³⁴

**Impact on Mercy South:**
- Current: 8 contract pharmacies exceed proposed HRSA 6-pharmacy limit (if finalized)
- Manufacturer restrictions: $3M-$5M annual savings at risk from Eli Lilly, Sanofi, AstraZeneca restrictions on contract pharmacy 340B discounts
- Change of control risk: Contract pharmacies may terminate agreements citing change to for-profit ownership

**Mercy Regional 340B Contract Pharmacy Exposure:**
- **Base scenario (70% probability):** Mercy South maintains DSH eligibility and 340B covered entity status post-acquisition; must reduce from 8 to 6 contract pharmacies (HRSA proposed limit); manufacturer restrictions continue
  - Loss: $3M-$5M annually from manufacturer restrictions (already occurring)
  - Additional loss: $1M-$2M from reducing to 6 pharmacies (geographic access reduced)
  - **Total: $4M-$7M annual 340B savings loss**

- **Adverse scenario (20% probability):** Contract pharmacies terminate agreements due to for-profit change of control; Mercy South must renegotiate
  - Loss: 6-12 month renegotiation period with limited contract pharmacy access
  - Additional loss: $6M-$8M (50% of $12M annual savings during renegotiation period)

- **Severe scenario (10% probability):** Mercy South loses DSH eligibility due to change in community benefit reporting post-conversion
  - Loss: $12M annual 340B savings (total program loss)
  - Loss: $8.5M annual Medicare DSH payments
  - **Total: $20.5M annual loss**

**[METHODOLOGY: Scenario probabilities based on: (1) HRSA precedent allowing for-profit DSH hospitals if Medicaid utilization thresholds met, (2) manufacturer restriction litigation ongoing (PhRMA v. HHS), (3) contract pharmacy agreement standard termination provisions, (4) Mercy South's 28% Medicaid utilization supports continued DSH eligibility]**

### C. ASC JOINT VENTURE OPERATING AGREEMENTS

#### 1. Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC Structure

Based on task assignment, Mercy Regional operates physician joint venture ASC: Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC
- **Ownership:** 50% Mercy Regional, 50% physician-owners (12 gastroenterologists, includes 8 employed physicians)
- **Problem:** 8 employed physicians own 33% of ASC, receive $35K annual distributions, refer 85% of cases (DHS: colonoscopies, endoscopies)
- **STARK/AKS violations:** Addressed in separate regulatory-rulemaking-analyst report (Task T1)

**Change of Control Impact on Operating Agreement:**

#### 2. Standard ASC Joint Venture Operating Agreement Provisions

**Governance and Control:**
- **Balancing interests:** "The key is balancing governance and ownership so both parties feel enfranchised, with amendments to the original operating contract typically requiring a supermajority board vote of 75 percent or as defined by the agreement."³⁵
- **Hospital control:** "Hospitals often retain a majority or controlling interest in ASCs, which for non-profit hospitals may help support alignment with their charitable purpose and tax-exempt mission."³⁶
- **Physician trade-off:** "One of the largest appeals of a hospital joint venture is access to hospital contracts, but relinquishing majority control is the price physicians must pay."³⁶
- **Corporate partner interest:** "In joint ventures, the corporate partner typically invests in or acquires a minority or majority interest, ranging from 20% to 51%."³⁶

**Valuation Requirements:**
- **Fair market value:** "Any contributed assets must be appraised for fair market value, and the valuation should not take into account the volume or value of referrals made or business otherwise generated."³⁷
- **As-is valuation:** "When valuating an entity's contribution to a potential joint venture, participants must consider the value of each contribution as-is rather than the anticipated synergistic value, meaning taking into consideration current patient volume and reimbursement, not the expected volume and reimbursement resulting from the joint venture."³⁷
- **Physician buy-in:** "Physicians must pay fair market value for their ownership shares, determined based on recent and projected future earnings."³⁷

**Buyout and Exit Strategies:**
- **Dissolution provisions:** "The possibility that the venture will need to be unwound raises issues including determining the events that can cause dissolution, the procedure for effecting dissolution, and the events that automatically cause redemption of a partner's ownership interest."³⁸
- **Physician lock-in:** "Exiting or not renewing employment agreements is much easier for physicians than leaving a business in which they are an owner, as restrictive covenants of an ASC's operating agreement and the inability to sell their units at a favorable rate can provide substantial deterrents."³⁸

**Change of Control and Licensure:**
- **State law impact:** "The parties may need to consider the effect of state law 'change of ownership' rules, as in certain instances the sale of 50% or more of the ownership interests in a facility may impact licensure or certificates of need."³⁹

**OIG Compliance Considerations:**
- **Variable buy-in risk:** "Variable buy-in prices may mean returns on investment would vary, and the OIG determined in one negative advisory opinion that a hospital's investment in a mature ASC at an appreciated price could potentially generate prohibited remuneration."⁴⁰
- **Pass-through structure:** "The OIG has recognized that using a pass-through holding company where physicians would buy-in and buy-out at a holding company level may be supportable with some business advantages."⁴⁰

#### 3. Mercy Endoscopy Center Change of Control Scenarios

**Scenario A: Unwind ASC Joint Venture (Buy Out Physician Owners)**

Recommended in Task T1 STARK/AKS compliance report to remediate violations.

**Valuation:**
- 12 gastroenterologist owners hold 50% of Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC
- Estimated ASC value: $3M-$4M (based on revenue/EBITDA multiples for gastroenterology ASCs)
- Physician 50% interest: $1.5M-$2M buyout cost

**Operating Agreement Provisions:**
- **Fair market value appraisal required:** Independent valuation (ASA credentialed appraiser)
- **Payment terms:** Lump sum vs. installment payments over 3-5 years
- **Non-compete enforcement:** Ohio law limits physician non-competes; buyout agreement should include narrow geographic restriction (5-10 mile radius, 2-year term maximum)
- **Transition services:** Physician owners may be required to continue providing ASC coverage for 90-180 days during transition

**Timeline:** 120-180 days from valuation to closing (appraisal 60 days, negotiation 30-60 days, documentation 30-60 days)

**Scenario B: Maintain ASC Joint Venture with Amended Operating Agreement**

If National Healthcare Partners prefers to maintain physician alignment through ASC ownership:

**Required Amendments:**
1. **Employed physician buyout:** 8 employed physicians must divest their 33% ownership (STARK violation)
   - Buyout cost: $1M-$1.3M (33% of $3M-$4M valuation)
   - Replacement owners: 4 community (non-employed) gastroenterologists purchase divested interests
2. **Change of control consent:** Amend operating agreement to add:
   - "Change of control of hospital partner [Mercy Regional] to National Healthcare Partners LLC is deemed approved by physician partners"
   - "No deemed assignment or termination rights triggered by hospital partner change of control"
3. **Fair market value recertification:** Independent FMV opinion for amended ownership structure (Sullivan Cotter or comparable)

**Scenario C: ASC Operating Agreement Contains Change of Control Termination Right**

If Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC operating agreement contains standard change of control provision (likely):

**Provision:** "The issuance or transfer of a controlling interest in [Mercy Regional] shall be deemed an assignment of this Agreement, unless the transferee has been first approved by [physician partners], in writing."

**Physician leverage:**
- Physician partners may withhold consent unless:
  1. Buyout at premium valuation (10-20% above FMV)
  2. Guaranteed distributions for 5 years
  3. Expanded ownership percentage (50% → 60%)
  4. Enhanced management rights

**Exposure:** If physician partners refuse consent and terminate ASC joint venture:
- Loss of 85% of ASC case volume (cases referred by employed physician-owners)
- Mercy Regional loses $500K-$800K annual ASC profits (50% ownership interest)
- Gastroenterology physician recruitment required to replace referral volume

**Recommended Strategy:** Execute ASC operating agreement amendment BEFORE announcement of acquisition, obtaining written consent from physician partners in exchange for retention bonuses tied to 3-year post-closing commitment.

### D. MATERIAL CONTRACT CONSENT REQUIREMENTS: QUANTIFICATION

#### 1. Estimated Third-Party Consents Required

Based on research findings and healthcare industry standards:

| Contract Category | Annual Value | % Requiring Consent | Contracts Requiring Consent | Estimated Timeline |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Payer Contracts** | $1.8B revenue | 40-60% (midpoint 50%) | $900M revenue | 60-90 days notice + 30-60 days consent |
| **Physician Employment** | $230M-$780M compensation | 100% (retention agreements) | 650 physicians | Execute BEFORE announcement |
| **Exclusive Service Contracts** | $50M-$83M | 70-90% (midpoint 80%) | $40M-$66M | 60-90 days notice + 30-60 days consent |
| **GPO Agreements** | $200M-$400M | 20-30% (midpoint 25%) notice only | $50M-$100M | 30-60 days notice (no consent) |
| **IT/EHR (Epic)** | $15M-$25M | 50% | $7.5M-$12.5M | 60-120 days negotiation |
| **Medical Device/Pharma Vendors** | $130M-$250M | 30-50% (midpoint 40%) | $52M-$100M | 30-60 days notice + 30-60 days consent |
| **340B Contract Pharmacies** | $12M savings | 60-80% (midpoint 70%) | 6-8 pharmacies | HRSA registration update + 30 days pharmacy consent |
| **ASC Operating Agreement** | $1.6M Mercy profit share | 90% (standard provision) | Physician partners (12) | 60-90 days negotiation + buyout execution |
| **TOTAL** | **$2.5B-$3.6B** | **Weighted Average: 52%** | **$1.05B-$1.19B** | **Critical path: 120-180 days** |

**[METHODOLOGY: Percentage estimates based on: (1) change of control provision prevalence in published healthcare contract precedents, (2) healthcare attorney guidance emphasizing consent requirements for payer, physician, and exclusive service contracts, (3) industry practice distinguishing between "consent required" (payer, physician, exclusive service, IT/EHR, ASC) vs. "notice only" (GPO, commodity vendors) contract categories, (4) expert judgment in absence of published statistical surveys of healthcare contract change of control provisions]**

#### 2. Critical Path Timeline for Change of Control Consents

**Phase 1: Pre-Announcement (Days -90 to 0)**
- Day -90: Engage healthcare M&A counsel to review all material contracts for change of control provisions
- Day -60: Identify contracts requiring consent vs. notice only
- Day -45: Draft retention agreements for 650 physicians (execution before announcement critical)
- Day -30: Execute physician retention agreements (50% base salary bonuses, 3-year commitment, accelerated vesting if termination without cause)
- Day -15: Prepare change of control consent request packages for payers, exclusive service groups, Epic, ASC physician partners
- Day 0: **PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT**

**Phase 2: Consent Solicitation (Days 0 to 90)**
- Day 0-30: Serve change of control notices (60-90 day notice periods commence)
- Day 30-60: Negotiate consent terms with payers (rate adjustments, network tier, utilization management)
- Day 30-60: Negotiate consent terms with exclusive service groups (rate adjustments, term extensions)
- Day 30-90: Negotiate Epic license assignment (pricing, multi-facility enterprise terms)
- Day 60-90: Obtain written consents or negotiate contract amendments

**Phase 3: Consent Failures - Remediation (Days 90-180)**
- If major payer withholds consent: Negotiate alternative payer contract or accept out-of-network status (severe)
- If exclusive service group withholds consent: Recruit replacement providers (60-120 days)
- If Epic withholds consent: Negotiate extended transition or evaluate alternative EHR (catastrophic - $50M-$100M migration cost)
- If ASC physician partners withhold consent: Execute buyout or accept JV termination

**Expected Closing Timeline Impact:**
- **Best case:** 120 days (if 90% consents obtained by Day 90)
- **Base case:** 150-180 days (if 10-20% consents require negotiation/remediation through Day 150-180)
- **Worst case:** 270-365 days (if major payer or Epic withholds consent requiring litigation or alternative arrangements)

### E. ASSIGNMENT RESTRICTIONS: NON-PROFIT TO FOR-PROFIT CONVERSION

#### 1. Legal Framework for Contract Assignment

**General Assignment Principles:**

In M&A transactions, attention to contract assignment rights is indispensable as it illuminates whether the target's most valuable agreements can continue to be useful to the post-closing enterprise without triggering counterparty consent, default, termination, or diminution of value. Many commercial, intellectual-property, financing, and customer contracts contain anti-assignment, change-of-control, or "deemed assignment" provisions.⁴¹

**Healthcare-Specific Considerations:**

Material transactions can include the acquisition of healthcare entities, including the assignment, sale, or other conveyance of assets, voting securities, membership or partnership interests or the transfer of control.⁴²

**Tax-Exempt Bond Restrictions:**

Mercy Northwest Hospital financed by $420M tax-exempt revenue bonds (issued 2016, mature 2046, 4.25% rate). IRC § 141 private activity test: >10% private business use violates tax exemption. Post-acquisition, National Healthcare Partners (for-profit) ownership triggers:
- **Bond redemption requirement:** Bond indenture requires redemption at 102% = $428M
- **Refinancing at taxable rates:** 30-year taxable bonds at 6.5% vs. 4.25% = $27M vs. $18M annually = $9M additional annual interest expense⁴³

**Management Contract Safe Harbors:**

Part or all of facilities financed by Hospital Authority are sometimes managed or operated by for-profit companies, and safe harbor guidelines can be used to assure that such arrangements do not impair the tax exemption of obligations issued for such facilities.⁴⁴

**Potential Structuring Strategy:**
- National Healthcare Partners acquires 100% equity of Mercy Regional Health System
- Mercy Northwest Hospital remains titled in name of non-profit subsidiary (to preserve bond tax exemption)
- National Healthcare Partners enters management services agreement with non-profit subsidiary (within safe harbor guidelines)
- Avoids immediate $428M bond redemption and $9M annual interest increase
- **Requires bond counsel opinion and IRS private letter ruling**

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Payer Contract Rate Renegotiation** | HIGH | 80% | $45M-$108M annual revenue loss (2-6% rate reductions) | Execute payer consents before announcement; leverage "must-have" hospital status; accept 2-3% rate reduction as acceptable cost |
| **Physician Turnover Post-Acquisition** | CRITICAL | 60% | $140M-$220M (13-22% turnover × $1M replacement cost per physician) | Execute retention agreements BEFORE announcement; 50% salary bonuses; 3-year commitments; accelerated vesting protections |
| **Exclusive Service Contract Termination** | HIGH | 40% | $50M-$83M contract value; $5M-$16.6M rate increase (10-20%) if groups demand renegotiation | Obtain consents 60-90 days pre-closing; offer 3-5 year term extensions; fair market value rate adjustments only |
| **340B Contract Pharmacy Termination** | MEDIUM | 30% | $4M-$7M annual savings loss (manufacturer restrictions + HRSA 6-pharmacy limit); worst case $20.5M (DSH eligibility loss) | Maintain DSH eligibility; reduce to 6 contract pharmacies proactively; execute new pharmacy agreements with change of control consent waivers |
| **Epic EHR License Assignment Refusal** | HIGH | 20% | $15M-$25M contract value; $1.5M-$5M annual increase if renegotiated; catastrophic $50M-$100M if must migrate to alternative EHR | Engage Epic 90 days pre-announcement; negotiate enterprise license pricing; obtain written consent 60 days pre-closing |
| **ASC Joint Venture Physician Partner Holdout** | MEDIUM | 50% | $1M-$1.3M premium buyout (10-20% above FMV); $500K-$800K annual profit loss if JV terminates | Execute ASC operating agreement amendment before announcement; offer retention bonuses to physician partners; alternative: buyout at FMV + retention bonus |
| **GPO Membership Termination (Non-Profit to For-Profit)** | MEDIUM | 25% | $7.5M-$25M one-time supply cost increase during 90-120 day transition to for-profit GPO | Identify Mercy's current GPO; if non-profit-only (e.g., hospital cooperative), pre-negotiate Premier or Vizient membership before closing |
| **Medical Device/Pharma Vendor Rate Increases** | MEDIUM | 60% | $2.6M-$10M annual cost increase (40% of vendors renegotiate 5-10% upward) | Negotiate consent packages in advance; lock in rates for 3-5 years; accept 5% increase as acceptable cost |
| **Major Payer Contract Termination** | CRITICAL | 10% | $270M-$360M annual revenue (15-20% patient volume if Anthem or UnitedHealthcare terminates) | Pre-negotiate with top 3 payers (Anthem, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna); offer rate concessions; leverage "must-have" status; litigation/arbitration if necessary |
| **State Transaction Review Denial (Ohio)** | LOW | 5% | Deal-blocking if Ohio Attorney General or Ohio Department of Health finds transaction harms competition, access, cost, quality | File pre-closing notice with Ohio AG; demonstrate community benefits; commit to charity care continuation; political engagement with Governor/state legislators |

- **Review for:** Redemption provisions (change of control triggering mandatory redemption at 102%), private activity test compliance, management services agreement safe harbor parameters, covenant requirements

#### 2. Payer Contract Concentration Risk

Mercy Regional's revenue concentration with top 3 payers creates significant negotiation leverage imbalance:

- **Medicare (48% revenue = $864M):** Non-negotiable government program rates, but Medicare Advantage plans (10% = $180M) subject to contract termination
- **Medicaid (22% revenue = $396M):** Ohio Medicaid MCO contracts (CareSource, Molina dominant) may contain change of control approval requirements
- **Commercial top 3 (estimated 20% revenue = $360M):** Anthem BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna concentration creates "must obtain consent" critical path

**Red Flag:** If Anthem BCBS represents >15% of revenue ($270M+), Anthem may use consent leverage to demand:
- 5-10% rate reduction
- 3-year rate freeze
- Enhanced utilization management (prior authorization expansion)
- Network tier demotion (preferred → standard tier, reducing patient volume 10-15%)

**Investigation Required:** Request payer revenue concentration analysis from Mercy Regional CFO:
- Top 10 payers by revenue
- Top 5 payers by patient volume
- Payer mix by hospital (Regional, Northwest, East, South)
- Medicare Advantage plans by carrier (identify plan-specific contracts requiring consent vs. CMS direct contracts not requiring consent)

#### 3. Physician Employment Agreement Non-Compete Enforceability (Ohio)

Ohio's physician non-compete enforceability standards create retention risk post-acquisition:

**Ohio Enforceability Test (BMD LLC 2024):**¹⁵
1. No greater than necessary for employer's legitimate business interests
2. No undue hardship on employee
3. Not injurious to public

**Recent Ohio Case Law:**¹⁵
- Ohio appeals court refused to enforce non-compete against physician as "against public interest"
- "Restrictive covenants are disfavored in the law, and this measure of disfavor is especially acute concerning restrictive covenants among physicians, which affect the public interest to a much greater degree"
- Courts favor narrow drafting: specialized services in limited geographic area (5-10 mile radius) for limited time (1-2 years)

**Red Flag for Mercy Regional:**
- If Mercy's 650 physician employment agreements contain broad non-competes (e.g., 25-mile radius, 3-year term, all medical specialties), Ohio courts may refuse enforcement
- Post-acquisition physician departures may not be restrained by non-competes
- Neurosurgery, orthopedics, cardiology high-value specialists may immediately compete within Columbus market

**Investigation Required:**
- Review non-compete provisions in standard physician employment agreement and specialty-specific agreements
- Identify physicians with broad vs. narrow non-competes
- Assess enforceability risk under Ohio standards
- Plan retention strategy assuming non-competes unenforceable (retention bonuses, equity incentives, clinical leadership opportunities)

#### 4. Exclusive Service Contract Physician Privilege Linkage

Industry standard: "Medical staff privileges are tied to exclusive contracts; if physician leaves the group providing exclusive services, privileges automatically terminate."¹⁸

**Red Flag Scenario:**
- Mercy Regional terminates exclusive contract with current anesthesia group
- Contracts with new anesthesia group (e.g., acquirer's preferred national group)
- All anesthesiologists in terminated group lose medical staff privileges automatically
- Service disruption: 30-60 days to credential new anesthesia group
- Surgical volume impact: Elective surgeries canceled/diverted during transition

**Investigation Required:**
- Review medical staff bylaws for privilege linkage provisions
- Identify exclusive service contracts with automatic privilege termination
- Assess credentialing timelines for replacement provider groups (90-120 days typical)
- Plan transition strategy if exclusive service groups refuse change of control consent (overlap coverage, temporary privileges for incumbent group during transition)

#### 5. Epic EHR License Assignment - Multi-Facility Enterprise Pricing Risk

Epic Systems licenses are non-transferable without consent.²⁵ National Healthcare Partners' acquisition of Mercy Regional may trigger:

**Potential Epic Negotiation Demands:**
- **Enterprise license surcharge:** If National Healthcare Partners owns multiple health systems using Epic, Epic may demand "enterprise license" pricing premium (10-20% above single-system pricing)
- **Interfacility data sharing fees:** Epic charges for data exchange between Epic instances across different health systems
- **Implementation services for integration:** If National Healthcare Partners requires Mercy Regional Epic instance integration with other portfolio company Epic instances, Epic may charge $5M-$15M professional services fees

**Red Flag:** If National Healthcare Partners owns 5+ health systems and Mercy Regional is 6th, Epic may view acquisition as opportunity to renegotiate entire portfolio to enterprise pricing model, affecting not just Mercy Regional but all portfolio companies.

**Investigation Required:**
- Identify all National Healthcare Partners portfolio companies using Epic (vs. Cerner, Meditech, AllScripts)
- Assess Epic's enterprise licensing policies for private equity-backed multi-system owners
- Engage Epic account executive 90 days pre-announcement to negotiate consent terms
- Alternative: Budget $1.5M-$5M annual Epic price increase as acceptable cost of change of control consent

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

#### 1. Aggregate Contract Change of Control Exposure

| Scenario | Probability | Annual Impact | One-Time Impact | NPV Impact (10-Year, 8% Discount) |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **BASE CASE** | 60% | $57M-$75M annual losses | $10M-$25M one-time costs | $392M-$528M |
| **ADVERSE CASE** | 30% | $145M-$195M annual losses | $30M-$60M one-time costs | $1.01B-$1.37B |
| **SEVERE CASE** | 10% | $290M-$400M annual losses | $100M-$150M one-time costs | $2.05B-$2.83B |

**Base Case Assumptions (60% probability):**
- Payer rate reductions: 2-3% across 50% of contracts = $45M annual revenue loss
- Physician turnover: 13% (143 physicians) = $143M one-time replacement cost, but mitigated by retention bonuses ($114M) = net $29M over 3 years = $10M annual
- Exclusive service rate increases: 10% across 80% of contracts = $4M-$6.6M annual cost increase
- 340B savings loss: $4M-$7M annual (manufacturer restrictions + 6-pharmacy limit)
- GPO transition: $7.5M-$25M one-time cost (mitigated to $10M-$15M with advance planning)
- Vendor rate increases: 5% across 40% of contracts = $2.6M-$5M annual cost increase
- **Total Base Case: $57M-$75M annual + $10M-$25M one-time = NPV $392M-$528M**

**Adverse Case Assumptions (30% probability):**
- Payer rate reductions: 5-7% across 60% of contracts = $108M annual revenue loss
- Physician turnover: 22% (143 physicians) = $220M one-time replacement cost, partially mitigated by retention bonuses = net $106M over 3 years = $35M annual
- Exclusive service rate increases: 15% across 90% of contracts = $6.75M-$11.2M annual cost increase
- 340B program loss: $12M annual (full savings loss due to contract pharmacy terminations + manufacturer restrictions)
- Epic EHR rate increase: 20% = $3M-$5M annual cost increase
- GPO transition disruption: $20M-$30M one-time cost
- Vendor rate increases: 10% across 50% of contracts = $6.5M-$12.5M annual cost increase
- ASC JV buyout premium: $300K-$400K one-time cost (20% above FMV)
- **Total Adverse Case: $145M-$195M annual + $30M-$60M one-time = NPV $1.01B-$1.37B**

**Severe Case Assumptions (10% probability):**
- Major payer termination: Anthem BCBS terminates, loses 20% patient volume = $360M annual revenue loss
- Physician mass exodus: 35% turnover (228 physicians) = $228M replacement cost + $150M revenue disruption = $50M annual
- Exclusive service group terminations: 3 of 5 groups terminate = $30M-$50M contract value at risk, 120-day service disruption
- Epic license termination: Must migrate to Cerner or Meditech = $75M-$100M one-time implementation cost
- 340B DSH eligibility loss: $20.5M annual (340B savings + Medicare DSH payments)
- ASC JV termination: Physician partners refuse consent, terminate = $1.6M annual profit loss + $5M buyout dispute litigation
- **Total Severe Case: $290M-$400M annual + $100M-$150M one-time = NPV $2.05B-$2.83B**

**[METHODOLOGY: Scenario probabilities based on: (1) Mercy Regional "must-have" hospital status in Columbus market (4 hospitals, 25-30% market share, strong brand recognition) supporting base case 60% probability that most consents obtained with modest rate concessions, (2) contentious payer negotiation environment 2024-2025 supporting 30% probability of adverse outcomes requiring significant rate reductions or one major payer termination, (3) severe case 10% probability reflecting low but non-zero risk of multiple simultaneous consent failures (major payer + Epic + physician exodus) creating compounding harm, (4) NPV calculated using 8% discount rate reflecting acquirer's cost of capital and 10-year time horizon for annualized losses]**

#### 2. Purchase Price Adjustment Recommendations

**Escrow for Contract Change of Control Risks:**
- **Amount:** $150M-$250M (6-10% of $2.4B purchase price)
- **Term:** 24-36 months post-closing
- **Release triggers:**
  - 80% of material payer contracts consented or renewed at rates within 5% of pre-closing rates
  - Physician turnover <15% in first 24 months post-closing
  - Exclusive service contracts consented or replaced without service disruption >30 days
  - Epic license assigned with pricing increase <15%
  - 340B program maintained with savings loss <$10M annually

**Purchase Price Reduction Negotiation:**
- **Base Case Adjustment:** $200M-$300M reduction (reflecting $392M-$528M NPV base case exposure, discounted 50% for probability-weighting and mitigation efforts)
- **Walk-Away Threshold:** If adverse case materializes during due diligence (e.g., Anthem BCBS indicates termination, Epic refuses consent, 20%+ physician departures announced), consider $400M-$600M price reduction or transaction termination

**Indemnification for Pre-Closing Contract Breaches:**
- Mercy Regional represents and warrants:
  - All material contracts (>$1M annual value) have been disclosed
  - No material contracts in default or breach
  - No material contracts contain change of control provisions prohibiting assignment
  - All payer contracts in good standing with rates at or above market
- Indemnification cap: $100M (uncapped for fraud)
- Survival period: 24-36 months post-closing (extended to statute of limitations for tax and environmental)

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

**1. Ubiquitous Change of Control Provisions Create Significant Transaction Risk**

An estimated 52% of Mercy Regional Health System's material contracts (weighted average across all contract categories) contain change of control provisions requiring third-party consent or triggering termination rights. This represents $1.05B-$1.19B in annual contract value requiring consent solicitation, with a critical path timeline of 120-180 days from announcement to consent completion.

The non-profit to for-profit conversion compounds this risk, as payers, physicians, and vendors may view the transaction as an opportunity to renegotiate rates, impose enhanced terms, or terminate unfavorable arrangements.

**2. Physician Retention Represents the Most Critical Deal Risk**

650 employed physicians at Mercy Medical Group PC are the linchpin of Mercy Regional's clinical operations and revenue generation. Industry data demonstrates that private equity acquisitions increase physician turnover by 13 percentage points (from 9% baseline to 22% post-acquisition), driven by administrative burdens, loss of clinical autonomy, and financial performance pressures.

**Quantified exposure:** 143-228 physician departures (22-35% turnover) would result in $140M-$370M in replacement costs and revenue disruption. This exposure dwarfs all other contract change of control risks combined.

**Critical mitigation:** Retention agreements must be executed BEFORE public announcement. Post-announcement retention efforts have substantially lower success rates, as physicians who decide to leave often do so within 90-180 days of transaction announcement.

**3. Payer Contract Rate Renegotiation is Highly Probable and Material**

The current healthcare payer contracting environment (2024-2025) is characterized by "contentious negotiations" as payers resist provider demands for 5-8% annual rate increases while providers face workforce shortages, rising labor costs, and inflation. Hospitals are "reaching a breaking point" and severing ties with specific plans.

Mercy Regional's non-profit to for-profit conversion eliminates the "charity care premium" justification for higher reimbursement rates. Payers will likely demand 2-6% rate reductions in exchange for change of control consent, representing $45M-$108M annual revenue impact.

**Mercy Regional's negotiation leverage:** As a "must-have" hospital system with 4 facilities, 1,285 beds, and estimated 25-30% Columbus market share, Mercy Regional maintains substantial negotiation leverage. Payers cannot easily exclude Mercy from their networks without alienating employer groups and members. However, leverage is not absolute—payers may accept narrow networks or tiered products that disadvantage Mercy.

**4. 340B Contract Pharmacy Agreements Face Dual Threats: Manufacturer Restrictions and Change of Control**

Mercy South Hospital's $12M annual 340B savings are under attack from:
- **Manufacturer restrictions:** Eli Lilly (effective July 1, 2024, single contract pharmacy limit) and Sanofi (October 1, 2024, claims data sharing requirement) have imposed restrictions eliminating $3M-$5M in annual savings
- **HRSA proposed rule:** 6-pharmacy maximum (Mercy South currently has 8) would require termination of 2 contract pharmacies
- **Change of control risk:** Contract pharmacy agreements may contain termination provisions triggered by hospital ownership change

**Worst-case scenario:** Loss of DSH eligibility due to for-profit conversion would eliminate $20.5M annually ($12M 340B savings + $8.5M Medicare DSH payments). However, for-profit hospitals can qualify as DSH hospitals if Medicaid utilization thresholds are met, and Mercy South's 28% Medicaid utilization supports continued eligibility.

**5. ASC Joint Venture Must Be Unwound to Remediate STARK/AKS Violations**

The Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC joint venture (50% Mercy Regional, 50% physician-owners including 8 employed physicians) violates STARK Law and Anti-Kickback Statute. Task T1 (STARK/AKS compliance report) recommends unwinding the joint venture through physician buyout ($1.5M-$2M) or OIG voluntary disclosure ($2M-$5M settlement).

**Change of control compounds STARK/AKS risk:** National Healthcare Partners' acquisition triggers ASC operating agreement change of control provisions, giving physician partners leverage to demand premium buyout pricing or withhold consent. If physician partners refuse consent and terminate the joint venture, Mercy loses $500K-$800K annual ASC profits and 85% of ASC case volume.

**Recommended strategy:** Execute ASC operating agreement amendment AND physician buyout BEFORE acquisition announcement, eliminating both STARK/AKS violation and change of control holdout risk simultaneously.

**6. Epic EHR License Assignment Represents Catastrophic Risk if Consent Withheld**

Epic Systems' license agreements contain non-transferability provisions requiring consent for assignment. While Epic typically consents to change of control in healthcare M&A transactions, Epic may use consent leverage to renegotiate pricing (10-20% increase = $1.5M-$5M annually) or impose enterprise license terms.

**Catastrophic scenario:** If Epic withholds consent and terminates license, Mercy Regional must migrate to alternative EHR (Cerner, Meditech, AllScripts) at a cost of $50M-$100M implementation expense plus 18-24 month disruption.

**Mitigation:** Engage Epic account executive 90 days pre-announcement to negotiate consent terms. Epic has strong incentive to consent (retaining $15M-$25M annual recurring revenue customer), but may demand pricing concessions.

**7. Ohio Non-Compete Enforceability Limitations Increase Physician Retention Risk**

Ohio courts enforce physician non-competes only if: (1) no greater than necessary for employer's legitimate business interests, (2) no undue hardship on employee, (3) not injurious to public. Recent Ohio appellate decisions refuse enforcement when non-competes are "against public interest" or too broad.

**Implication for Mercy Regional:** If Mercy's 650 physician employment agreements contain broad non-competes (e.g., 25-mile radius, 3-year term, all specialties), Ohio courts may refuse enforcement post-acquisition. High-value specialists (neurosurgery, orthopedics, cardiology) could immediately compete within Columbus market without restraint.

**Retention strategy must assume non-competes are unenforceable,** relying instead on retention bonuses, equity incentives, clinical leadership opportunities, and cultural integration to prevent departures.

**8. Aggregate Exposure: $392M-$2.83B NPV (10-Year) Depending on Scenario**

Probability-weighted exposure analysis:

| Scenario | Probability | NPV (10-Year, 8% Discount) |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Base Case** | 60% | $392M-$528M |
| **Adverse Case** | 30% | $1.01B-$1.37B |
| **Severe Case** | 10% | $2.05B-$2.83B |
| **Probability-Weighted Expected Loss** | 100% | **$680M-$920M** |

**Expected loss of $680M-$920M represents 28-38% of $2.4B purchase price,** supporting recommendation for substantial purchase price reduction or escrow to address contract change of control risks.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### IMMEDIATE (Days -90 to 0, Pre-Announcement)

**1. Engage Healthcare M&A Counsel Specializing in Contract Change of Control (Day -90)**
- Retain Ropes & Gray, Sidley Austin, or comparable firm with healthcare M&A transactional expertise
- Task: Review all Mercy Regional material contracts for change of control provisions
- Deliverable: Contract inventory with change of control provision summary, consent requirements, termination rights, and recommended solicitation strategy

**2. Execute Data Room Document Request (Day -90)**
- Request from Mercy Regional:
  - All payer contracts (Medicare Advantage, Medicaid MCO, commercial insurance)
  - All physician employment agreements (650 physicians, including template and specialty-specific agreements)
  - All exclusive service contracts (anesthesia, radiology, ER, pathology, hospitalist)
  - Epic Systems master license and subscription agreement
  - GPO participation agreements (Premier, Vizient, or other)
  - ASC operating agreement (Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC)
  - 340B contract pharmacy agreements (all 8 pharmacies)
  - Tax-exempt bond indenture and bond counsel opinion ($420M Mercy Northwest bonds)
  - Medical staff bylaws (privilege linkage to exclusive contracts)

**3. Conduct Payer Revenue Concentration Analysis (Day -75)**
- Request from Mercy Regional CFO:
  - Top 10 payers by revenue (FY2024)
  - Top 5 payers by patient volume
  - Payer mix by hospital (Regional, Northwest, East, South)
  - Medicare Advantage plan-specific contracts (identify CMS direct vs. plan-specific requiring consent)
- Identify "deal-critical" payers (>$100M revenue or >10% patient volume)
- Prioritize consent solicitation for top 3-5 payers

**4. Draft and Execute Physician Retention Agreements (Day -60 to Day -30)**

**CRITICAL: Must be executed BEFORE acquisition announcement to maximize effectiveness**

**Retention Agreement Terms:**
- **Eligible physicians:** All 650 employed physicians at Mercy Medical Group PC
- **Retention bonus amount:** 50% of base salary (industry standard)
  - Total retention pool: 650 physicians × $350K average salary × 50% = $113.75M
- **Vesting schedule:**
  - 50% vests on closing date (incentivizes remaining through closing)
  - 50% vests on 36-month anniversary of closing (incentivizes long-term retention)
- **Acceleration provisions:**
  - 100% vesting if terminated without cause within 36 months post-closing
  - 100% vesting if material adverse change to compensation, benefits, or clinical autonomy
  - 100% vesting if required to relocate >25 miles
- **Non-compete waiver:** Sign-on bonus repayment provisions waived if terminated without cause or due to change of control
- **Communication strategy:** Present retention agreements as "recognition of physician value" and "continuity commitment," NOT as "preventing departures"

**Execution timeline:**
- Day -60: Draft retention agreement template
- Day -45: Obtain National Healthcare Partners approval for $113.75M retention pool
- Day -30: Execute retention agreements with all 650 physicians (personal meetings with department chairs and high-value specialists; electronic execution for remaining physicians)

**Alternative (if $113.75M retention pool exceeds budget):**
- **Tiered retention bonuses:**
  - Tier 1 (50 high-value specialists: neurosurgery, orthopedics, cardiology, oncology): 75% of base salary = $26M-$45M
  - Tier 2 (200 moderate-value specialists): 50% of base salary = $35M-$60M
  - Tier 3 (400 primary care/hospital-based physicians): 25% of base salary = $35M-$40M
  - **Total tiered retention pool: $96M-$145M** (15-25% reduction vs. uniform 50%)

**5. Amend ASC Operating Agreement and Execute Physician Buyout (Day -45)**

**Two-step strategy to eliminate STARK/AKS violation AND change of control risk:**

**Step 1: Amend Operating Agreement (Consent to Change of Control)**
- Schedule Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC member meeting
- Propose amendment: "Change of control of hospital partner [Mercy Regional Health System] to National Healthcare Partners LLC is deemed approved by physician partners and does not constitute assignment requiring consent under Section [X] of this Agreement"
- Obtain written consent from physician partners (requires supermajority, likely 75% vote per operating agreement)
- **Inducement for physician consent:** Offer retention bonuses to physician partners ($50K-$100K per physician, $600K-$1.2M total for 12 gastroenterologists) in exchange for change of control consent

**Step 2: Buyout Employed Physician Owners (STARK Remediation)**
- 8 employed physicians hold 33% ownership in Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC
- Independent FMV appraisal (ASA credentialed appraiser): $3M-$4M total ASC value
- 33% buyout price: $1M-$1.3M
- Payment terms: Lump sum at closing OR installment payments over 3-5 years (reduces immediate cash outlay)
- Replacement owners: 4 community (non-employed) gastroenterologists purchase divested interests at FMV
- **Eliminates STARK violation (employed physician ownership + referrals) AND change of control holdout risk**

**Alternative (if physician partners refuse consent):**
- Buyout ALL physician partners: 50% ownership = $1.5M-$2M
- Convert ASC to 100% Mercy ownership (eliminates joint venture)
- Risk: Loss of physician alignment and referrals (may require recruiting new gastroenterologists)

**6. Engage Epic Systems Account Executive (Day -90)**
- Schedule meeting with Epic account executive
- Disclose planned acquisition (under NDA)
- Negotiate change of control consent terms:
  - Pricing: Lock in current rates for 5 years OR accept 5-10% increase (vs. 10-20% without advance negotiation)
  - Enterprise licensing: If National Healthcare Partners owns multiple Epic customers, negotiate enterprise license terms proactively
  - Interfacility data sharing: Clarify fees for data exchange between Mercy Regional and other National Healthcare Partners portfolio companies
- Obtain written consent to assignment 60 days before closing
- **Budget $1.5M-$3M annual price increase as acceptable cost of consent**

**7. Identify GPO Membership and Assess For-Profit Compatibility (Day -75)**
- Determine Mercy Regional's primary GPO: Premier, Vizient, or hospital-owned cooperative
- If non-profit-only GPO (e.g., hospital cooperative), pre-negotiate Premier or Vizient membership
- Transition timeline: 90-120 days
- **Action item:** Initiate Premier or Vizient membership application 90 days before closing to minimize supply cost disruption

**8. Conduct 340B Contract Pharmacy Compliance Review (Day -60)**
- Review HRSA registration status: Mercy South 340B ID, covered entity status, DSH qualification
- Review contract pharmacy agreements: 8 current pharmacies, change of control provisions
- **Proactive compliance actions:**
  - Reduce from 8 to 6 contract pharmacies (HRSA proposed limit, if finalized)
  - Terminate 2 lowest-volume pharmacies
  - Amend remaining 6 pharmacy agreements: Add change of control consent waiver ("Covered entity's change in ownership does not constitute assignment requiring pharmacy consent under this Agreement")
  - Register new ownership with HRSA within 30 days of closing
- **DSH eligibility preservation:** Confirm Medicaid utilization will remain ≥15% post-acquisition (Mercy South current: 28%, exceeds threshold)

---

#### SHORT-TERM (Days 0 to 90, Post-Announcement Consent Solicitation)

**9. Serve Change of Control Notices (Day 0-30)**

Immediately following public announcement, serve written change of control notices to all material contract counterparties:

**Notice Package Contents:**
- Formal notice of change of control (National Healthcare Partners acquiring Mercy Regional)
- Request for consent to assignment (if required by contract)
- Certification that all pre-closing obligations performed and no defaults
- Commitment to post-closing performance (no material changes to services, quality, or compliance)
- Contact information for National Healthcare Partners transaction team

**Notice Recipients (Prioritized by Criticality):**
1. **Top 5 payers** (Anthem BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Humana MA, CareSource Medicaid): 60-90 day notice period, request consent within 60 days
2. **Exclusive service groups** (anesthesia, radiology, ER, pathology, hospitalist): 60-90 day notice period, request consent within 60 days
3. **Epic Systems:** 60-120 day notice period (already engaged pre-announcement per Step 6 above)
4. **GPO (Premier or Vizient):** 30-60 day notice period (notice only, consent typically not required)
5. **Medical device and pharmaceutical vendors:** 30-60 day notice period for contracts >$5M annually
6. **340B contract pharmacies:** 30-day notice, request amendment waiving change of control consent requirement

**10. Negotiate Payer Consent Terms (Day 30-90)**

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- **Objective:** Obtain written consent to change of control for all material payer contracts (representing $1.8B annual revenue)
- **Acceptable concessions:**
  - 2-3% rate reduction across all contracts (base case scenario)
  - 3-year rate lock (prevents further rate reductions Years 2-3 post-closing)
  - Enhanced quality reporting (HEDIS, CMS quality measures)
  - Utilization management collaboration (joint prior authorization protocols)
- **Unacceptable concessions:**
  - >5% rate reduction (triggers adverse scenario, $108M annual revenue loss)
  - Network tier demotion (preferred → standard tier, reduces patient volume 10-15%)
  - Exclusive network restrictions (prohibiting participation in competing payer networks)

**Payer-Specific Strategies:**

**Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield (Estimated $300M-$400M annual revenue):**
- **Leverage:** Mercy Regional is "must-have" hospital with 4 facilities and 25-30% Columbus market share; Anthem cannot exclude without alienating employer groups
- **Anticipated demand:** 3-5% rate reduction + 3-year rate lock
- **Counteroffer:** 2% rate reduction + 5-year term extension + enhanced quality reporting
- **Walk-away threshold:** >5% rate reduction OR network tier demotion

**UnitedHealthcare Commercial + Medicare Advantage (Estimated $200M-$300M annual revenue):**
- **Leverage:** Mercy Regional Medicare Advantage volume significant in aging Columbus market
- **Anticipated demand:** 2-4% rate reduction + utilization management enhancements
- **Counteroffer:** 2% rate reduction + bundled payment pilots (joint gainsharing if utilization reduced)
- **Walk-away threshold:** Medicare Advantage contract termination (non-negotiable due to senior patient access)

**CareSource Ohio Medicaid MCO (Estimated $100M-$150M annual revenue):**
- **Leverage:** Mercy South's DSH status and 28% Medicaid utilization creates obligation to serve Medicaid population
- **Anticipated demand:** Minimal (Medicaid MCO rates tightly regulated by Ohio Department of Medicaid)
- **Counteroffer:** Accept current rates, request 3-year term extension
- **Walk-away threshold:** N/A (Medicaid contract termination not acceptable due to community benefit obligations)

**11. Negotiate Exclusive Service Contract Consent Terms (Day 30-90)**

**Exclusive Service Group Priorities:**
1. Anesthesia ($15M-$25M annually)
2. Emergency medicine ($12M-$20M annually)
3. Radiology ($10M-$18M annually)
4. Pathology ($5M-$8M annually)
5. Hospitalist ($8M-$12M annually)

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- **Objective:** Obtain written consent to change of control for all exclusive service contracts
- **Acceptable concessions:**
  - 5-10% rate increase (reflecting fair market value adjustment for private equity ownership)
  - 5-year term extension (provides exclusive service group stability and long-term revenue commitment)
  - Enhanced management fee for medical director services
- **Unacceptable concessions:**
  - >15% rate increase (triggers excessive cost escalation)
  - Reduced exclusivity (allowing competing groups to provide services)
  - Termination without cause rights (creates instability)

**Alternative (if exclusive service group refuses consent):**
- Recruit replacement provider group (national groups: TeamHealth, USPI, Envision for anesthesia; Sound Physicians, IPC for hospitalist)
- Transition timeline: 90-120 days (credentialing, onboarding)
- Service disruption mitigation: Overlap coverage for 30-60 days (both incumbent and replacement groups provide services during transition)

---

#### LONG-TERM (Days 90-180, Consent Failures - Remediation)

**12. Remediate Consent Failures (if Any)**

**Major Payer Refusal Scenario:**
If Anthem BCBS or UnitedHealthcare refuses consent and terminates contract:

**Step 1: Exhaust Contractual Remedies**
- Review payer contract for arbitration or mediation provisions
- Invoke dispute resolution procedures
- Timeline: 60-90 days for arbitration/mediation

**Step 2: Regulatory Intervention (if applicable)**
- Ohio Department of Insurance complaint (if termination violates Ohio insurance regulations)
- CMS complaint (if Medicare Advantage plan termination violates CMS network adequacy requirements)

**Step 3: Accept Out-of-Network Status OR Renegotiate at Adverse Terms**
- Out-of-network revenue: 15-20% patient volume loss as patients switch to in-network providers
- Adverse renegotiation: Accept 6-8% rate reduction to regain network participation

**Step 4: Replace Lost Volume with Alternative Payers**
- Target payers with <5% Mercy Regional market share for network expansion
- Offer competitive rates (5-10% below terminated payer) to gain volume

**Exclusive Service Group Refusal Scenario:**
If anesthesia, radiology, or ER physician group refuses consent and terminates contract:

**Step 1: Recruit Replacement Provider Group**
- National groups (pre-identified in contingency planning): TeamHealth, USPI, Envision (anesthesia); Radiology Partners, vRad (radiology); Vituity, Envision (ER)
- Contract negotiation: 30-60 days
- Credentialing: 90-120 days

**Step 2: Interim Staffing (Locum Tenens)**
- Engage locum tenens agencies (CHG Healthcare, CompHealth, Weatherby Healthcare)
- Cost: 150-200% of permanent staffing (acceptable for 60-120 day interim period)

**Step 3: Overlap Coverage During Transition**
- Incumbent group: Provides services for 60-day notice period
- Replacement group: Begins onboarding and credentialing Day 30, provides services Day 90+
- Overlap Day 60-90: Both groups provide services to ensure continuity

**Epic EHR Refusal Scenario (Catastrophic):**
If Epic Systems refuses consent and terminates license:

**Step 1: Litigation (Breach of Contract, Anticipatory Repudiation)**
- Sue Epic for breach of contract (Epic's refusal to consent may breach implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing)
- Seek preliminary injunction preventing Epic from terminating license during litigation
- Timeline: 6-12 months

**Step 2: Negotiate Settlement (Likely Outcome)**
- Epic has strong incentive to settle (losing $15M-$25M annual recurring revenue customer creates precedent risk)
- Settlement terms: Epic consents to assignment with 15-20% rate increase (vs. 10-20% without litigation)
- Timeline: 3-6 months

**Step 3: EHR Migration (Last Resort, if Epic Termination Unavoidable)**
- Select alternative EHR: Cerner, Meditech, AllScripts
- Implementation cost: $50M-$100M
- Timeline: 18-24 months
- **This scenario is HIGHLY UNLIKELY but must be planned for as contingency**

### C. Outstanding Questions Requiring Further Investigation

**1. What are the specific change of control provisions in Mercy Regional's top 10 payer contracts?**
- **Investigation required:** Data room review of Anthem BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Humana MA, CareSource Medicaid MCO contracts
- **Key provisions to identify:** Assignment/change of control clause language, consent requirements (affirmative vs. negative consent), notice periods (30/60/90 days), termination rights, rate adjustment triggers

**2. What percentage of Mercy Regional's 650 employed physicians have enforceable non-compete agreements under Ohio law?**
- **Investigation required:** Review standard physician employment agreement template and specialty-specific agreements
- **Key provisions to identify:** Geographic scope (mile radius), temporal scope (years), specialty restrictions, blue-pencil provisions (allowing courts to narrow overbroad restrictions)
- **Ohio enforceability analysis:** Compare to recent Ohio case law (BMD LLC 2024, McDonald Hopkins 2023 guidance) on physician non-compete enforceability

**3. Does Mercy Regional participate in a non-profit-only GPO that would prohibit for-profit membership?**
- **Investigation required:** Request GPO participation agreement from Mercy Regional supply chain department
- **Key provisions to identify:** Membership eligibility requirements (non-profit vs. for-profit vs. mixed), change of control notice requirements, termination provisions, transition assistance for exiting members

**4. What is the fair market value of Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC for purposes of buying out physician-owners?**
- **Investigation required:** Engage independent ASA-credentialed appraiser to value ASC
- **Valuation methodology:** Income approach (EBITDA multiple 4x-6x for gastroenterology ASCs), market approach (comparable ASC transactions), asset approach (adjusted net assets)
- **Key data inputs:** ASC revenue FY2022-2024, EBITDA margins (30-40% typical for GI ASCs), case volume, payer mix, facility/equipment value

**5. Will Mercy South Hospital maintain DSH eligibility post-acquisition for-profit conversion?**
- **Investigation required:** Consult with HRSA and CMS regarding DSH eligibility requirements for for-profit hospitals
- **Key factors:** Medicaid utilization percentage (Mercy South current: 28%, threshold: ≥15%), low-income patient percentage (current: 32%), community benefit reporting (for-profit hospitals may have different IRS Form 990 Schedule H requirements)
- **Anticipated answer:** For-profit hospitals CAN qualify as DSH hospitals if Medicaid utilization thresholds met; Mercy South's 28% Medicaid utilization substantially exceeds 15% threshold, supporting continued eligibility
