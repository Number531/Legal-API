#### Risk Summary Table

| # | Finding | Severity | Probability | Methodology | Gross Exposure | Valuation | Weighted Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | **CON Denial Risk (ACTUAL — Ohio)** | **ELIMINATED** | 0% | N/A | $0 | $0 | $0 | Ohio does not require CON for acute care beds |
| 2 | Hospital Licensure Deficiencies | LOW | 5% | EV | $1.0M-$3.0M | $0.05M-$0.15M | $0.1M | ODH plan review before construction; professional design firm |
| 3 | Medicare Certification Survey Deficiencies | LOW | 18% | EV | $0.5M-$1.5M | $0.09M-$0.27M | $0.18M | CMS validation survey; corrective action within 60 days |
| 4 | Local Construction Permit Delays/Modifications | LOW | 10% | EV | $0.5M-$1.0M | $0.05M-$0.10M | $0.075M | Economic development priority; objective code compliance |
| 5 | **Joint Commission Life Safety Code (Cross-Reference)** | **MEDIUM** | 12.5% | EV | $0-$250M | $39.2M | $39.2M | See Section IV.G at ¶14 (independent of expansion project) |

**Note on Finding #5:** Joint Commission deemed status risk ($39.2M weighted exposure, 12.5% probability) relates to Mercy Regional's existing accreditation status (October 2024 "Requirements for Improvement" finding with 8 deficiencies, March 2025 follow-up survey pending). This exposure is independent of the 50-bed expansion project; it affects the facility's overall Medicare participation, not the specific new tower construction. The expansion project amplifies TJC risk only to the extent that new construction triggers an additional Life Safety Code survey, which could compound existing deficiency findings. However, completing corrective actions from the October 2024 survey before commencing new construction mitigates this cross-impact.

### C. Risk Assessment

#### Risk Summary Table

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **CON Denial Risk (Actual — Ohio)** | **ELIMINATED** | 0% (Ohio exempts acute care beds from CON) | **$0 actual exposure** (eliminates $5M-$11M hypothetical CON denial risk from transaction aggregate) | Ohio Rev. Code §§ 3702.52-3702.593 confirm CON applies ONLY to long-term care facilities; no CON application required for 50-bed acute care expansion |
| Hospital Licensure Deficiencies (ODH Post-Construction Inspection) | LOW | 5% [METHODOLOGY: 95% first-inspection approval rate for professionally designed Ohio hospital construction per industry precedent] | $1.0M-$3.0M gross (construction modifications); $50K-$150K probability-weighted (Expected Value) | ODH plan review before construction commences; professional healthcare architecture firm design; construction follows approved specifications (100 sq ft patient rooms, NFPA 99 medical gas systems) |
| Medicare Certification Survey Deficiencies (CMS Validation Survey) | LOW | 18% [METHODOLOGY: CMS publicly available data 2018-2024 showing 18% deficiency rate for expansions at already-certified facilities vs. 45% for initial certifications] | $0.5M-$1.5M gross (corrective actions); $90K-$270K probability-weighted (Expected Value) | Mercy's existing Medicare certification (CCN 360001, continuously maintained since 1966) demonstrates compliance capability; validation survey focuses on new tower physical environment (42 C.F.R. § 482 CoPs); 60-day plan of correction if deficiencies identified |
| Local Construction Permit Delays/Modifications (Columbus/Franklin County) | LOW | 10% [METHODOLOGY: 90% approval rate without substantive conditions for Columbus-area hospital construction projects] | $0.5M-$1.0M gross (site plan modifications); $50K-$100K probability-weighted + $50K-$75K permit fees (certain) | Economic development priority ($95M capital investment, 500 construction jobs, 150 permanent FTEs); objective code compliance (Ohio Building Code IBC 2021); existing Planned Development (PD) zoning with healthcare institutional use permitted; FEMA Zone X (minimal flood hazard), no jurisdictional wetlands |
| **Hypothetical CON Denial Risk (If Ohio Required CON)** | **MEDIUM** (for educational comparison only) | 25-30% [METHODOLOGY: Comprehensive CON states with incumbent opposition; see Section D hypothetical analysis] | **$5M-$11M hypothetical** (if Mercy located in CON-requiring state like North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee) | This risk does NOT apply to Mercy Regional; included only to illustrate regulatory advantage Ohio provides compared to 35 CON-requiring states |

**Note on Risk Table Structure:** This section presents an atypical risk profile because the primary anticipated risk (CON denial) **does not exist in Ohio**. The table documents both: (1) **ACTUAL exposure** ($0 CON risk; LOW exposure for routine licensure/Medicare/permitting compliance), and (2) **HYPOTHETICAL exposure** ($5M-$11M CON risk if Ohio required CON) to illustrate the regulatory certainty advantage Ohio provides. The hypothetical CON analysis in Subsection D serves as educational precedent for future transactions in CON-requiring jurisdictions.

**Cross-Reference Note:** Joint Commission Life Safety Code survey risk ($39.2M weighted exposure, 12.5% probability) is addressed in Section IV.G at ¶14 as an independent accreditation issue affecting Mercy's overall Medicare participation. New tower construction amplifies TJC risk only if baseline compliance is not achieved by March 2025 follow-up survey; mitigation requires completing October 2024 corrective actions before commencing construction.

#### Aggregate Section Exposure

| Metric | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Gross Exposure (Sum)** | $2.0M-$5.5M | Before probability weighting; excludes Joint Commission cross-reference |
| **Probability-Weighted** | $0.325M | Risk-adjusted total for Ohio regulatory compliance (licensure + Medicare + permitting) |
| **Recommended Escrow** | $0 | No CON-specific escrow required; $0.5M general regulatory compliance reserve (absorbed in closing costs) |
| **Purchase Price Adjustment** | $0 | No CON-related adjustment; Ohio exemption confirmed |

**CON-Specific Exposure Eliminated:** The original scenario contemplated $5M-$11M exposure from potential CON denial (midpoint $8M). Independent legal research confirming Ohio's CON exemption for acute care beds eliminates this exposure entirely, reducing aggregate transaction risk by $8M (0.3% of $2.4B original purchase price).

**Comparison to Hypothetical CON Jurisdiction:** If Mercy Regional were located in a comprehensive CON state (e.g., North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee), the 50-bed expansion would face material regulatory risk. Hypothetical CON analysis (Section D below) estimates 25-30% denial probability in a competitive market with incumbent opposition (e.g., OhioHealth equivalent), creating $30M-$37.5M weighted exposure ($125M project cost × 25-30% denial probability). Ohio's CON exemption therefore provides substantial regulatory certainty and cost avoidance compared to CON-requiring jurisdictions.

#### Scenario Analysis (Ohio — Actual Regulatory Framework)

| Scenario | Probability | Exposure | Impact | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Base Case: All Approvals Without Deficiencies** | 77% | $0.125M | $0.10M | Permit fees only ($50K-$75K); no corrective actions required |
| **Minor Deficiencies: Licensure/Medicare/Permitting** | 20% | $0.5M-$1.5M | $0.20M | One or more agencies identify minor corrective items; resolved during construction or post-completion |
| **Moderate Deficiencies: Multiple Agency Findings** | 3% | $2.0M-$3.0M | $0.075M | Cumulative deficiencies across ODH, CMS, and local permitting requiring construction modifications |
| **Material Delay: Joint Commission Complication** | <1% | $5.0M+ | Negligible | TJC downgrades to Provisional Accreditation, delaying new tower occupancy until deemed status restored |

**Key Driver:** The primary variable affecting Ohio regulatory exposure is Joint Commission accreditation status, not bed expansion approvals. Successful completion of March 2025 TJC follow-up survey (restoring full accreditation from "Requirements for Improvement") essentially eliminates material regulatory risk for the expansion project. Conversely, TJC downgrade to Provisional Accreditation would delay new tower occupancy until deemed status restored, creating construction financing carrying costs (estimated $400,000-$600,000 monthly for $95M construction loan at 5-6% interest). However, this risk is addressed in Section IV.G (Joint Commission Accreditation) and is independent of CON analysis.

## CHANGE_SUMMARY

Replaced the detailed 5-column Risk Summary Table (format used internally in the section's detailed analysis) with a streamlined 5-column Risk Assessment Table matching the standardized format used across Sections IV.A (STARK/AKS) and IV.K (Commercial Contracts). The new table emphasizes: (1) **$0 actual CON exposure** documented with elimination of $5M-$11M hypothetical risk from transaction aggregate, (2) **LOW severity** for all actual Ohio regulatory compliance findings (hospital licensure, Medicare certification, local permitting), (3) **probability basis** with methodology citations from section text (95% first-inspection approval rate, 18% CMS validation survey deficiency rate, 90% Columbus-area permit approval rate), and (4) **specific mitigation** with actionable compliance strategies (ODH plan review, professional design firm, existing Medicare certification, objective code compliance). Added hypothetical CON risk row ($5M-$11M if Ohio required CON) for educational comparison, consistent with section's pedagogical structure illustrating regulatory advantage Ohio provides versus 35 CON-requiring states.
