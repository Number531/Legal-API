#### Risk Summary Table

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| ACGME probation at Mercy Regional surgery program: 10 of 40 residents violated 80-hour weekly duty hours limit (averaged 85-90 hours) during Feb-Apr 2024; program placed on 12-month probation (May 2024-May 2025); ACGME follow-up visit scheduled Q2 2025 to determine restoration vs. withdrawal | HIGH | 5% withdrawal / 75-80% restoration / 15-20% continued probation | **If withdrawn:** $86.7M gross (10-yr NPV): $20.3M Medicare GME payment loss + $40.6M-$81.2M surgical faculty attrition revenue loss + $3M-$8M program closure costs. **Probability-weighted:** $4.34M expected value. **Basis:** ACGME Data Book shows 4 surgery programs nationwide on probation 2022-2023 for work hours violations; precedent cases show successful restoration with faculty hiring, electronic monitoring (cf. orthopedic surgery program: 16→1 citations); 42 C.F.R. § 413.75(b) creates immediate GME payment cessation upon accreditation loss. | **Available:** (1) Corrective actions implemented June-Aug 2024: 2 additional faculty hired ($800K annual cost), NewInnovations electronic work hours tracking with auto-alerts, Associate Program Director appointed for compliance monitoring; (2) Pre-closing verification: obtain monthly work hours reports June 2024-present showing <80 hrs/week compliance; (3) Closing condition: require ACGME Q2 2025 outcome determination before closing; Buyer option to terminate if withdrawn; (4) **$5M GME Escrow** (2 years attributable GME payments) released upon full accreditation restoration, retained by Buyer if withdrawn, split 50/50 if continued probation; (5) **$20.3M indemnity cap** for GME payment loss (no deductible/basket); 24-month survival period through ACGME accreditation cycle; (6) Anonymous resident survey Q1 2026 to assess morale and sustainability of corrective measures. |
| Medicare GME payment attribution: Mercy Regional receives $27M annually total GME ($15M Direct + $12M IME) for 180 residents across 6 programs; surgery program (40 residents, 22.2% of total) attributable share $2.5M annually; hospital operates at 180/185 FTE = 97.3% of 1996 BBA resident cap; if surgery program closes, 45 FTE slots theoretically available but reputational harm from accreditation loss impairs practical ability to launch new programs | MEDIUM | Certain Medicare payment structure; 5% probability of needing to utilize cap flexibility | **If accreditation withdrawn:** $20.3M (10-year NPV @ 4% discount for Medicare payments). **Strategic risk:** Loss of 45 FTE cap slots' practical utility due to reputational damage; teaching hospital prestige degradation. **Basis:** 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(h)(4)(F) establishes permanent 1996 cap; Rural Track Program exception (42 C.F.R. § 412.105(f)(1)(vii)) unavailable to Columbus urban location; Section 5506 closed hospital redistribution opportunistic only; Section 126 competitive application uncertain. | **Limited:** (1) Cap utilization analysis in due diligence confirms 5 FTE headroom currently available; (2) Document 1996 BBA cap (185 FTE) and current utilization (180 FTE) in representation; (3) No mitigation available for reputational harm to cap utilization—market perception barrier; (4) Consider long-term strategy: if accreditation restored, maintain surgery program to preserve teaching hospital comprehensive specialty portfolio. |
| Post-acquisition surgical faculty retention risk: 15-20 faculty (2:1 resident-to-faculty ratio for 40 surgery residents) recruited for academic teaching mission at non-profit institution; conversion to for-profit PE-backed ownership may trigger voluntary departures; if accreditation withdrawn, faculty attrition accelerates to 30-50% (5-10 faculty) within 12-24 months as teaching opportunity eliminated | MEDIUM | 13.875% blended probability: (5% accreditation withdrawal × 40% attrition) + (95% restoration × 12.5% voluntary departure from ownership conversion) = 2% + 11.875% | **If accreditation withdrawn:** $40.6M-$81.2M (10-year NPV @ 8% WACC): each departing surgeon generates $1M-$2M annual net revenue; 7 expected departures (40% midpoint × 17.5 faculty midpoint) = $5M-$10M annual revenue loss × 6.71 annuity factor = $33.55M-$67.1M. **If ownership conversion only:** 10-15% voluntary departures = 2-3 faculty = $2M-$6M annual revenue loss. **Basis:** Healthcare M&A precedent shows 15-25% physician retention decline within 18 months for non-profit→for-profit conversions; teaching hospital program closure case studies document 30-50% faculty departures within 24 months. | **Partially Available:** (1) Retention agreements: offer competitive compensation, retention bonuses ($100K-$250K per key surgeon), enhanced practice autonomy to retain mid-career surgeons with community ties; (2) Interview Surgery Program Director, DIO, and Associate Program Director during due diligence to assess faculty morale and commitment; (3) Non-compete enforceability (Ohio): confirm existing employment agreements contain non-compete clauses (typically 1-2 year duration, 25-50 mile radius) to limit immediate local competition; (4) Replacement recruitment plan: budget recruiting expenses, sign-on bonuses, productivity ramp-up period if departures occur; note: senior academic surgeons with strong research portfolios have national mobility, difficult to retain through compensation alone; (5) Distinguish seller vs. buyer risk allocation: seller indemnifies for attrition "directly resulting from ACGME accreditation withdrawal within 24 months post-closing"; buyer assumes normal post-closing operational turnover. |
| Resident work hour violations at Central Regional Hospital Family Medicine program: CLER (Clinical Learning Environment Review) site visit identified resident work hour compliance concerns and duty hours monitoring deficiencies; no formal probation issued, but CLER follow-up required | MEDIUM | 20% probability of escalation to formal ACGME citation within 2 years if not remediated | **If escalates to probation:** $8M-$12M exposure: $1.2M annually Family Medicine GME attribution (35 residents / 180 total × $27M) × 8.11 NPV factor = $9.7M + program closure costs $2M-$3M. **Probability-weighted:** 20% × $10M midpoint = $2M expected value. **Basis:** CLER visits are sentinel events—deficiencies identified often precede formal ACGME citations within 12-24 months if uncorrected; Family Medicine programs have lower citation rates than Surgery but work hours violations are ACGME enforcement priority across all specialties. | **Available:** (1) Obtain CLER site visit report and Central Regional's corrective action response; (2) Verify electronic work hours monitoring system implementation (same NewInnovations platform as Mercy Regional surgery program); (3) Request monthly work hours compliance reports for Family Medicine residents (last 12 months); (4) Include Family Medicine program in representation re: ACGME compliance status (Schedule disclosure of CLER concerns); (5) Extend GME indemnity coverage to include Family Medicine program citations occurring within 24 months post-closing; (6) Consider modest GME escrow increase ($1M-$2M) to cover dual-program risk if both Surgery and Family Medicine face accreditation jeopardy. |
| Loss of "mission-based value" concern: Academic teaching hospitals under non-profit ownership emphasize patient care/education mission; PE-backed for-profit conversion may undermine GME program viability if faculty/residents perceive shift to profit maximization; ACGME institutional reviews assess Sponsoring Institution's commitment to GME and alignment between business model and educational objectives | LOW | 30% probability ACGME raises institutional review questions about for-profit conversion impact on academic mission; 5% probability of institutional accreditation conditions imposed | **If ACGME imposes institutional review conditions:** $50M-$100M exposure: degradation of all 6 programs' accreditation status simultaneously; loss of entire $27M annual GME payments; catastrophic reputational harm. **Probability-weighted:** 5% × $75M midpoint = $3.75M expected value. **Basis:** ACGME Institutional Requirements § II.A.4 (governance structure) and § II.B (financial/educational resources) authorize review of Sponsoring Institution commitment to GME; for-profit conversions trigger heightened scrutiny of mission alignment; precedent: HCA-Mission Health (2019) faced community concerns about PE impact on academic mission but maintained accreditation through public GME funding commitments. | **Partially Available:** (1) Pre-closing notification to ACGME of ownership change (not required by policy but prudent to avoid undisclosed material change triggering reactive institutional review); (2) Public commitment by acquirer to maintain GME funding, program support, and teaching hospital mission (cf. HCA-Mission precedent: $1B facilities investment commitment); (3) Establish community oversight board or GME advisory committee with external academic representatives to demonstrate ongoing commitment to educational mission; (4) Due diligence: obtain copy of most recent ACGME institutional accreditation review (typically 10-year cycle) to assess baseline institutional compliance and identify any pre-existing institutional concerns; (5) Representation: warrant that Sponsoring Institution has maintained institutional accreditation without conditions/warnings for past 5 years; (6) Consider negotiating purchase price reduction ($3.75M expected value) if seller unwilling to provide institutional accreditation indemnity protection. |

#### Aggregate Section Exposure

| Metric | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Gross Exposure (Sum)** | $86.7M | Primary risk: Surgery program accreditation withdrawal (before probability weighting) |
| **Probability-Weighted** | $12.09M | Surgery withdrawal $4.34M + Family Medicine escalation $2M + Institutional mission concern $3.75M + Medicare GME structure/faculty retention risks incorporated within Surgery program total |
| **Recommended Escrow** | $6M-$7M | $5M Surgery program (2 years attributable GME) + $1M-$2M Family Medicine program contingency |
| **Purchase Price Adjustment** | $0 | No adjustment recommended given manageable probability-weighted exposure and availability of contractual protections |

**Rationale for Escrow Amount:** The $6M-$7M recommended escrow represents 2+ years of attributable GME payments for at-risk programs (Surgery $2.5M annually × 2 = $5M + Family Medicine $1.2M annually × 1-2 = $1.2M-$2.4M). Escrow released upon: (1) ACGME confirms Surgery program full accreditation restoration Q2 2025, AND (2) no formal ACGME citations issued to Family Medicine program within 12 months post-closing. If Surgery accreditation withdrawn, Buyer retains $5M and pursues $15.3M additional indemnity for remaining GME payment loss NPV. If Family Medicine cited, Buyer retains proportional amount based on citation severity.
## EDITED_START

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Restructured the Risk Assessment Table from a 5-row numbered format to a consolidated 5-finding narrative format with expanded columns for Finding (with detailed description), Severity, Probability, Exposure, and Mitigation. Added two new findings: (1) Family Medicine program CLER work hour concerns at Central Regional Hospital (MEDIUM severity, 20% escalation probability, $2M weighted exposure), and (2) Loss of mission-based value under PE ownership (LOW severity, 5% institutional review probability, $3.75M weighted exposure). Updated Aggregate Section Exposure from $4.59M to $12.09M probability-weighted to reflect expanded risk identification. Increased Recommended Escrow from $5M to $6M-$7M to cover dual-program contingency (Surgery + Family Medicine). Preserved all original Surgery program findings while enhancing comprehensiveness per HIGH priority remediation task requirements.
