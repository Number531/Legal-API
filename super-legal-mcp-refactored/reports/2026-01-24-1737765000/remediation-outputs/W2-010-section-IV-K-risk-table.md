### A.1 Risk Assessment Summary

**Section Exposure Overview:** Commercial contracts and change-of-control provisions present the **second-largest financial exposure** in this transaction, with probability-weighted NPV of **$700M-$920M** across eight distinct risk categories. This section addresses consent requirements affecting $936M in annual payer revenue (52% of total), physician retention risks ($218M NPV), exclusive service contract renegotiation ($150M NPV), and ancillary contract exposures.

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Payer contract rate renegotiation (52% of contracts require consent; 2-6% rate reductions likely) | HIGH | 80% | $400M NPV (5-yr): $45M-$108M annual revenue loss from Anthem BCBS, UnitedHealthcare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid MCO rate concessions | Partial: Leverage "must-have" market status (82% market share Columbus); pre-negotiate consent with top 5 payers (90% of revenue); accept 2-3% reduction; $100M escrow for payer negotiations |
| Physician retention/turnover (13-25% departures in PE acquisitions; 650 employed physicians) | CRITICAL | 60% | $218M NPV (2-yr): 143-228 physician departures × $1.77M cost (replacement + revenue disruption); referral pattern transfer to OhioHealth/Mount Carmel competitors | Limited: $114M retention bonus pool (17.5% of physician payroll); Ohio non-compete unenforceable; signing bonuses $100K-$250K per physician; cultural integration critical |
| Exclusive service contract rate increases (5 groups: anesthesia, pathology, radiology, emergency, hospitalist; 80% require consent) | HIGH | 67% | $150M NPV (5-yr): $4M-$17M annual cost increase from 10-20% rate demands; Stark Law FMV compliance required | Available: Pre-negotiate consent with all 5 groups; independent FMV appraisals; accept 5-10% increases; alternative: 120-day locum tenens if termination |
| Epic EHR license assignment (non-transferable license; $15M-$25M annual cost) | MEDIUM | 70% | $14M NPV (5-yr): 5-10% pricing increase + potential enterprise license setup fee; 4% historical consent refusal rate | Limited: Epic consent highly probable (96% approval rate); negotiate enterprise pricing terms; tail risk: $75M migration cost if consent denied |
| 340B contract pharmacy restrictions + DSH eligibility (28% Medicaid utilization; 15 contract pharmacies) | MEDIUM | 70% | $32M NPV (10-yr): $4M-$7M annual savings loss from Eli Lilly/Sanofi single-pharmacy limits + HRSA 6-pharmacy cap proposal; 10% risk of DSH loss | Available: Reduce to 6 contract pharmacies (HRSA compliance); amend pharmacy agreements; maintain 28% Medicaid utilization (13-point buffer above 15% DSH threshold) |

**Aggregate Exposure:**
- **Gross Exposure:** $1.05B-$1.19B (sum of contract values requiring consent)
- **Probability-Weighted NPV:** $700M-$920M (risk-adjusted present value)
- **Recommended Escrow:** $150M commercial contracts escrow ($100M payer negotiations + $50M exclusive service consent)
- **Purchase Price Adjustment:** $200M-$300M (reflects 50% probability-weighting and partial mitigation potential)

**Key Transaction Risks:**
1. **Payer Consent Concentration:** Top 2 payers (Anthem BCBS $300M-$400M, UnitedHealthcare $200M-$300M) represent 60% of commercial revenue; refusal or prolonged out-of-network status triggers severe case ($1.26B NPV)
2. **Non-Profit to For-Profit Conversion Impact:** Charity care premium justification eliminated; 2024-2025 "contentious" payer negotiation climate; precedent transactions (HCA/Mission 2019, Tenet/Carondelet 2013) show 2-4% rate reductions
3. **Physician Cultural Clash:** Medical Economics 2024 study shows consistent 13-percentage-point turnover increase in PE-acquired practices; Ohio non-compete unenforceability means departing physicians can immediately compete within Columbus market
4. **Consent Timing Risk:** 90-day average consent procurement period × 52 contracts = 18-24 month total timeline; delayed consents trigger post-closing escrow releases and working capital adjustments

**Cross-Domain Implications:**
- **Section IV.H (Tax Conversion):** For-profit status loss eliminates IRS Form 990 community benefit reporting cited by payers as rate premium justification
- **Section IV.L (Employment):** 650 physician employment agreements with likely unenforceable Ohio non-compete clauses; retention bonus pool $114M represents 17.5% of physician payroll
- **Section IV.I (Medicare):** Medicare Advantage contracts ($180M annual revenue) governed by 42 C.F.R. § 422.202 allow 30-45 day termination notice upon change of control
- **Section IV.A (STARK/AKS):** Exclusive service contract rate increases must satisfy Stark Law personal services exception FMV requirements (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn(e)(3)(A)); rate increases >20% trigger OIG scrutiny

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Added comprehensive risk assessment summary table after Subsection A (Legal Framework) and before Subsection B (Application to Transaction) per task requirements. Table provides executive overview of the five highest-severity commercial contracts findings with specific dollar exposures ($700M-$920M probability-weighted NPV), consent percentages (52% of payer contracts, 80% of exclusive service contracts), and mitigation strategies. Extracted data from detailed analysis in Subsections B.1-B.5 and aggregated exposure calculations from Subsection C. Table emphasizes this section represents second-largest transaction exposure after tax conversion, with specific focus on payer consent concentration risk (Anthem BCBS and UnitedHealthcare representing 60% of commercial revenue) and physician retention challenges unique to PE acquisitions (13-25% turnover rates with Ohio non-compete unenforceability).
