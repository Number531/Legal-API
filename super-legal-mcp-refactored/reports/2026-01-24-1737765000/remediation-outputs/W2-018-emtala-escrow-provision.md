#### 1. Transactional Structure Recommendations

**A. EMTALA Compliance Escrow**

To address the $279,000-$327,600 weighted EMTALA exposure and mitigate tail risk from potential pattern violations, the purchase agreement should include a dedicated EMTALA compliance escrow with the following structure:

---

**ARTICLE [X]: EMTALA COMPLIANCE ESCROW**

**Section [X].1 Establishment of EMTALA Escrow Fund.**

(a) At the Closing, Seller shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with [Escrow Agent name] (the "**Escrow Agent**"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of **Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000)** (the "**EMTALA Escrow Fund**"). The EMTALA Escrow Fund shall be held and disbursed in accordance with the terms of this Article [X] and the Escrow Agreement to be executed at Closing in substantially the form attached hereto as **Exhibit [__]**.

(b) **Rationale**: The $5,000,000 escrow amount is calculated to cover (i) pattern violation civil monetary penalties of $200,000-$350,000 (if 2+ additional violations discovered during 10-year statute of limitations period), (ii) single-violation CMPs of $50,000-$133,420 per incident (2025 inflation-adjusted maximum), (iii) system-wide EMTALA policy remediation and training costs estimated at $500,000-$1,000,000, and (iv) tail risk for Medicare provider agreement termination defense costs (see Section IV.B.3, Exposure Summary Table). This amount represents 20x the weighted probability-adjusted exposure of $279,000-$327,600, providing substantial cushion for worst-case pattern violation scenarios.

**Section [X].2 Permitted Uses of EMTALA Escrow Fund.**

Buyer may draw from the EMTALA Escrow Fund for the following purposes, without limitation:

(a) **CMS Civil Monetary Penalties**. Any civil monetary penalties assessed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("**CMS**") pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1)(A) and 42 C.F.R. § 1003.500 et seq. for EMTALA violations occurring prior to the Closing Date, including:

(i) Financial inquiry violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(h);

(ii) Failure to provide appropriate medical screening examination under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a);

(iii) Failure to provide stabilizing treatment under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b);

(iv) Inappropriate transfers of patients with emergency medical conditions under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(c); and

(v) On-call physician refusal violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1)(C).

(b) **Pattern Violation Penalties**. Enhanced civil monetary penalties imposed by CMS for "pattern violations" (two or more EMTALA violations within a five-year period) discovered through (i) CMS Region 5 survey investigations, (ii) Ohio Department of Health complaint investigations, or (iii) retrospective review of hospital incident reports, emergency department transfer logs, or quality review records covering the period January 1, 2020 through the Closing Date.

(c) **Medicare Provider Agreement Termination Defense Costs**. Reasonable attorneys' fees, consulting fees, and expert witness costs incurred by Buyer in defending against any Medicare provider agreement termination proceedings initiated pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 489.53 based on EMTALA violations occurring prior to the Closing Date, including:

(i) Response to CMS 23-day termination notices;

(ii) Administrative appeals to the CMS Medicare Administrative Contractor ("**MAC**");

(iii) Administrative Law Judge ("**ALJ**") hearings; and

(iv) Departmental Appeals Board ("**DAB**") proceedings.

(d) **EMTALA Remediation and Corrective Action Costs**. Costs incurred by Buyer to implement system-wide EMTALA compliance corrective action plans mandated by CMS or voluntarily undertaken to address violations discovered after Closing, including:

(i) Development and implementation of revised financial inquiry prohibition policies across all four Mercy hospitals (Mercy Regional Medical Center, Mercy East Hospital, Mercy Northwest Hospital, Mercy South Hospital);

(ii) Mandatory EMTALA training for emergency department physicians, nurses, registration staff, business office staff, and all 1,200 community physicians with on-call obligations;

(iii) Monthly EMTALA compliance audits of emergency department registration practices, financial counseling timing, and transfer documentation for a minimum period of twenty-four (24) months;

(iv) Retention of external EMTALA compliance consultants to conduct root cause analysis and policy validation; and

(v) Implementation of electronic health record ("**EHR**") workflow modifications to prevent financial inquiry prior to medical screening and stabilization.

(e) **On-Call Physician CMP Indemnification**. Civil monetary penalties assessed against individual on-call physicians (employed or community physicians with privileges) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1)(B) for EMTALA violations occurring prior to the Closing Date, to the extent Buyer incurs liability for such penalties under hospital medical staff bylaws, indemnification agreements, or applicable law.

(f) **State Patient Complaint Investigation Costs**. Costs associated with responding to Ohio Department of Health patient complaints related to EMTALA violations occurring prior to the Closing Date, including document production, staff interviews, and corrective action plan preparation.

**Section [X].3 Escrow Release Schedule.**

The EMTALA Escrow Fund shall be released to Seller in accordance with the following schedule, subject to Section [X].4 (Claim Procedures):

(a) **First Release Date** (Third Anniversary of Closing Date):

(i) **Amount**: Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), representing 40% of the EMTALA Escrow Fund.

(ii) **Condition**: No CMS investigations, findings letters, or civil monetary penalty assessments related to EMTALA violations occurring prior to the Closing Date have been initiated or received during the thirty-six (36) month period following the Closing Date.

(iii) **Rationale**: Three-year period allows for complaint-driven enforcement cycle; CMS enforcement data indicates 85-90% of EMTALA violations are identified within three years of occurrence (see Section IV.B.2, Pattern Violation Risk Analysis).

(b) **Second Release Date** (Sixth Anniversary of Closing Date):

(i) **Amount**: Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), representing an additional 40% of the EMTALA Escrow Fund.

(ii) **Condition**: (A) No pattern violations (two or more EMTALA violations at any single hospital) have been discovered or assessed by CMS, and (B) all corrective action plans implemented pursuant to the July 2023 Mercy East Hospital violation have been sustained with no recidivism for a minimum period of sixty (60) consecutive months.

(iii) **Rationale**: Six-year period provides sufficient time to assess pattern violation risk across all four hospitals and verify sustainability of corrective action (see Section IV.B.3, System-Wide Policy Gap Analysis).

(c) **Final Release Date** (Tenth Anniversary of Closing Date):

(i) **Amount**: One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), representing the remaining 20% of the EMTALA Escrow Fund.

(ii) **Condition**: The ten-year statute of limitations for EMTALA civil monetary penalties has expired without additional penalty assessments related to violations occurring prior to the Closing Date.

(iii) **Rationale**: 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1) imposes a ten-year statute of limitations on EMTALA civil monetary penalty actions; release upon statute expiration eliminates tail risk (see Section IV.B.1, Enforcement Mechanisms).

(d) **Accrued Interest**: All interest and investment earnings accrued on the EMTALA Escrow Fund during each escrow period shall be released proportionally with the principal amounts specified in subsections (a), (b), and (c).

**Section [X].4 Claim Procedures.**

(a) **Buyer Notice of Claim**. If Buyer seeks to draw from the EMTALA Escrow Fund, Buyer shall deliver written notice (an "**Escrow Claim Notice**") to Seller and the Escrow Agent specifying:

(i) The nature of the EMTALA violation or enforcement action giving rise to the claim;

(ii) The specific hospital(s) at which the violation occurred (Mercy Regional, Mercy East, Mercy Northwest, or Mercy South);

(iii) The date(s) on which the violation occurred (which must be prior to the Closing Date);

(iv) The amount claimed from the EMTALA Escrow Fund, with detailed calculation;

(v) Documentation supporting the claim, including: (A) CMS findings letters, penalty assessment notices, or termination notices; (B) invoices from legal counsel or consultants; (C) corrective action plan documentation; or (D) other evidence demonstrating the claimed amount; and

(vi) Citation to the specific permitted use category under Section [X].2 applicable to the claim.

(b) **Seller Objection Right**. Seller shall have thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the Escrow Claim Notice (the "**Objection Period**") to deliver written objection (an "**Objection Notice**") to Buyer and the Escrow Agent. The Objection Notice shall specify with particularity the basis for Seller's objection, including any factual or legal grounds for disputing that the claim constitutes a permitted use under Section [X].2.

(c) **Uncontested Claims**. If Seller does not deliver an Objection Notice within the Objection Period, or if Seller delivers written consent to the claim, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the claimed amount from the EMTALA Escrow Fund to Buyer within five (5) Business Days.

(d) **Contested Claims**. If Seller timely delivers an Objection Notice, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith for fifteen (15) calendar days to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within such fifteen-day period, either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with Article [__] (Dispute Resolution) of this Agreement.

(e) **No Basket or Threshold**. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may draw from the EMTALA Escrow Fund for any individual claim meeting the requirements of Section [X].2, without regard to any minimum claim amount, basket, deductible, or threshold. **Rationale**: EMTALA violations impose strict liability with no scienter requirement (42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1)); accordingly, no de minimis threshold applies.

(f) **Multiple Claims**. Buyer may submit multiple Escrow Claim Notices during the escrow period. The EMTALA Escrow Fund shall remain available for claims until the applicable Release Date under Section [X].3, subject to sufficiency of funds.

**Section [X].5 Survival Period.**

(a) The representations and warranties set forth in Section [__] (EMTALA Compliance Representations) shall survive the Closing for a period of **ten (10) years**, corresponding to the statute of limitations for EMTALA civil monetary penalties under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(1).

(b) **Rationale**: Extended survival period is necessary because EMTALA violations are frequently discovered years after occurrence through complaint-driven enforcement. CMS Region 5 enforcement data indicates discovery lags of 18-60 months are common, and the July 2023 Mercy East violation (affecting conduct in 2021-2023) demonstrates delayed discovery risk (see Section IV.B.2, Pattern Violation Risk).

**Section [X].6 Relationship to General Indemnification.**

(a) The EMTALA Escrow Fund shall serve as Buyer's **sole and exclusive** remedy for EMTALA-related losses, damages, costs, and expenses arising from violations occurring prior to the Closing Date. Buyer waives any right to assert indemnification claims under Article [__] (General Indemnification) for EMTALA matters covered by this Article [X].

(b) **Exception**: If EMTALA-related losses exceed the $5,000,000 EMTALA Escrow Fund cap, Buyer may seek recovery under Article [__] (General Indemnification) for the excess amount, subject to the basket, cap, and survival provisions set forth therein.

(c) **Rationale**: Dedicated EMTALA escrow provides certainty and immediate liquidity for penalty payments without requiring indemnification litigation. $5,000,000 cap provides 15-18x coverage of worst-case pattern violation scenario ($300,000 CMPs + $1,000,000 remediation = $1,300,000 maximum realistic exposure).

**Section [X].7 Tax Treatment.**

(a) For federal income tax purposes, amounts drawn from the EMTALA Escrow Fund to pay CMS civil monetary penalties shall be treated as non-deductible penalties under IRC § 162(f), as confirmed by IRS Notice 2018-23. Buyer acknowledges that such amounts will not reduce taxable income in the year paid.

(b) Amounts drawn from the EMTALA Escrow Fund for remediation costs, training, legal defense, or consultant fees shall be treated as ordinary and necessary business expenses deductible under IRC § 162(a), subject to applicable limitations.

(c) **Cross-Reference**: See Section IV.H (Tax-Exempt Status Conversion) for analysis of post-conversion tax treatment of EMTALA penalties.

**Section [X].8 CMS Cooperation.**

Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in responding to any CMS investigations, findings letters, or penalty assessments related to EMTALA violations occurring prior to the Closing Date, including:

(a) Providing access to former Mercy employees for interviews and depositions;

(b) Producing historical medical records, incident reports, quality review documentation, emergency department logs, and transfer records;

(c) Executing authorizations for release of patient health information to CMS or the HHS Office of Inspector General; and

(d) Providing expert testimony, if necessary, regarding pre-Closing EMTALA policies, procedures, and training practices.

Such cooperation shall be provided at Buyer's expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees for Seller's counsel review of CMS submissions).

---

**B. Due Diligence Requirements (Pre-Closing Conditions)**

Before closing, Buyer should require Seller to provide:

1. **CMS Region 5 Complete Investigation History (2020-2024)**: All findings letters, investigation reports, penalty assessments, and corrective action correspondence for all four hospitals (CCNs 360001, 360285, 360312, 360198).

2. **System-Wide EMTALA Policy Verification**: Written confirmation that the financial inquiry prohibition policy, staff training, and monthly auditing implemented at Mercy East Hospital in September 2024 have been deployed to Mercy Regional Medical Center, Mercy Northwest Hospital, and Mercy South Hospital, with supporting documentation:
   - Updated policy manuals with revision dates
   - Training completion records for 100% of ED registration and business office staff
   - First 6 months of monthly audit results (September 2024 - February 2025)

3. **On-Call Physician EMTALA Training Documentation**: Evidence of EMTALA training completion for all 1,200 community physicians with on-call obligations, including training content addressing:
   - Prohibition on insurance-based refusals under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a)
   - Individual physician CMP liability ($133,420 per violation)
   - Medical staff privileging consequences for EMTALA violations

4. **Historical On-Call Refusal Audit**: Review of on-call logs from 2020-2024 for all four hospitals to identify any documented on-call refusals, with root cause analysis for each refusal to determine if insurance status was a factor.

5. **Ohio Department of Health Complaint Log**: Complete patient complaint records from ODH for all four hospitals (2020-2024), including complaints related to emergency department delays, financial counseling, transfers, or on-call specialist availability.

If the above due diligence reveals (i) 2 or more additional EMTALA violations (pattern violation), or (ii) failure to implement system-wide corrective action at all four hospitals, Buyer should require either (a) pre-closing remediation with CMS verification, or (b) increase the EMTALA Escrow Fund to $7,500,000-$10,000,000 to account for heightened pattern violation risk.

**C. Purchase Price Adjustment Recommendation**

No purchase price adjustment is recommended for EMTALA exposure. The $279,000-$327,600 weighted exposure represents 0.011-0.014% of the $2.4 billion purchase price and is immaterial relative to transaction size. The $5,000,000 escrow (208% of transaction price basis points) provides adequate protection without warranting direct price reduction.

**Rationale**: Unlike the $714 million tax conversion exposure (warranting $600 million price reduction) or the $800 million commercial contracts exposure (warranting $400 million price reduction), EMTALA exposure falls within normal transactional risk tolerance for healthcare M&A. Escrow mechanism is sufficient to address tail risk.
