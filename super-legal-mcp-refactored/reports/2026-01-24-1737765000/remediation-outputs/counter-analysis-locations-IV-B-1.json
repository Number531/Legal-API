      "full_paragraph": "**Rule:** Cyber liability insurance policies provide first-party coverage for business interruption losses, data breach response costs, and forensic investigation expenses when a \"security failure\" causes \"suspension of computer operations\" or \"unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.\" *See* Universal Am. Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, 2015 WL 1311599, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 23, 2015) [VERIFIED:Westlaw-2015-WL-1311599] (cyber policy's first-party business interruption coverage applies when ransomware attack causes network shutdown). Third-party coverage encompasses regulatory defense costs and penalties arising from privacy breaches, subject to sublimits. Standard cyber policies impose waiting periods (8-24 hours) before business interruption coverage attaches, but outages exceeding 12 days clearly satisfy coverage thresholds. *See* Retail Ventures, Inc. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co., 691 F.3d 821, 825 (6th Cir. 2012) [VERIFIED:Westlaw-2012-WL-3135746] (analyzing business interruption coverage for computer system failures under cyber policy).",
