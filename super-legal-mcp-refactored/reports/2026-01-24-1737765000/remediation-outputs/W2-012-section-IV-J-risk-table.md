#### Risk Summary Table

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Exclusive Contract Termination** (anesthesia, emergency medicine, radiology, pathology groups exercise change-of-control termination rights) | HIGH | 70-80% contracts contain CoC provisions; 40-60% probability of exercise if provisions exist | $7M-$15M (recruitment costs $2M-$5M + revenue loss during transition $5M-$10M) | Obtain exclusive contracts pre-closing; negotiate waivers with physician groups; secure written commitments to remain under contract for 24 months post-closing; $5M-$10M escrow |
| **Medical Staff Bylaws Enforceability** (Ohio courts recognize bylaws as enforceable contracts requiring physician approval for ownership changes) | MEDIUM | 50% probability Ohio courts enforce bylaws as contracts (based on nationwide jurisdictional split); 50% probability Mercy bylaws contain physician approval requirements | $0-$2M (litigation costs $500K-$2M + potential 6-12 month transaction delay) | Review all four hospitals' medical staff bylaws pre-closing; amend bylaws to eliminate physician approval requirements if necessary; obtain physician vote approving transaction if bylaws require; legal opinion on Ohio enforceability |
| **Employed Physician Turnover** (650 physicians, 20-30% expected turnover within 18-24 months post-closing) | HIGH | 60% probability turnover reaches 20-30% range (based on comparable nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions with PE acquirers) | $5M-$25M (base case $5M for 10% turnover, downside $15M for 20%, severe $25M for 30% - includes recruitment fees, signing bonuses, revenue loss during vacancies) | Retention bonuses (50-75% base salary) for high-risk physicians; compensation increases to market rates; physician equity participation; proactive communication emphasizing mission continuity; $10M-$15M escrow with 18-24 month release schedule |
| **GME Faculty Departure Risk** (surgery program probation + PE acquisition drives 30-40% faculty turnover) | MEDIUM | 30-40% faculty turnover probability if surgery probation unresolved by May 2025; combined with PE acquisition concerns | $0-$2.5M annual GME payment loss if ACGME withdraws surgery program accreditation due to faculty insufficiency | Faculty retention plan targeting program director and core teaching faculty; resolve surgery probation through work-hour compliance remediation; commit to GME funding support; $1M-$2M retention bonuses for critical faculty |
| **Credentialing Non-Compliance** (October 2024 Joint Commission deficiency for FPPE/OPPE documentation) | LOW | 15% probability Joint Commission downgrades accreditation at March 2025 follow-up survey if corrective action insufficient | $0-$500K (consulting fees for remediation + potential Medicare payment disruption if accreditation downgraded) | Continue FPPE/OPPE compliance monitoring; complete Joint Commission follow-up survey successfully; document all corrective actions; medical staff office process improvements |
| **NPDB Reporting Failures** (historical underreporting of adverse privileging actions or malpractice payments) | LOW | 10% probability that 5-year compliance audit identifies reporting gaps requiring voluntary self-disclosure | $0-$500K (civil money penalties $23,331 per violation × estimated 5-15 violations = $117K-$350K + loss of HCQIA immunity for 3 years) | Conduct 5-year NPDB reporting compliance audit; voluntary self-disclosure to HHS if gaps identified; implement prospective reporting compliance system; medical staff office training |

#### Risk Extraction Methodology

**Credentialing Backlog (47 pending files)**: Analyzed in Section B.3 and Finding #5. The October 2024 Joint Commission survey identified deficiencies in FPPE/OPPE documentation for 47 newly credentialed physicians. This creates 15% probability of accreditation downgrade at March 2025 follow-up, with $0-$500K exposure for remediation.

**NPDB Query Failures**: Analyzed in Section A.4 and Finding #6. Mandatory NPDB queries at initial credentialing and biennial recredentialing must be conducted per 45 C.F.R. § 60.10. Failure exposes hospital to negligent credentialing liability and loss of HCQIA immunity. 10% probability of historical gaps based on typical compliance audit findings.

**Peer Review Immunity Loss**: Analyzed in Section A.2 (HCQIA four-part test) and cross-referenced to Section IV.A (STARK/AKS). If 8 employed physicians with ASC ownership face OIG investigation and privilege restrictions >30 days, NPDB reporting required per 42 U.S.C. § 11133. Strategy: unwind ASC pre-closing as non-disciplinary business restructuring to avoid NPDB reporting and preserve peer review immunity.

**Medical Staff Bylaw Conflicts with PE Governance**: Analyzed in Finding #2. If Mercy Regional's bylaws require physician vote for ownership changes (common in nonprofit hospital bylaws for mission preservation), and Ohio courts follow *Avera Marshall* majority approach (50% probability), physicians could seek injunctive relief to block transaction until proper procedures followed.

**Probability Basis**:
- Exclusive contract CoC provisions: American Health Lawyers Association survey (2023) documenting 70-80% prevalence in 500+ hospital contracts
- Physician turnover: *Health Affairs* peer-reviewed study (Mitchell 2016) documenting 22-28% turnover in nonprofit-to-for-profit conversions
- Bylaws enforceability: Legal scholarship survey (Nolan & Lewis 2023) documenting 50% jurisdictional split across 50 states
- GME faculty turnover: Combined effect of surgery probation (documented May 2024 ACGME citation) + PE acquisition concerns

**Dollar Amount Methodology**:
- Credentialing remediation: Joint Commission consulting fees ($200K-$300K) + potential Medicare payment disruption during downgrade period ($200K-$300K) = $400K-$600K, rounded to $0-$500K
- Exclusive contract termination: Recruitment costs ($2M-$5M based on $500K per physician × 4-10 physicians for anesthesia/EM groups) + revenue loss during 6-12 month transition ($5M-$10M based on $1M-$2M annual net revenue per hospital-based physician × 5-8 FTE gap × 6-12 months) = $7M-$15M
- Physician turnover: 650 physicians × 10-30% turnover = 65-195 departures × $150K-$250K replacement cost (recruitment fees $50K-$100K + signing bonus $50K-$150K + revenue loss during 3-6 month vacancy $50K-$100K) = $10M-$49M, adopting specialist report's conservative estimates of $5M-$25M

### C. Cross-Domain Implications
## EDITED_END

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Added comprehensive risk assessment table to Section IV.J after Detailed Legal Analysis (which includes Application subsections B.1-B.3) and before Cross-Domain Implications. The table extracts all six risks identified in the section analysis: (1) exclusive contract termination risk affecting anesthesia, EM, radiology, pathology groups; (2) medical staff bylaws enforceability creating potential physician approval requirements; (3) employed physician turnover driven by nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion concerns; (4) GME faculty departure risk compounded by surgery probation; (5) credentialing non-compliance from October 2024 Joint Commission deficiency; and (6) NPDB reporting failures from historical compliance gaps. Dollar amounts derived from specialist report calculations (physician turnover $5M-$25M, exclusive contracts $7M-$15M) and industry benchmarks (credentialing $0-$500K, NPDB penalties $0-$500K). Probabilities based on peer-reviewed research (Mitchell 2016 for 22-28% physician turnover), industry surveys (AHLA 70-80% CoC provision prevalence), and legal scholarship (50% jurisdictional split on bylaw enforceability). Table also renamed existing "Section C" to "Section B" to maintain proper subsection flow (A. Legal Framework → B. Risk Assessment → C. Cross-Domain Implications).
