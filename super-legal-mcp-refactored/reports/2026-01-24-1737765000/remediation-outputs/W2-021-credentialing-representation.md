**(c) No Adverse Actions or Investigations.** Except as disclosed on Schedule [X].1(c), as of the Closing Date:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) No Medical Staff Member is subject to a pending adverse action, professional review action, or investigation by: (A) the Hospital's peer review committee, medical executive committee, or governing board; (B) the Ohio State Medical Board or any other state medical licensing authority; (C) the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); (D) the Office of Inspector General (Medicare/Medicaid exclusion list); or (E) any professional liability insurer;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Seller has no Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in: (A) denial, suspension, or revocation of any Medical Staff Member's clinical privileges; (B) exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs; or (C) loss of state medical licensure; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) All peer review activities conducted at each Hospital during the past five (5) years have complied with the Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) four-part test for immunity under 42 U.S.C. § 11112(a), including: reasonable belief in quality improvement, reasonable effort to obtain facts, adequate due process, and reasonable belief that action was warranted.

**(d) Medical Staff Bylaws Compliance.** The medical staff bylaws, rules and regulations, and credentialing policies for each Hospital (collectively, "Medical Staff Bylaws"):
