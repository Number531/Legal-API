**(a) Extended Reporting Periods.** Seller shall, at Seller's expense, obtain extended reporting period endorsements ("ERP Endorsements" or "Tail Coverage") for the following claims-made insurance policies maintained by Seller as of the Closing Date:

    (i) **Medical Professional Liability Insurance.** Ten (10)-year extended reporting period covering all claims arising from medical services rendered prior to the Closing Date and reported at any time during the ten-year period following policy termination. ERP Endorsement shall cover all 650 employed physicians listed on Schedule [X] (Medical Staff List).

**(b) Required Limits.** The ERP Endorsements procured by Seller pursuant to Section [X](a) shall provide coverage limits not less than:

    (i) **Medical Professional Liability:** $1,000,000 per claim / $3,000,000 aggregate (matching current policy limits), with self-insured retention not to exceed $1,000,000 per claim.

    (ii) **General Liability:** $5,000,000 per occurrence / $10,000,000 aggregate.

    (iii) **Cyber Liability:** $25,000,000 per occurrence / $25,000,000 aggregate (enhanced from current $15,000,000 limits to address identified HIPAA ransomware breach exposure), with regulatory penalty sublimit not less than $5,000,000.

**(c) D&O Run-Off Policy.** Buyer shall procure, at Buyer's expense (subject to Section [X](d)(ii) below), a six (6)-year directors and officers liability insurance run-off policy (the "D&O Run-Off Policy") providing coverage for acts or omissions of Seller's directors and officers occurring prior to the Closing Date and claims reported at any time during the six-year period following the Closing Date. The D&O Run-Off Policy shall:

    (i) Provide coverage limits of not less than $25,000,000 per claim and in the aggregate;

    (ii) Name Buyer as successor-in-interest to Seller with rights to maintain and control claims under the policy;

    (iii) Include coverage for defense costs on a first-dollar basis (no retention for defense costs);

    (iv) Not contain material coverage exclusions more restrictive than Seller's existing D&O policy as of the date hereof (copy attached as Exhibit [X]).

**(d) Cost Allocation.**

    (i) **Seller's Obligations.** Seller shall bear the full cost of ERP Endorsements procured pursuant to Section [X](a), estimated as follows:
        - Medical Professional Liability Tail: $4,500,000 to $15,000,000 (150-300% of annual premium)
        - General Liability Tail: $50,000 to $150,000
        - Cyber Liability Tail (Enhanced Limits): $200,000 to $600,000

    (ii) **Buyer's Obligations.** Buyer shall bear the cost of the D&O Run-Off Policy procured pursuant to Section [X](c), estimated at $375,000 to $750,000. The actual cost of the D&O Run-Off Policy shall be treated as a working capital adjustment reducing the Final Purchase Price on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to a cap of $750,000.

    (iii) **Purchase Price Reduction.** The Purchase Price shall be reduced by the actual cost of Medical Professional Liability Tail Coverage purchased by Seller pursuant to Section [X](a)(i), up to a maximum reduction of $15,000,000. If the actual cost of Medical Professional Liability Tail Coverage exceeds $15,000,000, Seller shall bear such excess cost without additional purchase price reduction.

**(e) Evidence of Coverage.** Seller shall deliver to Buyer:

    (i) **Quotations.** Within thirty (30) days following execution of this Agreement, written quotations from The Doctors Company, ProAssurance, or MEDPLI for Medical Professional Liability Tail Coverage, and from Seller's current carriers for General Liability and Cyber Liability Tail Coverage, setting forth proposed coverage terms and premiums.

    (ii) **Binders.** Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, binders or commitment letters from insurers confirming agreement to issue ERP Endorsements upon payment of specified premiums at Closing.

    (iii) **Certificates of Insurance.** At Closing, certificates of insurance evidencing that all ERP Endorsements required by Section [X](a) have been issued and are in full force and effect, with premiums paid in full.

    (iv) **Named Insured Provisions.** All ERP Endorsements and the D&O Run-Off Policy shall include provisions naming Buyer as successor-in-interest to Seller with respect to pre-Closing claims, and providing that Buyer has the right to submit claims and receive insurance proceeds directly from insurers.

**(f) Alternative—Nose Coverage.** If, within sixty (60) days following execution of this Agreement, Buyer's medical professional liability insurance carrier agrees to provide prior acts coverage ("Nose Coverage") for pre-Closing medical services rendered by Seller's 650 employed physicians at a total cost (inclusive of any increased retention, premium differential, or policy modifications) less than the quotations obtained pursuant to Section [X](e)(i), then:

    (i) Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to allocate Nose Coverage costs between the parties, with Seller's contribution not to exceed the lower of: (A) the quoted cost of Medical Professional Liability Tail Coverage, or (B) fifty percent (50%) of the Nose Coverage cost.

    (ii) If the parties agree to utilize Nose Coverage in lieu of Medical Professional Liability Tail Coverage, Seller's obligation to purchase Medical Professional Liability Tail Coverage pursuant to Section [X](a)(i) shall be waived, and the Purchase Price reduction pursuant to Section [X](d)(iii) shall be replaced by a payment from Seller to Buyer (or offset against amounts otherwise payable to Seller) equal to Seller's agreed Nose Coverage contribution.

    (iii) Seller shall retain the obligation to purchase General Liability and Cyber Liability Tail Coverage pursuant to Section [X](a)(ii) and (iii) regardless of whether the parties elect Nose Coverage for Medical Professional Liability.

**(g) Closing Condition.** The obligations of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to Seller's delivery of the certificates of insurance required by Section [X](e)(iii), evidencing that all ERP Endorsements required by Section [X](a) have been issued and are in full force and effect. Buyer's failure to obtain the D&O Run-Off Policy shall not excuse Buyer's obligations to close, but Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the D&O Run-Off Policy on terms consistent with Section [X](c).

**(h) Cross-Reference to Section IV.M.** The insurance tail coverage requirements set forth in this Section [X] address the following findings identified in Section IV.M (Insurance Coverage and Risk Transfer) of the Due Diligence Memorandum dated January 24, 2026:

    (i) Medical professional liability tail coverage requirement ($4.5M-$15M exposure) to avoid coverage gaps for claims arising from pre-Closing medical services rendered under claims-made policies.

    (ii) Cyber insurance limits inadequacy ($15M policy vs. $12.6M-$32.5M HIPAA ransomware breach exposure), requiring enhanced $25M tail coverage with $5M regulatory penalty sublimit.

    (iii) D&O fines/penalties exclusion ($2M-$5M uninsured STARK/AKS settlement exposure), necessitating D&O run-off policy to preserve defense cost coverage for pre-Closing acts.

    (iv) General liability tail coverage to address premises liability and professional services claims arising from pre-Closing operations.
```

**Purchase Price Adjustment (Article II, Section 2.2—Tail Coverage Reduction):**
```
The Purchase Price shall be reduced by the actual cost of Medical Professional Liability Tail Coverage purchased by Seller pursuant to Section [X](a)(i), up to a maximum reduction of $15,000,000. The cost of the D&O Run-Off Policy purchased by Buyer pursuant to Section [X](c) shall be treated as a working capital adjustment reducing the Final Purchase Price on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to a cap of $750,000. See Section [X](d) (Cost Allocation) for detailed allocation terms.

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Expanded the MPL tail coverage provision into a comprehensive insurance tail coverage section addressing all four key insurance gaps identified in Section IV.M: (1) medical professional liability tail coverage ($4.5M-$15M), (2) cyber liability enhanced tail coverage with $25M limits addressing HIPAA breach exposure, (3) D&O run-off policy for pre-closing acts, and (4) general liability tail coverage. The provision now includes specific coverage periods (10-year ERP for MPL/GL/cyber, 6-year for D&O), minimum coverage limits ($1M/$3M MPL, $5M/$10M GL, $25M cyber with $5M regulatory sublimit, $25M D&O), detailed cost allocation (Seller pays tail costs, Buyer pays D&O with working capital offset up to $750K), evidence delivery requirements (quotations within 30 days, binders 5 days pre-closing, certificates at closing), named insured provisions for successor-in-interest coverage, and alternative nose coverage negotiation option. Cross-references Section IV.M findings and addresses total uninsured exposure of $7.55M-$52.55M.
