### A. Legal Framework

The acquisition of Mercy Regional Health System requires navigation of Medicare provider agreement change of ownership requirements, which are critical to preserving $864 million in annual Medicare revenue (48% of net patient revenue). This section analyzes the controlling legal framework governing automatic assignment, notification timelines, deemed status preservation, and Medicare payment programs.

#### Risk Assessment Table

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **CHOW Notification Failure** - CMS Form 855A not submitted within 30 days triggers Medicare payment suspension | CRITICAL | 15% [Based on transaction complexity involving 4 CCNs and private equity ownership disclosure requirements under 42 CFR § 424.519] | $144M-$216M (2-3 month working capital gap at $72M/month Medicare revenue) | Pre-complete CMS Form 855A for all 4 facilities; submit electronically via PECOS on closing date; secure $100M-$150M working capital facility; liquidated damages provision ($5M) for notification failure |
| **CCN Transfer/Assignment Rejection** - Voluntary rejection of automatic assignment under 42 CFR § 489.18(c) constitutes termination requiring 3-12 month re-certification | CRITICAL | 5% [Low probability as rejection is economically irrational, but included for completeness] | $216M-$864M (complete Medicare revenue cessation during re-certification period; also terminates Medicare Advantage contracts worth $180M annually) | Mandatory acceptance covenant in purchase agreement as condition precedent; buyer representation that acceptance is irrevocable; education on catastrophic consequences of rejection |
| **DSH Reclassification Risk** - For-profit conversion has no direct DSH impact, but assignment rejection creates 1-2 year DSH payment gap during recalculation | MEDIUM | 3.5% [70% probability of gap × 5% assignment rejection probability] | $8.5M annually in DSH payments lost during 1-2 year recalculation period = $8.5M-$17M total exposure | Accept automatic assignment (same mitigation as CCN transfer); DSH qualification based on patient mix (Medicare SSI fraction + Medicaid fraction >15%), not tax status, so for-profit conversion preserves eligibility |
| **GME Payment Continuity Risk** - Teaching hospital designation and resident FTE caps tied to Medicare provider agreements; rejection disrupts $27M annual DGME/IME payments | HIGH | 5% [Tied directly to assignment rejection probability] | $27M annually in GME payments (Direct GME + Indirect GME under 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(h) and (d)(5)(B)); FTE cap does not automatically transfer if provider agreement terminates | Accept automatic assignment; verify teaching hospital designation transfers with provider agreement; ensure residency program accreditation continuity |
| **Joint Commission Deemed Status Loss** - March 2025 follow-up survey addressing October 2024 deficiencies determines deemed status continuity | HIGH | 12.5% [5% preliminary denial pathway + 7.5% CMS validation survey pathway if timing misalignment] | $5M-$10M direct CMS survey costs and corrective actions; $250M maximum if deemed status loss leads to Medicare termination (low probability tail risk) | Make March 2025 TJC survey satisfactory completion a closing condition OR establish $5M-$10M escrow; hand hygiene compliance must reach 90% target (currently 88%); leverage Mercy South precedent (similar deficiencies corrected successfully 2021-2022) |
| **HRRP Penalty Continuation** - Hospital Readmission Reduction Program penalty (-0.8% current) based on pre-closing performance (July 2021-June 2024 period); change of ownership does not reset penalty | MEDIUM | 75% [High probability penalty continues at current level; 10% probability increases to -1.0% to -1.5%] | $6.9M annually at current -0.8% penalty level; potential increase to $8.6M (-1.0%) or $12.9M (-1.5% maximum) announced August 2025 for FY 2026 | Budget $6.9M annual penalty in pro forma as certain cost; invest $2M-$3M annually in readmission reduction programs for 3-year improvement timeline; FY 2027-2028 penalty reduction possible with sustained quality improvement |
| **EMTALA Pattern Violation Risk** - July 2023 Mercy East violation creates pattern risk if 2+ violations occur within 3 years (pattern triggers Medicare termination threat) | MEDIUM | 10% [Based on 1 existing violation; industry baseline for additional violations; complaint-driven enforcement creates uncertainty] | $50K-$250K civil monetary penalties under 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d); $864M termination risk if pattern established (2+ violations) with <5% probability of actual termination | Pre-closing EMTALA compliance audit at all 4 hospitals; seller rep/warranty that no additional violations since August 2024; indemnification for pre-closing violations; strengthen on-call specialist credentialing (addresses October 2024 TJC deficiency #4 credentialing gap) |

**Table Notes:**

1. **Probability Methodology**:
   - CHOW notification failure (15%): Based on coordination complexity across 4 facilities and private equity beneficial ownership disclosure requirements extending processing timelines
   - Assignment rejection (5%): Expert judgment that rational acquirers always accept assignment; included only for completeness
   - DSH reclassification (3.5%): Conditional probability (70% gap probability × 5% rejection probability)
   - GME continuity (5%): Directly tied to assignment rejection
   - TJC deemed status (12.5%): Joint Commission preliminary denial (5%) + CMS validation survey timing misalignment (7.5%)
   - HRRP continuation (75%): High confidence penalty persists based on performance period data
   - EMTALA pattern (10%): Industry baseline for additional violations given 1 existing violation and complaint-driven enforcement

2. **Exposure Calculation Basis**:
   - Medicare revenue: $864M annually ($72M monthly) comprising Traditional Medicare FFS (38% = $684M) and Medicare Advantage (10% = $180M)
   - CHOW notification: $72M/month × 2-3 month suspension = $144M-$216M
   - Assignment rejection: 3-12 month re-certification period × $72M/month = $216M-$864M
   - DSH payments: $8.5M annually × 1-2 year gap = $8.5M-$17M
   - GME payments: $27M annually (combined DGME + IME)
   - TJC deemed status: Direct costs $5M-$10M; tail risk $250M if termination (weighted expected value $39.2M)
   - HRRP penalty: Base operating DRG payments × penalty percentage (current -0.8% = $6.9M)
   - EMTALA: CMP $133,420 per violation (hospitals with 100+ beds, 2025 inflation-adjusted); termination threat if pattern

3. **Mitigation Priorities**:
   - **Tier 1 (CRITICAL)**: CHOW notification and assignment acceptance are buyer-controllable risks that must be eliminated through contract covenants and operational execution
   - **Tier 2 (HIGH)**: TJC deemed status and GME continuity require closing conditions or escrows to protect buyer
   - **Tier 3 (MEDIUM)**: HRRP penalty is certain ongoing cost requiring pro forma adjustment; DSH and EMTALA are contingent risks with targeted mitigations
