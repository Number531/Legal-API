## DRAFTED PROVISION

### ARTICLE [X]: JOINT COMMISSION ACCREDITATION CONDITION

**Section [X].1 Joint Commission Accreditation Closing Condition.**

(a) **Condition Precedent to Buyer's Obligation.** Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is conditioned upon Mercy Regional Medical Center's successful completion of the Joint Commission follow-up survey scheduled for March 2025 (the "March 2025 Survey"), evidenced by written confirmation from The Joint Commission that Mercy Regional Medical Center has achieved one of the following accreditation statuses:

> (i) **"Accreditation"** (full accreditation with no follow-up survey required);
>
> (ii) **"Accreditation with Requirements for Improvement"** (full accreditation maintained with specified corrective action mandates but no downgrade to Preliminary Denial or Denial status); or
>
> (iii) **"Accreditation with Follow-up Survey"** (full accreditation maintained with on-site follow-up survey required within six (6) months).

(b) **Evidence of Accreditation Status.** Seller shall provide Buyer with a certified copy of The Joint Commission's official accreditation decision letter for Mercy Regional Medical Center within five (5) business days of receipt from The Joint Commission. The March 2025 Survey must occur at least ninety (90) days before the scheduled Closing Date to permit adequate time for accreditation decision issuance and review.

(c) **Failure to Satisfy Condition.** If the March 2025 Survey results in:

> (i) **"Preliminary Denial of Accreditation"** (requiring substantial compliance demonstration within sixty (60) days); or
>
> (ii) **"Denial of Accreditation"** (deemed status lost, triggering CMS validation survey obligation under 42 C.F.R. § 488.5);

then Buyer shall have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion by written notice to Seller within ten (10) business days of receipt of The Joint Commission's decision letter, to either:

> (A) **Terminate this Agreement** without liability or penalty to Buyer, with immediate return of all Buyer deposits and escrowed funds, and mutual release of all obligations except for surviving indemnities and confidentiality obligations; **OR**
>
> (B) **Proceed to Closing** pursuant to the Alternative Escrow provisions set forth in Section [X].2 below.

---

**Section [X].2 Alternative Escrow for Deemed Status Risk.**

(a) **Escrow Establishment.** If the March 2025 Survey has not occurred at least ninety (90) days before the scheduled Closing Date, or if Buyer elects to proceed to Closing following a Preliminary Denial or Denial of Accreditation decision pursuant to Section [X].1(c)(B), then at Closing, Seller shall deposit into a separate escrow account (the "**Joint Commission Escrow Account**") the amount of **Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000)** (the "**JC Escrow Amount**").

(b) **Purpose of Escrow.** The Joint Commission Escrow Account shall serve as security for Buyer's potential losses arising from Mercy Regional Medical Center's loss of deemed status under 42 C.F.R. § 488.5, including without limitation:

> (i) Costs of CMS direct certification surveys (estimated at $250,000-$500,000 per survey cycle);
>
> (ii) Costs of compliance consultants, corrective action implementation, and remediation programs required to restore Joint Commission accreditation or achieve CMS Conditions of Participation compliance;
>
> (iii) Losses resulting from Medicare payment suspensions or delays during the CMS validation survey period;
>
> (iv) Costs of Joint Commission re-survey fees, follow-up surveys, and consultant engagement for accreditation restoration;
>
> (v) Increased survey preparation costs arising from transition to direct CMS oversight regime (resurveys every 12-36 months instead of Joint Commission triennial surveys);
>
> (vi) Legal fees, expert witness fees, and defense costs related to any CMS termination proceedings or administrative appeals under 42 C.F.R. § 489.53.

(c) **Escrow Duration.** The Joint Commission Escrow Account shall remain in effect for twenty-four (24) months from the Closing Date (the "**JC Escrow Period**"), unless earlier released pursuant to Section [X].2(d).

(d) **Escrow Release Conditions.** The JC Escrow Amount shall be released as follows:

> (i) **Full Release Upon Accreditation Restoration.** If, at any time during the JC Escrow Period, Mercy Regional Medical Center receives written confirmation from The Joint Commission that it has achieved "Accreditation" status (full accreditation with no follow-up survey required), the entire JC Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller within ten (10) business days of Buyer's receipt of such confirmation.
>
> (ii) **Partial Release at 12 Months.** If no deemed status loss has occurred and Mercy Regional Medical Center maintains "Accreditation with Requirements for Improvement" or "Accreditation with Follow-up Survey" status as of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, then Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (50% of JC Escrow Amount) shall be released to Seller.
>
> (iii) **Final Release at 24 Months.** Any remaining JC Escrow Amount not previously released or drawn upon shall be released to Seller upon expiration of the JC Escrow Period, provided that Mercy Regional Medical Center continues to maintain Joint Commission accreditation (other than "Preliminary Denial" or "Denial" status) and has not experienced deemed status loss.

(e) **Drawdown Rights.** Buyer shall have the right to draw from the Joint Commission Escrow Account, without further consent or approval from Seller, to reimburse itself for any losses, costs, or expenses described in Section [X].2(b) upon written notice to the Escrow Agent and Seller specifying:

> (i) The nature of the loss, cost, or expense incurred;
>
> (ii) The amount being drawn from the Joint Commission Escrow Account;
>
> (iii) Documentary evidence supporting the drawdown (invoices, payment records, CMS correspondence, Joint Commission decision letters, or other reasonable supporting documentation).

Seller shall have ten (10) business days to object to any drawdown notice. If Seller timely objects, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith to resolve the dispute within fifteen (15) business days. If the parties cannot resolve the dispute, the matter shall be submitted to expedited arbitration pursuant to Article [XX] (Dispute Resolution) of this Agreement.

(f) **Excess Losses.** If Buyer's total losses, costs, and expenses arising from deemed status loss exceed the JC Escrow Amount, Buyer shall be entitled to seek indemnification from Seller pursuant to Article [VIII] (Indemnification), subject to the indemnification cap and survival periods set forth therein; provided, however, that any amounts drawn from the Joint Commission Escrow Account shall reduce dollar-for-dollar any indemnification obligations owed by Seller under Article [VIII] for Joint Commission-related claims.

**Section [X].3 Seller Covenants Regarding Joint Commission Accreditation.**

Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller covenants and agrees to:

(a) **Timely Evidence of Standards Compliance ("ESC") Submission.** File with The Joint Commission a complete and accurate Evidence of Standards Compliance submission addressing all deficiencies identified in the October 14-16, 2024 Joint Commission survey no later than **February 15, 2025**, including:

> (i) Documentation of corrective actions implemented for all eight (8) deficiencies (four significant, four minor) cited in the October 2024 survey;
>
> (ii) Evidence of sustainability of corrective actions, including engineering controls (Pyxis automated dispensing cabinets, magnetic hold-open devices on fire doors), software systems (VerityStream credentialing software), and enhanced monitoring programs (hand hygiene electronic monitoring, leadership rounding);
>
> (iii) Certification that hand hygiene compliance has achieved and sustained ≥90% compliance as of February 2025;
>
> (iv) Primary source verification currency for all 1,850 physician credentialing files (650 employed + 1,200 privileged physicians).

(b) **Buyer Observation Rights.** Grant Buyer and its designated representatives (including healthcare regulatory consultants and Joint Commission specialists) the right to observe the March 2025 Survey, subject to The Joint Commission's observer policies and Seller's reasonable confidentiality and non-interference requirements. Seller shall provide Buyer with at least ten (10) business days' advance notice of the confirmed March 2025 Survey dates.

(c) **Weekly Status Updates.** Provide Buyer with written status updates every Friday between the date of this Agreement and the completion of the March 2025 Survey, detailing:

> (i) Progress on corrective action implementation and sustainability;
>
> (ii) Hand hygiene compliance rates (by hospital unit and aggregate);
>
> (iii) Any communications with or correspondence from The Joint Commission regarding the March 2025 Survey scheduling, ESC submission review, or accreditation status;
>
> (iv) Any new deficiencies, patient safety concerns, or compliance issues that could affect the March 2025 Survey outcome.

(d) **Prohibition on Contracts Requiring Deemed Status.** Not enter into, amend, or renew any commercial insurance contracts, Medicare Advantage plan participation agreements, or other payer contracts that require Joint Commission accreditation or deemed status as a condition of network participation, reimbursement eligibility, or rate maintenance, without Buyer's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Seller acknowledges that loss of Joint Commission accreditation may trigger termination rights or rate renegotiation provisions in existing commercial payer contracts, creating additional commercial risk beyond CMS deemed status loss.

(e) **No Voluntary Surveys or Policy Changes.** Not request any voluntary Joint Commission surveys, substantial expansion surveys, or policy interpretation requests that could trigger additional survey activities or accreditation reviews before the March 2025 Survey is successfully completed.

(f) **Cooperation with Joint Commission.** Cooperate fully and promptly with all Joint Commission requests, inquiries, document production demands, and survey scheduling communications. Seller shall not delay, obstruct, or hinder The Joint Commission's March 2025 Survey preparation or conduct.

(g) **Notification of Adverse Developments.** Immediately notify Buyer (within two (2) business days) of:

> (i) Any communication from The Joint Commission indicating potential rescheduling, postponement, or cancellation of the March 2025 Survey;
>
> (ii) Any immediate jeopardy findings, condition-level deficiencies, or patient safety incidents occurring at Mercy Regional Medical Center that could affect the March 2025 Survey outcome;
>
> (iii) Any CMS validation survey activity, state licensure investigations, or patient complaints filed with the Ohio Department of Health or CMS Region 5 regarding Mercy Regional Medical Center;
>
> (iv) Any indication from The Joint Commission that the ESC submission is incomplete, inadequate, or requires supplementation.

**Section [X].4 Additional Termination Rights.**

(a) **Seller Refusal to Cooperate.** If Seller materially breaches any covenant in Section [X].3 and fails to cure such breach within ten (10) business days of written notice from Buyer, Buyer may terminate this Agreement without liability or penalty, with immediate return of all Buyer deposits and escrowed funds.

(b) **March 2025 Survey Not Completed.** If the March 2025 Survey has not occurred by **June 1, 2025**, through no fault of Buyer, and Seller has not received written confirmation from The Joint Commission that Mercy Regional Medical Center's accreditation status has been resolved, then Buyer may elect to:

> (i) Extend the Closing Date by up to ninety (90) days to permit completion of the March 2025 Survey and receipt of The Joint Commission's accreditation decision; **OR**
>
> (ii) Proceed to Closing pursuant to the Alternative Escrow provisions in Section [X].2; **OR**
>
> (iii) Terminate this Agreement without liability or penalty to Buyer.

**Section [X].5 Cross-Reference to Risk Analysis.**

The parties acknowledge that the Joint Commission accreditation condition and Alternative Escrow provisions are based on the risk analysis set forth in **Section IV.G (Joint Commission Accreditation and Deemed Status)** of the due diligence memorandum dated [DATE], which quantifies:

- 12.5% probability of deemed status loss if the March 2025 Survey results in Preliminary Denial or Denial of Accreditation;
- $39.2 million weighted expected value exposure;
- $1.26 billion annual Medicare and Medicaid revenue at risk if deemed status lost and Medicare provider agreement terminated;
- $15 million escrow amount representing 38.3% of weighted exposure, providing reasonable protection against CMS direct certification survey costs, Medicare payment suspension losses, and remediation expenses.

The $15,000,000 JC Escrow Amount is calculated as follows:

| Risk Component | Probability | Magnitude | Expected Value |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| CMS validation survey costs | 12.5% | $500K-$1M | $93.75K |
| Commercial payer contract terminations | 7.5% | $185M (midpoint) | $13.9M |
| Hand hygiene follow-up (6 months) | 12.5% | $375K | $46.9K |
| Medicare provider termination (catastrophic) | 2% | $1.26B | $25.2M |
| **Total Weighted Exposure** | — | — | **$39.2M** |
| **Recommended Escrow** | — | — | **$15M (38.3% of exposure)** |

The $15M escrow provides:
- 100% coverage for CMS direct survey costs and 6-month follow-up scenarios
- Partial coverage (8.1%) for commercial payer contract termination scenarios
- Minimal coverage (1.2%) for catastrophic Medicare provider termination scenario, with excess indemnification available under Article [VIII]

## CHANGE SUMMARY

Drafted comprehensive Joint Commission accreditation closing condition provision addressing the $39.2M weighted exposure identified in Section IV.G. The provision provides Buyer with three layers of protection:

1. **Primary Path**: Closing condition requiring satisfactory March 2025 Survey completion with termination right if Preliminary Denial or Denial of Accreditation occurs
2. **Alternative Path**: $15M escrow if survey incomplete or Buyer elects to proceed despite adverse accreditation decision
3. **Seller Obligations**: Covenants requiring timely ESC submission, weekly status updates, Buyer observation rights, and prohibition on new deemed-status-dependent contracts

The provision balances Buyer's risk mitigation needs (protecting against $1.26B Medicare/Medicaid revenue loss) with Seller's operational flexibility (permitting closing if survey timing uncertain).

## INTEGRATION NOTES

**Recommended Placement**: Insert after Section IV.G analysis (following "Application to Transaction" subsections) as new subsection:

### C. Recommendations

#### C.1 Draft Contract Language: Joint Commission Accreditation Closing Condition

[Insert drafted provision above]

**Coordination with Other Provisions**:
- **Article VIII (Indemnification)**: JC Escrow drawdowns reduce dollar-for-dollar any indemnification obligations for Joint Commission claims
- **Article VII (Closing Conditions)**: March 2025 Survey completion is express condition precedent to Buyer's obligation to close
- **Escrow Schedule**: Add "Joint Commission Escrow Account: $15,000,000 (24-month hold)" to total escrow allocation table

**Total Escrow Impact**: This provision adds $15M to the recommended total escrow structure outlined in Executive Summary Section F (Target Position), bringing total escrow to $90M if separately designated, or absorbed within the $75M general escrow if treated as component allocation.
