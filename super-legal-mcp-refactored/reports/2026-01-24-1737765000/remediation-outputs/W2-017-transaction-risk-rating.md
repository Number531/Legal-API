**Task ID**: W2-017
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Date**: January 24, 2026

## Overall Transaction Risk Rating

**RATING**: **HIGH** (on scale of LOW - MEDIUM - HIGH - CRITICAL)

---

## RATIONALE

### 1. Exposure Magnitude

The aggregate probability-weighted exposure of $2.19B represents 91.3% of the $2.4B purchase price, driven by two dominant risk categories:

**Tax-Exempt Status Conversion ($714M - 100% Certain)**:
- Tax-exempt bond redemption under IRC Section 141: $428M
- NPV of new annual property taxes ($33M/year over 10 years): $243M
- Additional corporate income tax exposure: $43M

**Commercial Contract Renegotiation ($700M-$920M gross, 52% probability)**:
- Payers leverage for-profit conversion to demand 2-6% rate reductions
- Eliminates "charity care premium" justifying historical rate differentials
- $800M NPV median estimate for payer contract value erosion

**Aggregate Impact**: The P90 stress scenario of $2.53B exceeds the entire $2.4B purchase price by $130M, creating unacceptable downside risk without restructuring.

### 2. Regulatory Complexity

This transaction involves **13 concurrent compliance domains** with enforcement jurisdiction spanning multiple federal and state agencies:

| Severity | Count | Key Issues |
|----------|-------|------------|
| CRITICAL | 3 | Tax-exempt bond redemption (IV.H), Payer contract renegotiation (IV.K), Physician retention (IV.L) |
| HIGH | 5 | STARK/AKS violations (IV.A), EMTALA pattern risk (IV.B), 340B compliance (IV.E), Joint Commission deemed status (IV.G), Medicare provider agreements (IV.I) |
| MEDIUM | 4 | HIPAA breach (IV.F), GME accreditation (IV.D), Medical staff credentialing (IV.J), Insurance gaps (IV.M) |

**Concurrent Enforcement Oversight**:
- **CMS**: Medicare conditions of participation, Form 855A provider enrollment
- **OCR**: HIPAA breach investigation (850,000 patient records)
- **HRSA**: 340B program integrity, contract pharmacy limitations
- **Joint Commission**: Accreditation restoration (March 2025 follow-up)
- **OIG**: STARK/AKS self-disclosure and potential settlement
- **Ohio Department of Taxation**: Property tax exemption conversion

---

### 3. Deal-Blocking Scenarios

Two conditions could prevent transaction closing or require termination:

**Scenario A: Joint Commission Accreditation Failure**
- **Probability**: 12.5% (deemed status loss)
- **Trigger**: March 2025 follow-up survey not passed
- **Impact**: Direct CMS surveys, potential Medicare/Medicaid decertification
- **Maximum Exposure**: $250M annual revenue at risk
- **Required Action**: Must be resolved or adequately reserved (90 days pre-closing deadline)

**Scenario B: Major Payer Consent Refusal**
- **Probability**: Moderate (estimated 20-30% for any individual major payer)
- **Trigger**: Anthem Blue Cross, UnitedHealthcare, or Aetna refuse consent or demand >5% rate reduction
- **Impact**: Anthem alone represents ~28% of commercial revenue
- **Maximum Exposure**: Outright consent refusal creates deal-breaker condition
- **Required Action**: Pre-closing payer feedback at T-90 days; termination right if adverse

---

### 4. Mitigation Feasibility (Why HIGH, Not CRITICAL)

The rating remains **HIGH rather than CRITICAL** because all identified exposures can be addressed through available deal mechanisms:

| Exposure Category | Mitigation Mechanism | Feasibility |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Tax conversion ($714M certain) | Direct purchase price reduction ($600M) | HIGH - fully quantifiable |
| Regulatory contingencies ($100M weighted) | $250M escrow with risk-appropriate release | HIGH - standard M&A structure |
| Payer consent risk ($800M NPV) | Pre-closing feedback process; termination right | MEDIUM - process-dependent |
| HIPAA/cyber exposure ($18.4M) | Existing Beazley policy ($25M limits) | HIGH - partially insured |
| Physician retention ($218M NPV) | 40-50% salary retention pool, pre-announcement | MEDIUM - execution-dependent |

**Market Precedent Supporting Feasibility**:
- 20-35% price discounts documented in comparable non-profit to for-profit healthcare conversions
- Mission Hospital (2019): 22% discount
- Carondelet (2019): 35% discount
- Epic Systems: 96% historical change-of-control consent rate

---

## CONCLUSION

This transaction is **viable but requires substantial structural adjustments**:

| Adjustment | Amount | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Purchase Price Reduction | $600M (from $2.4B to $1.8B) | Address certain tax conversion costs |
| Escrow | $250M (18-month hold) | Protect against contingent regulatory exposure |
| R&W Insurance | $150M | Supplement escrow for $400M total protection |
| **Total Buyer Protection** | **$400M + $600M price credit = $1.0B** | Against $2.19B median exposure |

**Pre-Closing Decision Gates**:
1. Payer rate reduction feedback <5% (T-90 days) - GO/NO-GO
2. Physician flight risk survey <35% (T-75 days) - GO/ADJUST/NO-GO
3. Joint Commission March 2025 follow-up - MUST PASS for closing

Without these restructuring measures, the 21.4% probability that total exposure exceeds the entire purchase price renders the transaction commercially unacceptable.
