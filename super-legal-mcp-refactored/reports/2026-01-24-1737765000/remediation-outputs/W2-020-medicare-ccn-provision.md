### Draft Contract Language: Medicare Provider Agreement CHOW Notification

**ARTICLE [X] - MEDICARE PROVIDER AGREEMENT CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP**

**Section [X].1 Acceptance of Automatic Assignment.**

(a) **Mandatory Acceptance**. Buyer hereby accepts automatic assignment of all Medicare provider agreements for the four (4) hospitals identified below pursuant to 42 C.F.R. § 489.18(c):

    (i)   Mercy Regional Medical Center (CCN 360001)
    (ii)  Mercy East Hospital (CCN 360285)
    (iii) Mercy Northwest Hospital (CCN 360312)
    (iv)  Mercy South Hospital (CCN 360198)

(b) **No Rejection**. Buyer acknowledges that rejection of automatic assignment under 42 C.F.R. § 489.52 would constitute voluntary termination of Medicare provider agreements, resulting in complete Medicare revenue cessation ($864 million annually) during the 3-12 month re-certification period. Buyer shall NOT reject automatic assignment under any circumstances.

(c) **Rationale**. This covenant addresses the CRITICAL risk identified in Section IV.I.B.1 of the Legal Due Diligence Memorandum: rejection of automatic assignment creates $216M-$864M gross exposure (5% probability × magnitude = $27M expected value).

**Section [X].2 Pre-Closing CMS Form 855A Preparation.**

(a) **Seller Obligations**. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall:

    (i)   Prepare and execute CMS Form 855A (Change of Ownership) applications for all four (4) hospitals (CCN 360001, 360285, 360312, 360198);

    (ii)  Complete all sections within Seller's knowledge and control, including current ownership information, Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) identification (J15, CGS Administrators), and historical compliance data;

    (iii) Provide Buyer with draft Form 855A applications for review and completion of Buyer ownership sections.

(b) **Buyer Pre-Closing Obligations**. No later than fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Buyer shall:

    (i)   Complete all Buyer ownership sections of CMS Form 855A applications, including corporate organizational documents, ownership disclosure statements, and managing employee information;

    (ii)  Coordinate with Seller to finalize all four (4) applications for immediate post-closing submission.

**Section [X].3 Post-Closing CMS Form 855A Submission.**

(a) **Submission Deadline**. Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall submit all four (4) completed CMS Form 855A applications to Medicare Administrative Contractor J15 (CGS Administrators) via the Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS) electronic submission portal.

(b) **PECOS Electronic Submission Requirement**. Buyer shall use PECOS electronic submission (not paper filing) to reduce processing time from 90-180 days (paper) to 60-90 days (electronic) and to reduce notification failure probability from 25% (paper baseline) to 15% (electronic).

(c) **Notification to Seller**. Within two (2) Business Days after submission, Buyer shall provide Seller with:

    (i)   PECOS confirmation receipts for all four (4) applications;
    (ii)  Application reference numbers assigned by CMS;
    (iii) Estimated processing timelines provided by MAC.

(d) **Rationale**. This covenant addresses the CRITICAL risk identified in Section IV.I.B.2: failure to submit Form 855A within 30 days of closing triggers Medicare payment suspension under CMS Manual Pub. 100-08, Ch. 10, § 10.5.2.2, creating $144M-$216M working capital gap over 2-3 months (15% probability × $180M midpoint = $27M expected value).

**Section [X].4 PECOS Database Update.**

(a) **Update Deadline**. Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall update the Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS) database for all four (4) hospitals to reflect:

    (i)   New ownership information (National Healthcare Partners LLC);
    (ii)  Updated authorized officials;
    (iii) Updated managing employees;
    (iv)  New correspondence addresses.

(b) **Verification**. Within thirty-five (35) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with screenshots or official reports from PECOS confirming completion of all updates.

**Section [X].5 Medicare Administrative Contractor Notification.**

(a) **Direct MAC Notification**. Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall notify Medicare Administrative Contractor J15 (CGS Administrators) via telephone and email of the ownership change, providing:

    (i)   Closing Date;
    (ii)  New owner legal name and contact information;
    (iii) Confirmation that automatic assignment has been accepted;
    (iv)  PECOS submission reference numbers (once obtained).

(b) **Follow-Up Communications**. Buyer shall respond to any MAC requests for additional information or documentation within five (5) Business Days of receipt to avoid processing delays.

**Section [X].6 Information Exchange Covenants.**

(a) **Seller Deliverables**. Within ten (10) days prior to Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with:

    (i)   Current CMS Form 855A applications on file with MAC for all four (4) hospitals;
    (ii)  Medicare provider agreement documents for all four (4) CCNs;
    (iii) MAC contact information (Provider Enrollment Hotline, Provider Outreach and Education representatives);
    (iv)  PECOS login credentials (if transferable) or instructions for establishing new credentials;
    (v)   Historical correspondence with MAC regarding ownership, enrollment, or compliance matters (2022-present).

(b) **Buyer Deliverables**. Within ten (10) days prior to Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller with:

    (i)   Corporate organizational documents (Articles of Incorporation, Operating Agreement, Certificate of Good Standing);
    (ii)  Ownership structure charts showing all entities and individuals with 5% or greater ownership interest (as required by 42 C.F.R. § 424.516(e));
    (iii) Authorized official and managing employee designations;
    (iv)  Medicare exclusion screening results confirming no individuals or entities are excluded under 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7 (OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities).

**Section [X].7 Working Capital Facility.**

(a) **Financing Requirement**. Buyer shall secure a working capital credit facility of no less than One Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($150,000,000) with availability commencing on the Closing Date and continuing for no less than one hundred eighty (180) days post-closing.

(b) **Purpose**. The working capital facility shall provide liquidity to cover potential Medicare payment suspensions or delays during CMS Form 855A processing (estimated 60-90 day processing period, with potential extension to 120-180 days if ownership verification issues arise).

(c) **Interest Cost Allocation**. Any interest costs incurred on working capital draws attributable to Medicare payment delays caused by CMS Form 855A processing shall be borne by Buyer. Interest costs attributable to Medicare payment suspensions caused by Seller's pre-closing compliance failures shall be borne by Seller pursuant to Section [X].8 (Indemnification).

**Section [X].8 Indemnification and Compliance Responsibility Allocation.**

(a) **Seller Pre-Closing Indemnification**. Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all Losses arising from or related to:

    (i)   **Medicare Overpayments**: Any CMS determination that Medicare payments made to Seller prior to the Closing Date were improper, including but not limited to DRG upcoding, medical necessity denials, or billing for non-covered services;

    (ii)  **Pre-Closing Conditions of Participation Violations**: Any CMS survey findings, condition-level deficiencies, or immediate jeopardy determinations based on conduct occurring prior to the Closing Date (excluding the October 2024 Joint Commission survey findings disclosed in Section IV.I.B.3, which are addressed separately);

    (iii) **EMTALA Violations**: Any EMTALA investigations, civil monetary penalties, or Medicare termination proceedings arising from patient encounters occurring prior to the Closing Date, including specifically the March 2024 violation at Mercy East Hospital (CCN 360285) disclosed in Section IV.F;

    (iv)  **Form 855A Disclosure Omissions**: Any penalties, enrollment revocations, or payment suspensions arising from inaccurate or incomplete information provided by Seller in the pre-closing portions of CMS Form 855A applications;

    (v)   **GME and DSH Payment Recoupments**: Any CMS recoupment of Graduate Medical Education (GME) payments or Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments attributable to Seller's pre-closing reporting or compliance failures.

(b) **Buyer Post-Closing Responsibility**. Buyer shall assume full compliance responsibility for Medicare provider agreements, Conditions of Participation, EMTALA obligations, and all other Medicare program requirements effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the day following the Closing Date. Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller from and against any Losses arising from Buyer's post-closing conduct, including:

    (i)   Failure to timely submit CMS Form 855A applications within the five (5) Business Day deadline;
    (ii)  Failure to update PECOS database within thirty (30) days;
    (iii) Post-closing Conditions of Participation violations;
    (iv)  Post-closing EMTALA violations.

(c) **Transition Period (30-Day Shared Responsibility)**. For the thirty (30) day period immediately following the Closing Date (the "Transition Period"):

    (i)   **CMS Form 855A Processing Issues**: If CMS identifies deficiencies in Form 855A applications submitted during the Transition Period, responsibility shall be allocated based on which party provided the deficient information:
          - Seller responsible for: Pre-closing ownership data, historical compliance certifications, financial statements through Closing Date

    (ii)  **Medicare Payment Suspensions**: If MAC suspends payments during the Transition Period:
          - Suspension caused by late Form 855A submission (after 5 Business Day deadline): Buyer responsible
          - Suspension caused by incomplete Seller-provided information: Seller responsible
          - Suspension caused by routine CMS processing delays despite timely submission: Neither party liable (cost of doing business)

    (iii) **Working Capital Interest Costs**: Interest costs on working capital draws during the Transition Period shall be allocated pursuant to Section [X].7(c).

(d) **October 2024 Joint Commission Survey - Specific Allocation**. The eight (8) deficiencies identified in the October 14-16, 2024 Joint Commission survey of Mercy Regional Medical Center (CCN 360001) are allocated as follows:

    (i)   **Seller Responsibility (Pre-Closing Correction)**: Findings 1-4 (medication management, infection prevention, life safety, medical staff credentialing) must be corrected prior to the March 2025 follow-up survey. If the March 2025 survey results in "Preliminary Denial of Accreditation" due to uncorrected Findings 1-4, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for all direct costs ($5M-$10M estimated) and deemed status loss consequences (up to $250M exposure per Section IV.I.B.3).

    (ii)  **Buyer Responsibility (Post-Closing Maintenance)**: If the March 2025 survey occurs after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for maintaining compliance and cooperating with Joint Commission surveyors. If preliminary denial results from new deficiencies discovered during the March 2025 survey (not related to the October 2024 findings), Buyer assumes full responsibility.

    (iii) **Shared Escrow**: Parties shall establish a Five Million Dollar ($5,000,000) escrow to be held until the March 2025 Joint Commission survey results are final (estimated June 2025 resolution). Escrow funds shall be released as follows:
          - **Full Accreditation Restored**: $5M released to Seller
          - **Accreditation with Additional Follow-Up**: $2.5M released to Seller, $2.5M held until September 2025 follow-up
          - **Preliminary Denial (Seller's uncorrected deficiencies)**: $5M released to Buyer as partial indemnification
          - **Preliminary Denial (Buyer's new deficiencies)**: $5M released to Seller; Buyer assumes all costs

(e) **Claims Process**. Any indemnification claim under this Section [X].8 shall be subject to the general indemnification provisions of Article [Y] (Indemnification), including notice requirements, defense obligations, and indemnification caps, except that:

    (i)   Medicare termination or deemed status loss claims shall not be subject to the general indemnification cap due to magnitude ($250M-$864M potential exposure);
