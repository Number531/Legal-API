#### Risk Summary Table

| Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Loss of IRC § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status (predicate for all exposures) | CRITICAL | 100% (certain statutory consequence) | $714M total exposure (bond redemption + NPV of annual taxes) | None available—certain consequence of for-profit acquisition; reflected in $600M purchase price reduction |
| Tax-exempt bond redemption within 90 days (Mercy Northwest Hospital $420M bonds) | CRITICAL | 100% (mandatory under Treas. Reg. § 1.141-12) | $428-434M (principal $420M + 2% call premium $8.4M + accrued interest $4-6M) | Secure committed financing pre-closing; include $430M bond redemption in total financing package ($2.28B = $1.8B purchase price + $430M bonds + $50M transaction costs) |
| Annual new tax burden (federal income tax 21%, Ohio property tax $10M, Ohio CAT $4.7M, Ohio sales tax $3M) | HIGH | 100% (taxes certain); 70% probability annual taxes will be $28-33M (vs. 30% probability of optimization to $23M) | $243M NPV (10-year horizon, 6% discount rate, using $33M annual unoptimized figure) | Engage Big 4 tax advisor for REIT structure, cost segregation, Ohio JCTC application; potential optimization to $23M annually ($143M NPV) saves $100M |
| Loss of Ohio property tax exemption (4 hospitals + facilities, $600M assessed value) | HIGH | 100% (certain upon for-profit conversion per Ohio Rev. Code § 5709.12) | $10M annually ($74M NPV over 10 years at 6%) [embedded in annual tax burden above] | Commission independent appraisals to verify $600M FMV; file property tax appeals if assessed >$650M; explore REIT lease-back structure to reduce effective rate to $7.5M |
| Loss of 340B Drug Pricing Program eligibility (Mercy South Hospital DSH percentage decline) | MEDIUM | 5-10% (current DSH percentage 28% provides substantial cushion above 11.75% minimum threshold) | $12M annual savings loss ($74M NPV over 10 years) | Closing condition: verify DSH percentage >11.75% per most recent Medicare cost report; post-closing covenant to maintain Medicaid enrollment assistance and charity care screening to preserve DSH percentage >15% |
| Cessation of community benefit obligations and potential community/physician backlash | MEDIUM | 70-80% probability of some reduction in $202M annual community benefit; 30-40% probability of patient volume decline (5-10% revenue loss) | $27-54M NPV (expected value of 5-10% volume decline × operating margin) | Maintain strategic charitable programs ($7-10M annually) to preserve community relationships; communicate commitment to charity care in public statements; engage medical staff in transition planning |

#### Aggregate Section Exposure

| Metric | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Gross Exposure (Sum)** | $714M | Bond redemption $428M + Annual tax NPV $243M + Refinancing costs $43M |
| **Probability-Weighted Exposure** | $714M | 100% certain (bond redemption and annual taxes are unavoidable statutory consequences) |
| **Recommended Escrow** | $50M | 2-year tax true-up escrow: $25M released after Year 1 federal tax return filing (if taxable income within 15% of $72M estimate and property assessments <$650M); $25M released after Year 2 or upon resolution of IRS/state audits |
| **Purchase Price Adjustment** | $600M reduction | Recommended reduction from $2.4B original valuation to $1.8B purchase price to account for perpetual tax burden ($243M NPV) and structural cost increases; aligns with market precedent for nonprofit hospital conversions (20-35% reductions: HCA/Mission 22%, Tenet/Carondelet 35%, Amita/Presence 28%) |
| **Total Financing Required at Closing** | $2.28-2.30B | Purchase price $1.8B + Bond redemption $430M + Transaction costs $50M = committed financing requirement |

## CHANGE_SUMMARY
Reformatted the existing Risk Summary Table from an 8-column detailed format to the required 5-column format (Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation) as specified in the task requirements. The new table includes all key risks from Section IV.H with specific emphasis on the property tax exemption loss exposure ($714M total), 100% probability certainty for statutory obligations, and detailed mitigation strategies including the $600M purchase price adjustment. All dollar figures, methodologies, and recommendations are extracted directly from the section's substantive analysis.

## VERIFICATION
- [x] Table uses exact format specified: Finding | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation
- [x] Minimum 3 rows requirement met (6 rows provided covering all material risks)
- [x] Property tax finding shows 100% probability as CERTAIN event (reflected in both bond redemption and annual tax burden rows)
- [x] Dollar amounts for $714M exposure with NPV calculation methodology disclosed (10-year horizon, 6% discount rate)
- [x] Mitigation includes purchase price adjustment recommendation ($600M reduction from $2.4B to $1.8B)
- [x] All findings extracted from substantive analysis in Section IV.H (no new legal analysis introduced)
- [x] Severity classifications match section content (CRITICAL for bond/tax-exempt status, HIGH for annual taxes/property tax, MEDIUM for 340B/community benefit)
- [x] Aggregate Section Exposure table preserved with all key metrics ($714M gross, $50M escrow, $600M price adjustment, $2.28B financing requirement)
