**Date:** January 24, 2026

---

## FEDERAL HEALTHCARE FRAUD AND ABUSE

### Question 1: Stark Law Physician Self-Referral Violations

**Under** 42 U.S.C. § 1395nn (Stark Law) and its implementing regulations at 42 C.F.R. §§ 411.350-411.389, which prohibit physicians from referring patients for designated health services to entities in which they hold ownership interests unless a statutory exception applies,

**Does** the Mercy Endoscopy Center LLC joint venture create impermissible financial relationships requiring disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, and potential False Claims Act liability,

**When** eight employed gastroenterologists of Mercy Regional Health System collectively own 33.3% of the ASC, refer 85% of all procedures (9,976 referrals over eight years) to that entity for colonoscopies and endoscopies constituting designated health services, receive $35,000 annual profit distributions ($2.24 million aggregate), and no statutory exception applies because (i) the in-office ancillary services exception fails the "same building" requirement, (ii) the whole hospital exception applies only to hospitals as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e) and not ASCs, and (iii) the rural provider exception is unavailable because Columbus, Ohio is a Metropolitan Statistical Area?

---

### Question 2: Anti-Kickback Statute Violations and Safe Harbor Analysis

**Under** 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b) (Anti-Kickback Statute) and the "one purpose" test established in *United States v. Greber*, 760 F.2d 68 (3d Cir. 1985), which provides that remuneration violates the statute if one purpose of payment is to induce referrals regardless of whether payment also serves legitimate purposes,

**Does** the ASC profit distribution arrangement constitute illegal remuneration warranting criminal penalties up to $100,000 per violation, treble damages under the False Claims Act, and potential exclusion from federal healthcare programs,

**When** the eight employed physician-owners receive annual distributions of $35,000 each, the ASC's financial viability depends entirely on physician-owner referrals (85% of volume), and the ASC safe harbor at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(r) does not apply because returns are indirectly based on referral volume given that without physician-owner referrals the ASC would generate insufficient revenue to cover fixed costs, consistent with OIG Advisory Opinion 21-02 (February 2021) declining safe harbor protection for an ASC where 78% of procedures originated from physician-owners?

---

## EMERGENCY TREATMENT AND PATIENT ACCESS

### Question 3: EMTALA Pattern Violation and Medicare Provider Agreement Risk

**Under** 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(h) (EMTALA) and CMS enforcement guidance treating two or more violations within three years as a "pattern" triggering elevated civil monetary penalties and Medicare provider agreement termination authority under 42 C.F.R. § 489.53,

**Does** the July 2023 Mercy East Hospital financial inquiry violation create material risk of Medicare provider agreement termination if additional violations are discovered during due diligence lookback,

**When** business office staff approached a psychiatric patient before transfer completion to inquire about insurance coverage, CMS Region 5 assessed a $50,000 civil monetary penalty (paid August 2024), corrective action was implemented at Mercy East but has not been verified as system-wide across all four hospitals (CCNs 360001, 360285, 360312, 360198), and Mercy's four hospitals collectively process approximately 500,000 emergency department visits annually, creating statistical probability of undiscovered violations in the complaint-driven enforcement environment?

---

## STATE CERTIFICATE OF NEED (Regulatory Framework Clarification)

### Question 4: Ohio Certificate of Need Requirements for Acute Care Bed Expansion

**Under** Ohio Rev. Code §§ 3702.52-3702.593 (Ohio Certificate of Need Act), which limits CON review exclusively to long-term care facilities including nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, and hospital-based skilled nursing beds, and does not enumerate acute care hospital medical/surgical beds in the definition of "health care facility" subject to CON review,

**Does** the pending 50-bed medical/surgical expansion at Mercy Regional Medical Center (525 beds to 575 beds, $125 million capital project) require Certificate of Need approval from the Ohio Department of Health,

**When** Ohio repealed CON requirements for acute care hospital beds in 1997, recent legislative amendments (House Bill 33, effective September 30, 2024) relate solely to long-term care facility review procedures without reinstating acute care bed regulation, and the expansion proceeds subject only to hospital licensure compliance under Ohio Rev. Code § 3701.07, Medicare certification survey under 42 C.F.R. § 488, and local construction permitting rather than state health planning approval?

---

## GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION ACCREDITATION

### Question 5: ACGME Probation and Medicare GME Payment Continuity

**Under** ACGME Common Program Requirements (Residency) 2025, Section VI.A.1, which mandates that clinical and educational work hours must not exceed 80 hours per week averaged over four weeks, and 42 C.F.R. § 413.75(b), which provides that Medicare GME payments are "only provided for residents in 'approved' programs,"

**Does** the surgery residency program's May 2024 probationary accreditation create material risk of Medicare GME payment termination and downstream faculty attrition,

**When** residents averaged 85-90 hours per week from February through April 2024 (10 residents affected over 12 weeks, 6.25-12.5% excess), the ACGME imposed 12-month probation with follow-up site visit scheduled Q2 2025, corrective actions implemented include hiring two additional surgical faculty ($800,000 annual cost), enhanced NewInnovations electronic work hours tracking, and dedicated Associate Program Director, the surgery program accounts for $2.5 million of Mercy's $27 million annual Medicare GME payments, and accreditation withdrawal would trigger 30-50% surgical faculty attrition based on teaching hospital M&A precedent?

---

## 340B DRUG PRICING PROGRAM

### Question 6: Manufacturer Contract Pharmacy Restrictions and DSH Eligibility Preservation

**Under** 42 U.S.C. § 256b (340B Drug Pricing Program) as interpreted in *Sanofi Aventis U.S. LLC v. HHS*, 58 F.4th 696 (3d Cir. 2023), and *Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC v. Becerra*, 58 F.4th 1177 (D.C. Cir. 2023), holding that HRSA lacks statutory authority to require manufacturers to provide 340B pricing to unlimited contract pharmacies,

**Does** Mercy South Hospital's operation of eight retail contract pharmacies (CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Walmart) expose the system to loss of $3 million to $5 million in annual 340B savings from manufacturer-restricted high-cost drugs,

**When** Eli Lilly's July 1, 2024 policy limits covered entities to one designated contract pharmacy, Novo Nordisk limits to two contract pharmacies, AstraZeneca prohibits all contract pharmacy dispensing (in-house pharmacy only), Ohio has not enacted state law protection against manufacturer restrictions unlike Arkansas and Mississippi, and the Supreme Court's elimination of Chevron deference in *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo*, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), substantially reduces the likelihood of successful HRSA regulatory intervention?

---

## HIPAA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

### Question 7: HIPAA Security Rule Violations and OCR Penalty Exposure

**Under** 45 C.F.R. §§ 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) (risk analysis), 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A) (contingency plan and data backup), and 164.312(a)(2)(iv) (encryption), and OCR's 2024 enforcement initiative targeting inadequate security safeguards in ransomware incidents,

**Does** the March 2024 ransomware attack compromising 850,000 patient records expose Mercy Regional to $500,000 to $1,500,000 in OCR civil monetary penalties plus a three-year Corrective Action Plan,

**When** Mercy's last enterprise-wide risk analysis was conducted in 2019 (five-year gap before the breach), backups were stored on network-connected storage and were encrypted by attackers causing 12 days of EHR downtime (March 5-17, 2024), the Epic database containing SSNs, diagnoses, and payment information was not encrypted at rest enabling plaintext exfiltration, and comparable OCR enforcement actions in 2024 (Providence Medical Institute $240,000, Cascade Eye & Skin Centers $250,000, Montefiore Medical Center $4.75 million) demonstrate OCR's Tier 3 willful neglect assessment for similar Security Rule deficiencies?

---

## JOINT COMMISSION ACCREDITATION AND DEEMED STATUS

### Question 8: Joint Commission Follow-Up Survey and Medicare Deemed Status Continuity

**Under** 42 C.F.R. § 488.5 (deemed status framework) and Joint Commission Accreditation Decision Rules, which provide that hospitals receiving "Accreditation with Requirements for Improvement" must demonstrate sustained corrective action or face preliminary denial triggering CMS validation surveys under direct Medicare oversight,

**Does** the October 2024 survey outcome at Mercy Regional Medical Center create material risk of deemed status loss requiring transition to direct CMS Conditions of Participation enforcement,

**When** Joint Commission surveyors cited eight deficiencies including medication management (12 expired medications in OR pharmacy), infection prevention (78% hand hygiene compliance versus 90% target), life safety (fire door propped open violating NFPA 101 § 7.2.1.8.2), and credentialing (Dr. Wilson missing primary source verification), the March 2025 follow-up survey will verify corrective action sustainability, hand hygiene compliance reached only 88% by December 2024 (below 90% target), and the proposed 2024 CMS rule would permit deemed status removal after a single condition-level citation during validation surveys?

---

## TAX-EXEMPT STATUS CONVERSION

### Question 9: IRC Section 501(c)(3) Status Loss and Tax-Exempt Bond Redemption

**Under** 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) (tax-exempt status requirements), IRC § 141 (private activity bond rules), and Treasury Regulation § 1.141-12 (remedial action requirements for change in use of bond-financed property),

**Does** the acquisition by National Healthcare Partners LLC (for-profit, private equity-backed) trigger immediate and certain loss of Mercy's federal tax-exempt status with mandatory redemption of $420 million tax-exempt revenue bonds within 90 days of closing,

**When** acquisition causes operational test failure under *Harding Hospital, Inc. v. United States*, 505 F.2d 1068 (6th Cir. 1974), because operations will benefit private shareholders through dividends and equity appreciation rather than exclusively charitable purposes, the private inurement prohibition is absolute per *Founding Church of Scientology v. United States*, 412 F.2d 1197 (Ct. Cl. 1969), the bonds become private activity bonds upon 100% private business use under *Uinta Medical Center v. United States*, 114 Fed. Cl. 402 (2013), and failure to redeem within 90 days results in retroactive loss of tax-exempt status exposing bondholders to federal income tax liability on previously received interest?

---

## MEDICARE PROVIDER AGREEMENTS AND REIMBURSEMENT

### Question 10: Medicare Provider Agreement Assignment and CMS Form 855A Notification

**Under** 42 C.F.R. § 489.18(c) (automatic assignment of provider agreements in change of ownership) and 42 C.F.R. § 424.516(e) (30-day notification requirement for ownership changes),

**Does** failure to accept automatic assignment of Mercy's four Medicare provider agreements or failure to submit CMS Form 855A within 30 days of closing expose National Healthcare Partners to $216 million to $864 million in Medicare revenue loss,

**When** rejection of automatic assignment constitutes voluntary termination under 42 C.F.R. § 489.52 requiring 3-12 month re-certification as initial applicants during which facilities receive no Medicare revenue, Medicare represents 48% of Mercy's $1.8 billion net patient revenue ($864 million annually including $180 million Medicare Advantage), CMS Manual Pub. 100-08, Chapter 10, § 10.5.2.2 directs MACs to stop payments if Form 855A is not submitted within 30 days, and National Healthcare Partners' private equity ownership structure requires beneficial ownership disclosure under 42 C.F.R. § 424.519 adding 3-6 months to standard processing timelines?

---

## COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS AND PHYSICIAN RETENTION

### Question 11: Payer Contract Renegotiation and Physician Retention Risk

**Under** common law principles governing change of control provisions in commercial contracts and empirical evidence from *Medical Economics* (2024) demonstrating that private equity acquisitions increase physician turnover by 13 percentage points (from 9% baseline to 22%),

**Does** the non-profit to for-profit conversion trigger material payer rate reductions and physician departures causing $400 million to $500 million in aggregate exposure,

**When** an estimated 52% of payer contracts by value require change of control consent, payers historically justified higher reimbursement rates for non-profit hospitals based on charity care obligations that for-profit conversion eliminates, the 2024-2025 contracting environment features "contentious negotiations" with providers demanding 5-8% increases while payers grant only 1-3%, the 650 employed physicians face productivity metric intensification, administrative burden increases, and clinical autonomy reduction typical of private equity-acquired practices, and physician replacement costs average $1 million per departure comprising recruitment expenses, signing bonuses, and revenue disruption during 6-12 month vacancy periods?

---

## EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR LAW

### Question 12: WARN Act Compliance and Union Organizing Risk

**Under** 29 U.S.C. § 2101 *et seq.* (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) requiring 60-day advance notice for mass layoffs affecting 50 or more employees at a single site, and NLRA § 7 (29 U.S.C. § 157) protecting employees' right to organize,

**Does** National Healthcare Partners face WARN Act liability and elevated union organizing risk if post-closing restructuring results in workforce reductions,

**When** Mercy Regional employs 8,500 employees across four hospitals (650 physicians, 2,800 nurses, 1,200 allied health, 3,850 support staff), private equity healthcare acquisitions historically result in 15-25% workforce restructuring within 24 months, healthcare unionization campaigns by SEIU, AFSCME, and National Nurses United have increased 40% since 2020 with non-profit to for-profit conversions serving as organizing catalysts, and Ohio does not have right-to-work protections limiting union organizing requirements?

---

## INSURANCE COVERAGE

### Question 13: Insurance Coverage Gaps for Known Liabilities

**Under** standard D&O policy fines/penalties exclusions as interpreted in *Level 3 Communications, Inc. v. Federal Insurance Co.*, 272 F.3d 908 (7th Cir. 2001), holding that regulatory penalties are uninsurable because allowing insurance "would undermine the deterrent effect of the punishments," and cyber insurance regulatory sublimit practices,

**Does** Mercy Regional face $7.55 million to $52.55 million in uninsured exposure for pre-closing liabilities,

**When** the OIG settlement for Stark/AKS violations ($2 million to $5 million) constitutes an excluded penalty under the D&O fines/penalties exclusion with only defense costs ($500,000 to $1.5 million) likely covered, the cyber insurance policy may have regulatory penalty sublimits of $1 million to $2 million insufficient to cover potential OCR penalties of $500,000 to $1.5 million plus class action exposure of $5 million to $15 million for the 850,000-record breach, and professional liability coverage for 650 employed physicians requires tail coverage verification for claims-made policies with Extended Reporting Period costs estimated at 150-300% of annual premium?
