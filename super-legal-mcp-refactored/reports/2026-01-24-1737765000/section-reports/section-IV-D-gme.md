### A. Legal Framework

Graduate medical education programs operate under a comprehensive regulatory framework that directly ties accreditation status to Medicare funding and hospital operational viability. The legal authority governing GME accreditation and Medicare payments creates binding obligations and substantial financial exposures for teaching hospitals.

#### 1. ACGME Accreditation Requirements

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) is the recognized national accrediting body for graduate medical education programs in the United States. The ACGME establishes program requirements through its **Common Program Requirements** and specialty-specific requirements that all residency and fellowship programs must satisfy.¹

The ACGME Common Program Requirements (Residency) 2025, Section VI.A.1, establishes the cornerstone duty hours limitation: clinical and educational work hours—including in-house activities, clinical work from home, and all moonlighting—must not exceed **80 hours per week when averaged over a four-week period**.² The ACGME has explicitly stated that "non-compliance from the 80-hour rule will not be tolerated."³ Review Committees issue citations where violations are identified, and repeated work hour violations correlate with lower compliance rates on the ACGME Resident/Fellow Survey, triggering probationary accreditation.⁴

Limited exceptions to the 80-hour limit exist only for Review Committee-approved specialty-specific rotations, which can extend to 88 hours maximum based on sound educational rationale.⁵ These exceptions are rare and require explicit ACGME approval. No such exception applies to general surgery programs absent specific Review Committee authorization.

The ACGME employs a tiered accreditation system with several classification levels:⁶
- **Continued Accreditation**: Full compliance, no citations
- **Continued Accreditation with Areas for Improvement**: Minor deficiencies identified
- **Continued Accreditation with a Warning**: More serious deficiencies requiring corrective action
- **Probationary Accreditation**: Substantial non-compliance requiring immediate remediation
- **Withdrawal of Accreditation**: Program must close

Probationary accreditation represents a serious adverse action indicating the ACGME has determined violations were substantial (not isolated), systemic (affecting a significant portion of residents), and sustained (occurring over a meaningful time period).⁷ Programs on probation receive a defined remediation period—typically 12-24 months—to correct deficiencies. If corrective action is insufficient, the ACGME may withdraw accreditation, forcing program closure.⁸

#### 2. Medicare GME Payment Structure

Medicare Graduate Medical Education payments are authorized under two distinct statutory provisions that together comprise the federal government's support for physician training.

**Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME)** payments are authorized under **42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(h)** and implemented in regulations at **42 C.F.R. §§ 413.75-413.86**.⁹ The DGME payment formula compensates teaching hospitals for the direct costs of resident training:

DGME Payment = **PRA × Weighted FTE Residents × Hospital's Medicare Share of Patient Days**

Where the **Per-Resident Amount (PRA)** represents the hospital's allowable GME costs in the base period divided by the number of residents in that period, inflation-adjusted annually.¹⁰ DGME payments cover resident salaries (typically $55,000-$65,000 for PGY1-PGY7), faculty supervision costs, program administration, and educational materials.¹¹

**Indirect Medical Education (IME)** payments are authorized under **42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(K)** and implemented at **42 C.F.R. § 412.105**.¹² The IME adjustment compensates teaching hospitals for higher operating costs due to more complex patient mix, slower resident workflows (learning curve), additional supervision requirements, and increased diagnostic testing for educational purposes.¹³ The IME adjustment factor is calculated as:

IME Adjustment Factor = **c × [(1 + r)^0.405 - 1]**

Where **c** equals the Congressional multiplier (currently 1.35 for most hospitals) and **r** equals the hospital's ratio of FTE residents to beds.¹⁴ This adjustment factor applies to each Medicare DRG payment, adding a percentage increase to base reimbursement.

#### 3. Critical Link: Accreditation as Payment Prerequisite

The regulatory framework creates an absolute dependency between ACGME accreditation and Medicare GME payments. **42 C.F.R. § 413.75(b)** defines "approved program" as one accredited by the ACGME or other organizations designated by the Secretary.¹⁵ The regulation explicitly states:

> "Payments are only provided for residents in 'approved' programs."¹⁶

If the ACGME withdraws accreditation from a program, that program immediately loses its "approved" status, and CMS will **immediately cease GME payments** for all residents in that program.¹⁷ There is no grace period, no administrative appeal process that preserves payments pending resolution, and no mechanism to substitute alternative accreditation. Loss of ACGME accreditation equals immediate loss of all Medicare GME funding for the affected program.

#### 4. 1996 Balanced Budget Act Resident Cap

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. 105-33, § 4623, 111 Stat. 251 (Aug. 5, 1997), codified at **42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(h)(4)(F)** (Direct GME cap) and **42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(d)(5)(B)(v)** (IME cap), established permanent caps on the number of FTE residents that can be counted for Medicare GME reimbursement purposes.¹⁸

Each hospital's cap was set at the hospital's resident count as of December 31, 1996, based on the most recent cost reporting period before December 31, 1997.¹⁹ Subsequent regulations established a three-year rolling average methodology for computing the cap.²⁰ These caps are permanent and hospital-specific, with only limited statutory exceptions available.

Limited exceptions to the 1996 cap include:²¹
- **Rural Track Programs (RTPs)**: Under 42 C.F.R. § 412.105(f)(1)(vii), hospitals participating in rural training can receive cap increases if >50% of resident training occurs in rural areas (effective October 1, 2022)
- **Section 5506 (ACA)**: When a teaching hospital closes, its GME FTE cap slots can be redistributed to other hospitals meeting specified criteria
- **Section 126 (CAA 2021)**: 1,000 additional FTE cap slots phased in at 200 slots/year beginning FY 2023, distributed nationally via competitive application to underserved areas

These exceptions are narrow, difficult to obtain, and generally unavailable to established urban teaching hospitals absent exceptional circumstances.²²

#### 5. Change of Ownership Implications

While ACGME policies do not require formal notification of ownership changes as a condition of maintaining accreditation, prudent practice dictates notification to avoid triggering institutional review or creating undisclosed material changes.²³ ACGME institutional accreditation reviews assess the "Sponsoring Institution's" governance structure, financial capacity, and commitment to GME.²⁴ A change from non-profit to for-profit ownership represents a substantial governance change that could trigger ACGME inquiry regarding:
- Continued institutional commitment to academic mission
- Financial resources for GME program support
- Alignment between for-profit business model and educational objectives
- Stability of program leadership and faculty during transition

Post-acquisition faculty retention represents a critical operational risk. Academic physicians recruited specifically for teaching roles at non-profit institutions may view for-profit conversion as inconsistent with their professional values or career objectives, potentially triggering departures that undermine program viability.²⁵

### B. Application to Transaction (CREAC Structure)

#### B.1 ACGME Surgery Program Probation and Accreditation Withdrawal Risk

**Conclusion:** Mercy Regional's surgery residency program presents **MEDIUM** risk. The ACGME placed the program on 12-month probation (May 2024 - May 2025) for 80-hour work week violations affecting 10 of 40 residents over a three-month period. If the ACGME withdraws accreditation following its Q2 2025 follow-up visit, the acquirer will incur immediate loss of $2.5 million annual Medicare GME payments, operational revenue loss of $40.6M-$81.2M (NPV) from surgical faculty departures, and program closure costs of $2M-$6M, totaling $63.6M-$109.5M exposure. However, based on substantial corrective actions implemented (2 additional faculty hired, electronic work hours monitoring enhanced, associate program director appointed) and case precedent showing successful probation exits, the probability of full accreditation restoration is assessed at 75-80%. The probability of accreditation withdrawal is only 5%.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM [BASIS: Specialist analysis of ACGME precedent cases and corrective action assessment, but ultimate ACGME decision uncertain until Q2 2025 follow-up visit]

**Rule:** Under ACGME Common Program Requirements (Residency) 2025, Section VI.A.1, clinical and educational work hours must not exceed 80 hours per week when averaged over a four-week period.²⁶ The ACGME has stated that "non-compliance from the 80-hour rule will not be tolerated."²⁷ When programs violate duty hours requirements in a sustained, systemic manner, the ACGME Review Committee may issue **Probationary Accreditation**, requiring corrective action within a specified timeframe (typically 12-24 months).²⁸ If corrective action is insufficient, the ACGME may **withdraw accreditation**, forcing program closure.²⁹ Under 42 C.F.R. § 413.75(b), Medicare GME payments are "only provided for residents in 'approved' programs," meaning ACGME-accredited programs.³⁰ Loss of accreditation immediately terminates Medicare GME funding for the affected program.³¹

**Explanation:** The ACGME Data Book 2022-2023 documents that surgery programs have recurring problems with work hour compliance.³² During the 2022-2023 academic year, four surgery programs nationwide were issued probationary accreditation, with citations typically focusing on duty hours violations, service-to-education ratios (residents used for service rather than education), and educational experiences deficiencies.³³

Case precedent demonstrates that programs receiving probationary accreditation for work hours violations can successfully restore full accreditation through substantive corrective action. One orthopedic surgery program successfully moved from 16 citations to 1 citation and achieved full accreditation through implementation of a night float system, faculty hiring, and electronic monitoring.³⁴ A psychiatry residency program achieved restoration from probationary to continued accreditation within 13 months through comprehensive quality improvements.³⁵

Conversely, programs that fail to implement sustainable corrective measures face accreditation withdrawal. When the ACGME withdraws accreditation, the consequences are immediate and severe: the program must cease accepting new residents, current residents must transfer to other ACGME-accredited programs, and the hospital loses all Medicare GME payments attributable to that program.³⁶ CMS provides no grace period or appeals process that preserves payments pending resolution.³⁷

**Application:** Here, Mercy Regional's surgery program received probationary accreditation in May 2024 after an April 2024 ACGME site visit revealed that surgery residents PGY2-PGY5 averaged **85-90 hours per week** during February-April 2024, representing a 6.25-12.5% excess over the 80-hour limit.³⁸ The violation was substantial in scope: 10 residents affected over 12 weeks equals 120 resident-weeks of violations.³⁹ The pattern was sustained and consistent, not isolated incidents.⁴⁰

The fact registry confirms the root cause: surgical volume increased 15% in Q1 2024 (trauma cases, complex surgeries), but the program made no compensatory adjustments to resident schedules despite increased workload.⁴¹ Electronic work hours system audit trails captured resident log-in/log-out times showing consistent 85-90 hour weeks across 10 residents over the three-month period.⁴²

Like the successful orthopedic surgery precedent, Mercy Regional implemented concrete, verifiable corrective actions within 60-90 days of the May 2024 citation:⁴³

1. **Hired 2 additional surgical faculty** at $800,000 annual cost (2 faculty × $400K average salary) to distribute call coverage more evenly, reducing resident on-call frequency by approximately 10-15%⁴⁴
2. **Enhanced electronic work hours tracking** through NewInnovations software with automatic alerts if residents approach 80-hour limit, weekly compliance reports, and prospective schedule adjustments⁴⁵
3. **Appointed Associate Program Director** dedicated to resident well-being, work hours monitoring, and quarterly ACGME reporting⁴⁶

These corrective actions directly address the root cause (workload-to-staffing imbalance) and align with ACGME best practices for work hours compliance.⁴⁷ They are independently verifiable through employment records, system audit logs, and organizational structure documentation.⁴⁸

**Liability Valuation:**

**If Accreditation Withdrawn (5% probability):**

- **Classification:** One-Time/Contingent (program closure is binary event, uncertain outcome)
- **Methodology:** Expected Value (probability × magnitude)
- **Calculation:**
  - **Direct GME Loss (10-year NPV)**: $2.5M annually × 8.11 annuity factor @ 4% = $20.3M⁴⁹
  - **Surgical Faculty Departures Revenue Loss (10-year NPV)**: 30-50% attrition × 15-20 faculty = 5-10 departures → $5M-$10M annual revenue loss × 8.11 = $40.6M-$81.2M⁵⁰
  - **Program Closure Costs**: Resident transfer assistance ($500K-$1M) + faculty retention bonuses ($500K-$1M) + locum tenens backfill ($2M-$6M over 2-3 years) = $3M-$8M⁵¹
  - **Total Gross Exposure**: $63.9M-$109.5M (using midpoint: $86.7M)
  - **Expected Value**: 5% probability × $86.7M = **$4.34M**
- **Result:** $4.3M expected value (rounded)
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 4% discount rate for Medicare GME payments (low-risk government payments); 8% for operational revenue loss (standard WACC per fact registry)

**Probability Assessment:**
- **Full accreditation restoration (Q2 2025):** 75-80% probability [METHODOLOGY: Based on (1) ACGME precedent cases showing successful probation exits with similar corrective actions, (2) substantive nature of Mercy's corrective measures (faculty hiring, electronic monitoring, dedicated oversight role), (3) verifiable implementation through employment records and system audit logs, (4) alignment with ACGME best practices]⁵²
- **Continued probation (18-24 months total):** 15-20% probability [METHODOLOGY: If initial corrections show improvement but sustainability concerns remain]⁵³
- **Accreditation withdrawn:** 5% probability [METHODOLOGY: Conservative estimate accounting for possibility of inadequate corrective action implementation or new violations discovered during follow-up visit]⁵⁴

**Counter-Analysis:** The target may argue that the 5% withdrawal probability is overstated because: (1) the corrective actions implemented are substantial and directly address the root cause, (2) no other ACGME citations exist beyond work hours, (3) electronic monitoring provides real-time compliance verification eliminating risk of undiscovered violations, and (4) case precedent shows high success rates for programs implementing similar corrective measures. This argument has merit based on the quality of corrective actions documented. However, three factors support maintaining the 5% risk assessment: (1) surgical volume trends post-Q1 2024 are unknown—if volume continued to increase, 2 additional faculty may prove insufficient; (2) resident morale and satisfaction are unverified (residents may be under-reporting hours under pressure); (3) ACGME follow-up visits sometimes reveal additional deficiencies beyond the original citation.

#### B.2 Medicare GME Payment Attribution and Resident Cap Constraints

**Conclusion:** The loss of 40 surgery residents from Mercy Regional's GME complement presents **LOW** immediate financial risk but **MEDIUM** strategic risk. Mercy Regional receives $27 million annually in total Medicare GME payments (Direct GME + IME) supporting 180 residents across 6 programs.⁵⁵ The surgery program's attributable share is $2.5 million annually, calculated as 40 surgery residents / 180 total residents = 22.2%, with surgery commanding higher per-resident costs due to longer training duration (5 years vs. 3 years for many specialties) and expensive educational resources.⁵⁶ If accreditation is withdrawn, this $2.5M annual payment ceases immediately under 42 C.F.R. § 413.75(b). The 10-year NPV of this loss is $20.3 million.⁵⁷ However, Mercy Regional operates at 180 FTE / 185 FTE cap = 97.3% of its 1996 Balanced Budget Act resident cap.⁵⁸ If the surgery program closes, 45 FTE slots (24.3% of cap) would become unused, but reputational harm from accreditation loss would significantly impair practical ability to launch new programs or expand existing programs to utilize these slots.⁵⁹

**Confidence:** HIGH [BASIS: Medicare GME payment formulas are statutory and regulatory, producing deterministic calculations; resident cap established by 1996 BBA is fixed by statute]

**Rule:** Medicare Direct GME payments are calculated under 42 C.F.R. § 413.76 as: Hospital's updated PRA × actual FTE residents = aggregate approved amount for cost reporting period.⁶⁰ Medicare IME payments are calculated under 42 C.F.R. § 412.105(d) as: IME Adjustment Factor = c × [(1 + r)^0.405 - 1], applied to each Medicare DRG payment.⁶¹ The 1996 Balanced Budget Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1395ww(h)(4)(F) and (d)(5)(B)(v), caps the number of FTE residents that can be counted for Medicare GME reimbursement at each hospital's count as of December 31, 1996.⁶² Exceptions to the cap are limited to: (1) Rural Track Programs under 42 C.F.R. § 412.105(f)(1)(vii), (2) Section 5506 closed hospital slot redistribution, and (3) Section 126 competitive application for underserved areas.⁶³

**Explanation:** Teaching hospitals depend on Medicare GME payments to offset the higher costs of resident training. The DGME payment covers direct costs (resident salaries, faculty supervision), while the IME adjustment compensates for inefficiencies inherent in teaching (slower workflows, more diagnostic testing, supervision burden).⁶⁴ Without these payments, teaching hospitals would operate at a significant financial disadvantage compared to non-teaching hospitals.

The 1996 BBA resident cap was Congress's response to concerns about unconstrained growth in physician supply and Medicare GME spending.⁶⁵ By freezing each hospital's cap at its 1996 level, Congress created a zero-sum environment where hospitals cannot expand GME programs without displacing slots from other programs or obtaining rare statutory exceptions.⁶⁶ The Commonwealth Fund has documented that this cap severely constrains teaching hospitals' ability to respond to physician workforce shortages in specific specialties.⁶⁷

**Application:** Here, the fact registry confirms Mercy Regional receives $27 million annually in combined Direct GME ($15M) and IME ($12M) payments supporting 180 residents.⁶⁸ The surgery program with 40 residents represents 22.2% of total resident count.⁶⁹ Given that surgery residents require 5-year training (vs. 3 years for internal medicine, family medicine), generate higher faculty supervision costs in operating rooms, and utilize expensive educational resources (simulation labs, cadaver labs), the specialist report's attribution of $2.5 million annually to the surgery program is a conservative estimate—actual attribution may be higher.⁷⁰

The hospital's 1996 BBA cap is 185 FTE residents.⁷¹ Current utilization of 180 FTE represents 97.3% of cap, leaving only 5 FTE slots (2.7%) available for expansion.⁷² This minimal headroom severely constrains strategic flexibility. Mercy Regional cannot, for example, launch a new psychiatry fellowship program (typical size: 6-12 residents) without exceeding the cap and forfeiting Medicare GME payments for the excess residents.

If the surgery program closes and 40 residents are displaced, Mercy Regional would have 45 FTE unused slots (140 current residents / 185 cap = 75.7% utilization).⁷³ Theoretically, this creates opportunity to expand other programs (internal medicine, family medicine) or launch new programs. However, three practical barriers eliminate this theoretical opportunity:

1. **Reputational harm**: Loss of surgery accreditation signals quality and compliance failures that would severely impair ability to attract residents and faculty to expanded or new programs⁷⁴
2. **Academic mission degradation**: Surgery is a core specialty; its absence undermines the hospital's teaching hospital identity and prestige⁷⁵
3. **Faculty recruitment difficulty**: Academic physicians strongly prefer teaching hospitals with comprehensive specialty offerings; a hospital without surgery residency accreditation is less attractive⁷⁶

The Rural Track Program exception is unavailable to Mercy Regional because Columbus, Ohio is an urban area, not rural under CMS definitions.⁷⁷ The Section 5506 closed hospital redistribution is opportunistic only—it depends on another teaching hospital closing and releasing its cap slots for redistribution.⁷⁸ The Section 126 competitive application for underserved areas is uncertain and would require demonstrating underserved area needs and shortage specialty focus.⁷⁹

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** Perpetual (annual GME payments cease permanently if accreditation withdrawn)
- **Methodology:** NPV (10-year horizon for teaching hospital strategic planning)
- **Calculation:** $2.5M annually × 8.11 annuity factor @ 4% discount rate = $20.3M
- **Result:** $20.3M NPV
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 4% discount rate appropriate for Medicare payments (low-risk government obligation with statutory formula)

**Probability Assessment:**
5% probability of accreditation withdrawal per B.1 analysis above = 5% × $20.3M NPV = **$1.02M expected value for GME payment loss component alone**

**Counter-Analysis:** The target may argue that the 10-year NPV horizon is too long given uncertainty in Medicare GME policy. Congress periodically considers GME payment reforms, and future legislation could increase caps, eliminate caps, or restructure payments entirely. This argument has limited merit because: (1) the 1996 BBA cap has persisted for 28 years despite numerous reform proposals, demonstrating political durability; (2) CMS has consistently maintained the accreditation-payment linkage under 42 C.F.R. § 413.75(b) without deviation; (3) even if future reform occurs, any transition period would likely preserve existing programs while grandfathering new rules. The 10-year NPV horizon is conservative compared to the indefinite nature of GME caps. [METHODOLOGY: Historical policy analysis of GME payment stability 1997-2026]

#### B.3 Post-Acquisition Faculty Retention Risk

**Conclusion:** Surgical faculty retention following the acquisition presents **MEDIUM** risk with potential operational revenue impact of $40.6M-$81.2M (10-year NPV) if the surgery program loses accreditation. Mercy Regional employs an estimated 15-20 general surgery faculty (typical 2:1 resident-to-faculty ratio for 40 surgery residents).⁸⁰ Academic surgeons are recruited specifically for teaching roles and value the academic mission, research collaboration opportunities, and prestige of teaching hospital affiliation.⁸¹ If the ACGME withdraws accreditation, the specialist report estimates 30-50% faculty attrition within 12-24 months post-closure, equaling 5-10 faculty departures.⁸² Each departing surgeon generates approximately $1M-$2M in annual net revenue, producing $5M-$10M annual revenue loss.⁸³ The 10-year NPV of this operational impact ranges from $40.6M to $81.2M at 8% discount rate.⁸⁴ Even absent accreditation withdrawal, the conversion from non-profit to for-profit ownership may trigger voluntary departures among faculty who view for-profit healthcare as inconsistent with academic medicine values.⁸⁵

**Confidence:** MEDIUM [BASIS: Faculty attrition estimates based on teaching hospital M&A precedent, but individual physician decisions inherently uncertain; revenue impact calculated from standard surgeon productivity metrics]

**Rule:** Employment agreements for academic physicians typically contain change-of-control provisions allowing voluntary termination with notice (commonly 90-180 days) following ownership change.⁸⁶ Under Ohio law, physicians are generally employees-at-will absent specific contractual protections, though academic medical centers frequently provide enhanced protections through faculty appointment processes.⁸⁷ The WARN Act, 29 U.S.C. § 2101 *et seq.*, requires 60-day advance notice for plant closings or mass layoffs affecting 50+ employees at a single site.⁸⁸ Ohio's Mini-WARN Act imposes similar notice requirements.⁸⁹ However, voluntary resignations do not trigger WARN Act obligations—only employer-initiated terminations qualify.⁹⁰

**Explanation:** Teaching hospitals face unique retention challenges during ownership transitions. Academic physicians choose teaching hospital employment for non-financial reasons including academic mission, research opportunities, teaching responsibilities, and professional prestige.⁹¹ Conversion from non-profit to for-profit ownership can undermine these motivations if physicians perceive:
- Shift from patient care/education mission to profit maximization⁹²
- Reduced investment in research infrastructure or GME programs⁹³
- Loss of academic freedom or clinical autonomy⁹⁴
- Reputational concerns about for-profit affiliation⁹⁵

Market precedent from healthcare M&A transactions shows that physician retention rates decline 15-25% within 18 months post-acquisition when non-profit teaching hospitals convert to for-profit ownership.⁹⁶ Surgeon retention is particularly vulnerable because surgeons have high market demand, portable credentials, and readily available alternative employment at competing teaching hospitals or private practice groups.⁹⁷

If a surgery residency program loses ACGME accreditation, faculty attrition accelerates dramatically. Without residents to teach, academic surgeons lose the primary professional benefit of teaching hospital employment.⁹⁸ Case studies of teaching hospitals that closed residency programs due to accreditation loss document 30-50% faculty departures within 24 months.⁹⁹ Departing faculty are disproportionately high performers—those with strongest academic credentials and research portfolios have highest mobility and quickest placement at competing institutions.¹⁰⁰

**Application:** Here, Mercy Regional's estimated 15-20 surgical faculty members were recruited for an academic teaching environment at a non-profit health system.¹⁰¹ The pending acquisition by National Healthcare Partners LLC (for-profit, private equity-backed) represents a fundamental change in institutional character.¹⁰² Even if the surgery program's accreditation is restored in Q2 2025, some faculty voluntary departures are likely due to ownership conversion alone.

If the surgery program loses accreditation (5% probability per B.1 analysis), faculty attrition would accelerate to the 30-50% range documented in precedent cases.¹⁰³ Applying the midpoint (40% attrition) to 17.5 faculty (midpoint of 15-20 range) yields 7 expected departures.¹⁰⁴

Each general surgeon generates approximately $1M-$2M in annual net revenue (after accounting for salary, benefits, malpractice insurance, and overhead allocation).¹⁰⁵ The specialist report estimates $5M-$10M annual revenue loss from surgical faculty departures.¹⁰⁶ Using 8% WACC discount rate for 10-year NPV:
- Low scenario: $5M annually × 6.71 annuity factor = $33.55M
- High scenario: $10M annually × 6.71 annuity factor = $67.1M
- Specialist report midpoint: $40.6M-$81.2M NPV range¹⁰⁷

This operational revenue loss is distinct from the $20.3M Medicare GME payment loss. The GME payment loss is immediate and certain upon accreditation withdrawal. The faculty attrition revenue loss is gradual (occurring over 12-24 months) and probabilistic (dependent on individual physician decisions).¹⁰⁸

**Liability Valuation:**
- **Classification:** Multi-Year/Phased (faculty departures occur gradually over 12-24 months, then stabilize)
- **Methodology:** DCF (discounted cash flow for phased revenue loss over 10-year horizon)
- **Calculation:**
  - Year 1-2: $5M-$10M annual revenue loss (faculty departures phase)
  - Year 3-10: Sustained $5M-$10M annual revenue loss (reduced surgical capacity)
  - 10-year NPV at 8% WACC: $40.6M-$81.2M (per specialist report calculation)¹⁰⁹
- **Result:** $40.6M-$81.2M NPV (midpoint: $60.9M)
- **Discount Rate Basis:** 8% WACC per fact registry standard for operational revenue projections

**Probability Assessment:**
- **If accreditation withdrawn (5% probability):** 30-50% faculty attrition [METHODOLOGY: Teaching hospital precedent cases documented in healthcare M&A literature]¹¹⁰
- **If accreditation restored but for-profit conversion:** 10-15% voluntary departures [METHODOLOGY: Standard physician retention rates for non-profit to for-profit conversions]¹¹¹
- **Blended probability:** (5% × 40% faculty loss) + (95% × 12.5% faculty loss) = 2% + 11.875% = **13.875% overall probability of significant faculty attrition**
- **Expected value of revenue loss:** 13.875% × $60.9M midpoint NPV = **$8.45M**

**Counter-Analysis:** The acquirer may argue that faculty retention risk is overstated because: (1) National Healthcare Partners can offer competitive compensation packages, retention bonuses, and enhanced practice autonomy to retain key surgeons; (2) Columbus, Ohio has limited competing academic medical centers, reducing surgeons' alternative employment options locally; (3) non-compete clauses in employment agreements may restrict departing surgeons' ability to practice within geographic radius; (4) even if some faculty depart, the hospital can recruit replacement surgeons from the competitive job market. These arguments have partial merit. Retention bonuses and competitive compensation can reduce voluntary departures among mid-career surgeons with families and community ties. However, senior academic surgeons with strong research portfolios have national mobility and are difficult to retain through compensation alone. Non-compete clauses are enforceable in Ohio for physicians, but typically contain 1-2 year duration and 25-50 mile radius limitations—insufficient to prevent surgeons from joining competing Columbus-area hospitals after the restriction period. Replacement recruitment is feasible but costly (recruiting expenses, sign-on bonuses, productivity ramp-up period) and difficult if the hospital's teaching hospital prestige has been damaged by accreditation loss.

| **Purchase Price Adjustment** | $0 | No adjustment recommended given low probability and post-closing timing |

**Rationale for Escrow Amount:** The $5 million recommended escrow represents approximately 2 years of Medicare GME payments attributable to the surgery program ($2.5M × 2 = $5M). This escrow would be released upon confirmation of full accreditation restoration following the Q2 2025 ACGME follow-up visit. If accreditation is withdrawn, the escrow would be retained by buyer and applied against the $20.3M NPV GME payment loss, with buyer absorbing the remaining exposure as a post-closing operational matter.

#### Scenario Analysis (TIER 3 ENHANCEMENT - P10/P50/P90)

| Finding | P10 (Optimistic) | P50 (Base Case) | P90 (Stress) | Key Driver |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| ACGME accreditation withdrawal | $0 (full restoration) | $0 (full restoration; 75-80% probability) | $86.7M (withdrawal + full faculty attrition) | ACGME Q2 2025 follow-up decision |
| Medicare GME payment loss (if withdrawn) | $15M (5-year horizon) | $20.3M (10-year NPV @ 4%) | $25M (perpetual horizon) | Time horizon for NPV calculation |
| Faculty attrition revenue loss | $20M (10% attrition, low revenue impact) | $60.9M (40% attrition, midpoint revenue) | $100M (60% attrition, high revenue impact + recruitment costs) | Faculty retention rate; replacement recruitment costs |

**Scenario Methodology:**
- **P10 (Optimistic):** ACGME restores full accreditation Q2 2025 based on successful corrective actions; minimal faculty voluntary departures due to ownership change (5-10%); revenue impact limited to replacement recruitment costs
- **P50 (Base Case):** ACGME restores full accreditation (75-80% probability scenario); moderate faculty voluntary departures (12-15%) due to for-profit conversion; operational impact manageable through retention programs
- **P90 (Stress):** ACGME withdraws accreditation (5% probability scenario realized); high faculty attrition (50-60%); cascading reputational harm impairs other programs; difficulty recruiting replacement surgeons due to loss of teaching hospital prestige

**Sensitivity Drivers:**
1. **ACGME Q2 2025 Decision:** If ACGME withdraws accreditation (binary event), exposure shifts from $0 to $86.7M instantly
2. **Surgical Volume Sustainability:** If surgical volume continues to increase beyond Q1 2024 levels and 2 additional faculty prove insufficient, probability of accreditation withdrawal increases from 5% to 15-20%
3. **Faculty Retention Program Effectiveness:** If acquirer implements aggressive retention bonuses ($100K-$250K per surgeon) and practice autonomy commitments, faculty attrition could decrease from 40% to 20%, reducing revenue impact from $60.9M to $30M

### D. Cross-Domain Implications

#### Cross-Section Impact Summary

| Finding | Affects Section | Legal Doctrine | Contract Impact |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| ACGME surgery probation | IV.J (Medical Staff Credentialing) | Faculty appointment processes; privileging requirements | Representations regarding compliance with accreditation standards |
| Medicare GME payment loss | IV.I (Medicare Provider Agreements) | CMS GME payment calculations; IME adjustment factor | Medicare revenue projections; EBITDA adjustments |
| Faculty attrition risk | IV.L (Employment & Labor) | Change-of-control provisions; WARN Act compliance | Employment agreement termination provisions; retention bonus structure |
| Teaching hospital reputational harm | IV.K (Commercial Contracts) | Payer contract "teaching hospital" status provisions | Commercial payer rate negotiation leverage |

#### Detailed Cross-References

**ACGME Surgery Probation** directly affects:
- **Section IV.J (Medical Staff Credentialing)** at ¶[TBD]: The surgery program's work hours violations raise questions about institutional oversight of medical staff well-being and compliance with duty hours regulations. Under 42 C.F.R. § 482.22 (Medicare Conditions of Participation for medical staff), hospitals must have medical staff bylaws that govern medical staff responsibilities, including supervision of residents and fellows. The credentialing section must address whether Mercy Regional's medical staff bylaws adequately address resident supervision and whether the surgery program's work hours violations indicate broader medical staff oversight deficiencies.

**Medicare GME Payment Structure** directly affects:
- **Section IV.I (Medicare Provider Agreements)** at ¶[TBD]: The $27 million annual Medicare GME payments (Direct GME + IME) represent a significant component of Mercy Regional's total Medicare revenue. The Medicare provider agreements section should incorporate GME payment risk into its analysis of total Medicare revenue exposure. If the surgery program loses accreditation and $2.5M annually in GME payments cease, this reduces total Medicare revenue and may affect the hospital's Medicare cost report calculations, readmission penalty assessments, and value-based purchasing performance metrics. The IME adjustment factor in particular would decrease hospital-wide (reduced resident-to-bed ratio), affecting all Medicare DRG payments, not just surgery-related cases.

**Surgical Faculty Retention Risk** directly affects:
- **Section IV.L (Employment & Labor)** at ¶[TBD]: The employment and labor section analyzes physician retention risk across all 650 employed physicians (per fact registry, subject to conflict resolution). Surgical faculty attrition represents a subset of this broader physician retention analysis. The section should coordinate its physician turnover probability estimates (15-25% expected turnover) with the GME section's surgical faculty attrition estimates (30-50% if accreditation withdrawn, 10-15% from ownership conversion alone). The employment section must address whether surgical faculty employment agreements contain change-of-control termination rights, non-compete clause enforceability in Ohio, and WARN Act applicability if 5-10 surgeons depart within a rolling 90-day period (likely below the 50-employee threshold at a single site, but merits confirmation).

**Teaching Hospital Reputational Harm** directly affects:
- **Section IV.K (Commercial Contracts)** at ¶[TBD]: Commercial payer contracts may include "teaching hospital" status provisions that affect reimbursement rates. Loss of surgery residency accreditation could provide leverage for commercial payers to argue that Mercy Regional no longer qualifies for teaching hospital rate premiums. The commercial contracts section should review whether major payer agreements (representing 52% of contracts requiring consent per fact registry) contain teaching hospital definitions tied to number of residency programs, total resident count, or specific specialty program requirements. If contracts define "teaching hospital" as maintaining accreditation for 6+ residency programs and surgery program closure reduces count to 5 programs, this could trigger rate renegotiation rights or breach of contract claims.

#### Precedent Transaction Analysis (TIER 3 ENHANCEMENT - "What's Market?")

Limited public precedent exists for healthcare acquisitions where target had active ACGME probationary accreditation at signing. Most teaching hospital M&A transactions either: (1) involved targets with clean accreditation records, or (2) disclosed probationary status as a material adverse effect triggering price adjustment or deal termination.

| Comparable Deal | Date | Similar Issue | Resolution | Relevance |
|-----------------|------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| HCA acquisition of Mission Health (NC) | 2019 | Teaching hospital with GME programs; community concern about for-profit conversion impact on academic mission | HCA committed to maintaining GME programs; established community oversight board; invested $1B in facilities | High relevance—demonstrates acquirer commitment to GME can mitigate faculty retention risk |
| Tenet Healthcare acquisition of Vanguard Health | 2013 | Multiple teaching hospitals with GME programs transitioning to for-profit ownership | Tenet maintained GME funding commitments; faculty retention >85% over 3 years | Medium relevance—shows for-profit acquirers can successfully retain teaching faculty |
| Ascension divestiture of Via Christi (KS) | 2016 | Teaching hospital with surgery residency program; buyer initially proposed closing program | Community advocacy resulted in buyer commitment to maintain program; $5M GME support fund established | Medium relevance—demonstrates community/regulatory pressure to maintain GME programs |

**Market Data Sources:**
- HCA mission commitment: Modern Healthcare, "HCA finalizes Mission Health acquisition" (Feb. 1, 2019) [VERIFIED: news report]
- Tenet-Vanguard retention: Becker's Hospital Review, "Tenet's approach to teaching hospitals post-acquisition" (2016) [INFERRED: industry analysis]
- Ascension-Via Christi: Kansas City Star, "Via Christi sale preserves GME programs" (Nov. 2016) [INFERRED: local news coverage]

**Benchmark Conclusions:**
- **Market Escrow Range:** GME-related escrows in teaching hospital M&A typically range from 1-2 years of attributable GME payments ($2.5M-$5M for Mercy surgery program)
- **Typical Survival Period:** GME-related representations typically survive 18-24 months post-closing to encompass at least one full ACGME accreditation cycle
- **Standard Indemnity Cap:** Teaching hospital transactions often include specific GME indemnity sublimits of $10M-$25M, separate from general indemnity basket/cap, to address magnitude of potential GME payment loss

#### E.2 Draft Contract Language

##### Finding: ACGME Surgery Program Probation and Accreditation Withdrawal Risk

**Severity:** MEDIUM | **Exposure:** $4.59M (probability-weighted) to $86.7M (gross) | **Recommended Escrow:** $5M

**Representation (Article III, Section 3.18 - GME Accreditation):**

```
Seller represents and warrants that, except as set forth on Schedule 3.18:

(a) **Accreditation Status.** Mercy Regional Health System currently operates six (6) residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), comprising one hundred eighty (180) full-time equivalent (FTE) residents as follows: Internal Medicine (60), Surgery (40), Family Medicine (35), OB/GYN (20), Pediatrics (15), and Psychiatry (10). As of the date hereof, five (5) programs (Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Psychiatry) maintain Continued Accreditation status with no citations or areas for improvement identified by ACGME during the most recent accreditation cycle.

(b) **Surgery Program Probation.** The Surgery residency program received Probationary Accreditation from the ACGME in May 2024 for violations of the 80-hour weekly duty hours limitation during the period February-April 2024, affecting ten (10) of forty (40) surgery residents. The ACGME has scheduled a follow-up site visit for Q2 2025 to determine whether full accreditation will be restored.

(c) **Corrective Actions.** Seller has implemented the following corrective actions in response to the Surgery program probation: (i) hired two (2) additional general surgery faculty effective June-August 2024 at aggregate annual cost of $800,000; (ii) enhanced electronic work hours tracking through NewInnovations software with automatic alerts and real-time monitoring; and (iii) appointed an Associate Program Director dedicated to work hours compliance and ACGME reporting. As of [Signing Date], all surgery residents are in compliance with the 80-hour weekly duty hours limitation as measured on a four-week rolling average.

(d) **Medicare GME Payments.** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025, Mercy Regional received approximately $27,000,000 in combined Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) and Indirect Medical Education (IME) payments from Medicare, of which approximately $2,500,000 is attributable to the Surgery residency program.

(e) **No Other Citations.** Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.18(e), no other ACGME citations, warnings, or areas for improvement have been issued to any of Seller's six (6) residency programs during the five (5) year period preceding the date hereof.

(f) **Seller's Knowledge.** To Seller's Knowledge, there is no pending or threatened ACGME investigation, inquiry, or complaint regarding any of Seller's residency programs other than the Surgery program probation disclosed in Section 3.18(b).
```

**Indemnification (Article VIII, Section 8.6 - GME Indemnification):**

```
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses arising from or related to the ACGME Surgery program probation or loss of GME payments, subject to:

(i) **Special Indemnity for GME Payments.** If the ACGME withdraws accreditation from the Surgery residency program at any time prior to the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for the present value of lost Medicare GME payments (Direct GME and IME) attributable to the Surgery program, calculated as $2,500,000 annually discounted at four percent (4%) over a ten (10) year period, resulting in indemnity payment of $20,300,000.

(ii) **No Deductible or Cap.** The indemnification obligations in Section 8.6(i) shall not be subject to the Deductible (Mini-Basket) or Cap provisions of Article VIII, Section 8.3, and shall constitute a separate indemnity obligation with no dollar limitation.

(iii) **Survival Period.** The representations and warranties in Article III, Section 3.18 shall survive for twenty-four (24) months from the Closing Date, extending through at least one (1) complete ACGME accreditation cycle for the Surgery program.

(iv) **Payment Mechanics.** Any indemnity payment owed under Section 8.6(i) shall be satisfied first from the GME Escrow (as defined in Section 2.3(c)), and to the extent the GME Escrow is insufficient, Seller shall pay the balance to Buyer within thirty (30) business days after written demand with supporting documentation of ACGME accreditation withdrawal.
```

**Escrow Terms (Article II, Section 2.3(c) - GME Escrow):**

```
(c) **GME Escrow.**

(i) **Amount and Purpose.** At Closing, Buyer shall withhold Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) from the Purchase Price (the "GME Escrow Amount"), to be held in escrow pending the outcome of the ACGME Q2 2025 follow-up site visit to the Surgery residency program.

(ii) **Release Conditions.** The GME Escrow Amount shall be released as follows:

    (A) **Full Release to Seller ($5,000,000).** If the ACGME restores the Surgery program to Continued Accreditation status (or equivalent full accreditation) following its Q2 2025 follow-up visit, the entire GME Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller within ten (10) business days after Buyer receives written confirmation from the ACGME or Seller's Designated Institutional Official (DIO).

    (B) **Full Retention by Buyer ($5,000,000).** If the ACGME withdraws accreditation from the Surgery program following its Q2 2025 follow-up visit (or at any time prior to the second anniversary of Closing), the entire GME Escrow Amount shall be released to Buyer and applied as partial satisfaction of Seller's indemnification obligations under Article VIII, Section 8.6(i). Buyer shall retain all rights to pursue indemnification for Losses exceeding the GME Escrow Amount ($20,300,000 total indemnity less $5,000,000 escrow = $15,300,000 remaining Seller obligation).

    (C) **Partial Release - Continued Probation ($2,500,000 to Buyer; $2,500,000 to Seller).** If the ACGME continues the Surgery program on Probationary Accreditation status following its Q2 2025 follow-up visit (neither full restoration nor withdrawal), the GME Escrow Amount shall be split equally: $2,500,000 released to Buyer to offset one year of at-risk GME payments, and $2,500,000 released to Seller. The escrowed $2,500,000 released to Buyer shall be held pending the outcome of the subsequent ACGME follow-up visit, with final release determined under subclauses (A) or (B) above.

(iii) **Time-Based Release.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the ACGME has not conducted its Q2 2025 follow-up visit by September 30, 2025, and has not communicated a revised schedule to Seller's DIO, the GME Escrow Amount shall be released to Seller on October 15, 2025, and Buyer's sole remedy for subsequent accreditation withdrawal shall be indemnification under Article VIII, Section 8.6(i) without benefit of the GME Escrow.

(iv) **Escrow Agent.** The GME Escrow Amount shall be held by [Escrow Agent Name], pursuant to the Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit D.
```

**Closing Condition (Article VII, Section 7.2(h) - ACGME Status):**

```
(h) **ACGME Q2 2025 Follow-Up Completed.** The Obligation of Buyer to consummate the Closing shall be conditioned upon the ACGME having completed its Q2 2025 follow-up site visit to the Surgery residency program and having communicated its accreditation decision to Seller's Designated Institutional Official. If the ACGME withdraws accreditation, Buyer may (at its sole discretion): (i) terminate this Agreement without penalty and with return of the Deposit, or (ii) proceed to Closing subject to the purchase price adjustment in Section 2.2(d).
```

**Knowledge Qualifier Definition:**

```
"Seller's Knowledge" means the actual knowledge of the following individuals after reasonable inquiry of the Surgery Program Director, Associate Program Director, and Designated Institutional Official: [Chief Executive Officer], [Chief Medical Officer], [Chief Operating Officer], and [General Counsel].
```

#### E.3 Pre-Closing Conditions

| Condition | Trigger | Action Required | Responsible Party |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| ACGME Q2 2025 outcome determination | Scheduled follow-up visit (April-June 2025) | Buyer receives written confirmation of accreditation decision from ACGME or DIO | Seller (provide documentation); Buyer (verify) |
| Monthly work hours compliance verified | Pre-closing due diligence | Buyer reviews June 2024-present work hours reports confirming <80 hours/week average | Seller (provide reports); Buyer (analyze) |
| 2 additional faculty employment confirmed | Pre-closing due diligence | Buyer verifies employment records, contracts, and active clinical practice for new surgical faculty | Seller (provide HR records); Buyer (verify) |
| Resident morale assessment | Pre-closing (Q1 2026) | Independent consultant conducts anonymous survey of surgery residents regarding work hours, supervision, program satisfaction | Buyer (engage consultant); Seller (facilitate access) |

#### E.4 Counter-Party Response Anticipation (TIER 3 ENHANCEMENT)

| Anticipated Position | Likelihood | Our Response | Supporting Evidence |
|---------------------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| "Surgery program probation is minor; 75-80% restoration probability means minimal risk" | HIGH | Counter: Even 5% probability of $86.7M exposure ($4.3M expected value) warrants contractual protection; magnitude justifies escrow mechanism regardless of low probability | Cite ACGME precedent showing accreditation withdrawals do occur; cite CMS regulation 42 C.F.R. § 413.75(b) creating immediate payment cessation |
| "GME escrow should be limited to 1 year of payments ($2.5M), not 2 years ($5M)" | MEDIUM | Counter: $5M represents balance between 1-year interim protection and magnitude of 10-year NPV loss ($20.3M); market precedent supports 1-2 years of attributable payments | Cite comparable teaching hospital M&A escrow ranges; note that $5M covers only 25% of total $20.3M indemnity exposure |
| "Faculty retention risk is post-closing operational matter; buyer assumes this risk" | HIGH | Accept with modification: Buyer assumes faculty retention risk if accreditation is restored; Seller indemnifies for faculty attrition directly caused by accreditation withdrawal within 24 months post-closing | Distinguish between normal post-closing operations (buyer risk) and pre-closing compliance failure (seller risk); draft indemnity language limiting seller exposure to attrition "directly resulting from ACGME accreditation withdrawal" |
| "Closing should not be conditioned on ACGME Q2 2025 outcome; timing uncertainty" | MEDIUM | Counter: Buyer requires certainty on $86.7M potential exposure before closing; alternative is larger escrow ($15M-$20M) if closing precedes ACGME decision | Demonstrate transaction timing flexibility: if ACGME completes follow-up visit April-June 2025, closing can occur Q2-Q3 2026 per original timeline; if ACGME delays, parties negotiate extension or increased escrow |

**Negotiation Strategy:**
1. **Opening Position:** $10M GME escrow (4 years of payments) + full $20.3M indemnity for accreditation withdrawal + closing condition requiring ACGME restoration confirmation
2. **Target Position:** $5M GME escrow (2 years of payments) + $20.3M indemnity cap + closing condition allowing Buyer option to terminate or proceed with price adjustment
3. **Walk-Away:** Seller refuses any GME-specific escrow or indemnity protection beyond general R&W insurance ($150M policy may exclude known GME probation issue)
4. **Leverage Points:** (1) ACGME probation disclosed in public ACGME database (if applicable)—buyer's lenders/investors will demand protection; (2) R&W insurance carrier will likely exclude GME probation as "known issue," forcing negotiated contractual protection; (3) transaction timing post-Q2 2025 ACGME decision allows certainty-based negotiation

**Response Playbook:**
- **If seller argues ACGME restoration is "certain":** Request seller accept higher indemnity cap ($25M-$30M) with lower escrow ($2.5M) to align risk allocation with seller's confidence
- **If seller proposes limiting indemnity to GME payments only (excluding faculty attrition):** Accept, but increase GME-specific escrow to $7.5M-$10M to reflect that faculty attrition is unindemnified buyer risk
- **If seller refuses closing condition tied to ACGME outcome:** Require purchase price reduction of $4.3M (expected value) as certain adjustment, with escrow mechanism preserving upside/downside allocation
