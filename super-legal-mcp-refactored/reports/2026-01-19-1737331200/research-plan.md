## ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

Document key assumptions for specialist context:

| Assumption | Basis | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| Nebraska DOI approves RBC Plan $150M injection Q1 2025 | Standard practice for RBC capital raises, 95% approval rate | If rejected, RBC ratio remains <200%, increased regulatory scrutiny, dividend restrictions, business plan approval required |
| IUL class action settles $25M-$45M within E&O coverage | Defense counsel estimate, mediation Q2 2025, Chubb $50M policy adequate | If settlement >$45M or E&O coverage unavailable, acquirer exposure, purchase price adjustment |
| Vermont captive structure acceptable to Nebraska DOI | 50-60% probability per materiality assessment | If reserve credit disallowed 10-15% probability, $730M surplus reduction, RBC 114% regulatory action level |
| Market conduct exam fines <$250K | Nebraska DOI preliminary findings, 20 violations, industry standards $5K-$10K per violation | If fines >$250K, purchase price adjustment, reputational impact, multistate examinations possible |
| Agent attrition 20-30% without retention bonuses | Industry standard post-M&A life insurance, LIMRA studies | If attrition <20% or >30%, retention bonus structure/cost may need adjustment |

**Data Gaps (Known):**
- Actual insurance policy terms for E&O coverage not provided (using industry standard $50M limit, $5M SIR assumptions)
- Vermont captive Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC detailed financials not provided (using $120M assets, $730M parental guarantee from transaction overview)
- Nebraska DOI RBC Plan review timeline estimate 90-120 days (actual may vary, could be 60 days if expedited or 150+ days if additional information requested)
- IUL class action settlement negotiations confidential (using defense counsel estimate $25M-$45M range, actual may differ based on mediation)

---

## ORCHESTRATOR NOTES

**Critical Path:**
- Phase 1 (T1-T7) can execute fully in parallel (no interdependencies)
- T8 (financial-analyst) depends on T1 RBC data, T3 settlement ranges, T4 captive scenarios (sequential after Phase 1)
- Tiered parallel validation: research-review-gate must complete FIRST (GATE), then fact-validation + coverage-gap-analysis + risk-aggregation run in parallel

**Potential Issues:**
- If Nebraska DOI RBC Plan approval uncertain or delayed, may impact closing timeline Q3 2025 → Q4 2025 or later
- If IUL class action settlement cannot be reached pre-closing, tail risk $170M-$375M punitive damages exposure remains
- If Vermont captive reserve credit disallowed, $730M surplus impact → RBC 114% creates deal-blocking issue, requires $730M additional capital or deal restructure

**Escalation Triggers:**
- If any specialist finds >$500M unquantified exposure (escalate immediately to acquirer investment committee)
- If captive recapture scenario indicates RBC <150% (regulatory action level, deal-blocking)
- If market conduct exam triggers multistate coordinated examinations (12+ states, fines could exceed $1M aggregate)

### CROSS-REFERENCE PATTERNS (Mandatory in Memorandum)

Based on HIGH severity findings, these cross-domain connections MUST appear:

| # | Source Finding | Source Section | Target Section | Doctrine/Connection | Contract Impact |
|---|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | RBC 188% + $150M capital injection | IV.A | IV.G, IV.H | Capital structure optimization: HoldCo debt ($148.36M NPV advantage) vs. surplus notes vs. equity | Purchase agreement must specify capital injection structure and Nebraska DOI approval as closing condition |
| 2 | Captive disallowance → $730M surplus reduction → RBC 114% (ACL breach) | IV.B | IV.A, IV.H | If Nebraska DOI disallows parental guarantee → regulatory seizure authority | MAE clause: Does captive disallowance constitute MAE? |
| 3 | IUL settlement $27.23M expected value | IV.D | IV.E, IV.C | E&O coverage adequacy ($50M policy, net $5M SIR); FINRA violations as evidentiary support | Settlement must occur pre-closing or escrow $36.55M (75th percentile) |
| 4 | FINRA suitability pattern (3 violations Oct 2023) | IV.C | IV.D, IV.F | Regulatory violations as class action evidence; agent training gaps | Enhanced supervision ($425K + $200K/yr) as closing condition |
| 5 | GMWB tail risk $45M-$75M impacts RBC | IV.C | IV.A, IV.H | Severe recession: $60M loss + $36.55M IUL + $9M attrition → RBC 193% (below 200% CAL) | Stress test disclosure in purchase agreement representations |
| 6 | Agent attrition 20-30% → $106M-$185M revenue decline | IV.F | IV.H, IV.C | Top 10-15% producers generate 60-70% revenue; FINRA transfer delays exacerbate attrition | Retention bonus vesting must align with FINRA approval timeline |
| 7 | Market conduct IUL illustration violations | IV.A | IV.D, IV.C | Nebraska DOI findings provide regulatory evidence for Thompson misrepresentation claims | Corrective action plan as Form A approval condition may mitigate class action damages |
| 8 | Captive recapture risk 30-60% over 5 years → RBC -20 points | IV.B | IV.A, IV.H | PBR VM-20 eliminates reserve redundancies → recapture incentive 2029-2031 → $200M buffer needed | Negotiate treaty amendment extending recapture from 10 to 15 years |
| 9 | Nebraska Form A approval timeline 60-90 days | IV.A | IV.B, IV.D, IV.F | Critical path: File April-May 2025, coordinate RBC Plan, complete IUL settlement Q2 2026, obtain reinsurer consents | Closing conditions: Form A approval + RBC Plan approval + IUL settlement-in-principle |
| 10 | HoldCo debt structure → $148.36M NPV benefit | IV.G | IV.A, IV.H | Tax optimization netted against gross exposure: $235M - $148.36M = $86.64M net | Purchase agreement should specify HoldCo domicile (Nevada/Wyoming) and debt issuance |
