## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview

This report analyzes the Vermont captive reinsurance structure and commercial reinsurance agreements associated with Liberty Life Insurance Company's acquisition by American Financial Holdings LLC (Project Chronos, $2.9B transaction value). The research examines: (1) Vermont captive regulatory framework for Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC; (2) NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (AG48) compliance and reserve credit sustainability; (3) reinsurance recapture risk and economic incentives; (4) third-party reinsurance counterparty consent requirements; and (5) letter of credit (LOC) collateral strategy as mitigation for AG48 deficiencies.

**BOTTOM LINE:** The Vermont captive structure presents **two material AG48 compliance deficiencies** creating 10-15% probability of Nebraska DOI reserve credit disallowance, which would reduce Liberty Life's Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio from 188% to **114%** (Authorized Control Level)—a **deal-blocking regulatory event** absent immediate $730M capital injection or LOC deployment. While 85-90% probability suggests Nebraska DOI continues historical acceptance of the structure, the combination of (1) parental guarantee net worth failure ($280M parent net worth < $730M guarantee amount), and (2) Primary Security deficiency (14.1% vs. industry standard 25-50%) creates material tail risk requiring pre-closing mitigation planning. Additionally, captive recapture probability of 30-60% over 2026-2031 (driven by Principle-Based Reserves VM-20 adoption eliminating XXX/AXXX redundancy) poses 20-percentage-point RBC decline risk requiring $200M-$300M capital buffer planning.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Vermont Captive Regulatory Framework - LOW RISK (Domiciliary Compliance)

**Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC** is a Vermont-domiciled captive insurance company authorized under **8 V.S.A. Chapter 141** (Vermont Captive Insurance Companies Act, amended July 1, 2024). The captive holds:
- **Assets:** $120 million (bonds and cash) = 14.1% of $850M reinsured reserves
- **Parental Guarantee:** $730 million from Liberty Life Holdings LLC = 85.9% of reserves
- **Total Collateral:** $850 million supporting Nebraska DOI statutory reserve credit for XXX/AXXX term and universal life redundant reserves

**Vermont DFR Compliance:** The $120M asset base substantially exceeds Vermont's minimum capital requirements for any captive type (ranging from $100K for sponsored captives to $1M for risk retention groups). Vermont DFR oversight includes:
- Annual VCAR (Vermont Captive Annual Report) filing with audited financial statements
- Triennial examination authority (likely last examined 2021-2023)
- Investment restrictions requiring investment-grade securities and diversification
- Premium tax of 0.38% on gross written premiums

**Conclusion:** Vermont domiciliary regulation poses **minimal risk**. Vermont DFR maintains a pro-captive regulatory environment (1,200+ licensed captives as of 2024) and defers to Nebraska DOI (ceding state regulator) on reserve credit determinations. Vermont's role is limited to ensuring captive solvency and statutory compliance, not evaluating Nebraska's reserve credit approval.

#### 2. AG48 Compliance Deficiencies - **CRITICAL RISK** (10-15% Disallowance Probability)

**NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48** (AG48), effective January 1, 2015, established standards for XXX/AXXX reserve financing transactions to address "shadow insurance" concerns raised by New York DFS in 2013 (revealing $48B in hidden captive transactions nationally). AG48 requires:

**Primary Security:** High-quality assets (cash, investment-grade bonds, Treasuries) calculated via Actuarial Method to represent economic reserve layer
**Other Security:** Additional collateral (parental guarantees, LOCs, lower-quality assets) to support remaining statutory reserve requirement

**Liberty Captive Structure Analysis:**

| Component | Amount | % of Total | AG48 Classification | Compliance Status |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Captive Assets (bonds + cash) | $120M | 14.1% | Primary Security | **DEFICIENT** (vs. 25-50% industry standard) |
| Parental Guarantee | $730M | 85.9% | Other Security | **NON-COMPLIANT** (net worth condition failure) |
| **TOTAL** | **$850M** | **100%** | | **AG48 AT RISK** |

**DEFICIENCY #1: Primary Security Shortfall (14.1% vs. 25-50%)**

Industry practice and regulatory guidance indicate AG48-compliant transactions maintain Primary Security of 25-50% of statutory reserves. Liberty's $120M (14.1%) falls substantially below this range, creating shortfall of:
- **Minimum standard (25%):** $212.5M required → $92.5M shortfall
- **Conservative standard (50%):** $425M required → $305M shortfall

**DEFICIENCY #2: Parental Guarantee Net Worth Failure**

AG48 "Other Security" parental guarantee conditions require:
1. Parent RBC ratio >300% (uncertain; transaction documents do not specify)
2. **Parent net worth > guarantee amount** → **$280M < $730M FAILS** ✗
3. Parent credit rating A or better (uncertain; likely unrated or below A)

Research plan indicates Liberty Life Holdings LLC has **$280M net worth**, failing the AG48 requirement that parent net worth exceed the $730M guarantee amount by **$450M shortfall**.

**Conclusion:** The parental guarantee appears **non-compliant** with AG48 standards based on available information, creating material risk that Nebraska DOI disallows reserve credit upon regulatory review during Form A (change of control approval) process.

#### 3. Nebraska DOI Regulatory Scrutiny - **10-15% Disallowance Probability, DEAL-BLOCKING IMPACT**

As Liberty Life's domiciliary regulator, the **Nebraska Department of Insurance** has exclusive authority to approve or disallow statutory reserve credit for the Vermont captive reinsurance. Nebraska has implemented AG48 principles (either via direct AG48 adoption or through NAIC Model Regulation #787, which 42 jurisdictions have adopted as of August 2025).

**Historical Acceptance (85-90% Probability Base Case):**

The Vermont captive structure has likely operated since 2015-2018 with Nebraska DOI approval, suggesting historical regulatory acceptance. Nebraska DOI's past approval creates precedent favoring continued reserve credit, absent material change in circumstances or increased regulatory scrutiny.

**Scrutiny Risk Factors (10-15% Probability Adverse Action):**

- **AG48 Enforcement Trend:** 10-15 states post-2020 have increased captive reserve credit scrutiny, requiring collateral upgrades or enhanced Primary Security
- **A.M. Best Concerns:** Rating agency publications 2015-2024 expressed concerns about shadow insurance structures where parental guarantees exceed 75% of collateral
- **Form A Change of Control Review:** Project Chronos acquisition triggers Nebraska DOI Form A filing, creating heightened regulatory review opportunity for Nebraska DOI to reassess captive structure
- **Parental Guarantee Net Worth Failure:** Explicit AG48 violation ($280M < $730M) provides statutory basis for Nebraska DOI to demand remediation

**Financial Impact of Reserve Credit Disallowance:**

**Scenario: Nebraska DOI Disallows $730M Parental Guarantee**

| Metric | Current (Pre-Disallowance) | Post-Disallowance | Change |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Statutory Surplus** | $1.85B | $1.12B | **-$730M (-39.5%)** |
| **RBC Ratio** | 188% | **114%** | **-74 percentage points** |
| **Action Level** | Company Action Level (CAL) | **Authorized Control Level (ACL)** | **↓2 levels** |

**At 114% RBC ratio (Authorized Control Level), Nebraska DOI has authority to:**
- Place Liberty Life under **regulatory supervision or conservatorship**
- Restrict dividends, distributions, and capital withdrawals
- Require immediate capital infusion ($730M+ to restore surplus)
- Prohibit new business writings until capital restored
- Order rehabilitation or liquidation if capital not restored

**Conclusion:** Reserve credit disallowance represents a **DEAL-BLOCKING regulatory event** requiring immediate remediation. Even 10-15% tail risk probability warrants pre-closing mitigation planning, including LOC commitment letter ($730M at 100 bps = $7.3M annual cost) and Nebraska DOI pre-filing consultation to surface concerns before Form A submission.

#### 4. Recapture Risk - **30-60% Probability Over 5 Years, RBC -20 Percentage Points**

**Recapture Defined:** Contractual right of ceding company (Liberty Life) to reassume risks previously ceded to reinsurer (Vermont captive), effectively terminating the reinsurance agreement.

**Standard Recapture Timing:**
- **Term life (XXX):** 10-15 years from policy issue (most common: 10 years)
- **Universal life (AXXX):** 10-20 years from policy issue (most common: 15 years)

**Liberty Captive Recapture Window Analysis:**

Based on industry patterns for AG48-compliant captive establishments (post-January 1, 2015 effective date), Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC was likely established **2015-2018**, with estimated treaty effective date **2016** (midpoint).

**Recapture Eligibility:**
- **10-year anniversary:** **2026** (current transaction year) ← **IMMEDIATE RISK**
- **15-year anniversary:** **2031** (5 years post-acquisition)

**Critical Finding:** The captive structure is **approaching or within the 10-year recapture window**, creating immediate post-acquisition recapture risk if treaty contains standard 10-year recapture provisions.

**Economic Incentive for Recapture: PBR VM-20 Impact**

NAIC **Valuation Manual VM-20** (Principle-Based Reserves), effective January 1, 2017 (early adoption) and mandatory January 1, 2020, establishes principle-based reserve methodologies that **reduce or eliminate XXX/AXXX reserve redundancies**. American Academy of Actuaries guidance notes VM-20 will "effectively eliminate the financial incentive for financing transactions once PBR becomes effective."

Recapture incentives include:
1. **Eliminate annual captive costs:** Vermont premium tax 0.38%, audit fees, regulatory fees = $500K-$1M annually
2. **Simplify corporate structure:** Reduce regulatory complexity, examination burden
3. **Improve RBC ratio:** If VM-20 reserves lower than XXX/AXXX, recapture increases net available capital

**Recapture Probability Estimate:**

| Timeframe | Probability | Triggering Factor |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **2026-2028 (0-2 years post-closing)** | **30-40%** | 10-year treaty anniversary + PBR adoption complete |
| **2029-2031 (3-5 years post-closing)** | **50-60%** | 15-year anniversary + full VM-20 transition |
| **2032+ (6+ years post-closing)** | **20-30%** | Mortality improvement triggers |

**Recapture Financial Impact:**

*Assumptions:*
- Recapture 2030 (14 years post-treaty)
- VM-20 reserves $650M (↓23.5% from $850M XXX/AXXX, consistent with PBR reserve reductions observed industry-wide)

*RBC Impact:*
- **Before Recapture:** RBC ratio 188% (baseline)
- **After Recapture:** Statutory reserves increase +$650M (VM-20) vs. -$850M (previously ceded) = **-$200M surplus benefit lost**
- **Adjusted RBC Ratio:** 168% (TAC $1.65B ÷ ACL $982M)
- **Decline:** **-20 percentage points** (188% → 168%)

**Regulatory Consequence:** RBC ratio remains above 150% Regulatory Action Level but below 200% Company Action Level, requiring Nebraska DOI notification and updated RBC Plan. If recapture coincides with market stress (below-IG bond defaults, GMWB losses), combined RBC ratio could approach or breach 150% RAL.

**Mitigation Strategy:** Negotiate contractual amendment to Vermont captive coinsurance treaty extending recapture eligibility from 10 to 15 years (2026 → 2031), providing 5-year buffer for acquirer to strengthen capital position. Cost: <$50K (administrative amendment, no adverse counterparty since wholly-owned affiliate). Additionally, establish $200M-$300M capital buffer for eventual recapture scenario 2029-2031.

#### 5. Third-Party Reinsurance Counterparty Consent - **90-95% Success Probability**

Liberty Life maintains $925M in third-party reinsurance (separate from $850M Vermont captive):

| Reinsurer | Domicile | Treaty Type | Amount | Product Coverage |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|------------------|
| **Global Reinsurance Ltd.** | Bermuda | Coinsurance | $450M | Universal life |
| **Swiss Re Life & Health America** | USA (MO) | YRT | $280M | Term life excess mortality |
| **Munich Re Life US** | USA (DE) | Excess of Loss | $195M | Excess mortality |

**Change of Control Consent Requirements:**

Industry precedent indicates:
- **70-80% of reinsurance treaties** require change of control notification (30-45 days)
- **40-50% of treaties** require affirmative reinsurer consent
- **30-40% of treaties** grant reinsurer early recapture rights upon change of control

**Consent Risk Assessment:**

| Reinsurer | Consent Probability | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|------------|
| **Swiss Re (A+ rated, U.S.)** | 95-98% | Minimal | Standard notification |
| **Munich Re (A+ rated, U.S.)** | 95-98% | Minimal | Standard notification |
| **Global Re (A rated, Bermuda)** | 85-90% | Moderate | Pre-closing dialogue, consent as closing condition |

**Overall Consent Probability:** **90-95%** with potential 30-60 day delays if Global Re requests revised terms (increased ceding commission 50-100 bps = $2.25M-$4.5M annual cost) or additional acquirer financial information.

**Timeline:** Notify reinsurers within 30 days of definitive agreement, allow 60-120 days for due diligence and consent process, target Q2 2025 consents for Q3 2025 closing.

**Reinsurer Credit Ratings:** Swiss Re and Munich Re (U.S.-domiciled authorized reinsurers, A+ ratings) pose minimal credit risk; Liberty Life receives full statutory reserve credit without collateral. Global Re (Bermuda Certified Reinsurer, A rating) requires 10-20% collateral ($45M-$90M) under NAIC Model #785 for full reserve credit.

#### 6. LOC Collateral Strategy - **$7.3M Annual Cost, 60-90 Day Procurement**

If Nebraska DOI demands replacement of $730M parental guarantee with letter of credit:

**LOC Cost Analysis (2024-2025 Market Pricing):**

| Bank Tier | LOC Fee (bps) | Annual Cost | After-Tax Cost (21% rate) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Tier 1 (JPM, BAC, WFC)** | 50-100 bps | $3.65M-$7.3M | $2.88M-$5.767M |
| **Tier 2 (Regional Banks)** | 75-125 bps | $5.475M-$9.125M | $4.33M-$7.21M |
| **Federal Home Loan Bank** | 7.5 bps | $547.5K | $432.5K (requires FHLB membership + collateral pledge 110-120%) |

**Median Cost Estimate:** $7.3M annual (100 bps Tier 1 bank pricing) = **$5.767M after-tax** = **3.1% reduction in Liberty Life net income** ($185M baseline).

**LOC Requirements for Statutory Reserve Credit (NAIC Model #786):**
1. **Clean:** No documentary requirements beyond certification of amount due
2. **Irrevocable:** Cannot be cancelled without beneficiary consent
3. **Unconditional:** No conditions precedent to draw
4. **Qualified U.S. Financial Institution (QUSFI):** Issued by bank on NAIC QUSFI list (typically AA- or better credit rating)
5. **Evergreen:** Automatically renews annually unless 30-90 days non-renewal notice

**LOC Procurement Timeline:**
- Bank selection and credit application: 2-4 weeks
- LOC negotiation and documentation: 2-4 weeks
- Nebraska DOI regulatory approval filing: 4-8 weeks
- LOC issuance and reserve credit: 1-2 weeks
- **Total: 60-90 days**

**Recommended Strategy:** **Wait-and-See with LOC Pre-Negotiation**

Given 85-90% probability Nebraska DOI does not demand LOC immediately:
1. Maintain current structure pending Nebraska DOI feedback during Form A review
2. **Pre-negotiate 90-day LOC commitment letter** from Tier 1 bank (JPMorgan Chase target) at locked-in pricing (100 bps)
3. Implement LOC only if mandated by Nebraska DOI as closing condition or post-closing directive

**Cost:** Commitment fee $365K-$730K (5-10 bps one-time) provides execution certainty while avoiding $7.3M annual cost if parental guarantee remains acceptable.

**Alternative: Hybrid Structure (Increased Primary Security + LOC)**
- Increase Primary Security to 40%: $340M captive assets (add $220M)
- LOC for remaining 60%: $510M LOC
- **LOC cost savings:** $5.1M annually (vs. $7.3M for full $730M LOC)
- **Downside:** Requires $220M additional capital, reducing holding company liquidity

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. VERMONT CAPTIVE INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

#### 1. Statutory Authority and Capital Requirements

Vermont's captive insurance regulatory framework is established under **8 V.S.A. Chapter 141 (Vermont Captive Insurance Companies Act)**, with recent amendments effective July 1, 2024.¹ The statute provides comprehensive regulation of captive insurance companies, including special purpose financial captives (SPFCs) commonly used for life insurance reserve financing.

**Minimum Capital and Surplus Requirements (8 V.S.A. § 6004):**²

Prior to issuing policies or entering into reinsurance contracts, each captive insurance company must maintain unimpaired paid-in capital and surplus as follows:

| Captive Type | Minimum Capital |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Pure captive insurance company | $250,000 |
| Association captive insurance company | $500,000 |
| Industrial insured captive insurance company | $500,000 |
| Agency captive insurance company | $250,000 |
| Risk retention group | $1,000,000 |
| Sponsored captive insurance company | $100,000 |

**Special Purpose Financial Captives (SPFCs):**

Section 6048g establishes distinct capital requirements for SPFCs, while Section 6049e sets separate minimums for Affiliated Reinsurance Companies.³ These specialized captive types are specifically designed for life insurance reserve financing transactions, such as the Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC structure at issue here.

**Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC Capitalization Analysis:**

Based on transaction data, Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC holds:
- **Assets:** $120 million (bonds and cash) = **14.1% of reinsured reserves** ($120M ÷ $850M)
- **Parental Guarantee:** $730 million from Liberty Life Holdings LLC = **85.9% of reinsured reserves**
- **Total Collateral:** $850 million supporting statutory reserve credit

The $120 million in assets substantially exceeds Vermont's minimum capital requirements for any captive type, satisfying Vermont's domiciliary regulatory standards. However, the heavy reliance on parental guarantee (86% of collateral) rather than primary security assets creates potential vulnerability to Nebraska DOI scrutiny under AG48 standards (discussed in Section IV.B below).

#### 2. Regulatory Oversight and Examination Requirements

The Vermont Commissioner of Financial Regulation possesses broad supervisory authority under **8 V.S.A. § 6002** (Licensing; authority).⁴ The regulatory framework includes:

**Annual Reporting (8 V.S.A. § 6007):**⁵

Vermont captive insurance companies must annually submit to the commissioner a report of their financial condition, verified by oath of two executive officers, using the "**Vermont Captive Insurance Company Annual Report (VCAR)**" form prescribed by the commissioner. The financial statements must be:
- Prepared on the same basis of accounting as the annual statement
- Comparative, presenting amounts as of December 31 (or fiscal year end) for both the current year and immediately preceding year
- Audited by an independent certified public accountant

**Audit and Accountant Requirements:**⁶

The accountant must furnish the captive company a letter stating they:
1. Are independent and conform to professional ethics standards of the AICPA and FASB
2. Describe background and experience of audit staff, including experience auditing captives or insurance companies
3. Understand the audited annual report will be filed with the Department of Financial Regulation
4. Consent to making work papers available for review by the commissioner

**Examination Authority (8 V.S.A. § 6008):**⁷

The Commissioner may conduct examinations and investigations of captive insurance companies, including:
- **Organizational examination:** General survey of corporate records (charter, bylaws, minute books), verification of capital and surplus, verification of principal place of business, determination of assets and liabilities
- **Financial examination:** May be performed at the Commissioner's discretion or upon petition
- **Triennial examination:** Vermont DFR typically examines captives on a three-year cycle, though frequency may increase for captives with elevated risk profiles

**Regulatory Compliance for Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC:**

As a Vermont-domiciled captive, Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC is subject to:
- Annual VCAR filing (due March 1 following fiscal year end, with 30-day extension available)
- Audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Statutory Accounting Principles (SAP)
- Periodic examination by Vermont DFR (likely last examined 2021-2023 range)
- Investment restrictions under 8 V.S.A. § 6010 (Legal investments) and § 6048j (SPFC-specific investment rules)

#### 3. Investment Restrictions and Asset Quality Standards

**General Investment Standards (8 V.S.A. § 6010):**⁸

Vermont law designates "legal investments" permissible for captives, while **§ 6048j** specifies "Disposition of assets; investments" for SPFCs. The statute generally requires captive assets to be invested in a manner consistent with the NAIC Model Act for captive investments, emphasizing:
- Investment-grade securities (BBB-/Baa3 or higher from recognized rating agencies)
- Diversification to limit concentration risk
- Liquidity sufficient to meet policyholder obligations

**Liberty Captive Asset Composition Analysis:**

Transaction documents indicate Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC holds $120 million in "bonds and cash equivalents." Assuming compliance with Vermont investment standards, this likely comprises:
- **Investment-grade bonds:** 70-85% of assets ($84M-$102M), likely U.S. Treasury securities, agency bonds, or highly rated corporate bonds
- **Cash and cash equivalents:** 15-30% of assets ($18M-$36M), held in FDIC-insured accounts or money market funds

**Risk Assessment:**

The $120 million asset base provides **primary security** that is directly accessible to satisfy policyholder claims without relying on the parental guarantee. Vermont DFR has likely verified during examinations that:
- Asset quality meets statutory standards (investment-grade or better)
- Custody arrangements ensure assets are segregated and available
- Investment policies comply with Vermont captive investment regulations

However, the adequacy of $120 million (14% of reserves) as "primary security" depends on AG48 standards enforced by the **ceding state** (Nebraska DOI), not Vermont DFR. This creates potential regulatory tension between domicile and ceding state regulators (analyzed in Section IV.B).

#### 4. Vermont DFR Licensing and Ongoing Compliance

**Licensing Requirements:**⁹

Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC would have obtained a Vermont captive insurance license under 8 V.S.A. § 6002, requiring:
- Application with business plan describing purpose, risk profile, and capitalization
- Feasibility study demonstrating economic viability
- Actuarial opinion supporting reserve adequacy
- Proof of minimum capital and surplus ($250,000+ depending on captive type)
- Payment of licensing fees (Vermont captive license fee: $5,000 initial + $3,000-$5,000 annual renewal)

**Ongoing Compliance Obligations:**¹⁰

Vermont captives must maintain:
- **Annual premium tax:** 0.38% of gross written premiums (or minimum tax if applicable)
- **Regulatory filings:** VCAR annual report, audited financial statements, actuarial certifications
- **Corporate governance:** Board of directors meetings, bylaws compliance, minute book maintenance
- **Registered agent:** Vermont-based registered agent for service of process

**Vermont DFR Enforcement Posture:**

Vermont has cultivated a **pro-captive regulatory environment** to maintain its position as the leading U.S. captive domicile (over 1,200 captives licensed as of 2024).¹¹ Vermont DFR enforcement tends to focus on:
- Actuarial soundness of reserve financing transactions
- Asset adequacy relative to assumed liabilities
- Compliance with SPFC statutory requirements under 8 V.S.A. Subchapter 004 (§§ 6048a-6048o)

Vermont DFR generally does **not** substitute its judgment for that of the ceding state regulator (Nebraska DOI) regarding reserve credit approval. Vermont's role is to ensure the captive operates safely and soundly as a domiciliary matter, while Nebraska DOI determines whether Liberty Life receives statutory reserve credit.

#### 5. Vermont vs. Nebraska Regulatory Tension

**Critical Jurisdictional Issue:**

Vermont DFR regulates Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC as the **domiciliary regulator** (licensing, examination, solvency oversight). However, the **Nebraska Department of Insurance** regulates whether Liberty Life Insurance Company (the ceding company) receives statutory reserve credit for the $850 million reinsured to the Vermont captive.

**Nebraska DOI Scrutiny Risk (10-15% probability per research plan assumptions):**

Even if Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC fully complies with Vermont captive regulations, Nebraska DOI may:
- Disallow or reduce statutory reserve credit if the captive structure fails AG48 standards (discussed Section IV.B)
- Require additional collateral (e.g., letter of credit) to replace parental guarantee
- Demand increased "Primary Security" percentage (e.g., 25-50% assets vs. current 14%)

**Consequence of Reserve Credit Disallowance:**

If Nebraska DOI disallows the $730 million parental guarantee component:
- Liberty Life's statutory surplus would decrease by $730 million ($1.85B → $1.12B)
- Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio would decline from 188% to approximately **114%** (below 150% Regulatory Action Level)
- Nebraska DOI would have authority to impose corrective action plan, restrict dividends, or potentially place Liberty Life under regulatory supervision

This jurisdictional tension—between Vermont's captive-friendly domiciliary regulation and Nebraska's conservative reserve credit standards—creates the central regulatory risk in this transaction.

### B. NAIC ACTUARIAL GUIDELINE 48 (AG48) COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

#### 1. AG48 Framework and Purpose

**NAIC Actuarial Guideline XLVIII (AG48)** was adopted by the NAIC Executive Committee and Plenary in December 2014 and became effective January 1, 2015.¹² AG48 defines the rules for new XXX and AXXX reserve financing transactions executed after the effective date, addressing regulatory concerns about captive reinsurance arrangements used for term life insurance with level premiums (XXX) and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees (AXXX).

**Historical Context - "Shadow Insurance" Controversy:**

Prior to AG48, life insurers increasingly turned to captive reinsurers to finance redundant statutory reserves on term and universal life products when reserves were viewed as excessive relative to underlying economic risk.¹³ This practice, termed "**shadow insurance**" by the New York State Department of Financial Services in 2013, depicted arrangements whereby insurers shifted blocks of insurance policy claims to special out-of-state (or out-of-country) shell companies, or captives, which carriers then used to reinsure existing policy claims—an arrangement DFS called a "complex shell game" that enables carriers to divert policy reserves to other purposes while the parent company remains "on the hook" through parental guarantee.¹⁴

A 2013 New York State DFS report revealed that New York-based insurers were held accountable for at least **$48 billion in hidden 'shadow insurance' transactions** through captive and reinsurance entities.¹⁵ Regulators warned that failing to regulate shadow insurance could short-change tax-payers and, in a worst case scenario, place the entire economy at risk from cascading failures.¹⁶

**AG48 Response:**

AG48 established a consistent method for calculating the **economic reserve** (plus a margin for conservatism) and the level of "**primary security**" (i.e., higher quality assets), even when held at a captive reinsurer.¹⁷ The remainder of the statutory reserve is allowed to be backed by a wider variety of assets, referred to as "**other security**," and the ceding company's appointed actuary is required to analyze transactions to determine whether the required amount of high-quality assets are being held to back the reserve and whether the remainder of the reserve is sufficiently backed by other types of assets.¹⁸

#### 2. AG48 Key Definitions and Requirements

**Primary Security:**¹⁹

"Primary Security" refers to high-quality assets that must be held by the reinsurer (including captive reinsurers) to support the **Required Level of Primary Security**. Acceptable Primary Security assets include:
- Cash and cash equivalents
- Investment-grade bonds (NAIC 1-2 designation, equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher)
- U.S. Treasury and agency securities
- Certain loan obligations secured by real property
- Other assets specifically approved by the ceding company's domiciliary commissioner

**Other Security:**²⁰

"Other Security" refers to collateral beyond Primary Security that may be used to support the remaining statutory reserve requirement. Other Security may include:
- **Parental guarantees** (subject to conditions: parent RBC >300%, net worth > guarantee amount, A rating or better from recognized rating agency)
- Letters of credit from qualified U.S. financial institutions
- Assets that do not meet Primary Security quality standards (e.g., below-investment-grade bonds, certain equity securities)
- Other forms of collateral approved by the domiciliary commissioner

**Required Level of Primary Security (Actuarial Method):**²¹

AG48 specifies an "Actuarial Method" to calculate the Required Level of Primary Security, which represents the **economic reserve layer**—the amount of reserves actuarially necessary to support policyholder obligations under reasonable assumptions. The Actuarial Method calculation is designed to identify a reserve level that is sufficiently conservative to provide for the payment of all policyholder claims, but that is less conservative than the currently required gross XXX or AXXX reserving levels.²²

**Appointed Actuary Certification:**²³

The ceding company's appointed actuary must provide an actuarial opinion certifying that:
1. The Required Level of Primary Security has been calculated in accordance with AG48 methodology
2. Primary Security assets held by the reinsurer meet or exceed the Required Level
3. Other Security is sufficient to cover the remaining statutory reserve requirement
4. The total collateral (Primary Security + Other Security) is adequate to support the ceded reserves

If these conditions are not met, the appointed actuary must issue a **qualified opinion**, which may trigger regulatory action by the ceding company's domiciliary insurance department.

#### 3. Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC AG48 Compliance Assessment

**Current Structure Analysis:**

| Component | Amount | % of Total | AG48 Classification |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Captive Assets (bonds + cash) | $120M | 14.1% | **Primary Security** |
| Parental Guarantee | $730M | 85.9% | **Other Security** |
| **Total Collateral** | **$850M** | **100%** | Supporting $850M statutory reserves |

**Critical Issue:**

The 14.1% Primary Security ratio is **substantially below** the typical range for AG48-compliant transactions. Based on industry practice and regulatory guidance:

- **Expected Primary Security Range:** 25-50% of statutory reserves ($212.5M-$425M for $850M reserves)²⁴
- **Liberty Captive Primary Security:** $120M = **14.1%** of reserves
- **Shortfall:** $92.5M-$305M below expected Primary Security levels (using 25-50% range)

**Parental Guarantee Conditions:**

For the $730 million parental guarantee from Liberty Life Holdings LLC to qualify as acceptable "Other Security" under AG48, the following conditions must be met:²⁵

1. **Parent RBC Ratio >300%:** Liberty Life Holdings LLC must maintain RBC ratio exceeding 300% (3× the Authorized Control Level)
   - *Transaction documents do not specify parent's RBC ratio*
   - *Risk: If parent RBC <300%, parental guarantee may not qualify under AG48*

2. **Parent Net Worth > Guarantee Amount:** Liberty Life Holdings must have net worth exceeding $730M
   - *Research plan indicates Liberty Life Holdings LLC has $280M net worth*
   - *$280M < $730M guarantee amount* → **FAILS AG48 CONDITION**

3. **Parent Credit Rating:** Liberty Life Holdings must maintain "A" rating or better from A.M. Best, Standard & Poor's, Moody's, or Fitch
   - *Transaction documents do not specify parent's credit rating*
   - *Risk: If parent unrated or rated below A, parental guarantee may not qualify*

**Conclusion:** Based on available information, the parental guarantee structure appears **non-compliant** with AG48 standards, specifically failing the net worth condition ($280M parent net worth < $730M guarantee amount).

#### 4. Nebraska DOI Regulatory Scrutiny Risk

**AG48 Adoption in Nebraska:**

Nebraska has implemented AG48 principles for captive reserve financing transactions executed after January 1, 2015.²⁶ As Liberty Life's domiciliary regulator, the **Nebraska Department of Insurance** has authority to:
- Review and approve (or disallow) statutory reserve credit for reinsurance ceded to captives
- Require additional collateral or increased Primary Security percentages
- Disallow reserve credit for transactions that fail AG48 standards

**Model Regulation #787 (XXX/AXXX Model Regulation):**

The NAIC subsequently codified AG48 principles in the **Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation (#787)**, also known as the XXX/AXXX Model Regulation, which harmonizes reserve financing standards and became an accreditation standard for states.²⁷ As of August 2025, **42 jurisdictions have implemented Model #787**, while **9 jurisdictions continue to rely on AG48** as the governing framework.²⁸

Nebraska's implementation status (Model #787 vs. AG48 framework) is not specified in available sources, but either standard would subject the Liberty captive structure to scrutiny regarding:
- Adequacy of Primary Security (14.1% vs. expected 25-50%)
- Validity of parental guarantee (net worth condition failure)
- Overall compliance with reserve financing standards

**Regulatory Enforcement Posture (2023-2024):**

While the search results did not reveal specific Nebraska DOI enforcement actions in 2023-2024, industry sources indicate:

- **10-15 states post-2020** have increased scrutiny of captive reserve credit arrangements, requiring collateral upgrades or increased Primary Security percentages²⁹
- **A.M. Best and rating agencies** have expressed concerns about shadow insurance structures, particularly where parental guarantees constitute >75% of collateral³⁰
- **Principle-Based Reserves (PBR) adoption** under VM-20 has created incentives for reinsurers to recapture XXX/AXXX business, as PBR reduces or eliminates reserve redundancies³¹

**Estimated Probability of Nebraska DOI Action:**

Based on research plan assumptions and industry trends:

| Regulatory Action | Probability | Potential Requirement |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Request for additional information | **60-70%** | Actuarial analysis, parental guarantee documentation |
| Demand for collateral upgrade | **30-40%** | Letter of credit replacing parental guarantee |
| Increased Primary Security requirement | **20-30%** | Raise Primary Security to 25-50% ($212.5M-$425M) |
| Partial disallowance of reserve credit | **10-15%** | Disallow $730M parental guarantee portion |
| Full disallowance of reserve credit | **<5%** | Disallow all $850M (would be extraordinary) |

#### 5. Financial Impact of Reserve Credit Disallowance

**Scenario 1: Partial Disallowance ($730M Parental Guarantee Rejected)**

If Nebraska DOI disallows the $730 million parental guarantee as "Other Security" due to AG48 non-compliance:

**Liberty Life Statutory Surplus Impact:**
- Current statutory surplus: $1.85 billion
- Reserve credit disallowed: -$730 million
- **Adjusted statutory surplus: $1.12 billion** (↓39.5%)

**Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Ratio Impact:**³²
- Current RBC ratio: **188%** (TAC $1.85B ÷ ACL $982M = 1.88)
- Adjusted TAC after disallowance: $1.12B
- **Adjusted RBC ratio: 114%** (TAC $1.12B ÷ ACL $982M = 1.14)

**Regulatory Action Level Consequences:**

| RBC Ratio | Action Level | Regulatory Authority |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| 200%+ | Company Action Level (CAL) | File RBC Plan (Liberty current: 188%) |
| 150-199% | Regulatory Action Level (RAL) | DOI may examine, order RBC Plan |
| 100-149% | Authorized Control Level (ACL) | DOI may place under regulatory control |
| 70-99% | Mandatory Control Level (MCL) | DOI must place under regulatory control |

**At 114% RBC ratio (Authorized Control Level):**

Nebraska DOI would have authority to:
- Place Liberty Life under **regulatory supervision or conservatorship**
- Restrict dividends, distributions, and capital withdrawals
- Require immediate capital infusion ($730M+ to restore surplus)
- Prohibit new business writings until capital restored
- Potentially order rehabilitation or liquidation if capital not restored

**This represents a DEAL-BLOCKING issue** requiring immediate remediation pre-closing.

**Scenario 2: Primary Security Upgrade Requirement (25% Minimum)**

If Nebraska DOI requires Primary Security to increase to 25% of reserves (industry standard minimum):

- Required Primary Security: $850M × 25% = **$212.5 million**
- Current Primary Security: $120 million
- **Additional cash infusion required: $92.5 million** to Vermont captive

Liberty Life Holdings or acquirer (American Financial Holdings) would need to contribute $92.5M additional capital to the Vermont captive to meet the 25% Primary Security threshold.

**Scenario 3: Letter of Credit Replacement (Full Parental Guarantee Substitution)**

If Nebraska DOI requires replacing the $730 million parental guarantee with a letter of credit from a qualified U.S. financial institution (discussed Section IV.E below):

- **Annual LOC cost:** $730M × 0.75-1.50% = **$5.475M-$10.95M annually**
- **Median cost estimate:** $730M × 1.0% = **$7.3 million per year**

This represents a recurring annual expense to maintain statutory reserve credit, reducing Liberty Life's net income by $7.3M annually (↓3.9% from $185M baseline).

#### 6. State-by-State AG48 Implementation Variations

**Multistate Consideration:**

While Nebraska DOI is Liberty Life's domiciliary regulator with primary authority over reserve credit, Liberty Life is licensed in **38 states + DC**. Multistate coordination on captive reserve credit is generally deferred to the domiciliary state, but non-domiciliary states may:
- Conduct targeted examinations if concerned about captive structure
- Require additional information during routine financial examinations
- Coordinate through NAIC's Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation (F) Committee if systemic concerns arise

**States with Heightened Scrutiny:**³³

Based on industry reports, states that have implemented more restrictive captive reserve credit standards (post-2020) include:
- **New York:** New York DFS bulletin 2013 initiated shadow insurance investigation, resulting in stricter collateral requirements
- **California:** California DOI has required LOCs for certain captive transactions, disfavoring parental guarantees
- **Texas:** Texas DOI has increased examination frequency for insurers using captive reserve financing
- **Pennsylvania, Illinois, Connecticut:** Mid-tier commercial states with active captive oversight

Liberty Life's licensing footprint across 38 states creates potential for **multistate examination coordination** if one state raises concerns about the captive structure. However, Nebraska DOI's determination is dispositive for statutory financial statement purposes.

### C. REINSURANCE AGREEMENT RECAPTURE PROVISIONS AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVES

#### 1. Standard Reinsurance Treaty Recapture Provisions

**Recapture Defined:**

"Recapture" is the contractual right of a ceding company to reassume risks previously ceded to a reinsurer, effectively terminating the reinsurance agreement for the recaptured block of business.³⁴ Recapture provisions are standard in life insurance reinsurance treaties, particularly for:
- **Term life insurance** (XXX reserve financing coinsurance treaties)
- **Universal life insurance** (AXXX reserve financing coinsurance treaties)
- **Yearly Renewable Term (YRT)** excess mortality reinsurance

**Standard Recapture Timing:**

Based on industry practice and published treaty precedent, typical recapture provisions allow the ceding company to exercise recapture rights after a specified period:³⁵

| Product Type | Typical Recapture Period | Industry Standard |
|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Term Life (10-year level premium)** | 10-15 years from issue date | Most common: 10 years |
| **Universal Life with Guarantees** | 10-20 years from issue date | Most common: 15 years |
| **YRT Excess Mortality** | 5-10 years from treaty effective date | Most common: 5 years |

**Recapture Conditions:**³⁶

Reinsurance agreements typically permit recapture upon:
1. **Time-based trigger:** Specified number of years elapsed since policy issue or treaty effective date
2. **Regulatory change:** Elimination of reserve requirements that created financing need (e.g., PBR adoption eliminates XXX/AXXX redundancy)
3. **Mortality improvement:** Actual mortality experience improves beyond original pricing assumptions, reducing economic reserve needs
4. **Notice requirements:** Ceding company must provide 90-180 days advance written notice of recapture election
5. **Recapture settlement:** Payment of recapture consideration (typically return of ceding commission plus/minus experience refund/charge)

#### 2. Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC Captive Recapture Analysis

**Transaction Timing:**

Based on industry patterns for XXX/AXXX reserve financing captives established 2010-2020, Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC was likely established **2015-2018** (post-AG48 effective date of January 1, 2015).³⁷

**Estimated Treaty Effective Date:** 2016 (midpoint assumption)

**Recapture Eligibility Window:**

If the Vermont captive coinsurance treaty was executed in 2016:
- **10-year recapture eligibility:** **2026** (current transaction year)
- **15-year recapture eligibility:** **2031** (5 years post-acquisition)

**Critical Finding:** The Liberty Life captive reinsurance structure is **approaching or within the 10-year recapture window**, creating immediate post-acquisition recapture risk.

#### 3. Economic Incentives for Recapture - PBR VM-20 Impact

**Principle-Based Reserves (PBR) VM-20 Background:**³⁸

The NAIC adopted the **Valuation Manual (VM-20)** as part of the Principle-Based Reserves (PBR) framework, effective January 1, 2017 for companies electing early adoption, and mandatory for most life insurers beginning January 1, 2020.³⁹ VM-20 establishes principle-based reserve methodologies for term life and universal life products, replacing the formulaic XXX/AXXX reserve requirements.

**PBR Impact on XXX/AXXX Redundant Reserves:**⁴⁰

The adoption of PBR is expected to **reduce or eliminate current reserve redundancies** that necessitated captive reinsurance financing. Specifically:

- **XXX (Term Life):** VM-20 Section 3 establishes net premium reserves and stochastic modeling for term life products, eliminating the overly conservative XXX formulaic approach
- **AXXX (Universal Life):** VM-20 Section 4 addresses universal life with secondary guarantees, reducing reserve requirements through more accurate mortality and lapse assumptions

The goal of VM-20's Actuarial Method calculation is to identify a reserve level that is sufficiently conservative to provide for the payment of all policyholder claims, but that is **less conservative than the currently required gross XXX or AXXX reserving levels**.⁴¹

**Recapture Incentive Created by PBR:**

As noted in American Academy of Actuaries guidance, VM-20 is hoped to achieve consensus acceptance by regulators and insurers, but will "**effectively eliminate the financial incentive for financing transactions once PBR becomes effective**."⁴² This creates a powerful economic incentive for ceding companies to:

1. **Recapture reinsured reserves** from captives once PBR reduces statutory reserve requirements
2. **Eliminate annual captive costs:** Captive maintenance costs (Vermont premium tax 0.38%, audit fees, regulatory fees) totaling $500K-$1M annually
3. **Simplify corporate structure:** Reduce regulatory complexity and examination burden
4. **Improve RBC ratio:** If statutory reserves under VM-20 are lower than XXX/AXXX, recapture increases net available capital

**Recapture Timing Considerations:**

Companies would assume recapture would occur following Section 8.C.18.c of VM-20, with different variations in reinsurance premium assumptions potentially being applied for scenarios at **5, 10, 15, and 20 years**.⁴³ Companies must disclose whether, and if so in what time period, they assumed recapture/contract termination would occur.⁴⁴

#### 4. Recapture Risk Assessment for Project Chronos Transaction

**Recapture Probability Estimate:**

Based on industry trends, PBR adoption timelines, and standard treaty provisions:

| Timeframe | Recapture Probability | Triggering Factor |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **2026-2028 (0-2 years post-closing)** | **30-40%** | 10-year treaty anniversary + PBR adoption by most insurers |
| **2029-2031 (3-5 years post-closing)** | **50-60%** | 15-year treaty anniversary + full industry PBR transition |
| **2032+ (6+ years post-closing)** | **20-30%** | Mortality improvement triggers or regulatory pressure |

**Most Likely Scenario:** Recapture exercise in **2029-2030** (13-14 years post-treaty execution), once Liberty Life has fully transitioned underlying policies to VM-20 reserving and determined that statutory reserves are materially lower than XXX/AXXX levels.

**Recapture Impact on Liberty Life RBC Ratio:**

If Liberty Life exercises recapture of the $850 million reserves from the Vermont captive:

**Scenario Analysis:**

*Assumptions:*
- Recapture occurs 2030 (14 years post-treaty)
- Statutory reserves under VM-20 for recaptured block: $650M (↓23.5% from $850M XXX/AXXX)
- Recapture settlement: No material consideration (reserves return to Liberty Life)

*RBC Impact:*

**Before Recapture:**
- Liberty Life statutory surplus: $1.85B (assuming no other changes)
- RBC ratio: 188% (per transaction baseline)

**After Recapture:**
- Statutory reserves increase: +$650M (VM-20 reserves) - $850M (previously ceded) = **-$200M surplus benefit lost**
- Adjusted statutory surplus: $1.85B - $200M = **$1.65B**
- **Adjusted RBC ratio: 168%** (TAC $1.65B ÷ ACL $982M = 1.68)

**Regulatory Consequence:** RBC ratio declines from 188% to **168%**, remaining above 150% Regulatory Action Level but still below 200% Company Action Level. This represents a **20-percentage-point decline** in RBC ratio, material enough to require Nebraska DOI notification and updated RBC Plan.

**Adverse Recapture Scenario (Concurrent with Other Stressors):**

If recapture occurs during a period of market stress (e.g., below-investment-grade bond defaults, equity market decline impacting GMWB reserves):

- Base recapture impact: -20 percentage points RBC ratio
- Concurrent stressors: -8 to -13 percentage points (per research plan stress scenarios)
- **Combined RBC ratio: 145-160%** (approaching or breaching 150% Regulatory Action Level)

This creates **material downside risk** to Liberty Life's regulatory standing post-acquisition if recapture is exercised during an economic downturn.

#### 5. Recapture Mitigation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Contractual Recapture Waiver**

Negotiate with the Vermont captive (as an affiliate) or seek contractual amendment to:
- **Extend recapture eligibility period** from 10 years to 20 years
- **Require mutual consent** for recapture (rather than unilateral ceding company right)
- **Add recapture fees/penalties** to discourage early recapture (e.g., 5% of reinsured reserves)

**Feasibility:** High (since Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC is wholly owned affiliate, no adverse counterparty interests)

**Cost:** Minimal (administrative amendment costs <$50K)

**Strategy 2: PBR Transition Capital Planning**

Proactively model VM-20 reserve impact and establish capital contingency plan:
- Conduct actuarial study of VM-20 reserve requirements for reinsured block
- If VM-20 reserves materially lower than XXX/AXXX, **prepare $200M-$300M capital buffer** for potential recapture
- Coordinate with acquirer (American Financial Holdings) to earmark capital for future recapture scenario

**Feasibility:** Medium (requires actuarial analysis and capital commitment)

**Cost:** Actuarial study $150K-$300K; capital opportunity cost (holding $200M-$300M liquid capital vs. alternative investments)

**Strategy 3: Replacement Reinsurance Pre-Negotiation**

Engage third-party reinsurers (Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re) to pre-negotiate replacement reinsurance terms:
- Secure indicative pricing for $850M coinsurance replacement
- Establish reinsurer appetite for assuming block upon captive recapture
- Lock in favorable terms (low ceding commission, minimal collateral requirements)

**Feasibility:** Medium (requires reinsurer engagement and due diligence)

**Cost:** Broker fees $500K-$1M; potential for higher ceding commissions than captive (estimated 1-3% of reserves = $8.5M-$25.5M)

**Strategy 4: Accept Recapture Risk as Manageable**

Based on analysis, **30-40% recapture probability over 3-5 years** with **20-percentage-point RBC decline** may be acceptable risk if:
- Acquirer American Financial Holdings maintains $200M-$300M capital cushion for contingency
- Liberty Life RBC ratio improves to 200%+ post-capital injection, providing buffer for future recapture impact
- Transaction modeling incorporates recapture scenario as "reasonably likely" downside case

**Recommended Approach:** **Strategy 4 (Accept Risk) + Strategy 1 (Contractual Waiver)**

Accept that recapture is a normal life insurance transaction risk, but negotiate contractual amendment to extend recapture window from 10 to 15 years (delaying earliest recapture from 2026 to 2031). This provides 5-year buffer for acquirer to improve Liberty Life's capital position and prepare for eventual recapture.

### D. THIRD-PARTY REINSURANCE COUNTERPARTY ANALYSIS

#### 1. Reinsurance Counterparty Identification

Based on transaction context from the research plan, Liberty Life Insurance Company maintains reinsurance relationships with major international and domestic reinsurers:

| Reinsurer | Domicile | Treaty Type | Reinsured Amount | Product Coverage |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Global Reinsurance Ltd.** | Bermuda | Coinsurance | $450M | Universal life policies |
| **Swiss Re Life & Health America** | USA (MO domiciled) | YRT (Yearly Renewable Term) | $280M | Term life excess mortality |
| **Munich Re Life US** | USA (DE domiciled) | Excess of Loss | $195M | Excess mortality coverage |
| **Total Third-Party Reinsurance** | | | **$925M** | |

**Note:** This $925 million in third-party reinsurance is **separate from** the $850 million Vermont captive reinsurance, representing **total ceded reserves of $1.775 billion** ($850M captive + $925M third-party).

#### 2. Change of Control Consent Requirements

**Standard Reinsurance Treaty Provisions:**⁴⁵

Reinsurance agreements typically include change of control provisions requiring:

1. **Notice to Reinsurer:** Ceding company must notify reinsurer within **30-60 days** of change of control event
2. **Definition of Change of Control:** Acquisition of >50% voting equity, merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all assets
3. **Reinsurer Consent:** Many treaties require reinsurer's **written consent** for ceding company change of control
4. **Recapture Rights Triggered:** Change of control may activate **early recapture rights** for reinsurer (even if treaty has not reached normal recapture eligibility period)
5. **Renegotiation Rights:** Reinsurer may condition consent on revised terms (increased ceding commission, additional collateral, modified experience refund provisions)

**Industry Precedent:**⁴⁶

Based on publicly filed reinsurance agreements and industry practice:

- **70-80% of reinsurance treaties** include change of control notification requirements (30-45 days notice)
- **40-50% of treaties** require affirmative reinsurer consent for change of control
- **30-40% of treaties** grant reinsurer early recapture rights upon change of control
- **20-30% of treaties** include "termination for convenience" clauses allowing reinsurer to terminate without cause (typically 180-365 days notice)

**Application to Liberty Life Transaction:**

For the Project Chronos acquisition ($2.9B stock purchase by American Financial Holdings), Liberty Life must:

1. **Notify all three reinsurers** (Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re) within 30-60 days of definitive agreement execution
2. **Request consent** if treaties require affirmative consent (likely for at least Global Re Bermuda coinsurance, as Bermuda reinsurers typically require consent for material ceding company changes)
3. **Negotiate terms** if reinsurers condition consent on revised treaty terms

#### 3. Reinsurer Credit Ratings and Reserve Credit Qualification

**Statutory Reserve Credit Requirements:**⁴⁷

For Liberty Life (Nebraska-domiciled) to receive statutory reserve credit for reinsurance ceded to third parties, reinsurers must be either:

1. **Authorized Reinsurer:** Licensed/accredited in Nebraska or ceding company's state
2. **Certified Reinsurer:** Domiciled in Qualified Jurisdiction, certified by state insurance department, reduced collateral based on financial strength rating
3. **Reciprocal Jurisdiction Reinsurer:** Domiciled in EU/UK reciprocal jurisdiction, no collateral required if meets Model #785 standards
4. **Unauthorized Reinsurer with Collateral:** Must post 100% collateral (trust, LOC) unless Certified or Reciprocal status applies

**Reinsurer Credit Rating Analysis:**

| Reinsurer | Expected Rating Agency Status | A.M. Best Rating (Typical) | Reserve Credit Status |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Global Reinsurance Ltd. (Bermuda)** | Bermuda Financial Stability Rating | A (Excellent) or higher | **Certified Reinsurer** (reduced collateral 10-50% based on rating) |
| **Swiss Re Life & Health America** | U.S. Domiciled, Authorized | A+ (Superior) | **Authorized Reinsurer** (no collateral required, full reserve credit) |
| **Munich Re Life US** | U.S. Domiciled, Authorized | A+ (Superior) | **Authorized Reinsurer** (no collateral required, full reserve credit) |

**Key Findings:**

- **Swiss Re and Munich Re:** As U.S.-domiciled authorized reinsurers with A+ ratings, these reinsurers pose **minimal credit risk** and Liberty Life receives full statutory reserve credit without collateral requirements.⁴⁸

- **Global Re (Bermuda):** As a Bermuda-domiciled reinsurer, Global Re is likely a **Certified Reinsurer** under Nebraska's implementation of NAIC Model #785. Certified status requires:⁴⁹
  - Minimum capital and surplus of $250 million
  - Financial strength rating from two or more acceptable rating agencies (e.g., A.M. Best, S&P, Moody's, Fitch)
  - Reduced collateral based on rating (e.g., A-rated: 10% collateral, BBB-rated: 75% collateral, below BBB: 100% collateral)

Assuming Global Re maintains **A (Excellent)** rating from A.M. Best, Nebraska DOI would require **10-20% collateral** ($45M-$90M for $450M coinsurance) to grant full reserve credit.⁵⁰

#### 4. Consent and Approval Timeline

**Estimated Timeline for Reinsurer Consents:**

| Milestone | Timeframe | Contingencies |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Notice to Reinsurers** | Within 30 days of definitive agreement | Immediate upon signing |
| **Reinsurer Due Diligence** | 30-60 days after notice | Reinsurers review acquirer financial strength, business plan |
| **Consent Negotiation** | 30-90 days (if consent required) | Potential for revised terms (increased ceding commission, collateral) |
| **Final Consent** | 60-120 days total | **Target: Q2 2025 for Q3 2025 closing** |

**Consent Risk Assessment:**

| Reinsurer | Consent Probability | Potential Issues | Mitigation |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Swiss Re Life & Health America** | **95-98%** | Minimal (U.S. domesticreinsurer, likely no consent required) | Standard notification |
| **Munich Re Life US** | **95-98%** | Minimal (U.S. domestic reinsurer, established relationship) | Standard notification |
| **Global Re (Bermuda)** | **85-90%** | Moderate (Bermuda reinsurer may request revised terms or additional collateral) | Negotiate pre-closing, consider consent as closing condition |

**Overall Assessment:** **90-95% likelihood of obtaining all necessary reinsurer consents**, with potential delays of 30-60 days if Global Re requests revised terms or additional financial information about acquirer American Financial Holdings.

#### 5. Post-Acquisition Reinsurer Relationship Management

**Reinsurer Retention Strategy:**

Post-closing, acquirer American Financial Holdings should:

1. **Maintain existing reinsurer relationships:** Swiss Re and Munich Re are top-tier reinsurers with A+ ratings, providing valuable capacity and favorable terms
2. **Strengthen Global Re relationship:** Schedule post-closing meeting with Global Re to discuss long-term partnership, potential for additional reinsurance capacity
3. **Avoid unnecessary renegotiation:** Existing treaties likely have favorable ceding commissions and terms; renegotiation risks deterioration

**Reinsurer Concerns About Acquirer:**

Reinsurers may scrutinize American Financial Holdings' experience with life insurance operations:

- **Private equity ownership:** Reinsurers sometimes view PE-backed insurers as higher risk due to dividend pressure and shorter investment horizons
- **Capital adequacy:** Reinsurers will assess whether American Financial Holdings has committed sufficient capital to maintain Liberty Life's financial strength ratings (A.M. Best A- or better target)
- **Management continuity:** Reinsurers prefer stable management teams; significant post-closing turnover may trigger concern

**Mitigation:** American Financial Holdings should provide reinsurers with:
- **Capital commitment letter:** Documentation of $150M+ capital injection to improve RBC ratio to 200%+
- **Management retention plan:** Confirmation that Liberty Life CEO, CFO, Chief Actuary will remain post-closing
- **Business plan overview:** Strategic rationale for acquisition, growth plans, commitment to life insurance business

### E. LETTER OF CREDIT (LOC) COLLATERAL STRATEGY

#### 1. LOC Structure and Requirements

**Letter of Credit as Reinsurance Collateral:**⁵¹

NAIC regulations stipulate that certain reinsurance recoverables due from certified or unauthorized reinsurers require collateral to secure the recoverable amounts, and the collateral requirement is often satisfied through the use of a letter of credit. By some estimates, **three out of every four funded collateral programs use LOCs**.⁵²

**LOC Characteristics for Statutory Reserve Credit:**⁵³

Under the NAIC's Credit for Reinsurance Model Regulation (MO-786), LOCs must meet the following criteria:

1. **Clean:** No documentary requirements for draw beyond certification of amount due
2. **Irrevocable:** Cannot be cancelled or modified without beneficiary consent
3. **Unconditional:** No conditions precedent to draw (other than certification of amount due and presentation of complying documents)
4. **Qualified U.S. Financial Institution:** Issued or confirmed by a bank meeting NAIC QUSFI standards
5. **Evergreen:** Automatically renews annually unless bank provides 30-90 days non-renewal notice

**Qualified U.S. Financial Institution (QUSFI) Standards:**⁵⁴

A QUSFI is defined as an institution that:
- Is organized or licensed under U.S. or state laws
- Is regulated and supervised by U.S. federal or state authorities having regulatory authority over banks and trust companies
- Has been determined by either the commissioner or the NAIC Securities Valuation Office to meet financial soundness standards (typically **AA- or better credit rating** from S&P/Moody's/Fitch)

The NAIC Securities Valuation Office publishes an annual "**List of Qualified U.S. Financial Institutions**" identifying banks approved for issuing reinsurance LOCs.⁵⁵

#### 2. LOC Cost Analysis for Vermont Captive

**LOC Fee Structure:**⁵⁶

Banks charge annual fees for issuing standby letters of credit, typically expressed in basis points (bps) of the LOC face amount. Based on 2024-2025 market pricing:

| Bank Tier | Credit Rating | LOC Fee Range (bps) | Annual Cost per $730M LOC |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Tier 1 (Global Systemically Important Banks)** | AA-/Aa3 or higher | 50-100 bps (0.50-1.00%) | $3.65M-$7.3M |
| **Tier 2 (Large Regional Banks)** | A+/A1 to AA-/Aa3 | 75-125 bps (0.75-1.25%) | $5.475M-$9.125M |
| **Tier 3 (Regional/Community Banks)** | A/A2 to A+/A1 | 100-150 bps (1.00-1.50%) | $7.3M-$10.95M |

**Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) LOC Pricing:**⁵⁷

As a specialized alternative, the Federal Home Loan Bank system offers LOCs to member institutions at favorable rates. FHLB Dallas increased LOC pricing to **7.5 bps (0.075%)** effective January 1, 2024, substantially below commercial bank rates.⁵⁸

However, FHLB LOCs require the borrower (Liberty Life) to be an FHLB member and pledge collateral (typically mortgage-backed securities or residential mortgages) to secure the LOC. For a $730M LOC, Liberty Life would need to pledge approximately $800M-$875M in eligible collateral (110-120% collateralization).

**Median LOC Cost Estimate for $730M:**

Using Tier 1 bank pricing at **100 bps (1.0%)**:
- **Annual LOC fee:** $730M × 1.0% = **$7.3 million**
- **After-tax cost** (assuming 21% corporate tax rate): $7.3M × 79% = **$5.767 million**

**Comparison to Current Structure:**

| Collateral Type | Annual Cost | Tax Treatment | Net Annual Cost |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Parental Guarantee (current)** | $0 | N/A | **$0** |
| **LOC (proposed)** | $7.3M | Tax deductible | **$5.767M** |
| **Additional Captive Assets (Primary Security upgrade)** | Opportunity cost 4-5% | N/A | $3.7M-$4.6M (on $92.5M additional assets) |

**LOC represents $5.767M annual after-tax cost** to maintain statutory reserve credit if Nebraska DOI requires replacing parental guarantee.

#### 3. LOC Procurement Timeline and Process

**LOC Arrangement Process:**⁵⁹

1. **Bank Selection and Credit Application** (2-4 weeks):
   - Solicit proposals from 3-5 QUSFIs (e.g., JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank, U.S. Bank)
   - Submit credit application including American Financial Holdings (acquirer) financials, Liberty Life financial statements, transaction overview
   - Banks conduct credit analysis and underwriting

2. **LOC Negotiation and Documentation** (2-4 weeks):
   - Negotiate LOC fee (50-150 bps range depending on bank tier and relationship)
   - Draft LOC terms in compliance with NAIC Model Regulation #786 (clean, irrevocable, unconditional)
   - Execute bank credit agreement, security documents (if collateralized), LOC reimbursement agreement

3. **Regulatory Approval Filing** (4-8 weeks):
   - File LOC with Nebraska DOI as substitute collateral for parental guarantee
   - Nebraska DOI reviews LOC terms for statutory compliance
   - Obtain Nebraska DOI written approval of LOC as acceptable "Other Security" under AG48/Model #787

4. **LOC Issuance and Reserve Credit** (1-2 weeks):
   - Bank issues LOC in favor of Liberty Life Insurance Company as beneficiary
   - Liberty Life files amended Schedule S (Reinsurance) with Nebraska DOI showing LOC collateral
   - Vermont captive pledge or custody arrangements formalized

**Total Timeline:** **60-90 days** from bank selection to final LOC issuance and regulatory approval

**Critical Path Consideration:** LOC procurement should begin **pre-closing** (upon signing definitive agreement) to ensure LOC is in place by closing date if Nebraska DOI requires as closing condition.

#### 4. Alternative Collateral Structures

**Option 1: Regulation 114 Trust**⁶⁰

In lieu of an LOC, credit for reinsurance ceded to non-admitted reinsurers is permitted where the reinsurer's obligations are secured by a **compliant trust agreement** (Regulation 114 trust), permitted by the laws of all U.S. states under some version of the NAIC model act and regulation governing credit for reinsurance.

**Trust Requirements:**
- Qualified U.S. trustee (bank with fiduciary powers)
- Assets held in trust must be "admitted assets" under state insurance law (investment-grade bonds, cash, Treasuries)
- Trust assets equal to 102-105% of reinsured reserves ($867M-$892.5M for $850M reserves)
- Irrevocable trust with beneficiary (Liberty Life) having priority claim on assets

**Cost:** Lower annual fees than LOC (trustee fees typically 5-15 bps = $425K-$1.275M annually), but requires funding 102-105% of reserves (vs. 100% for LOC)

**Option 2: Hybrid Structure (Increased Primary Security + LOC)**

Instead of replacing entire $730M parental guarantee with LOC, use hybrid approach:
- **Increase Primary Security to 40%:** $850M × 40% = $340M captive assets (add $220M to current $120M)
- **LOC for remaining 60%:** $850M × 60% = $510M LOC
- **Parental guarantee eliminated**

**Cost Analysis:**
- LOC fee: $510M × 1.0% = $5.1M annually (vs. $7.3M for $730M LOC)
- **Savings:** $2.2M annually
- **Downside:** Requires $220M additional capital contribution to Vermont captive, reducing liquidity at Liberty Life holding company level

**Option 3: Wait-and-See Approach**

Given 85-90% probability that Nebraska DOI does not demand LOC immediately:
- **Maintain current structure** (parental guarantee) pending Nebraska DOI feedback during Form A review
- **Pre-negotiate LOC terms** with bank (90-day commitment letter) to enable rapid execution if Nebraska DOI requires
- **Implement LOC only if mandated** by Nebraska DOI as closing condition or post-closing regulatory directive

**Recommended Approach:** **Option 3 (Wait-and-See) with LOC Pre-Negotiation**

Negotiate a 90-day LOC commitment letter from a Tier 1 bank (e.g., JPMorgan Chase) at locked-in pricing (100 bps), providing certainty of execution if Nebraska DOI demands LOC, while avoiding $7.3M annual cost if parental guarantee remains acceptable.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Financial Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **AG48 Non-Compliance - Parental Guarantee Failure** | **CRITICAL** | 10-15% | $730M surplus loss → RBC 114% (ACL breach) | LOC replacement ($7.3M annual) or Primary Security upgrade ($92.5M capital) |
| **Nebraska DOI Reserve Credit Disallowance** | **HIGH** | 10-15% | $730M surplus reduction → Deal-blocking | Pre-closing engagement with Nebraska DOI, Form A disclosure of mitigation plan |
| **Primary Security Deficiency (14% vs. 25-50% standard)** | **HIGH** | 20-30% | $92.5M-$305M additional capital required | Capital injection to Vermont captive pre-closing |
| **Captive Recapture Risk (2026-2031)** | **MEDIUM** | 30-60% | RBC decline 188% → 168% (-20 pts) | Contract amendment extending recapture window, $200M capital buffer |
| **Third-Party Reinsurer Consent Delays** | **MEDIUM** | 5-15% | Closing delay 30-90 days | Early notification, consent as closing condition |
| **Global Re (Bermuda) Consent/Terms Renegotiation** | **MEDIUM** | 10-15% | Increased ceding commission 50-100 bps ($2.25M-$4.5M annual) | Pre-closing dialogue, acquirer financial strength presentation |
| **LOC Cost if Mandated** | **MEDIUM** | 30-40% | $5.767M annual after-tax cost | Wait-and-see with bank commitment letter pre-negotiated |
| **Multistate Examination Coordination** | **LOW** | 5-10% | Additional regulatory scrutiny, potential collateral demands | Proactive disclosure in all state Form D filings |

### B. Deal-Blocking Red Flags

**CRITICAL ISSUE #1: AG48 Parental Guarantee Net Worth Failure**

- **Finding:** Liberty Life Holdings LLC net worth $280M < $730M parental guarantee amount
- **AG48 Requirement:** Parent net worth must exceed guarantee amount
- **Consequence:** If Nebraska DOI enforces strictly, parental guarantee fails AG48 "Other Security" qualification
- **Impact:** $730M reserve credit disallowance → RBC ratio 114% → Authorized Control Level → Deal-blocking
- **Probability:** 10-15% (Nebraska DOI may exercise discretion given historical approval, but risk is material)

**Required Pre-Closing Actions:**
1. **Immediate Nebraska DOI engagement:** Disclose parental guarantee structure in Form A filing, request confirmation of reserve credit acceptability
2. **LOC standby arrangement:** Secure 90-day LOC commitment from Tier 1 bank ($730M at 100 bps) executable if Nebraska DOI demands
3. **Capital injection contingency:** American Financial Holdings commits $730M capital if parental guarantee disallowed (either to Vermont captive as Primary Security or to Liberty Life to offset surplus loss)

### C. Quantified Exposure Summary

| Scenario | Probability | Gross Exposure | Net Exposure (after mitigation) | RBC Impact |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **Base Case (No Regulatory Action)** | 70-75% | $0 | $0 | RBC stable at 188% (post-$150M injection: 204%) |
| **Primary Security Upgrade Required (25%)** | 20-30% | $92.5M capital | $92.5M (one-time) | RBC improves to 213% with full capital deployment |
| **LOC Replacement Mandated** | 30-40% | $7.3M annual | $5.767M annual (after-tax) | RBC stable, earnings ↓3.1% |
| **Partial Reserve Credit Disallowance** | 10-15% | $730M surplus loss | $730M (deal-blocking without capital injection) | RBC 114% → Requires $730M rescue capital |
| **Captive Recapture (2029-2031)** | 50-60% | RBC -20 pts | Accept risk with $200M capital buffer | RBC 188% → 168% (manageable) |
| **Reinsurer Consent Delays** | 5-15% | Closing delay 30-90 days | De minimis (interest carry costs) | No RBC impact |

**Aggregate Quantified Exposure (Probability-Weighted):**
- **Expected value:** (0.25 × $92.5M) + (0.35 × $5.767M × 5 years NPV) + (0.125 × $730M rescue capital cost 10% ROE hurdle) = **$23.125M + $10.09M + $9.125M** = **$42.34M total expected exposure**
- **Worst-case (90th percentile):** $730M capital injection required + $7.3M annual LOC cost = **$730M + $36.5M (5-year LOC PV)** = **$766.5M total worst-case exposure**

### D. Regulatory Timeline Risks

| Milestone | Expected Timeline | Delay Risk | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Form A Filing (Change of Control)** | Within 30 days of definitive agreement | Low (mechanical filing) | Nebraska DOI 60-day review clock starts |
| **Nebraska DOI Form A Review** | 60-90 days (statutory maximum 60 days, often extended) | Medium (15-20% probability of 60-90 day extension) | Closing delay if extended review |
| **Vermont Captive Structure Inquiry** | 30-60 days during Form A review | Medium (30-40% probability Nebraska DOI requests additional captive documentation) | Respond within 15 days to avoid review delay |
| **Third-Party Reinsurer Consents** | 60-120 days from notification | Low-Medium (10-15% probability of delays) | Include as closing conditions with outside date extension |
| **LOC Procurement (if required)** | 60-90 days | Low (5% probability of bank credit issues) | Begin pre-closing to avoid critical path |

**Critical Path:** Form A approval is on critical path for Q3 2025 closing. If Nebraska DOI review extends to 90 days + 30-day captive inquiry = 120 days total, closing shifts to Q4 2025 unless outside date extended.

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Vermont Captive Regulatory Compliance:** Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC complies with Vermont domiciliary requirements (8 V.S.A. Chapter 141) with $120M assets exceeding minimum capital thresholds. Vermont DFR poses minimal regulatory risk as captive domicile.

2. **AG48 Compliance Deficiency:** The captive structure exhibits **two material AG48 compliance issues**:
   - **Primary Security Deficiency:** 14.1% ($120M) vs. industry standard 25-50% → shortfall of $92.5M-$305M
   - **Parental Guarantee Net Worth Failure:** Parent net worth $280M < $730M guarantee amount → fails AG48 "Other Security" condition

3. **Nebraska DOI Scrutiny Risk (10-15%):** While historical regulatory acceptance suggests 85-90% probability of continued reserve credit approval, the AG48 deficiencies create 10-15% probability that Nebraska DOI demands collateral upgrade or disallows reserve credit entirely.

4. **Deal-Blocking Scenario:** If Nebraska DOI disallows $730M parental guarantee, Liberty Life's RBC ratio declines from 188% to **114%** (Authorized Control Level), creating deal-blocking regulatory intervention risk unless $730M capital injection or LOC immediately deployed.

5. **Recapture Risk (30-60% over 5 years):** The captive reinsurance structure is approaching or within the 10-year recapture window (estimated treaty effective date 2016). PBR VM-20 adoption creates strong economic incentive for Liberty Life to recapture reserves 2029-2031, resulting in 20-percentage-point RBC decline (188% → 168%).

6. **Third-Party Reinsurer Consent (90-95% success probability):** Swiss Re and Munich Re (U.S.-domiciled, A+ rated) pose minimal consent risk. Global Re (Bermuda, A-rated) presents moderate risk (10-15%) of consent delay or revised terms, but overall probability of obtaining all consents is 90-95%.

7. **LOC Mitigation Strategy:** If Nebraska DOI mandates LOC replacement of parental guarantee, annual cost is **$7.3M** (100 bps on $730M), or **$5.767M after-tax** (21% corporate rate). This represents 3.1% reduction in Liberty Life net income ($185M baseline).

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Pre-Closing - Q1 2025)**

1. **Nebraska DOI Pre-Filing Consultation (PRIORITY 1 - Within 30 days of definitive agreement)**
   - Schedule meeting with Nebraska DOI Financial Analysis Division
   - Disclose Vermont captive structure, AG48 compliance analysis, parental guarantee terms
   - Request preliminary feedback on reserve credit acceptability
   - **Objective:** Surface any Nebraska DOI concerns BEFORE Form A filing to enable pre-closing remediation

2. **LOC Commitment Letter Procurement (PRIORITY 2 - Within 45 days)**
   - Solicit proposals from 3 Tier 1 banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo)
   - Negotiate 90-day commitment letter at locked-in pricing (target: 100 bps)
   - **Cost:** Commitment fee ~$365K-$730K (5-10 bps one-time)
   - **Benefit:** Execution certainty if Nebraska DOI demands LOC as closing condition

3. **Third-Party Reinsurer Notification (Within 30 days of definitive agreement)**
   - Provide written notice to Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re of pending change of control
   - Include American Financial Holdings financials, management bios, capital commitment letter
   - Request written consent where required by treaty terms
   - **Timeline:** Allow 60-120 days for reinsurer due diligence and consent process

4. **Captive Recapture Contract Amendment (Within 60 days - During due diligence)**
   - Negotiate amendment to Vermont captive coinsurance treaty
   - **Proposed terms:** Extend recapture eligibility from 10 years to 15 years (2026 → 2031)
   - **Rationale:** Provide 5-year buffer for acquirer to strengthen Liberty Life capital position before recapture risk materializes
   - **Cost:** <$50K (administrative amendment, no adverse counterparty since wholly-owned affiliate)

#### **SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Post-Signing, Pre-Closing - Q2 2025)**

5. **Form A Filing with Vermont Captive Exhibit (Within 30 days of definitive agreement)**
   - File Nebraska DOI Form A (Application for Approval of Change of Control)
   - Include comprehensive exhibit documenting Vermont captive structure:
     - AG48 compliance analysis (acknowledge Primary Security deficiency, propose LOC mitigation if required)
     - Parental guarantee terms and parent financial condition
     - Actuarial opinion from Liberty Life appointed actuary certifying reserve adequacy
   - **Objective:** Full transparency to Nebraska DOI with proactive mitigation proposals

6. **Primary Security Upgrade Analysis (Q2 2025 - During regulatory review)**
   - Engage actuarial consultant to calculate Required Level of Primary Security under AG48 Actuarial Method
   - **Cost:** $150K-$300K actuarial study
   - Determine whether $120M current assets meet Required Level or if shortfall exists
   - If shortfall identified, prepare capital injection plan to bring Primary Security to 25-40% ($212.5M-$340M range)

7. **Reinsurer Relationship Management (Q2 2025)**
   - Schedule in-person meetings with Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re leadership
   - Present acquirer business plan, capital adequacy, management continuity
   - Address any reinsurer concerns about PE ownership or strategic direction
   - **Objective:** Maintain favorable reinsurance relationships, avoid post-closing treaty renegotiation

#### **LONG-TERM CONSIDERATIONS (Post-Closing - 2026+)**

8. **PBR Transition Modeling and Capital Planning (2026-2027)**
   - Conduct comprehensive VM-20 reserve study for captive-reinsured block
   - Model recapture scenarios: impact on statutory reserves, RBC ratio, capital requirements
   - Establish $200M-$300M capital buffer for potential 2029-2031 recapture
   - **Objective:** Proactive capital planning to absorb recapture impact without RBC deterioration

9. **Ongoing Nebraska DOI Engagement (Annual)**
   - Provide annual updates on Vermont captive financial condition via Form D (Biographical Affidavit)
   - File Schedule S (Reinsurance) amendments if captive structure modified (e.g., LOC added, Primary Security increased)
   - Maintain open dialogue with Nebraska DOI to surface any emerging regulatory concerns
   - **Objective:** Cultivate constructive regulatory relationship, early warning of adverse actions

10. **Reinsurance Market Monitoring (2027+)**
    - Assess third-party reinsurance pricing for potential captive replacement
    - Maintain relationships with reinsurance brokers (Aon, Guy Carpenter) for market intelligence
    - If captive recapture becomes likely, pre-negotiate replacement reinsurance to avoid coverage gaps
    - **Objective:** Optionality for reinsurance structure optimization post-recapture

### C. Outstanding Questions for Due Diligence

1. **Vermont Captive Establishment Date:** Confirm actual treaty effective date for Liberty Reinsurance VT LLC coinsurance agreement (estimated 2016, but requires data room verification to assess precise recapture window)

2. **Parental Guarantee Full Terms:** Obtain complete parental guarantee agreement between Liberty Life and Liberty Life Holdings LLC, including:
   - Parent RBC ratio covenants (AG48 requires >300%)
   - Parent net worth covenants (AG48 requires >$730M, but current net worth only $280M)
   - Credit rating requirements (AG48 requires A or better)
   - Termination/substitution provisions

3. **Nebraska DOI Historical Approval Documentation:** Review Nebraska DOI files for:
   - Original approval of Vermont captive reserve credit (likely 2016-2018)
   - Annual examination reports addressing captive structure (2020-2024)
   - Any correspondence regarding AG48 compliance or parental guarantee adequacy
   - **Purpose:** Assess Nebraska DOI's historical posture toward this specific captive structure

4. **Third-Party Reinsurance Treaty Terms:** Obtain full reinsurance agreements for Global Re, Swiss Re, Munich Re to verify:
   - Change of control consent requirements (affirmative consent vs. notification only)
   - Recapture provisions (timing, conditions, settlement terms)
   - Collateral requirements (especially Global Re as Bermuda Certified Reinsurer)
   - Experience refund/profit-sharing provisions

5. **Appointed Actuary Opinion on Captive:** Review Liberty Life appointed actuary's most recent AG48 compliance opinion (2024) to determine:
   - Actuarial Method calculation of Required Level of Primary Security
   - Whether actuary certified $120M Primary Security as adequate or issued qualified opinion
   - Any reservations expressed regarding parental guarantee adequacy
