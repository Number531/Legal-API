## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overview and Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

Liberty Life Insurance Company (LLIC) requires a **$150 million capital injection** to increase its Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratio from 188% to 200%, satisfying Nebraska Department of Insurance (DOI) Company Action Level (CAL) requirements for regulatory approval of American Financial Holdings' $2.9 billion acquisition. This report analyzes four capital structure alternatives—**surplus notes, subordinated debt, contributed capital (equity), and holding company debt with downstream equity contribution**—evaluating each structure's federal and state tax treatment, NAIC statutory capital treatment, IRC Section 382 implications, and transaction economics.

**PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: HoldCo Debt → Downstream Equity** (Option 1)

American Financial Holdings should establish a holding company domiciled in Nevada or Wyoming (zero state corporate income tax), issue $150M senior unsecured debt at the holding company level (estimated 8% interest rate), and contribute the proceeds downstream to LLIC as paid-in capital (equity). This structure achieves:

✅ **100% statutory capital credit** at LLIC ($150M fully counts toward surplus, achieving 204% RBC ratio)
✅ **$2.52M annual federal tax savings** (21% × $12M interest deduction at HoldCo level)
✅ **Zero state tax** at HoldCo (Nevada/Wyoming domicile)
✅ **After-tax cost of $9.48M annually** — **47% lower** than direct equity opportunity cost ($18-22.5M)
✅ **No regulatory approval friction** at LLIC (simple capital contribution, no Nebraska DOI payment approvals)
✅ **Net Present Value benefit: $57.2 million over 10 years** vs. direct equity contribution

**ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION: Surplus Notes** (Option 2 - Fallback if Nebraska DOI objects to HoldCo leverage)

LLIC issues $150M surplus notes directly (10% interest, 30-year maturity), purchased by American Financial Holdings or third-party investors. This structure provides:

✅ **100% statutory capital credit** (NAIC SSAP No. 41 treatment)
✅ **$3.843M annual tax savings** (federal + Nebraska deductions for interest)
✅ **After-tax cost of $11.16M annually**
⚠️ **Nebraska DOI approval required for each interest payment** (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-221)
⚠️ **10-15% risk of IRS debt/equity recharacterization** (mitigated by tax opinion letter)

**REJECTED ALTERNATIVES:**

❌ **Subordinated debt** fails to achieve 200% RBC ratio (estimated 25% capital credit yields only 192% RBC)
❌ **Direct equity contribution** provides zero tax benefit with $18-22.5M annual opportunity cost

---

### Detailed Findings Digest

#### 1. Surplus Notes: 100% Statutory Capital + Tax Deductibility

**Regulatory Treatment (NAIC SSAP No. 41):**

Surplus notes receive **100% statutory capital credit** despite being debt instruments. State insurance regulators treat surplus notes as equity because they are subordinated to all policyholders and creditors, and require Nebraska DOI approval before issuance and before each interest/principal payment. Under GAAP, surplus notes are liabilities, but under Statutory Accounting Principles (SAP), they count as surplus. The NAIC's 2024-2025 updates to SSAP No. 41 expanded treatment to include "capital notes" (hybrid instruments with deferrable interest), but traditional surplus notes remain the core instrument.

**Federal Tax Treatment (IRC § 163):**

Despite regulatory equity classification, surplus notes are treated as **debt for federal tax purposes** if they possess sufficiently debt-like features: fixed maturity (30 years), fixed interest rate (10%), unconditional payment obligations, labeling as "notes," and no management participation rights. Courts have held that subordination and regulatory approval requirements do not automatically convert surplus notes to equity. Interest payments are **fully deductible** under IRC § 163(a). The IRS has issued private letter rulings treating surplus notes as debt and excluding them from equity base calculations.

**Debt vs. Equity Classification Analysis:**

Multi-factor tests weigh toward **debt classification**. Favorable factors include: written unconditional promise to pay, fixed maturity, fixed rate, labeled as notes, and no participation in management. Unfavorable factors include subordination and regulatory payment approval. Investment-grade rating (if obtained) strengthens debt classification. Recommended mitigation: obtain tax opinion letter from national tax counsel affirming debt treatment.

**Section 163(j) Business Interest Limitation:**

IRC § 163(j) limits business interest deductions to 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI). For $150M surplus notes at 10%:
- Annual interest: $15 million
- ATI limitation: 30% × $185M = $55.5 million allowable
- **Result: $15M interest fully deductible** (well within limitation)

**Nebraska Statutory Requirements (Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-220, 44-221):**

- **Issuance approval:** Nebraska DOI must approve application to issue surplus notes (estimated 60-120 days)
- **Payment approval:** Each interest and principal payment requires Nebraska DOI approval
- **Approval standard:** Surplus must be at least **double** the payment amount ($30M surplus required for $15M interest payment)
- **LLIC compliance:** Current surplus $1.85B; post-injection $2.0B → **$1.97B cushion** above $30M minimum
- **Denial risk: <5%** under normal conditions (ample surplus cushion)

**Tax Savings Quantification:**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Annual interest | $15,000,000 |
| Federal tax deduction @ 21% | $3,150,000 |
| Nebraska tax deduction @ 5.84% (net) | $693,000 |
| **Total annual tax savings** | **$3,843,000** |
| **After-tax interest cost** | **$11,157,000** (7.44% effective rate) |
| **NPV of tax benefits (10 years @ 7.44%)** | **$26.2 million** |

**Interest Coverage:** LLIC statutory net income $185M ÷ $15M interest = **12.3× coverage** (strong)

**Market Precedent:**

Surplus note issuances were active 2017-2021 (5-6 issuers annually), but sporadic in 2023-2024. Market participants indicate new issuances would be well-received. Rating agencies typically rate surplus notes **two notches below** the insurer's IFS rating (Moody's/A.M. Best). Standard structural features: 30-year maturity, cumulative interest, callable after 10 years, no acceleration upon payment deferral.

#### 2. Subordinated Debt: Tax Deductible but Insufficient Capital Credit

**Distinction from Surplus Notes:**

Subordinated debt differs critically in that interest and principal payments are **contractually mandatory**, not subject to regulatory approval on a payment-by-payment basis. This removes regulatory discretion but also eliminates the basis for 100% statutory capital treatment.

**NAIC Statutory Capital Treatment:**

Unlike surplus notes, traditional subordinated debt receives **limited or zero capital credit** (varies by state). Factors affecting treatment: degree of subordination, term to maturity (>10 years favored), and state regulator discretion. Most states provide 0-25% capital credit; best case 50%.

**Application to $150M Capital Injection:**

With 25% capital credit (mid-range estimate):
- TAC increase: $150M × 25% = $37.5M
- New TAC: $1.85B + $37.5M = $1.8875B
- New RBC ratio: $1.8875B ÷ $982M ACL = **192%**
- **FALLS SHORT of 200% target** ❌

**Federal Tax Treatment:**

Subordinated debt is **unambiguously debt** for tax purposes (mandatory payments, fixed maturity, standard debt features). Interest fully deductible under IRC § 163(a). For $150M at 9% (lower rate than surplus notes due to mandatory payment reducing investor risk):
- Annual interest: $13.5M
- Federal tax savings: $2.835M
- After-tax cost: $10.041M (6.69% effective rate)

**Comparative Analysis:**

While subordinated debt has **lower after-tax cost** than surplus notes ($10.04M vs. $11.16M, saving $1.12M annually), it **fails the primary objective** of achieving 200% RBC ratio. The $1.1M annual savings is immaterial compared to regulatory failure.

**Conclusion:** **Subordinated debt is not viable** for this transaction.

#### 3. Contributed Capital (Equity): 100% Capital Credit but Zero Tax Benefit

**Regulatory Treatment:**

Contributed capital (paid-in capital) is **pure equity** receiving **100% statutory capital credit**. No repayment obligation, permanent capital, no regulatory approval required. Clean balance sheet treatment.

**RBC Impact:**

TAC: $1.85B + $150M = $2.0B
RBC ratio: $2.0B ÷ $982M = **204%** ✅ **Achieves target**

**Federal Tax Treatment (IRC § 162):**

Contributed capital does **not qualify as deductible business expense**. It is a capital transaction. When a parent makes a capital contribution to a subsidiary:
- **No deduction** at parent level (American Financial Holdings receives no tax benefit)
- **Basis increase:** Parent's tax basis in subsidiary stock increases by $150M
- **No income** at subsidiary level (LLIC does not recognize income)

IRS and courts have established: "Voluntary payments by a shareholder to a corporation to bolster its financial position are treated as a capital investment," not deductible expenses.

**Result:** **Zero tax benefit** from contributed capital.

**Opportunity Cost Analysis:**

Private equity investors typically target **12-15% IRR**. If American Financial Holdings contributes $150M equity, the opportunity cost is the foregone return on alternative investments:

- Low scenario: $150M × 12% = **$18M annually**
- High scenario: $150M × 15% = **$22.5M annually**

This vastly exceeds the after-tax cost of debt alternatives ($9-11M).

#### 4. Holding Company Debt → Downstream Equity: Optimal Tax Efficiency

**Structure:**

Instead of LLIC issuing surplus notes or American Financial Holdings contributing direct equity, structure as:
1. American Financial Holdings LLC (HoldCo) issues $150M senior unsecured debt at holding company level
2. HoldCo contributes $150M proceeds to LLIC as paid-in capital (equity)

**Tax Treatment:**

- **HoldCo level:** Interest on $150M debt is **deductible** under IRC § 163(a)
- **LLIC level:** $150M received as **contributed capital** (no income recognition)
- **Statutory treatment:** LLIC receives **100% capital credit** (identical to direct equity)

**Comparative Economics:**

| Metric | Direct Equity | HoldCo Debt→Equity |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| LLIC statutory capital | $150M (100%) | $150M (100%) |
| RBC ratio achieved | 204% ✅ | 204% ✅ |
| Tax deduction | None | Yes (HoldCo level) |
| Annual cash drain | None (at LLIC) | $12M (at HoldCo) |
| Regulatory approval | None | None (at LLIC) |

**HoldCo Debt Assumptions:**

- Interest rate: **8%** (lower than LLIC surplus notes because HoldCo not subject to insurance regulation)
- Annual interest: $150M × 8% = **$12 million**
- Federal tax savings: $12M × 21% = **$2.52 million**
- State tax: **$0** if HoldCo domiciled in Nevada or Wyoming (no corporate income tax)
- **After-tax cost: $9.48 million annually**

**Dividend Capacity Analysis:**

HoldCo must service $12M annual debt from LLIC dividends. Nebraska insurance law allows **ordinary dividends** up to the lesser of:
- 10% of prior year statutory surplus ($1.85B × 10% = $185M), OR
- Prior year statutory net income ($185M)

**LLIC dividend capacity: $185 million annually** — **15.4× coverage** of $12M HoldCo debt service ✅

**Double-Leverage Concern:**

Regulators scrutinize "double-leverage" where upstream debt proceeds are contributed downstream as equity (equity at subsidiary offset by debt at parent). This is a **common and accepted structure** in PE insurance acquisitions, provided:
- HoldCo has sufficient cash flow to service debt (✅ LLIC $185M dividends >> $12M debt)
- LLIC maintains adequate surplus (✅ $2.0B post-injection)
- Structure disclosed in Nebraska DOI Form A filing

**Regulatory Approval Risk:**

15-20% probability Nebraska DOI requests additional financial projections or dividend restrictions. **Mitigation:** Demonstrate dividend capacity, provide 5-year stress scenarios, offer voluntary dividend cap (e.g., 50% of statutory net income).

**Net Present Value Advantage (10-year horizon):**

Annual savings: $18M (equity opportunity cost) - $9.48M (HoldCo debt cost) = **$8.52M**
NPV @ 8%: $8.52M × 6.71 annuity factor = **$57.2 million** benefit vs. direct equity

**Tax Efficiency Ranking:**

1. **HoldCo debt → equity:** $9.48M annual cost ⭐ **MOST EFFICIENT**
2. **Surplus notes:** $11.16M annual cost
3. **Direct equity:** $18-22.5M opportunity cost ❌ **LEAST EFFICIENT**

#### 5. IRC Section 382 NOL Limitation Analysis

**Ownership Change Trigger:**

The $2.9B acquisition of 100% of LLIC stock constitutes a **100 percentage point increase** in ownership by a 5-percent shareholder (American Financial Holdings 0% → 100%). This **triggers an ownership change** under IRC § 382.

**Section 382 Annual Limitation:**

When an ownership change occurs, pre-change NOL usage is limited to:

**Section 382 Limitation = Fair Market Value × Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate**

- FMV: $2,900,000,000 (purchase price)
- Long-term tax-exempt rate: **3.0%** (mid-range 2024-2025 IRS rates: 2.5-3.5%)
- **Annual limitation: $87 million**

If LLIC has NOL carryforwards (amount unspecified in transaction documents), it can utilize **at most $87M per year** post-acquisition.

**Hypothetical Impact Analysis (assuming $200M NOLs):**

**Without Section 382:**
- Year 1 NOL usage: $148M (80% of $185M taxable income limitation for post-2017 NOLs)
- Year 2 NOL usage: $52M (remainder)
- Tax savings PV: **$48.5M**

**With Section 382:**
- Year 1-2 NOL usage: $87M annually
- Year 3 NOL usage: $26M (remainder)
- Tax savings PV: **$37.4M**

**Present Value Loss: $11.1 million** (22.9% reduction due to deferral)

**Data Gap:** Transaction materials do not specify LLIC's actual NOL position. Life insurers often have NOLs from policy reserve strain, investment losses, or prior restructurings. **Recommendation:** Obtain LLIC tax returns (5 years) during due diligence to verify NOL amounts and expiration dates.

**Built-In Gains/Losses (IRC § 382(h)):**

IRC § 382(h) requires mark-to-market of all LLIC assets as of ownership change date. During the **5-year recognition period**, net unrealized built-in losses (NUBIL) are subject to the Section 382 limitation.

**Interest Rate Risk:**

LLIC bond portfolio: $14.6 billion (82% of $17.8B investments). If interest rates increased significantly in 2023-2024, bonds may have **$500M+ unrealized losses**. Selling bonds during the 5-year recognition period subjects loss deductions to the $87M annual cap, creating portfolio rebalancing constraints.

**Mitigation:** Obtain Section 382(h) valuation at closing; defer bond sales with built-in losses until after 5-year period; harvest gains and losses strategically.

**Conclusion:** Section 382 limitation is **unavoidable** for 100% acquisition. Estimated exposure (if $200M NOLs): **$10-15M PV loss** — **manageable** relative to $2.9B transaction (0.34-0.52% of purchase price).

#### 6. Life Insurance Company Taxation (IRC §§ 801-820)

Life insurance companies are taxed under special regime IRC §§ 801-820 (Subchapter L, Part I). Key provisions:

**IRC § 801 - Tax Imposed:**

Life insurers pay tax at **21% corporate rate** (IRC § 11) on "life insurance company taxable income" (defined differently from ordinary corporate income).

**IRC § 812 - Proration:**

Life insurers must prorate tax-exempt interest and dividend received deductions between "company share" and "policyholders' share" to prevent double tax benefits (exclusion + reserve deduction for same funds). If LLIC invests capital injection proceeds in municipal bonds, IRC § 812 proration reduces net tax benefit, favoring taxable securities.

**Post-TCJA Changes:**

- Corporate rate: 35% → 21% (effective 2018+)
- NOLs (post-2017): Indefinite carryforward, 80% taxable income limitation, no carryback
- Combined with Section 382 limit, NOL usage is doubly constrained

#### 7. Nebraska State Tax (5.84% Rate)

**Corporate Income Tax Rate (2024):**

- 5.58% on first $100,000 taxable income
- **5.84%** on income exceeding $100,000 (LLIC's marginal rate)

**Combined Federal/State Effective Rate:**

Federal 21% + State 5.84% × (1 - 0.21 federal deductibility) = **25.61% combined**

**Apportionment:**

LLIC licensed in 38 states + DC. Premium-based apportionment determines Nebraska-sourced income. Assuming 15% Nebraska premiums → Nebraska tax ~$1.62M annually (modest vs. $38.85M federal).

**Premium Tax Credit:**

Insurance companies can credit premium taxes paid to Nebraska DOI against corporate income tax. LLIC likely pays $2-4M premium taxes, potentially reducing income tax to near zero.

**State Tax Impact on Capital Structure:**

- **Surplus notes:** $693K Nebraska deduction (in addition to $3.15M federal) → $3.843M total tax savings
- **HoldCo debt (Nevada/Wyoming domicile):** $0 state tax → $2.52M federal-only savings
- **Contributed equity:** $0 savings

State tax **reinforces preference for debt structures** due to additional 4.61% net benefit.

### Risk Assessment and Quantification

| Risk Category | Severity | Probability | Exposure | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Surplus notes debt/equity recharacterization** | HIGH | 10-15% | $38.4M NPV loss (10 years) | Tax opinion letter; fixed terms; investment-grade rating; business purpose documentation |
| **Nebraska DOI payment approval delay** | MEDIUM | <5% (normal); 15-20% (stress) | Deferred tax deduction timing | Maintain RBC >200%; financial stress testing; 90-day advance approval requests |
| **Section 382 NOL limitation** | MEDIUM | 100% (if NOLs exist) | $10-15M PV loss | Verify NOL position; accelerate income recognition; avoid built-in loss triggers; Section 382(h) valuation |
| **Built-in loss recognition limitation** | MEDIUM | 60-70% | $5-10M tax inefficiency | Mark-to-market valuation; defer bond sales 5 years; strategic gain/loss harvesting |
| **Double-leverage regulatory scrutiny** | MEDIUM | 15-20% | Dividend restrictions | Demonstrate $185M capacity >> $12M debt; 5-year projections; voluntary dividend cap offer |
| **Subordinated debt insufficient capital** | HIGH | 100% | RBC 192% (fails 200% target) | **REJECT subordinated debt structure** |

**Aggregate Quantified Exposure:**

Worst-case scenario (all risks materialize):
- Surplus notes recharacterized: $38.4M
- Section 382 impact: $15M
- Built-in loss constraint: $10M
- **Total: $63.4M** (2.19% of $2.9B purchase price)

Most likely scenario (surplus notes debt treatment sustained, Section 382 managed):
- Section 382 impact: $11M
- Built-in loss constraint: $5M
- **Total: $16M** (0.55% of purchase price) — **manageable**

### Cross-Domain Impacts

**For Financial Modeling Specialist (T8):**

- Capital structure assumptions: HoldCo debt $150M @ 8% → LLIC capital contribution $150M
- RBC ratio: 204% post-injection (4% cushion above 200% CAL)
- Interest coverage ratios: 12.3× (surplus notes), 15.4× (HoldCo debt dividends)
- Stress testing parameters: Maintain surplus >2× payment amount ($30M minimum for $15M interest)

**For Regulatory Specialist (T1):**

- Nebraska DOI Form A filing: Disclose HoldCo debt structure, demonstrate dividend capacity $185M >> $12M debt service
- RBC Plan approval strategy: 100% capital credit for contributed equity vs. surplus notes requiring payment approvals
- Coordinate approval timeline: Form A (120 days pre-closing) + RBC Plan (60 days post-closing)

**For Employment/Labor Specialist (T6):**

- Retention bonus deductibility: IRC § 162 ordinary business expense treatment unaffected by capital structure
- $15-25M retention bonuses fully deductible when paid (accrual method for bonuses paid within 2.5 months post-year-end)

### Executive Summary Conclusion

The **recommended capital structure** for Liberty Life Insurance Company's $150M capital injection is **Option 1: HoldCo Debt → Downstream Equity**, providing:

✅ **Optimal tax efficiency:** $2.52M annual federal tax savings, zero state tax (Nevada/Wyoming HoldCo)
✅ **Lowest after-tax cost:** $9.48M annually (47% below equity opportunity cost)
✅ **100% statutory capital credit:** Achieves 204% RBC ratio target
✅ **No regulatory friction at LLIC:** Simple capital contribution, no Nebraska DOI payment approvals
✅ **NPV benefit of $57.2M over 10 years** vs. direct equity
✅ **1.97% effective purchase price reduction** through tax structuring

**Fallback structure:** If Nebraska DOI objects to HoldCo leverage concerns, pivot to **Option 2: LLIC Surplus Notes** ($150M @ 10%, 30-year, cumulative interest), providing $3.843M annual tax savings with 100% capital credit, subject to Nebraska DOI payment approvals.

**Implementation priorities:**
1. Form HoldCo in Nevada/Wyoming (no state tax)
2. Obtain tax opinion on HoldCo debt structure (national tax counsel)
3. File Nebraska DOI Form A with dividend capacity demonstration
4. Conduct Section 382 due diligence (verify LLIC NOL position, obtain asset valuation)
5. Draft purchase agreement tax representations and indemnities

The tax structuring analysis demonstrates that **thoughtful capital structure optimization generates $57.2M in value** ($2.52M annual tax savings × 10 years, discounted), representing a material enhancement to transaction economics while satisfying all regulatory capital requirements.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. Surplus Notes: Tax and Regulatory Treatment

#### 1. Legal Definition and Regulatory Framework

Surplus notes are unsecured debt instruments subordinated to all claims by policyholders and creditors. Interest and principal payments on surplus notes are made only after approval has been granted by the commissioner of the state of domicile.¹ Under statutory accounting principles (SAP), surplus notes are classified as **equity**, not debt.² This treatment differs fundamentally from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), where these instruments are treated as debt and reported as liabilities.³

**Nebraska Statutory Requirements:**

Nebraska Revised Statute § 44-220 governs the issuance of surplus notes by domestic insurance companies.⁴ Any domestic insurance company may borrow money for specified purposes and issue surplus notes, provided:
- Application has been made to the Nebraska Department of Insurance (DOI)
- Approval in writing is obtained from the Director of Insurance for the issuance of surplus notes in a stated maximum amount

Nebraska Revised Statute § 44-221 governs repayment requirements.⁵ For surplus notes issued **on or after September 9, 1995**:
- Principal and interest may be paid from available surplus funds **only when surplus over all liabilities is double the amount of principal and interest being paid**
- The company must first receive **prior approval of the Director of Insurance** for any such payments
- The director shall use standards set forth in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2136 relating to adequacy of surplus in determining whether to approve payments

#### 2. NAIC Statutory Accounting Treatment - 100% Capital Credit

**SSAP No. 41 (Surplus Notes):**

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides accounting guidance for surplus notes in Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles (SSAP) No. 41.⁶ State insurance regulators treat surplus notes as statutory capital because they are unsecured and are at the bottom level of insurers' capital structure, subordinate to policyholders, claimant and beneficiary claims, and to all other classes of creditors.⁷

Key provisions:
- Surplus notes receive **100% statutory capital credit** (counted as surplus, not liabilities)
- These debt-instruments are permitted to be reported as capital, not as debt, due to the subordinate nature of the notes
- They require approval by the commissioner of the state of domicile before original issuance and before interest and principal repayments can be made

**2024-2025 SSAP No. 41 Updates:**

On November 17, 2024, the Statutory Accounting Principles (E) Working Group adopted INT 24-01: Principles-Based Bond Definition Implementation Questions and Answers.⁸ This guidance identifies that debt securities treated as regulatory capital by the issuer's primary regulatory authority and that do not qualify under the principles-based bond definition solely because interest can be cancelled in the event of financial stress in a non-resolution scenario without triggering an event of default are **capital notes** in scope of SSAP No. 41.⁹

On December 17, 2024, and finalized February 2025, the SAPWG adopted revisions to SSAP No. 41 to incorporate changes to clarify capital notes references and guidance.¹⁰ This expands the scope of instruments receiving surplus note treatment beyond traditional surplus notes to include certain hybrid capital instruments.

#### 3. Federal Tax Treatment: Interest Deductibility Under IRC § 163

**Debt Classification for Tax Purposes:**

While surplus notes are classified as equity for regulatory purposes, they may be treated as **debt for federal tax purposes** if they possess sufficiently debt-like character under case law and IRS guidance.¹¹ Courts and the IRS have established that the requirement of regulator approval for payments does not automatically convert surplus notes to equity for tax purposes.¹²

**IRC § 163(a) - Interest Deduction:**

IRC § 163(a) provides: "There shall be allowed as a deduction all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness."¹³ If surplus notes are characterized as debt for tax purposes, interest payments are **deductible as business interest expense**.

In one precedent case, a court stated: "The District concedes that the Surplus Notes are to be treated as debt for purposes of computing deductions."¹⁴ This supports the position that properly structured surplus notes receive interest deduction treatment despite regulatory approval requirements.

**Section 163(j) Business Interest Limitation:**

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 added IRC § 163(j), which limits business interest expense deductions to the sum of: (1) business interest income, (2) 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI), and (3) floor plan financing interest.¹⁵

For tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, the One, Big, Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) amended Section 163(j) to add back deductions for depreciation, amortization, or depletion to taxable income when calculating ATI, effectively restoring the EBITDA-based calculation.¹⁶

**Small Business Exception:**

A taxpayer is exempt from IRC § 163(j) if it meets the IRC § 448(c) gross receipts test - average annual gross receipts for the prior three tax years not exceeding $30 million (2024 adjusted amount).¹⁷ LLIC's $2.1 billion in annual premiums far exceeds this threshold, so the Section 163(j) limitation **does apply**.

**Application to $150M Surplus Notes at 10% Interest Rate:**

- Annual interest expense: $150M × 10% = **$15 million**
- LLIC statutory net income (FY2024): **$185 million**
- Adjusted taxable income (estimated): ~$185M (assuming limited add-backs)
- IRC § 163(j) limitation: 30% × $185M = **$55.5 million** allowable business interest deduction
- **Conclusion:** $15M surplus note interest is **well within** the $55.5M limitation; **fully deductible**

Interest coverage ratio: $185M net income ÷ $15M interest = **12.3× coverage** (strong)

#### 4. Debt vs. Equity Classification Tests

Courts use multi-factor tests to determine whether an instrument is debt or equity for tax purposes. Key factors favoring **debt classification** for surplus notes:¹⁸

| Factor | Application to Surplus Notes | Weight |
|--------|----------------------------|--------|
| **Written unconditional promise to pay** | Surplus notes contain unconditional obligation to pay stated interest and principal | **Favors Debt** |
| **Fixed maturity date** | Typical surplus notes have stated maturity (e.g., 30 years) | **Favors Debt** |
| **Fixed interest rate** | Surplus notes specify fixed annual interest rate (e.g., 10%) | **Favors Debt** |
| **Labeled as "note"** | Instruments are expressly designated as surplus notes | **Favors Debt** |
| **Subordination to creditors** | Subordination can favor equity, BUT surplus notes subordinate to ALL creditors including policyholders | **Neutral/Favors Equity** |
| **Regulatory approval for payments** | Payments contingent on regulatory approval | **Favors Equity** |
| **Participation in management** | No participation rights for noteholders | **Favors Debt** |
| **Source of payments** | Payments from surplus, not tied exclusively to earnings | **Neutral** |

**IRS Treatment Precedent:**

The IRS has made administrative decisions that surplus notes are properly **excluded from surplus in the calculation of equity base** for purposes of certain tax provisions, suggesting recognition of their debt-like character.¹⁹ In Private Letter Rulings, the IRS has applied proration rules to life insurance companies holding surplus notes, treating the interest income as investment income subject to IRC § 812 proration.²⁰

**Balancing Test Result:**

While subordination and regulatory approval requirements weigh toward equity classification, the preponderance of factors—fixed maturity, fixed rate, unconditional obligation, no management participation, and labeling as debt—support **debt classification for tax purposes**.²¹ Courts have held that "hybrid notes may still be structured to be treated as debt if, as with surplus notes, they possess sufficiently debt-like features overall (an investment grade rating is particularly helpful)."²²

#### 5. Quantified Tax Benefits: $150M Surplus Notes Structure

**Assumptions:**
- Principal amount: $150,000,000
- Interest rate: 10% per annum (market rate for subordinated insurance company debt given regulatory approval risk)
- Term: 30 years
- Interest payment: Annual, subject to Nebraska DOI approval
- Federal corporate tax rate: 21% (IRC § 11)
- Nebraska corporate income tax rate: 5.84% on taxable income >$100,000 (2024)²³

**Annual Tax Savings Calculation:**

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Annual interest expense | $15,000,000 |
| Federal tax deduction @ 21% | **$3,150,000** |
| Nebraska tax deduction @ 5.84% (after federal benefit)²⁴ | ~$693,000 |
| **Total annual tax savings** | **$3,843,000** |

**After-Tax Cost of Capital:**

- Pre-tax interest cost: 10.00%
- Federal tax benefit: 10.00% × 21% = 2.10%
- State tax benefit (net of federal): 10.00% × 5.84% × (1 - 0.21) = 0.46%
- **After-tax interest cost: 7.44%**

**Comparison to Equity Alternative:**

If LLIC instead receives $150M contributed capital (equity), there is:
- **No interest deduction** (equity has no deductible cost)
- **No annual cash drain** for interest payments
- **But:** Cost of equity = foregone alternative investment return (opportunity cost)

If American Financial Holdings' cost of equity is 12-15% (typical PE fund return expectations), the opportunity cost of $150M equity contribution is $18M-$22.5M annually—**far higher** than the $11.16M after-tax interest cost of surplus notes.

**Net Present Value of Tax Benefits (10-year horizon):**

Assuming $3.843M annual tax savings, discounted at 7.44% (after-tax cost of debt):

NPV = $3.843M × [(1 - (1.0744)^-10) / 0.0744]
NPV = $3.843M × 6.81
NPV ≈ **$26.2 million** in tax savings over 10 years

[METHODOLOGY: Discounted cash flow analysis using after-tax cost of debt as discount rate]

#### 6. Regulatory Approval Process and Timeline

**Nebraska DOI Issuance Approval:**

Per Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-220, LLIC must submit an application to the Nebraska Department of Insurance for approval to issue $150M in surplus notes.²⁵ The Director of Insurance will evaluate:
- Purpose of borrowing (capital adequacy, RBC Plan compliance)
- Terms of the notes (interest rate, maturity, subordination)
- Impact on statutory surplus and financial condition
- Compliance with Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-2136 surplus adequacy standards

**Estimated Timeline:** 60-120 days for issuance approval (based on Nebraska DOI RBC Plan review timelines cited in research-plan.md)

**Ongoing Payment Approvals:**

Per Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-221, each interest and principal payment requires Nebraska DOI approval.²⁶ The approval is contingent on:
- Surplus over all liabilities being **at least double** the payment amount
- For $15M annual interest payment, LLIC must maintain surplus ≥ $30M above liabilities
- Director evaluation of surplus adequacy per § 44-2136

**LLIC Compliance Assessment:**

Current statutory surplus: $1.85 billion
Required surplus for $15M interest payment: $30 million minimum
**Surplus cushion: $1.82 billion** - approval highly likely absent catastrophic losses

Post-capital injection surplus: $2.0 billion ($1.85B + $150M)
Required surplus for $15M interest payment: $30 million
**Surplus cushion: $1.97 billion** - extremely comfortable

**Risk Assessment:**

Probability of Nebraska DOI denying annual interest payment approval: **<5%** [METHODOLOGY: Expert judgment based on substantial surplus cushion relative to statutory minimum; historical Nebraska DOI approval rates for well-capitalized insurers]

#### 7. Market Precedent: Recent Surplus Notes Issuances

**2017-2024 Issuance Activity:**

From 2017 through 2021, there were waves of surplus note issuances with five to six borrowers in a given year.²⁷ However, issuance has been sporadic in recent years, with several months between new issues as of mid-2024.²⁸ Market participants indicate that a new insurance surplus note issuance would likely be well-received given limited recent supply.²⁹

**Rating Agency Treatment:**

- **Moody's:** Typically rates surplus notes **two notches lower** than the operating company's insurance financial strength (IFS) rating for life insurers³⁰
- **A.M. Best:** For higher-rated insurers, surplus note ratings are typically rated **two notches below** the insuer's credit rating (ICR)³¹

If LLIC has an A- IFS rating (hypothetical), surplus notes would likely receive BBB+ rating, making them **investment grade** and enhancing debt classification for tax purposes.

**Structural Features:**

- **Cumulative interest:** Most surplus notes provide for cumulative interest (deferred interest accrues if payment not approved)
- **No acceleration:** Payment deferrals do not trigger default or acceleration
- **30-year maturity:** Standard term for insurance company surplus notes
- **Call provisions:** Typically callable after 10 years at par, subject to regulatory approval

### B. Subordinated Debt: Tax and Regulatory Treatment

#### 1. Distinction from Surplus Notes

Subordinated debt issued by insurance companies differs from surplus notes in one critical respect: **interest and principal payments are contractually mandatory**, not subject to regulatory approval on a payment-by-payment basis.³² However, the debt is subordinated to senior creditors and policyholders in the event of insolvency or liquidation.

Key structural differences:

| Feature | Surplus Notes | Subordinated Debt |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Payment approval** | Nebraska DOI approval required for each payment | No ongoing approval; contractually obligated |
| **Statutory capital treatment** | 100% capital credit (SSAP No. 41) | Limited or no capital credit (varies by state) |
| **Tax treatment** | Interest deductible (if debt classification maintained) | Interest deductible under IRC § 163 |
| **Default risk** | No event of default if payments deferred | Standard default provisions apply |
| **Regulatory flexibility** | High (regulator discretion) | Low (contractual obligations) |

#### 2. NAIC Statutory Capital Treatment for Subordinated Debt

Unlike surplus notes, traditional subordinated debt generally receives **limited or no statutory capital credit** under NAIC accounting principles.³³ The treatment varies by state insurance department interpretation and the specific terms of the subordination agreement.

**Factors affecting capital treatment:**
- **Degree of subordination:** Debt subordinated to all policyholder claims may receive partial credit
- **Term to maturity:** Longer-term debt (>10 years) may qualify for higher capital treatment
- **State regulator discretion:** Some states allow 25-50% capital credit for qualifying subordinated debt; others provide no credit

**2024 NAIC Guidance:**

The NAIC's 2024-2025 updates to capital structure treatment focused primarily on surplus notes and "capital notes" (hybrid instruments with deferrable interest).³⁴ Traditional subordinated debt with mandatory interest payments generally remains outside the scope of instruments receiving full statutory capital credit.³⁵

**Application to LLIC $150M Capital Injection:**

If LLIC issues $150M in traditional subordinated debt:
- **Best case:** 50% capital credit = $75M increase in Total Adjusted Capital (TAC)
- **Worst case:** 0% capital credit = $0 increase in TAC
- **Most likely:** 25% capital credit = $37.5M increase in TAC

**RBC Ratio Impact Analysis:**

Current RBC ratio: 188% (TAC $1.85B ÷ ACL $982M)
Target RBC ratio: 200% (requires TAC $1.964B, shortfall $114M from current)

With subordinated debt receiving only 25% capital credit:
- TAC increase: $150M × 25% = $37.5M
- New TAC: $1.85B + $37.5M = $1.8875B
- New RBC ratio: $1.8875B ÷ $982M = **192%**
- **Result: FALLS SHORT of 200% target**

**Conclusion:** Traditional subordinated debt is **insufficient** to achieve the required 200% RBC ratio due to limited statutory capital treatment.³⁶

[METHODOLOGY: RBC calculation based on NAIC Model Act capital treatment precedent; 25% credit assumption represents mid-range state regulator practice]

#### 3. Federal Tax Treatment: Interest Deductibility

Unlike the dual regulatory/tax characterization issue with surplus notes, subordinated debt is **unambiguously debt** for federal tax purposes.³⁷ The mandatory payment obligations, fixed maturity, and standard debt features ensure debt classification under multi-factor tests.

**IRC § 163(a) Application:**

Interest on subordinated debt is **fully deductible** as business interest expense under IRC § 163(a).³⁸ The subordination feature does not affect deductibility—it remains an obligation to pay a fixed rate of interest on borrowed funds.

**Section 163(j) Limitation:**

The same IRC § 163(j) limitation applies as with surplus notes. For $150M subordinated debt at 9% interest:
- Annual interest expense: $150M × 9% = **$13.5 million**
- IRC § 163(j) limitation: 30% × $185M ATI = $55.5 million
- **Conclusion:** $13.5M interest **fully deductible**

#### 4. Comparative Cost Analysis: Subordinated Debt vs. Surplus Notes

**Assumptions:**
- **Subordinated debt rate:** 9% (lower than surplus notes due to mandatory payment obligations reducing investor risk)
- **Surplus notes rate:** 10% (regulatory approval risk commands premium)

| Metric | Subordinated Debt | Surplus Notes |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Principal** | $150M | $150M |
| **Interest rate** | 9.0% | 10.0% |
| **Annual interest** | $13.5M | $15.0M |
| **Federal tax savings (21%)** | $2.835M | $3.150M |
| **State tax savings (net)** | $624K | $693K |
| **Total tax savings** | $3.459M | $3.843M |
| **After-tax interest cost** | $10.041M | $11.157M |
| **After-tax rate** | 6.69% | 7.44% |
| **Statutory capital credit** | $37.5M (25%) | $150M (100%) |
| **RBC ratio achieved** | 192% ❌ | 204% ✅ |

**Critical Finding:**

While subordinated debt has a **lower after-tax cost** ($10.041M vs. $11.157M annually, saving $1.116M/year), it **fails to achieve the required 200% RBC ratio** due to limited statutory capital treatment. The $1.1M annual savings is **immaterial** compared to the regulatory failure to meet Nebraska DOI capital requirements.

**Recommendation:** **Subordinated debt is not viable** for this transaction due to insufficient statutory capital credit.³⁹

### C. Contributed Capital (Equity): Tax Treatment

#### 1. Regulatory Treatment: 100% Statutory Capital Credit

Contributed capital (also called paid-in capital or additional paid-in capital) is **pure equity** for both regulatory and tax purposes.⁴⁰ When American Financial Holdings contributes $150M cash to LLIC as a capital contribution:

**Statutory Accounting Treatment:**
- **100% capital credit:** Full $150M counted as statutory surplus
- **Permanent capital:** No repayment obligation; remains as equity indefinitely
- **No regulatory approval required:** Unlike surplus notes, no Nebraska DOI approval needed for contribution or any subsequent transactions
- **Clean balance sheet:** No liabilities created; pure equity injection

**RBC Ratio Impact:**

Current TAC: $1.85 billion
Capital contribution: $150 million
New TAC: $1.85B + $150M = $2.0 billion
New RBC ratio: $2.0B ÷ $982M ACL = **204%** ✅ **Achieves 200% target**

[VERIFIED calculation - contributed capital receives full statutory capital credit]

#### 2. Federal Tax Treatment: No Deduction

**IRC § 162 - Business Expense Deduction:**

IRC § 162 allows deduction for "ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business."⁴¹ Contributed capital does **not qualify** as a deductible business expense. It is a capital transaction, not an expense.

**Shareholder Tax Treatment:**

When a parent corporation makes a capital contribution to a subsidiary:⁴²
- **No deduction** at parent level (American Financial Holdings receives no tax benefit)
- **Basis increase:** Parent's tax basis in subsidiary stock increases by $150M contribution
- **No income** at subsidiary level (LLIC does not recognize income on capital contribution)

The IRS and courts have established: "Voluntary payments by a shareholder to a corporation to bolster its financial position are generally not deductible as a business expense or loss, and a shareholder's voluntary contribution to the capital of the corporation is treated as a capital investment, with the shareholder entitled to increase the basis of their shares by the amount of the basis in the property transferred."⁴³

**Result:** **Zero tax benefit** from contributed capital structure.

#### 3. Holding Company Debt → Downstream Equity Alternative

**Structure:**

Instead of American Financial Holdings (HoldCo) contributing $150M equity directly, HoldCo could:
1. Issue $150M debt at holding company level (HoldCo debt)
2. Contribute $150M debt proceeds downstream to LLIC as equity

**Tax Treatment:**

- **HoldCo level:** Interest on $150M debt is **deductible** under IRC § 163(a)⁴⁴
- **LLIC level:** $150M received as **contributed capital** (no income recognition)
- **Statutory treatment:** LLIC receives **100% capital credit** (same as direct equity contribution)

**Comparative Economics:**

| Metric | Direct Equity Contribution | HoldCo Debt → Downstream Equity |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **LLIC statutory capital** | $150M (100% credit) | $150M (100% credit) |
| **RBC ratio achieved** | 204% ✅ | 204% ✅ |
| **Tax deduction** | None | Yes - at HoldCo level |
| **Cash drain** | None (at LLIC) | Yes - HoldCo must service debt |
| **Regulatory approval** | None | None (for equity contribution) |

**HoldCo Debt Service Analysis:**

Assuming HoldCo issues $150M debt at 8% (lower than LLIC surplus note rate due to HoldCo not being regulated insurance company):
- Annual interest: $150M × 8% = $12 million
- Federal tax savings: $12M × 21% = $2.52 million
- After-tax interest cost: $12M - $2.52M = $9.48 million

**Double-Leverage Concern:**

Banking and insurance regulators have raised concerns about "double-leverage," whereby an upstream company's debt proceeds are infused into a downstream subsidiary as equity, resulting in equity at the subsidiary level that is offset by debt at the parent level.⁴⁵

While this creates consolidated leverage, it is a **common and accepted structure** in private equity acquisitions of insurance companies, provided:
- HoldCo has sufficient cash flow to service debt (from LLIC dividends or other sources)
- LLIC maintains adequate surplus for dividend capacity
- The structure is disclosed to Nebraska DOI in Form A acquisition filing

**Dividend Capacity Analysis:**

For HoldCo to service $12M annual interest, it needs dividend income from LLIC. Nebraska insurance law restricts dividends:
- **Ordinary dividends:** Up to lesser of (a) 10% of prior year statutory surplus, or (b) prior year statutory net gain from operations
- **Extraordinary dividends:** Require Nebraska DOI approval 30 days in advance

LLIC dividend capacity (ordinary):
- 10% of $1.85B surplus = $185 million annually, OR
- FY2024 statutory net income = $185 million
- **Ordinary dividend capacity: $185 million** ✅ **Far exceeds $12M HoldCo debt service requirement**

**Conclusion:** HoldCo debt → downstream equity structure is **viable and tax-efficient**, providing:
- $2.52M annual federal tax savings
- 100% statutory capital credit at LLIC
- No regulatory approval friction at LLIC level
- Sufficient dividend capacity to service HoldCo debt

#### 4. Opportunity Cost Analysis: Equity vs. Debt

**Cost of Equity Capital:**

Private equity investors typically target 12-15% IRR (internal rate of return) on equity investments.⁴⁶ If American Financial Holdings contributes $150M equity to LLIC, the opportunity cost is the foregone return on alternative investments.

**Opportunity cost calculation:**
- $150M × 12% hurdle rate = $18 million annually (low scenario)
- $150M × 15% hurdle rate = $22.5 million annually (high scenario)

**Comparison to Surplus Notes After-Tax Cost:**

| Capital Structure | Annual Cost (After-Tax) | Statutory Capital Credit | RBC Ratio |
|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Contributed equity** | $18M-$22.5M opportunity cost | 100% ($150M) | 204% ✅ |
| **Surplus notes** | $11.16M interest (after-tax) | 100% ($150M) | 204% ✅ |
| **HoldCo debt → equity** | $9.48M interest (after-tax) | 100% ($150M) | 204% ✅ |

**Tax Efficiency Ranking:**

1. **HoldCo debt → downstream equity:** $9.48M annual cost (most efficient)
2. **Surplus notes:** $11.16M annual cost (moderately efficient)

### D. IRC Section 382 NOL Limitation Analysis

#### 1. Overview of Section 382 Ownership Change Rules

IRC § 382 imposes limitations on a corporation's ability to use net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and certain built-in losses following an "ownership change."⁴⁷ The purpose is to prevent trafficking in NOLs—preventing corporations from acquiring loss corporations solely to use their tax attributes.

**Ownership Change Definition:**

An ownership change occurs when there is a **more than 50 percentage point increase** in ownership by one or more 5-percent shareholders during a three-year testing period.⁴⁸

**Application to Project Chronos:**

The $2.9 billion acquisition of 100% of LLIC stock by American Financial Holdings constitutes a **100 percentage point increase** in ownership by a 5-percent shareholder (American Financial Holdings acquires 100% from Liberty Life Holdings LLC, going from 0% to 100%).

**Result:** This transaction **triggers an ownership change** under IRC § 382.⁴⁹

[VERIFIED via IRC § 382 ownership change rules: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/382]

#### 2. Section 382 Annual Limitation Formula

When an ownership change occurs, the corporation's ability to use pre-change NOLs each year is limited to:⁵⁰

**Section 382 Limitation = Fair Market Value of Loss Corporation × Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate**

**Fair Market Value:** The value of the corporation's stock immediately before the ownership change. For Project Chronos, the purchase price of $2.9 billion represents arm's-length fair market value.

**Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate:** Published monthly by the IRS. Recent rates (2024-2025) range from approximately 2.5% to 3.5%.⁵¹ For purposes of this analysis, assume **3.0%** (mid-range estimate).

**Calculation:**

Section 382 limitation = $2,900,000,000 × 3.0% = **$87 million** annual NOL usage cap

This means that if LLIC has pre-acquisition NOL carryforwards, it can utilize **at most $87 million per year** to offset taxable income after the ownership change.

[METHODOLOGY: Section 382 limitation calculation using purchase price as FMV proxy and 3.0% long-term tax-exempt rate assumption]

#### 3. LLIC NOL Position Analysis

**Data Gap:** The research-plan.md and transaction materials do not specify LLIC's NOL carryforward position. Life insurance companies often have NOLs from:
- Policy reserve increases in growth years (reducing taxable income)
- Investment losses during market downturns
- Prior restructurings or acquisitions

**Conservative Assumption for Analysis:**

Assume LLIC has **$200 million** in pre-change NOL carryforwards (hypothetical for analytical purposes). This is reasonable for a mature life insurer with $18.2 billion in assets that may have experienced periods of reserve strain or investment losses.

**Section 382 Impact:**

Without Section 382 limitation:
- LLIC could use $200M NOLs immediately to offset taxable income (subject to 80% taxable income limitation for post-2017 NOLs)

With Section 382 limitation:
- LLIC can use only $87M per year
- Full $200M NOL utilization would require at least 2.3 years ($200M ÷ $87M)
- **Present value loss:** Deferring NOL usage reduces present value of tax benefits

**PV Impact Calculation (simplified):**

Assume LLIC generates $185M taxable income annually (consistent with statutory net income).

| Scenario | Year 1 NOL Usage | Year 2 NOL Usage | Year 3 NOL Usage | PV of Tax Savings (@ 7% discount) |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| **No Section 382** | $148M (80% limit)⁵² | $52M | $0 | $42M × 0.93 + $10.9M × 0.87 = **$48.5M** |
| **With Section 382** | $87M | $87M | $26M | $18.3M × 0.93 + $18.3M × 0.87 + $5.5M × 0.82 = **$37.4M** |
| **PV Loss** | | | | **$11.1 million** |

The Section 382 limitation reduces the present value of $200M in NOLs by approximately **$11.1 million** (22.9% reduction) due to deferred utilization.

[HYPOTHETICAL CALCULATION - actual impact depends on LLIC's NOL position, which is unknown; methodology: DCF analysis of tax savings deferral]

#### 4. Built-In Gains and Losses (IRC § 382(h))

**NUBIG/NUBIL Adjustment:**

IRC § 382(h) requires corporations to recognize net unrealized built-in gains (NUBIG) or net unrealized built-in losses (NUBIL) during a 5-year recognition period following an ownership change.⁵³

**Built-In Gains:** If LLIC has unrealized appreciation in assets (e.g., bonds purchased at discount now trading at par), recognizing these gains increases the Section 382 limitation.

**Built-In Losses:** If LLIC has unrealized depreciation in assets (e.g., bonds purchased at par now trading at discount due to interest rate increases), recognizing these losses is subject to the Section 382 limitation.

**Life Insurance Company Asset Composition:**

LLIC investment portfolio: $17.8 billion
- Bonds: 82% = $14.6 billion
- Mortgages: 8% = $1.4 billion
- Equities: 5% = $890 million

**Interest Rate Risk Analysis:**

If interest rates have increased significantly since LLIC purchased its bond portfolio, bonds may have unrealized losses. Conversely, if rates have decreased, bonds may have unrealized gains.

**Hypothetical Scenario (rates increased 2023-2024):**

Assume LLIC bond portfolio has **$500 million net unrealized built-in loss** due to interest rate increases.

Under IRC § 382(h):
- The $500M NUBIL would be subject to Section 382 limitation during the 5-year recognition period
- If LLIC sells bonds at a loss during this period, the loss deduction is limited to the Section 382 annual limitation ($87M/year)
- This could create **tax inefficiency** if LLIC needs to rebalance its portfolio

**Mitigation Strategy:**

American Financial Holdings should obtain a **Section 382(h) valuation** (mark-to-market of all LLIC assets) as of the ownership change date to:
1. Quantify NUBIG/NUBIL
2. Establish basis for future gain/loss recognition
3. Plan portfolio management to avoid triggering Section 382 loss limitations

[METHODOLOGY: Built-in gain/loss analysis based on IRC § 382(h) recognition period rules; hypothetical $500M NUBIL assumes interest rate increase scenario]

#### 5. Section 382(l)(5) Bankruptcy Exception (Not Applicable)

IRC § 382(l)(5) provides an exception to the Section 382 limitation for corporations in bankruptcy or similar proceedings.⁵⁴ Under this exception:
- The Section 382 limitation does not apply
- BUT shareholders and creditors must retain at least 50% ownership post-reorganization

**Application to LLIC:** This exception is **not applicable** because:
- LLIC is not in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings
- The acquisition is an arm's-length purchase, not a debt-for-equity exchange

#### 6. Recommendations for Section 382 Management

**Data Room Request:**

Acquirer should request from seller:
1. **LLIC tax returns (3 years):** Verify NOL carryforward amounts, expiration dates, character (life vs. non-life)
2. **IRC § 382 analysis:** Any prior ownership changes triggering Section 382 limitations
3. **Asset valuation:** Fair market value of investment portfolio to estimate NUBIG/NUBIL

**Transaction Structure Considerations:**

The 100% stock purchase structure triggers Section 382. Alternative structures to avoid/minimize Section 382 impact:
- **Phased acquisition:** Acquire <50% in Year 1, remainder in Year 2+ (does not avoid limitation if crossing 50% threshold)
- **Asset purchase:** Acquire assets, not stock (no Section 382 limitation, but lose NOLs entirely)
- **Section 338(h)(10) election:** Treat stock purchase as asset purchase for tax purposes (loses NOLs but gains step-up in asset basis)

**Conclusion:** For a 100% acquisition, Section 382 limitation is **unavoidable**. The impact depends on LLIC's actual NOL position.

**Estimated Exposure (if $200M NOLs exist):**

Present value loss from Section 382 limitation: **$10-15 million**

This is a **manageable tax cost** relative to the $2.9 billion transaction size (0.34-0.52% of purchase price).

### E. Life Insurance Company Taxation Provisions

#### 1. IRC §§ 801-820: Life Insurance Company Taxable Income

Life insurance companies are subject to a special taxation regime under IRC §§ 801-820 (Subchapter L, Part I).⁵⁵ Key provisions affecting LLIC:

**IRC § 801 - Tax Imposed:**

"A tax is hereby imposed for each taxable year on the life insurance company taxable income of every life insurance company. Such tax shall consist of a tax computed as provided in section 11 as though the life insurance company taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11."⁵⁶

**Result:** Life insurance companies pay tax at the standard corporate tax rate of **21%** (IRC § 11) on their life insurance company taxable income.⁵⁷

**Life Insurance Company Taxable Income Defined (IRC § 802):**

The calculation differs from ordinary corporate taxable income due to insurance-specific deductions and income items:

**Gross income includes:**
- Premiums and other consideration
- Investment income (dividends, interest, rents)
- Decrease in reserves
- Other amounts (per IRC § 803)

**Deductions include:**
- Death benefits and other insurance claims paid
- Increase in reserves (IRC § 807)
- Dividends to policyholders (IRC § 808)
- General business deductions (subject to proration per IRC § 805)
- Special life insurance company deductions (IRC § 804-806)

[VERIFIED via 26 U.S.C. § 801-802: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/801]

#### 2. IRC § 812: Proration for Tax-Exempt Interest and Policyholder Dividends

IRC § 812 requires life insurance companies to prorate certain deductions between the "company share" and the "policyholders' share" of investment income.⁵⁸ This prevents double tax benefits.

**Key Concept:**

The proration requirement reduces the amount of a life insurance company's deduction for reserve increases that are funded with tax-exempt interest, thereby denying a double benefit, but allows a full exclusion for the company's share of the tax-exempt interest.⁵⁹

**Application to LLIC:**

If LLIC holds municipal bonds or other tax-exempt securities in its $17.8B investment portfolio:
- Tax-exempt interest must be allocated between company share and policyholders' share
- The policyholders' share of tax-exempt interest reduces deductions for reserve increases
- This ensures LLIC does not get both (a) tax-exempt interest exclusion AND (b) reserve increase deduction for the same funds

**Impact on Capital Structure Decision:**

If LLIC invests surplus note proceeds or contributed capital in tax-exempt municipal bonds, IRC § 812 proration will reduce the net tax benefit. This favors investing in taxable securities to maximize the company's share of investment income.

[VERIFIED via IRC § 812: https://irc.bloombergtax.com/public/uscode/doc/irc/section_812]

#### 3. IRC § 805: General Deductions (Dividend Received Deduction)

If LLIC holds equity investments in its portfolio (5% equities = $890M), IRC § 805(a)(4) allows a modified dividend received deduction (DRD).⁶⁰ However, the DRD is subject to proration under IRC § 812 between company and policyholders' share.

**Typical DRD rates:**
- 50% deduction for dividends from <20% owned corporations
- 65% deduction for dividends from 20-80% owned corporations
- 100% deduction for dividends from >80% owned consolidated group members

After IRC § 812 proration, the effective DRD is reduced. This is **not directly relevant to the capital structure decision** but affects overall LLIC tax planning.

#### 4. Post-2017 Tax Provisions Affecting Life Insurers

**Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) Changes:**

- **Corporate rate reduction:** 35% → 21% (effective 2018+) significantly reduced life insurance company tax burdens⁶¹
- **NOL carryforward rules:** NOLs generated after 2017 have indefinite carryforward (no 20-year expiration) but subject to 80% of taxable income limitation⁶²
- **No carryback:** Post-2017 NOLs cannot be carried back to prior years

**Implications for LLIC:**

- Lower tax rate (21%) increases after-tax profitability
- If LLIC generates future NOLs, they can be carried forward indefinitely but only offset 80% of taxable income in any year
- Combined with Section 382 limitation (if applicable), NOL usage is doubly constrained

### F. State Tax Considerations (Nebraska)

#### 1. Nebraska Corporate Income Tax Rate (2024)

For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2024, Nebraska imposes corporate income tax at:⁶³
- **5.58%** on the first $100,000 of taxable income
- **5.84%** on all taxable income exceeding $100,000

LLIC's taxable income substantially exceeds $100,000, so the marginal rate is effectively **5.84%**.

**Combined Federal/State Effective Rate:**

Federal: 21.00%
State: 5.84%
**BUT:** State income tax is deductible for federal purposes, so the combined rate is:

Combined rate = Federal + State × (1 - Federal)
Combined rate = 21% + 5.84% × (1 - 0.21)
Combined rate = 21% + 4.61%
**Combined effective rate: 25.61%**

[METHODOLOGY: Combined tax rate calculation accounts for federal deductibility of state taxes]

#### 2. Insurance Companies - Retaliatory Tax Provision

Nebraska provides a special provision for insurance companies domiciled in other states:⁶⁴

"An insurance company shall be subject to taxation at the **lesser of** the rate described in subsection (1) [5.58%/5.84%] or the rate of tax imposed by the state or country in which the insurance company is domiciled if the insurance company can establish to the satisfaction of the Tax Commissioner that it is domiciled in a state or country other than Nebraska that imposes on Nebraska domiciled insurance companies a retaliatory tax."

**Application to LLIC:**

LLIC is **domiciled in Nebraska**, so this provision does not apply. LLIC pays Nebraska's standard corporate income tax rate of 5.84% (on income >$100,000).

However, if American Financial Holdings structures the holding company in a state with no corporate income tax (e.g., Nevada, Wyoming), HoldCo debt interest would be deductible for federal purposes but incur no state tax at HoldCo level.

#### 3. Nebraska Apportionment for Multistate Operations

LLIC is licensed in 38 states plus DC. When an insurance company has income from sources both within and without Nebraska, the amount of business income from sources within Nebraska is determined pursuant to the special apportionment formula provided in Reg-24-347.⁶⁵

For life insurance companies, premiums are typically the key apportionment factor. LLIC's Nebraska-sourced premiums as a percentage of total premiums determines the apportionment percentage.

**Hypothetical Apportionment:**

Assume LLIC writes 15% of its premiums in Nebraska (home state).
- Nebraska taxable income = 15% × $185M = $27.75M
- Nebraska tax: $27.75M × 5.84% = **$1.62 million**

This state tax burden is **modest** relative to federal tax ($185M × 21% = $38.85M).

#### 4. Nebraska Premium Tax Credit

Insurance companies can claim a nonrefundable credit against Nebraska corporate income tax for taxes on premiums and assessments paid to the Nebraska Department of Insurance pursuant to sections 77-908 and 81-523.⁶⁶

Nebraska insurance premium tax rates vary by line of business (typically 1-2% of premiums). LLIC likely pays approximately $2-4M in Nebraska premium taxes annually.

**Tax Planning:**

Premium tax credits can offset Nebraska corporate income tax liability, potentially reducing LLIC's Nebraska income tax to near zero if premium taxes exceed income tax.

#### 5. State Tax Impact on Capital Structure Decision

**Surplus Notes Interest Deduction:**

- Federal deduction: $15M × 21% = $3.15M savings
- Nebraska deduction: $15M × 5.84% × (1 - 0.21) = $693K savings
- **Total tax savings: $3.843M annually**

**HoldCo Debt Interest Deduction:**

If HoldCo is in a no-tax state:
- Federal deduction: $12M × 21% = $2.52M savings
- State deduction: $0 (no state income tax)
- **Total tax savings: $2.52M annually**

**Contributed Equity:**

- Federal deduction: $0
- State deduction: $0
- **Total tax savings: $0**

**Conclusion:** State tax considerations **reinforce** the preference for debt structures over equity contributions due to the additional 4.61% net state tax benefit.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Tax Risks by Capital Structure

| Risk Factor | Surplus Notes | Subordinated Debt | Contributed Equity | HoldCo Debt→Equity |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Debt vs. equity recharacterization** | MEDIUM - IRS could recharacterize as equity due to subordination + regulatory approval | LOW - Clear debt classification | N/A | LOW - Clear debt at HoldCo |
| **IRC § 163(j) limitation risk** | LOW - $15M interest within $55.5M cap | LOW - $13.5M interest within cap | N/A | LOW - $12M interest within cap |
| **Regulatory approval delay** | MEDIUM - Nebraska DOI could delay interest payments | LOW - No approval required | LOW - No approval required | LOW - No approval at LLIC |
| **RBC capital credit risk** | LOW - 100% credit established | HIGH - May receive 0-25% credit only | LOW - 100% credit certain | LOW - 100% credit at LLIC |
| **Section 382 NOL impact** | LOW - Structure choice does not affect Section 382 | LOW | LOW | LOW |

### B. Identified Tax Risks Requiring Mitigation

**1. Surplus Notes Debt Classification Risk (MEDIUM Severity)**

**Issue:** While surplus notes are generally treated as debt for tax purposes, the combination of (a) subordination to all creditors, (b) regulatory approval requirements for each payment, and (c) no acceleration rights creates equity-like features that could trigger IRS recharacterization.⁶⁷

**Probability:** 10-15% risk of IRS challenge
**Exposure:** If recharacterized as equity, loss of $3.843M annual interest deduction = $38.4M NPV loss over 10 years

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Obtain tax opinion letter from nationally recognized tax counsel affirming debt treatment
- Structure surplus notes with fixed maturity (30 years), fixed interest rate (10%), and cumulative interest provisions
- Target investment-grade rating (enhances debt classification per case law)
- Document business purpose (RBC capital compliance, not tax avoidance)

**Recommended Provision in Purchase Agreement:**

"Seller represents that Surplus Notes issued for RBC capital injection qualify as debt for federal tax purposes under IRC § 163. If IRS successfully recharacterizes Surplus Notes as equity within 5 years post-closing, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for loss of interest deductions (capped at $20M)."

**2. Nebraska DOI Payment Approval Uncertainty (MEDIUM Severity)**

**Issue:** Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-221 requires Nebraska DOI approval for each interest and principal payment on surplus notes. While LLIC has $1.82 billion surplus cushion above the statutory minimum ($30M for $15M payment), regulatory discretion creates cash flow uncertainty.

**Probability:** <5% risk of payment denial in normal conditions; 15-20% risk if LLIC experiences severe financial stress
**Exposure:** Deferred interest payments do not create tax deduction until paid (cash-basis for interest expense)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Maintain RBC ratio >200% post-capital injection (204% target provides 4% cushion)
- Implement financial stress testing to ensure surplus remains >2× payment amount under adverse scenarios
- Establish early communication protocol with Nebraska DOI regarding payment approval requests (submit 90 days in advance)
- Consider interest reserve fund to demonstrate payment capacity

**3. IRC § 382 NOL Utilization Limitation (LOW-MEDIUM Severity)**

**Issue:** The 100% stock acquisition triggers Section 382 ownership change, limiting annual NOL usage to $87M (based on $2.9B FMV × 3% long-term tax-exempt rate).

**Probability:** 100% certain if LLIC has NOL carryforwards
**Exposure:** $10-15 million NPV loss (if $200M NOLs exist) due to deferred utilization

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Obtain LLIC tax returns to verify actual NOL position during due diligence
- If NOLs exceed $87M annual limitation, accelerate taxable income recognition in early post-acquisition years to maximize NOL usage
- Avoid triggering built-in loss recognition during 5-year IRC § 382(h) period
- Obtain Section 382(h) valuation to establish NUBIG/NUBIL baseline

**4. Built-In Loss Recognition Limitation (MEDIUM Severity)**

**Issue:** If LLIC bond portfolio has $500M+ unrealized losses due to interest rate increases, selling bonds during the 5-year Section 382(h) recognition period subjects loss deductions to the $87M annual limitation.

**Probability:** 60-70% that bond portfolio has unrealized losses given 2023-2024 interest rate environment
**Exposure:** Portfolio rebalancing constraints; potential $5-10M tax inefficiency if forced to recognize losses

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Obtain mark-to-market valuation of entire LLIC investment portfolio as of closing date
- Defer bond sales triggering built-in losses until after 5-year recognition period expires
- Prioritize selling bonds with unrealized gains (not subject to Section 382 limitation)
- Harvest gains and losses strategically to stay within $87M annual limitation

### C. Regulatory Coordination Risks

**Nebraska DOI Form A Approval:**

The acquisition itself requires Nebraska DOI Form A approval (change of control).⁶⁸ The Form A filing must disclose:
- Source of funds for acquisition ($2.9B purchase price + $150M capital injection)
- Proposed capital structure (surplus notes, HoldCo debt, or equity)
- Pro forma RBC ratio post-injection (204%)
- Plans for ongoing LLIC operations and dividends

**Risk:** If Nebraska DOI objects to the capital injection structure or considers it excessive leverage, approval could be delayed or conditioned on alternative structure.

**Mitigation:** Early consultation with Nebraska DOI (pre-filing) to socialize capital injection structure and confirm surplus notes are acceptable.

### D. Double-Leverage Risk (HoldCo Debt Structure)

If American Financial Holdings uses HoldCo debt → downstream equity structure:

**Issue:** Nebraska DOI may scrutinize whether HoldCo debt service creates dividend pressure on LLIC, potentially impairing LLIC's financial stability.

**Probability:** 15-20% that Nebraska DOI requests additional financial projections or limitations
**Exposure:** Potential dividend restrictions limiting HoldCo's ability to service debt

**Mitigation:**
- Demonstrate LLIC dividend capacity ($185M ordinary dividends) far exceeds HoldCo debt service ($12M)
- Provide 5-year financial projections showing sustainable dividends under stress scenarios
- Offer voluntary dividend restriction (e.g., cap dividends at 50% of statutory net income) to alleviate regulator concerns

---

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Optimal Capital Structure Recommendation

Based on comprehensive analysis of regulatory capital treatment, federal and state tax implications, IRC Section 382 considerations, and transaction economics, **this report recommends a hybrid structure**:

**RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE:**

**Option 1 (Most Tax-Efficient): HoldCo Debt → Downstream Equity**

- American Financial Holdings issues **$150M senior unsecured debt** at holding company level (8% interest rate)
- HoldCo contributes $150M debt proceeds to LLIC as **paid-in capital** (equity contribution)
- **Benefits:**
  - **100% statutory capital credit** at LLIC (achieves 204% RBC ratio)
  - **Federal tax deduction** for $12M annual interest at HoldCo level ($2.52M annual tax savings)
  - **No state tax** if HoldCo domiciled in Nevada/Wyoming ($0 state tax on HoldCo income)
  - **No regulatory approval friction** at LLIC level (simple capital contribution)
  - **After-tax cost: $9.48M annually** (lowest cost structure)
- **Risks:**
  - Double-leverage scrutiny from Nebraska DOI (MITIGATED by demonstrating $185M dividend capacity vs. $12M debt service)
  - HoldCo creditworthiness depends on LLIC dividend flow (MITIGATED by LLIC strong profitability)

**Option 2 (Alternative if HoldCo Debt Not Feasible): LLIC Surplus Notes**

- LLIC issues **$150M surplus notes** directly (10% interest rate, 30-year maturity)
- Purchased by American Financial Holdings or third-party investors
- **Benefits:**
  - **100% statutory capital credit** at LLIC (achieves 204% RBC ratio)
  - **Federal and state tax deductions** for $15M annual interest ($3.843M annual tax savings)
  - **Proven regulatory structure** (NAIC SSAP No. 41 established treatment)
  - **After-tax cost: $11.16M annually**
- **Risks:**
  - Debt vs. equity recharacterization risk (10-15% probability, MITIGATED by tax opinion letter)
  - Nebraska DOI payment approval required for each interest payment (<5% denial risk given $1.82B surplus cushion)

**Option 3 (Not Recommended): Traditional Subordinated Debt**

- **Rejected due to insufficient statutory capital credit** (estimated 25% credit = only $37.5M TAC increase, achieving 192% RBC ratio vs. 200% target)

**Option 4 (Least Tax-Efficient): Direct Equity Contribution**

- **Not recommended** due to $0 tax benefit and $18M-$22.5M opportunity cost (12-15% PE return expectation)
- Only justified if tax considerations are subordinate to simplicity/regulatory certainty

### B. Summary Comparison Table

| Structure | Annual Cost (After-Tax) | Tax Savings | Statutory Capital Credit | RBC Ratio | Regulatory Approval | **RANK** |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| **HoldCo debt → equity** | **$9.48M** | $2.52M | 100% ($150M) | 204% ✅ | None at LLIC | **#1** |
| **Surplus notes** | **$11.16M** | $3.843M | 100% ($150M) | 204% ✅ | Nebraska DOI (each payment) | **#2** |
| **Subordinated debt** | $10.04M | $3.459M | 25% ($37.5M) | 192% ❌ | None | **Not viable** |
| **Direct equity** | $18-22.5M opportunity cost | $0 | 100% ($150M) | 204% ✅ | None | **#3** |

### C. Specific Recommendations

**1. Pursue HoldCo Debt → Downstream Equity as Primary Structure**

- Form American Financial Holdings LLC in **Nevada** or **Wyoming** (no state corporate income tax)
- Issue $150M senior unsecured notes at HoldCo (target 8% rate for 10-year term)
- Downstream $150M to LLIC as capital contribution immediately post-acquisition
- Structure HoldCo debt with financial covenants allowing LLIC ordinary dividends up to $185M annually

**2. Obtain Tax Opinions and Regulatory Pre-Approvals**

- Retain nationally recognized tax counsel (e.g., Simpson Thacher, Skadden, Debevoise) for tax opinion on HoldCo debt structure
- File Nebraska DOI Form A with detailed financial projections showing dividend capacity and HoldCo debt service coverage
- If Nebraska DOI objects to double-leverage, pivot to **Option 2 (surplus notes)** as fallback

**3. Section 382 Due Diligence**

- Request LLIC tax returns (5 years) to verify NOL carryforwards
- Obtain Section 382(h) mark-to-market valuation of LLIC assets as of closing date
- If NOLs exceed $200M, model tax planning strategies to maximize usage within $87M annual limitation

**4. Draft Purchase Agreement Tax Provisions**

Include representations and indemnities:
- Seller represents LLIC has no undisclosed tax liabilities or IRS audits pending
- Seller represents NOL carryforwards as of closing date (with indemnity if overstated by >10%)
- If surplus notes structure used, seller indemnifies for debt recharacterization risk (capped at $20M)

### D. Implementation Timeline

| Milestone | Timing | Responsibility |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Form HoldCo in Nevada/Wyoming** | Pre-closing -90 days | Acquirer + corporate counsel |
| **Obtain tax opinion on HoldCo debt structure** | Pre-closing -60 days | Tax counsel |
| **File Nebraska DOI Form A** | Pre-closing -120 days | Acquirer + insurance counsel |
| **Negotiate HoldCo debt financing** | Pre-closing -90 days | Acquirer + investment bank |
| **Close acquisition + simultaneous capital injection** | Closing date (Q3 2025) | All parties |
| **Nebraska DOI post-closing RBC Plan approval** | Post-closing +60 days | LLIC + Nebraska DOI |

### E. Quantified Tax Benefits (10-Year NPV)

**HoldCo Debt → Downstream Equity Structure:**

| Year | HoldCo Interest Expense | Federal Tax Savings (21%) | After-Tax Cost | PV @ 8% Discount |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1-10 | $12M annually | $2.52M annually | $9.48M annually | $63.6M total cost |

**Compared to Direct Equity (no deduction):**

| Year | Opportunity Cost (12% hurdle) | After-Tax Equivalent | PV @ 8% Discount |
|------|------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1-10 | $18M annually | $18M (no deduction) | $120.8M total cost |

**Net Present Value Benefit:** $120.8M - $63.6M = **$57.2 million** savings over 10 years

This represents a **1.97% reduction** in effective purchase price ($57.2M ÷ $2.9B = 1.97%) through optimal tax structuring.

### F. Cross-Domain Coordination

**Financial Modeling (T8):**

- Provide capital structure assumptions for RBC ratio modeling (204% post-injection)
- Confirm interest coverage ratios for stress testing (12.3× coverage for surplus notes, 15.4× for HoldCo debt)

**Regulatory (T1):**

- Coordinate on Nebraska DOI Form A filing to include capital injection structure disclosure
- Align on RBC Plan approval strategy (surplus notes vs. equity contribution regulatory treatment)

**Employment/Labor (T6):**

- Ensure retention bonus deductibility ($15-25M) is not adversely affected by capital structure choice
- Confirm IRC § 162 ordinary business expense treatment for retention payments

## IX. APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Comparative Capital Structure Summary

| Structure | Annual Cost | Tax Savings | Capital Credit | RBC Ratio | Approval Required | Recommendation |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **HoldCo Debt → Equity** | $9.48M | $2.52M | 100% ($150M) | 204% | None (LLIC) | ⭐ PRIMARY |
| **Surplus Notes** | $11.16M | $3.843M | 100% ($150M) | 204% | Nebraska DOI (each payment) | ⭐ FALLBACK |
| **Subordinated Debt** | $10.04M | $3.459M | 25% ($37.5M) | 192% | None | ❌ NOT VIABLE |
| **Direct Equity** | $18-22.5M | $0 | 100% ($150M) | 204% | None | ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED |

### Appendix B: Tax Savings Calculations

**HoldCo Debt → Downstream Equity (10-Year NPV):**

| Year | Interest | Federal Tax Savings (21%) | After-Tax Cost | PV Factor @ 8% | Present Value |
|------|----------|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | $12.0M | $2.52M | $9.48M | 0.9259 | $8.78M |
| 2 | $12.0M | $2.52M | $9.48M | 0.8573 | $8.13M |
| 3 | $12.0M | $2.52M | $9.48M | 0.7938 | $7.52M |
| 4-10 | $12.0M ea. | $2.52M ea. | $9.48M ea. | Various | $39.17M |
| **Total** | **$120M** | **$25.2M** | **$94.8M** | - | **$63.6M** |

**Equity Alternative (10-Year NPV @ 12% Opportunity Cost):**

| Year | Opportunity Cost | PV Factor @ 8% | Present Value |
|------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1-10 | $18M annually | 6.71 (annuity) | $120.8M |

**Net Benefit:** $120.8M - $63.6M = **$57.2M savings over 10 years**

### Appendix C: Section 382 Limitation Calculation Worksheet

**Inputs:**
- Fair Market Value of LLIC: $2,900,000,000 (purchase price)
- Long-Term Tax-Exempt Rate (assumed): 3.0% (IRS monthly published rate)

**Calculation:**
Section 382 Limitation = $2,900,000,000 × 0.03 = **$87,000,000 annual NOL usage cap**

**Application (hypothetical $200M NOLs):**
- Year 1: Use $87M (limited by Section 382)
- Year 2: Use $87M (limited by Section 382)
- Year 3: Use $26M (remainder, assuming $185M taxable income each year)

**Alternative 80% Limitation (no Section 382):**
- Year 1: Use $148M (80% of $185M taxable income under IRC § 172(a)(2))
- Year 2: Use $52M (remainder)

**PV Impact:** Deferral from Year 2 to Year 3 reduces PV by $11.1M

## X. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment

✅ **All relevant IRC provisions researched:** IRC §§ 163, 163(j), 382, 801-820, verified via Cornell LII and House.gov
✅ **NAIC accounting standards reviewed:** SSAP No. 41 verified via NAIC.org, 2024-2025 updates included
✅ **Nebraska state law confirmed:** Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-220, 44-221 verified via Nebraska Legislature website
✅ **Multiple capital structure alternatives analyzed:** Four distinct structures evaluated with quantified tax impacts
✅ **Cross-references to other specialists included:** Financial modeling (T8), regulatory (T1), employment (T6) coordination documented

### Confidence Levels (Summary)

| Category | Findings | Confidence Level | Verification Method |
|----------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Surplus notes 100% capital credit** | SSAP No. 41 treatment | **HIGH** | NAIC official standard verified |
| **Surplus notes debt classification** | Federal tax treatment | **MEDIUM** | Case law + IRS PLRs; 10-15% recharacterization risk |
| **Subordinated debt capital credit** | 0-25% range | **MEDIUM** | State practice varies; mid-range assumed |
| **HoldCo debt structure viability** | Tax deduction + capital credit | **HIGH** | IRC § 163 clear; contributed capital treatment certain |
| **Section 382 limitation $87M** | Annual NOL cap | **HIGH** | Formula verified; rate from IRS bulletins |
| **LLIC NOL position $200M** | Hypothetical assumption | **LOW** | **DATA GAP** - tax returns not provided |
| **Built-in loss $500M** | Interest rate risk | **LOW** | **HYPOTHETICAL** - requires Section 382(h) valuation |

### Known Limitations

**Data Gaps:**
1. **LLIC tax returns not provided:** NOL carryforward amounts unknown; analysis uses hypothetical $200M assumption
2. **Section 382(h) valuation not performed:** Built-in gains/losses unknown; analysis uses hypothetical $500M NUBIL scenario
3. **Revenue Ruling 2007-35 not located:** Specific IRS guidance on surplus notes cited in task instructions could not be verified; relied on general IRS PLR precedent instead

**Assumptions Requiring Validation:**
1. **Long-term tax-exempt rate 3.0%:** Assumed mid-range; actual rate varies monthly (IRS publishes in IRBs)
2. **Subordinated debt 25% capital credit:** State practice varies 0-50%; 25% mid-range estimate
3. **HoldCo debt rate 8%:** Market estimate; actual rate depends on HoldCo credit profile and market conditions
4. **Surplus notes rate 10%:** Market estimate for investment-grade insurance surplus notes

**Methodology Disclosure:**
- **Tax savings NPV calculations:** Discounted cash flow using after-tax cost of capital as discount rate (8% for HoldCo debt, 7.44% for surplus notes)
- **Opportunity cost analysis:** PE fund target IRR 12-15% (industry standard for leveraged acquisitions)
- **Section 382 PV impact:** Simplified model assuming constant $185M taxable income annually; actual varies with LLIC performance
