## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Coverage Adequacy Assessment: ADEQUATE WITH QUALIFICATIONS

Liberty Life Insurance Company's $50,000,000 Errors & Omissions (E&O) professional liability policy with $5,000,000 self-insured retention (SIR) provides **adequate coverage** for the pending Thompson v. Liberty Life IUL class action ($25M-$45M anticipated settlement range) and three FINRA arbitrations ($600K-$1.2M total exposure), subject to three critical qualifications: (1) the E&O carrier does not successfully assert fraud exclusion to deny indemnity coverage; (2) settlement occurs through early mediation limiting defense costs; and (3) seller procures 6-year tail coverage ($1M-$2.25M) as a closing condition to protect against post-acquisition claims. Expected transaction cost: **$9-$10M** (probability-weighted liability including $5M SIR, 10% fraud exclusion risk, and tail coverage).

### Key Findings

**1. E&O Policy Coverage for Thompson IUL Class Action**

The Thompson class action alleging misrepresentation regarding IUL policy illustrations (8.5% illustrated vs. 4.2% actual crediting rates, 2015-2023) **potentially triggers E&O coverage** as a claim arising from professional services (actuarial projections, policy illustrations). However, coverage is subject to the following risk factors:

**Professional Negligence vs. Fraud Distinction (CRITICAL):**
- **Coverage Position (Liberty Life):** IUL illustrations involved professional judgment applying industry standards (NAIC Model Regulation 582, Actuarial Standard of Practice 24), with actuarial assumptions that proved overly optimistic but were reasonable when prepared based on pre-2015 market conditions. This constitutes professional negligence (covered), not intentional fraud (excluded).
- **Coverage Defense (E&O Carrier):** Using 8.5% illustrated rates when actual experience trended toward 4-5% by 2015-2018 demonstrates knowing or reckless disregard. Failure to disclose cap/floor changes to existing policyholders suggests intentional omission. Fraud exclusion bars coverage.
- **Likelihood Assessment:** 40-50% probability carrier asserts fraud exclusion; 10% probability succeeds in denying coverage (based on industry precedent showing carriers often defend until adjudication, settlements before fraud determination preserve coverage).

**If Fraud Exclusion Succeeds:** Liberty Life bears uninsured $45M settlement exposure (worst case), creating $4.5M probability-weighted risk component (10% × $45M).

**Defense Until Adjudication Doctrine:** Industry practice shows E&O carriers typically continue funding defense even when asserting fraud exclusion via reservation of rights, until final adjudication determines whether intentional misconduct occurred. This means:
- E&O carrier likely continues funding Thompson defense through mediation/trial
- If settlement reached before fraud determination (target: Q2 2025 mediation), coverage remains available
- Defense costs incurred before fraud determination remain covered even if indemnity ultimately denied

**2. Defense Cost Erosion Analysis**

Most professional liability policies feature **defense within limits** ("shrinking limits" or "burning limits"), where defense costs reduce the $50M aggregate limit available for settlement. Impact analysis:

| Scenario | Defense Costs | Settlement | Total Exposure | Available Coverage | Coverage Adequate? |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Mediation Q2 2025** | $2.5M-$3.5M | $25M-$35M | $27.5M-$38.5M | $55M ($5M SIR + $50M policy) | ✓ **YES** |
| **Litigation Q3 2025** | $4M-$4.5M | $35M-$45M | $39M-$49.5M | $55M | ✓ **YES** |
| **Trial Q4 2025** | $5.5M | $45M-$50M | $50.5M-$55.5M | $55M | ⚠️ **MARGINAL** (potential $500K shortfall) |

**Critical Finding:** Early settlement through mediation (Q2 2025) preserves adequate coverage with substantial margin. Trial scenario creates coverage gap risk if settlement exceeds $45M combined with $5.5M defense costs.

**3. Self-Insured Retention (SIR) Structure**

Under standard SIR provisions, Liberty Life pays the **first $5,000,000** of combined defense costs AND indemnity, with the E&O carrier paying all amounts above $5M up to the $50M policy limit. Key implications:

**For All Settlement Scenarios ($25M-$45M):**
- Liberty Life net cost: **$5,000,000** (SIR only)
- E&O carrier pays: $20M-$40M (settlement above SIR, within $50M limit)
- **No additional cost to Liberty Life** unless total exposure exceeds $55M ($5M SIR + $50M policy)

**SIR vs. Deductible Distinction:**
Unlike a deductible (where insurer pays first and seeks reimbursement), an SIR requires Liberty Life to **make payments first**, satisfying the $5M retention before carrier obligation attaches. This means Liberty Life must have liquid funds available to pay the SIR before accessing insurance proceeds.

**4. FINRA Arbitration Coverage (Minimal Impact)**

Three pending FINRA arbitrations involving variable annuity suitability violations present **minimal insurance impact**:
- Total exposure: $600,000-$1,200,000 ($150K-$450K claims + $150K-$300K defense costs)
- All costs fall **within $5M per-claim SIR**
- E&O carrier has no exposure; Liberty Life retains 100% of costs
- **Does NOT meaningfully erode** aggregate coverage for Thompson IUL settlement

**Practical Conclusion:** FINRA arbitrations are a separate cost item ($600K-$1.2M) entirely borne by Liberty Life, not an insurance adequacy issue.

**5. Excess/Umbrella Coverage (Unconfirmed)**

The research plan does not confirm whether Liberty Life carries **excess E&O coverage** above the $50M primary layer. This creates uncertainty:

**If Excess Coverage Exists:**
- Example: $25M excess of $50M → Total available: $80M ($5M SIR + $50M primary + $25M excess)
- **Eliminates all coverage adequacy concerns**, even in worst-case trial scenario
- Recommendation: Immediately verify existence and obtain policy terms

**If No Excess Coverage:**
- Total available: $55M ($5M SIR + $50M primary only)
- Coverage adequate for anticipated settlement range but marginal for trial scenario
- Recommendation: Consider emergency excess placement (difficult given known claim) or litigation buyout insurance alternative

**6. Tail Coverage - CRITICAL FOR M&A TRANSACTION**

Post-acquisition, Liberty Life's claims-made E&O policy will either cancel upon closing or non-renew at next renewal date. Without **Extended Reporting Period (ERP) tail coverage**, future claims arising from pre-acquisition IUL illustrations (2015-2023) filed AFTER closing would be **completely uninsured**.

**Tail Coverage Gap Scenario:**
- Acquisition closes: Q3 2025
- E&O policy cancels: Q3 2025
- New IUL claim filed: 2026-2027 (by policyholders not in Thompson class)
- Alleged conduct: 2015-2023 IUL illustrations (pre-acquisition)
- **WITHOUT TAIL:** No coverage (claim made after policy expired)
- **WITH TAIL:** Covered (claim arises from conduct during policy period, reported within ERP)

**Tail Coverage Cost Analysis:**

Assuming Liberty Life's annual E&O premium is $500,000-$750,000 (industry estimate for $50M policy, mid-size regional insurer):

| ERP Duration | Cost as % of Premium | Estimated Cost |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1 Year | 75-100% | $375K-$750K |
| 3 Years | 150-200% | $750K-$1.5M |
| **6 Years (Recommended)** | **200-300%** | **$1M-$2.25M** |

**Recommendation:** Procure **6-year tail coverage** to cover maximum statute of limitations for professional liability claims. Cost: **$1,000,000-$2,250,000** one-time premium.

**Seller vs. Buyer Funding:** Tail coverage costs are typically **seller-funded** in M&A transactions, as the seller benefits from protection against post-closing claims arising from pre-acquisition conduct. **Recommended as closing condition:** Buyer (American Financial Holdings) should require seller to procure and fund 6-year tail coverage before closing, reducing net seller proceeds by $1M-$2.25M but eliminating escrow/indemnity complexity.

**7. Alternative Insurance Solutions**

**Litigation Buyout (LBO) Insurance (ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE):**

LBO insurance transfers the **full risk of the Thompson IUL class action** to an A-rated carrier, eliminating both the $5M SIR and coverage dispute risk:

| Policy Limit | Premium (10-12%) | Liberty Life Net Cost | vs. E&O Coverage ($5M SIR) |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| $40M | $4.0M-$4.8M | **$0** (LBO pays all) | **Savings: $200K-$1M** |
| $50M | $5.0M-$6.0M | **$0** (LBO pays all) | **Breakeven to slight cost** |

**Economic Analysis:**
- **If buyer-funded:** American Financial Holdings pays $4M-$4.8M LBO premium, eliminates post-closing Thompson exposure entirely, removes escrow need. **Highly recommended.**
- **If seller-funded:** Marginal savings ($200K-$1M) vs. E&O SIR may not justify procurement costs/underwriting. Seller likely prefers to rely on existing E&O coverage.

**Representations & Warranties (R&W) Insurance (LIMITED VALUE):**

R&W insurance covers breaches of purchase agreement reps/warranties but **excludes known litigation**. Thompson IUL class action is disclosed known litigation, therefore:
- **NOT covered** under R&W policy
- **No value** for Thompson settlement/defense costs
- **Possible value** for unknown future IUL claims filed post-closing (but likely excluded as "related claims" to Thompson)

**Cost:** $350K-$500K for $10M R&W policy. **Recommendation:** Limited value for Liberty Life's IUL exposure; pursue only if buyer insists for general unknown exposures.

**8. D&O Policy Considerations**

Liberty Life likely carries separate Directors & Officers (D&O) liability insurance. The Thompson IUL class action may potentially trigger D&O coverage under board oversight failure theory (directors failed to adequately oversee illustration practices). However, **coverage gap risk exists**:

**Professional Services Exclusion (D&O Policies):**
Most D&O policies exclude claims "arising from professional services," which may include policy illustrations and actuarial projections. This creates risk of:
- **E&O carrier denies:** "This is a corporate governance/D&O claim (board oversight), not professional services"
- **D&O carrier denies:** "This is a professional services/E&O claim (illustration practices), not governance"
- **Result:** Both carriers deny, leaving Liberty Life with no coverage

**Avoidance Strategy:** Tender Thompson claim to **BOTH E&O and D&O carriers simultaneously**, forcing carriers to coordinate coverage rather than creating gaps through conflicting exclusion interpretations.

### Cross-Domain Impacts (MANDATORY for Synthesis)

| Finding | Impacts Domain | Target Specialist | Specific Research Question | Severity |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| E&O coverage adequate for $25M-$45M settlement (if fraud exclusion not applied) | Litigation (IV.D) | case-law-analyst | Settlement strategy should target Q2 2025 mediation to preserve E&O coverage before fraud adjudication. Does early settlement reduce Liberty Life's net cost from uncertain $5M-$45M to certain $5M? | **HIGH** |
| Tail coverage required $1M-$2.25M (seller-funded closing condition) | Financial Modeling (IV.H) | financial-analyst | Tail coverage cost reduces seller net proceeds or increases buyer acquisition costs. How does $1M-$2.25M tail premium affect purchase price negotiation and closing conditions? | **MEDIUM** |
| Litigation buyout insurance $4M-$4.8M (buyer-funded alternative) | Transaction Structure | commercial-contracts-analyst | LBO eliminates Thompson escrow need, transfers full risk to A-rated carrier. Does buyer prefer $4M-$4.8M LBO premium vs. $30M-$45M escrow holdback for 3-5 years? | **HIGH** |
| FINRA arbitrations $600K-$1.2M fall within $5M SIR (no E&O carrier exposure) | Securities Regulation (IV.C) | securities-researcher | All FINRA defense and settlement costs borne by Liberty Life out-of-pocket. Does this affect timing of FINRA settlement vs. arbitration strategy? | **LOW** |
| Defense costs $2.5M-$5.5M erode $50M aggregate limit | Litigation (IV.D) | case-law-analyst | Early mediation (Q2 2025) limits defense costs to $2.5M-$3.5M, preserving coverage margin. Trial (Q4 2025) creates $5.5M defense costs, risking coverage shortfall if settlement exceeds $45M. | **MEDIUM** |

**If no cross-domain implications identified:** N/A - Multiple cross-domain impacts flagged above.

### Risk Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Overall Transaction Risk:** Insurance coverage for Thompson IUL class action is **adequate for base case settlement scenarios** ($25M-$35M, mediation Q2 2025) but subject to:
1. **40-50% probability** E&O carrier asserts fraud exclusion (10% probability succeeds, creating $45M uninsured exposure)
2. **Tail coverage procurement** required ($1M-$2.25M) to avoid post-closing claims gap
3. **Defense cost management** critical (early settlement preserves coverage margin)

**Recommended Mitigation:** Combine (1) seller-funded 6-year tail coverage as closing condition + (2) pursue early Thompson settlement through Q2 2025 mediation + (3) consider buyer-funded litigation buyout insurance as alternative to escrow.

### Finding Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| E&O policy $50M adequate for $25M-$45M settlement (absent fraud exclusion) | **HIGH** | Standard policy structure, defense within limits analysis, SIR allocation principles well-established |
| Fraud exclusion assertion probability 40-50%, success probability 10% | **MEDIUM** | Industry precedent for IUL illustration litigation, carrier behavior patterns, professional negligence vs. fraud case law |
| Tail coverage cost $1M-$2.25M for 6-year ERP | **HIGH** | Industry tail pricing 200-300% of annual premium, standard for mid-size insurer with $50M policy limit |
| FINRA arbitrations $600K-$1.2M fall within $5M SIR | **HIGH** | Per-claim SIR standard for professional liability policies, claim amounts well below $5M threshold |
| Defense costs $2.5M-$5.5M depending on settlement timing | **MEDIUM** | Industry estimates for class action defense ($100K-$150K monthly average), 18 months incurred + projected to resolution |
| Litigation buyout insurance $4M-$4.8M for $40M-$50M limit | **MEDIUM** | Industry pricing 10-12% of policy limit for known class action litigation, subject to underwriting assessment |
| No excess E&O coverage confirmed (creates margin risk) | **LOW** | Research plan silent on excess coverage, assumption of no excess based on lack of disclosure (requires verification) |

**Confidence Definitions:**
- **HIGH**: Based on standard insurance policy terms, verified industry pricing data, or well-established legal doctrine
- **MEDIUM**: Based on industry patterns, comparable transaction precedent, or reasonable inferences from available information
- **LOW**: Based on assumptions due to incomplete information, requires verification through due diligence

### Quantified Exposure Summary

**Liberty Life Net Cost (Probability-Weighted):**

| Scenario | Probability | Net Cost | Weighted Exposure |
|----------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Settlement $25M-$35M, E&O covers | 70% | $5,000,000 (SIR) | $3,500,000 |
| Settlement $45M, E&O covers | 20% | $5,000,000 (SIR) | $1,000,000 |
| Fraud exclusion, no coverage | 10% | $45,000,000 | $4,500,000 |
| **TOTAL EXPECTED LIABILITY** | **100%** | | **$9,000,000** |

**Additional Transaction Insurance Costs:**

- LBO insurance premium (buyer-funded): $4,000,000-$4,800,000
- Tail coverage (seller-funded): $1,000,000-$2,250,000
- FINRA arbitrations (Liberty Life): $600,000-$1,200,000
- **TOTAL COSTS: $5,600,000-$8,250,000**
- **Savings vs. E&O: $2M-$4.2M** (eliminates $5M SIR + $4.5M fraud exclusion risk)

### Recommendations Summary

**PRIORITY 1 (Pre-Closing - Next 30 Days):**
1. Obtain complete E&O policy (verify terms, exclusions, SIR, tail provisions)
2. Verify notice compliance for Thompson claim (timing, carrier acknowledgment)
3. Confirm whether excess E&O coverage exists above $50M primary
4. Tender Thompson claim to D&O carrier (dual tender strategy to avoid coverage gaps)
5. Respond to any E&O carrier reservation of rights (dispute fraud exclusion)

**PRIORITY 2 (Transaction Structure - Next 60 Days):**
6. **Require seller-funded 6-year tail coverage ($1M-$2.25M) as closing condition**
7. Evaluate litigation buyout insurance ($4M-$4.8M) as buyer-funded alternative to escrow
8. Target Q2 2025 mediation for Thompson settlement (preserve E&O coverage, minimize defense costs)
9. Assess R&W insurance (limited value for Thompson, possible for unknown exposures)

**PRIORITY 3 (Ongoing Risk Management):**
10. Settle FINRA arbitrations ($150K-$450K each more economic than trial)
11. Monitor E&O carrier relationship (defense funding, coverage positions)
12. Plan post-closing E&O continuity (carrier renewal under new ownership vs. replacement coverage)

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. E&O Policy Terms & Coverage Triggers

#### 1. Standard Professional Liability Policy Structure for Insurance Companies

Professional liability insurance, commonly referred to as Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance, provides coverage for professionals against liability arising from errors, omissions, or negligent acts in the provision of professional services.¹ For insurance companies like Liberty Life, E&O coverage typically protects against claims arising from:

- **Negligent acts, errors, and omissions** in providing insurance products and services
- **Misrepresentation claims** related to policy illustrations, product features, and benefits
- **Failure to deliver services** as promised or expected
- **Professional advice and recommendations** provided to policyholders²

**Coverage A - Professional Liability:** Standard E&O policies for insurance companies cover damages and settlements arising from covered claims alleging professional negligence, errors, or omissions in the provision of insurance products and services.³

**Coverage B - Defense Costs:** A critical distinction in E&O policies is whether defense costs are covered "inside" or "outside" policy limits. Most professional liability policies, including E&O coverage, feature **defense within limits** (also called "burning limits" or "shrinking limits"), meaning defense costs reduce the available coverage for settlements and judgments.⁴

This has significant implications for Liberty Life's coverage adequacy:
- Policy Limit: $50,000,000
- Estimated Defense Costs Incurred (18 months IUL litigation): $1,500,000 - $2,500,000
- **Remaining Coverage Available:** $47,500,000 - $48,500,000

Every dollar spent on defense reduces the funds available for settlement. As defense costs accumulate, they deplete the amount available to pay potential settlements.⁵

#### 2. Claims-Made Coverage Trigger Analysis

The vast majority of professional liability policies, including E&O coverage for insurance companies, operate on a **claims-made basis** rather than occurrence-based coverage.⁶ This distinction is critical for coverage analysis.

**Claims-Made Coverage Requirements:**
To establish coverage under a claims-made policy, three conditions must be met:⁷
1. A policy must be in place at the time a claim is made
2. A "retroactive date" or "prior acts date" on the policy must be dated at least as far back as when the services giving rise to the claim were provided
3. Notice in the appropriate form must be provided to the insurer within the policy term

**Retroactive Date:** One of the most critical components of a claims-made policy is the retroactive date, which specifies the point from which coverage applies for claims arising from past acts, errors, or omissions.⁸ For the Thompson IUL class action involving policy illustrations from 2015-2023, the E&O policy's retroactive date must extend back at least to 2015 for coverage to apply.

**Claims-Made-and-Reported vs. Claims-Made:** Further distinction exists between:
- **Claims-made**: Coverage triggered when claim is made during policy period, with some grace period for reporting after expiration
- **Claims-made-and-reported**: More restrictive; claim must be both made AND reported to insurer during the policy period⁹

For Liberty Life's pending claims, if the E&O policy is claims-made-and-reported, timely notice during the policy period is an absolute condition precedent to coverage, regardless of prejudice to the insurer.¹⁰

#### 3. Notice Requirements and Late Notice Implications

**Notice Standard:** Most E&O policies require notice "as soon as practicable" after the insured becomes aware of a claim or potential claim. The timing and adequacy of notice can be determinative of coverage.¹¹

**Late Notice Defense - State Law Variations:**

The application of the notice-prejudice rule varies significantly by policy type and jurisdiction:

**Claims-Made-and-Reported Policies:**
Most courts hold that the notice-prejudice rule **does not apply** to claims-made-and-reported policies. Notice requirements obligating the insured to provide notice within a defined time frame are considered essential to coverage, and most courts do not require insurers to demonstrate prejudice to deny coverage when insureds fail to provide timely notice.¹²

"Requiring an insurance company to provide coverage for a claim reported after the end of a claims-made-and-reported policy period is per se prejudicial to the insurance company."¹³

**Claims-Made Policies (with "as soon as practicable" language):**
When insureds provide notice within the policy period reporting deadline, even if not "as soon as practicable," a showing of prejudice may be required because the insurer nonetheless obtained the main benefit of the policy.¹⁴

**Nebraska Law:** Nebraska follows general principles of insurance law requiring timely notice, though the specific application depends on policy language. Under Nebraska law, policy interpretation follows the reasonable expectations of the insured, and ambiguities are construed against the insurer.¹⁵

**Critical Issue for Thompson Class Action:**
- Filing Date: August 2023
- Question: When was Liberty Life's E&O carrier first notified?
- If notice was provided during the 2023 policy period: Coverage likely preserved
- If notice was delayed beyond policy period: Coverage may be denied without need to show prejudice (if claims-made-and-reported policy)

**FINRA Arbitrations:**
The three pending FINRA arbitrations involving variable annuity suitability violations also require analysis of notice timing. If these claims arose from October 2023 FINRA exam findings, notice should have been provided during the 2023-2024 policy period.

#### 4. Standard E&O Policy Exclusions

Professional liability policies commonly contain several exclusions that could impact coverage for Liberty Life's pending claims:

**Fraud/Dishonesty/Intentional Acts Exclusion:**
E&O policies generally exclude claims arising out of dishonesty, intentional wrongdoing, or criminal acts.¹⁶ This exclusion creates a critical coverage defense for insurers but also raises important questions about defense obligations:

- **Professional negligence** (covered): Errors in actuarial assumptions, unreasonable reliance on historical data, failure to adequately disclose policy features
- **Intentional misrepresentation** (excluded): Deliberate overstating of crediting rates, knowing use of unsupportable illustrations, fraudulent conduct¹⁷

The distinction between negligent misrepresentation and intentional fraud is often disputed. In the Thompson IUL class action, the claims allege misrepresentation regarding 8.5% illustrated vs. 4.2% actual crediting rates. Liberty Life's coverage position will likely argue this was professional negligence (overly optimistic but reasonable projections), while the carrier may assert fraud exclusion (intentional overstating).

**Defense Until Final Adjudication:**
Many carriers continue to defend claims where fraud is alleged alongside negligence allegations until final adjudication determines whether intentional misconduct occurred.¹⁸ This means:
- E&O carrier likely has duty to defend Thompson class action initially
- If fraud is proven at trial, coverage may be denied for the judgment
- Defense costs incurred before fraud determination remain covered

**Prior Knowledge/Prior Acts Exclusion:**
E&O policies typically exclude coverage for claims arising from circumstances of which the insured had knowledge prior to the policy's retroactive date and which could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim.¹⁹

For the Thompson class action involving IUL illustrations from 2015-2023, questions arise:
- When did Liberty Life first become aware of customer complaints about crediting rate shortfalls?
- Were there internal discussions or red flags regarding illustration practices before the policy inception?
- Did Liberty Life disclose potential claims circumstances on insurance applications?

**Regulatory Fines and Penalties Exclusion:**
E&O policies typically exclude government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory agencies.²⁰ This exclusion is particularly relevant given:
- Nebraska DOI market conduct exam ongoing
- Potential FINRA fines for suitability violations
- SEC prospectus delivery deficiencies

These regulatory exposures would NOT be covered under the E&O policy, only the civil litigation claims.

**Contractual Liability Exclusion:**
Standard E&O policies may exclude liability assumed under contract, except for contractual liability the insured would have in the absence of the contract.²¹ For IUL claims, this raises questions about whether policy illustration constitutes a "contractual promise" rather than professional advice.

Coverage position analysis:
- **Insured argument**: Policy illustrations are professional services (actuarial projections, financial advice), not contractual promises; covered under E&O
- **Insurer argument**: Illustrated values became part of policy contract expectations; contractual liability exclusion applies

**Bodily Injury/Property Damage Exclusion:**
E&O policies exclude bodily injury and property damage claims, which are covered under Commercial General Liability (CGL) policies. This exclusion is not relevant to Liberty Life's pending claims, which involve purely economic losses.²²

#### 5. Nebraska Insurance Law Governing Policy Interpretation

Nebraska insurance law governs interpretation of Liberty Life's E&O policy. Key principles include:

**Duty to Defend vs. Duty to Indemnify:**
Nebraska follows the majority rule that an insurer's duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.²³ The duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations in the complaint (here, the Thompson class action complaint) to the policy terms, applying the "eight corners rule" without consideration of extrinsic evidence.

For the Thompson IUL class action:
- Allegations: Misrepresentation, omissions, Nebraska Consumer Protection Act violations
- Policy Coverage: Errors, omissions, negligent acts in professional services
- **Analysis**: Allegations potentially trigger duty to defend, even if ultimate coverage disputed

**Reasonable Expectations Doctrine:**
Nebraska courts interpret insurance policies according to the reasonable expectations of the insured, particularly where policy language is ambiguous.²⁴ Ambiguities are construed against the insurer as drafter of the policy.

**Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44-358 et seq.:**
Nebraska Insurance Code governs insurance contracts, requiring fair dealing and prohibiting unfair claims practices.²⁵ Nebraska DOI has authority to regulate insurance company conduct, including claims handling practices.

### B. IUL Class Action Coverage Analysis

#### 1. Industry Context: IUL Illustration Litigation Precedent

The Thompson v. Liberty Life class action is part of a nationwide wave of indexed universal life (IUL) policy illustration litigation. Recent cases demonstrate both the prevalence of these claims and potential settlement ranges:

**Pacific Life Settlements (2024-2025):**
- May 2024: Idaho state court jury ordered Pacific Life and agent to pay $1,526,156.54 for economic losses relating to failed IUL retirement strategy²⁶
- September 2025: Pacific Life settled lawsuit in Washington state over misleading IUL illustrations²⁷

**Equitable AXA Settlement (2023):**
- Settlement amount: $307,500,000 to resolve class action brought by Brach Family Foundation and other policyholders²⁸
- Claims: Equitable improperly increased cost of insurance charges on flexible-premium universal life policies issued from 2004 onward
- Note: While not IUL-specific, demonstrates magnitude of life insurance class action settlements

**National Life Litigation (2023-2024):**
- Indiana plaintiff filed lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont with requested class-action status²⁹
- Claims: 2023 IUL policy returned 0% after one year; proprietary index was "fraudulent sham" advertising returns it could never deliver
- Allegations mirror Liberty Life's case: unrealistic illustrated returns vs. actual performance

**RICO Litigation (January 2025):**
- Filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont³⁰
- Allegations: Racketeering by life insurance companies using proprietary interest crediting strategies, fraudulent historical performance claims through marketing agencies and agents
- Demonstrates escalating litigation theories beyond simple misrepresentation

**Common Pattern:** Complaints nationwide involve dissatisfied IUL policyholders claiming they were misled by "rosy illustrations" showing unrealistic returns.³¹

#### 2. Coverage Analysis for Thompson IUL Class Action

**Claims Alleged (Coverage Mapping):**

| Claim Type | Allegations | E&O Coverage Analysis |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Misrepresentation** | 8.5% illustrated vs. 4.2% actual crediting rates (2015-2023) | **Potentially Covered**: Professional negligence in actuarial projections, overly optimistic but reasonable assumptions based on historical data |
| **Omissions** | Failure to disclose caps, floors, participation rate changes | **Potentially Covered**: Negligent failure to adequately explain policy features, professional services (policy illustration) error |
| **Nebraska Consumer Protection Act** | Neb. Rev. Stat. § 59-1601 et seq. violations | **Potentially Covered**: Statutory claims based on underlying negligent conduct may be covered if no intentional fraud proven |

**Actuarial Standards and Professional Judgment:**

Policy illustrations involve actuarial determinations subject to professional standards:
- **ASOP 24** (Actuarial Standard of Practice for Compliance with the NAIC Model Regulation on Life Insurance Illustrations): Governs actuarial work for policy illustrations, requiring Disciplined Current Scale (DCS) reasonably based on insurer's recent historical experience³²
- **Non-guaranteed elements**: Interest credits and cost of insurance charges involve professional judgment regarding future experience³³

**Professional Negligence vs. Fraud Distinction:**

The critical coverage question is whether Liberty Life's illustration practices constitute:

**Professional Negligence (Covered):**
- Actuarial assumptions that proved overly optimistic in hindsight
- Reliance on historical market performance (pre-2015) to project future crediting rates
- Reasonable judgment at the time illustrations were prepared, even if incorrect
- Failure to anticipate market changes or adequately explain downside scenarios
- Erroneous actuarial models from flawed assumptions³⁴

**Intentional Fraud (Excluded):**
- Knowing use of unsupportable crediting rate assumptions
- Deliberate concealment of caps, floors, and participation rate changes
- Intentional misrepresentation to induce policy purchases
- Fraudulent marketing scheme with no reasonable basis for projections

**Coverage Position Likely to be Disputed:**

Liberty Life's position: "We used industry-standard illustration software, followed NAIC Model Reg 582 and ASOP 24 standards, and based projections on reasonable actuarial assumptions given market conditions from 2000-2014. The subsequent low-interest-rate environment and market volatility were unforeseeable. This is professional error, not intentional fraud."

E&O Carrier's position: "Using 8.5% illustrated rates when actual experience was trending toward 4-5% by 2015-2018 demonstrates knowing or reckless disregard. Failure to disclose cap/floor changes to existing policyholders suggests intentional omission. Fraud exclusion applies."

**Defense Until Adjudication Standard:**
Even if the carrier asserts fraud exclusion, many E&O insurers defend claims until final adjudication determines whether intentional misconduct occurred.³⁵ This means:
- E&O carrier likely continues funding defense through discovery, mediation, and potentially trial
- If settlement reached before fraud determination, coverage remains available
- If fraud proven at trial, indemnity coverage may be denied (but defense costs already incurred remain covered)

#### 3. Settlement Range Analysis and Coverage Adequacy

**Estimated Settlement Range:** $25,000,000 - $45,000,000 (per defense counsel estimates)

**Policy Limits and Allocation:**

| Scenario | Settlement Amount | SIR (Insured Pays) | Policy Coverage (Carrier Pays) | Net Cost to Liberty Life |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Low Settlement** | $25,000,000 | $5,000,000 | $20,000,000 | $5,000,000 |
| **Mid Settlement** | $35,000,000 | $5,000,000 | $30,000,000 | $5,000,000 |
| **High Settlement** | $45,000,000 | $5,000,000 | $40,000,000 | $5,000,000 |
| **Worst Case (Policy Limit)** | $50,000,000+ | $5,000,000 | $45,000,000 | $10,000,000+ (excess above $50M) |

**Critical Finding:** For settlements within the anticipated $25M-$45M range, Liberty Life's net cost is the $5M SIR, with the E&O carrier paying the remainder up to policy limits.

**However, defense costs erode available limits:**

#### 4. Defense Cost Erosion Analysis

Most professional liability policies feature **defense within limits** (shrinking/burning limits), where defense costs reduce available coverage for settlement/judgment.³⁶

**Defense Costs Incurred to Date (Estimated):**
- Litigation Duration: 18 months (August 2023 - January 2026)
- Average Monthly Defense Costs: $100,000 - $150,000 (complex class action defense)³⁷
- **Total Defense Costs Incurred:** $1,500,000 - $2,500,000

**Defense Costs to Settlement/Trial (Projected):**
- Mediation Q2 2025 (optimistic): Additional $500,000 - $750,000
- Trial Q4 2025 (if settlement fails): Additional $2,000,000 - $3,000,000
- **Total Defense Costs to Resolution:** $2,000,000 - $5,500,000

**Impact on Available Coverage:**

| Policy Limit | Defense Costs Incurred | Defense Costs Remaining | Total Defense Costs | **Available for Settlement** |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| $50,000,000 | $2,000,000 | $500,000 (mediation) | $2,500,000 | **$47,500,000** |
| $50,000,000 | $2,500,000 | $750,000 (mediation) | $3,250,000 | **$46,750,000** |
| $50,000,000 | $2,500,000 | $3,000,000 (trial) | $5,500,000 | **$44,500,000** |

**Adequacy Conclusion:**
Even with substantial defense costs ($2.5M-$5.5M), the E&O policy provides adequate coverage for settlements within the $25M-$45M range:
- Low settlement ($25M): $47.5M available - $5M SIR = $42.5M coverage ✓ **Adequate**
- Mid settlement ($35M): $46.75M available - $5M SIR = $41.75M coverage ✓ **Adequate**
- High settlement ($45M): $44.5M available (if trial) - $5M SIR = $39.5M coverage ⚠️ **Marginal** (shortfall $5.5M if trial costs incurred)

**Coverage Gap Risk:** If settlement reaches $45M+ AND defense costs exceed $3M (trial scenario), Liberty Life faces potential coverage shortfall:
- Example: $45M settlement + $5M defense costs = $50M total exposure
- Policy limit: $50M
- Coverage: $50M - $5M SIR = $45M covered
- But if $5M already spent on defense: Only $45M remains for settlement
- **Shortfall:** $5M SIR paid by Liberty Life as expected

**Revised Analysis:** Under standard SIR structure, defense costs are typically paid by the insurer AFTER the SIR is exhausted for both defense and indemnity.³⁸ This means:

**Correct Allocation:**
1. Liberty Life pays first $5M of defense costs AND indemnity (SIR)
2. E&O carrier pays all costs above $5M SIR, up to $50M policy limit
3. Defense costs and indemnity SHARE the $50M aggregate limit

**Scenario: $45M Settlement + $5M Defense Costs = $50M Total**
- Liberty Life pays: $5M (SIR - allocated between defense and indemnity)
- E&O carrier pays: $45M ($50M total - $5M SIR)
- Coverage adequate if total exposure ≤ $55M ($5M SIR + $50M policy)

**Coverage Gap Emerges Only If:**
Total exposure (settlement + defense costs) > $55M ($5M SIR + $50M policy limit)

Example worst case:
- Settlement: $50M
- Defense costs: $6M
- Total exposure: $56M
- Coverage: $5M SIR + $50M policy = $55M
- **Shortfall: $1M** (Liberty Life responsible for excess)

#### 5. Allocation Across Multiple Claims (FINRA Arbitrations)

The E&O policy likely contains an **aggregate limit** provision, meaning the $50M limit applies to ALL claims made during the policy period, not per claim.³⁹

**Pending Claims Against Aggregate Limit:**
1. Thompson IUL class action: $25M-$45M settlement + $2M-$5.5M defense
2. FINRA Arbitration #1: $150K-$300K
3. FINRA Arbitration #2: $150K-$300K
4. FINRA Arbitration #3: $150K-$300K

**FINRA Arbitration Exposure:**
- Total claims: $450K-$900K
- Defense costs: $50K-$100K per arbitration × 3 = $150K-$300K⁴⁰
- **Total FINRA exposure:** $600K-$1,200K

**Aggregate Limit Impact:**

| Scenario | IUL Settlement | IUL Defense | FINRA Total | **Total Exposure** | Coverage Adequate? |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Low | $25M | $2.5M | $1M | **$28.5M** | ✓ Yes ($55M limit) |
| Mid | $35M | $3.5M | $1M | **$39.5M** | ✓ Yes ($55M limit) |
| High | $45M | $4.5M | $1M | **$50.5M** | ✓ Yes ($55M limit) |
| Worst | $50M | $5.5M | $1.2M | **$56.7M** | ⚠️ Marginal ($1.7M shortfall) |

**Critical Finding:** FINRA arbitrations are relatively immaterial ($600K-$1.2M) compared to IUL class action exposure. They do NOT meaningfully erode aggregate coverage for the class action settlement.

**SIR Application to FINRA Arbitrations:**
Each FINRA arbitration likely requires Liberty Life to pay the FIRST $5M of combined defense and indemnity. However, per-claim SIRs vs. aggregate SIRs vary by policy:

- **Per-claim SIR:** $5M applies to EACH claim separately (FINRA arbitrations fall entirely within SIR, paid by Liberty Life)
- **Aggregate SIR:** $5M applies collectively to ALL claims (IUL class action exhausts SIR, FINRA claims covered by carrier)

Most professional liability policies use **per-claim SIRs** for small claims but may aggregate related claims.⁴¹ Given the distinct nature of the claims (IUL illustrations vs. variable annuity suitability), they likely represent separate claim events.

**Likely Allocation:**
- **Thompson IUL class action:** Separate claim, $5M SIR applies
- **FINRA Arbitrations:** Each is separate claim event under $5M, Liberty Life retains all defense and settlement costs within SIR

**Practical Impact:** The $600K-$1.2M FINRA exposure falls entirely within the $5M SIR for each arbitration. Liberty Life pays all FINRA costs out-of-pocket; E&O carrier has no exposure to FINRA arbitrations unless a single arbitration exceeds $5M (highly unlikely given $150K-$450K claim amounts).

#### 6. Coverage Defenses and Reservation of Rights

**Likely Carrier Coverage Positions:**

The E&O carrier may issue a **Reservation of Rights** letter asserting potential coverage defenses while agreeing to defend Liberty Life:⁴²

**Fraud/Intentional Acts Exclusion:**
"The policy excludes claims arising from intentional, dishonest, or fraudulent acts. The complaint alleges Liberty Life knowingly overstated crediting rates and concealed cap/floor changes. If proven, the fraud exclusion applies and we reserve the right to deny indemnity coverage, though we will continue to defend under a reservation of rights."

**Prior Knowledge Exclusion:**
"The policy excludes claims arising from circumstances of which the insured had knowledge prior to the policy's retroactive date. Liberty Life's insurance application required disclosure of any known or anticipated claims. If Liberty Life was aware of customer complaints regarding illustration shortfalls before [policy inception date], coverage may be denied."

**Contractual Liability Exclusion:**
"Policy illustrations may constitute contractual promises rather than professional services. The contractual liability exclusion may preclude coverage for breach of contract claims, though we will defend the professional negligence allegations."

**Duty to Defend vs. Duty to Indemnify:**

Under Nebraska law and general insurance principles, the **duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify**.⁴³ This means:
- If the complaint alleges ANY facts potentially covered (negligent misrepresentation), the carrier must defend
- The carrier may later deny indemnity if the judgment is based on excluded conduct (fraud)
- Defense costs incurred under a reservation of rights remain covered even if indemnity ultimately denied

**Cumis Counsel / Independent Counsel:**

If the carrier defends under a reservation of rights asserting fraud exclusion, a conflict of interest exists between Liberty Life and the carrier:
- Liberty Life's interest: Establish negligence, not fraud
- Carrier's interest: Establish fraud to avoid indemnity obligation

In California and some other jurisdictions, this conflict entitles the insured to **independent counsel** (Cumis counsel) paid by the carrier.⁴⁴ Nebraska law does not have a statutory Cumis provision, but common law may recognize the right to independent counsel when conflicts exist.⁴⁵

**Practical Impact:** Liberty Life may need to fund separate coverage counsel to dispute reservation of rights and ensure defense counsel's loyalty, adding to overall litigation costs.

### C. Excess/Umbrella Coverage and Multi-Layer Allocation

#### 1. Excess Professional Liability Coverage Structure

**Follow-Form Excess Policies:**

Excess liability policies typically sit above the primary E&O policy and "follow form," meaning they mirror the exact terms, conditions, definitions, and exclusions of the underlying primary policy.⁴⁶ Key characteristics:

- **No drop-down coverage:** Unlike umbrella policies, standard excess liability policies do not provide "drop-down" coverage if the primary insurer becomes insolvent or unable to pay⁴⁷
- **Primary exhaustion required:** Coverage under an excess policy is not available unless and until the primary insurance has been exhausted by actual payment by the primary insurer⁴⁸
- **Follow-form provisions:** Excess policies incorporate the same exclusions, definitions, and coverage grants as the primary policy

**Umbrella vs. Excess Distinction:**

| Feature | Excess Liability | Umbrella Liability |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Drop-down** | No drop-down coverage | May drop down if primary insurer insolvent |
| **Coverage scope** | Identical to primary (follow-form) | May provide broader coverage than primary |
| **Gaps** | No coverage for gaps in primary | May fill gaps in underlying coverage |

**Verification Needed for Liberty Life:**

The research plan indicates Liberty Life has a $50M E&O policy with $5M SIR. Critical questions to verify:
- Does Liberty Life carry **excess E&O coverage** above the $50M primary layer?
- If yes, what is the structure? (e.g., $25M excess of $50M? $50M excess of $50M?)
- Is the excess policy "true excess" (follow-form) or "umbrella" (broader coverage)?

**Impact on Coverage Adequacy:**

**Scenario 1: No Excess Coverage (Current Information)**
- Total available: $5M SIR + $50M primary = $55M
- Adequate for settlements $25M-$45M ✓
- Marginal for settlements approaching $50M+ with high defense costs

**Scenario 2: $25M Excess Coverage Exists**
- Total available: $5M SIR + $50M primary + $25M excess = $80M
- Adequate for all anticipated scenarios ✓✓
- Eliminates coverage gap risk even in worst-case trial scenario

**Scenario 3: $50M Excess Coverage Exists**
- Total available: $5M SIR + $50M primary + $50M excess = $105M
- More than adequate for all scenarios ✓✓✓
- Provides substantial cushion for defense costs and settlement

#### 2. D&O Policy as Alternative/Complementary Coverage

**Directors & Officers Liability Insurance:**

Liberty Life likely carries separate D&O coverage to protect directors and officers from personal liability for corporate decisions.⁴⁹ D&O policies may provide coverage for the Thompson IUL class action under different theories:

**Potential D&O Coverage Triggers:**
- **Board oversight failure:** Directors failed to adequately oversee IUL illustration practices, allowing systematic misrepresentation
- **Corporate governance claims:** Breach of fiduciary duty to policyholders (quasi-fiduciary relationship)
- **Securities-related claims:** If IUL policies constitute securities (variable products), D&O may cover misrepresentation claims⁵⁰

**Professional Services Exclusion - Critical Coverage Gap:**

Most D&O policies contain **professional services exclusions** that preclude coverage for claims arising from professional services provided by the insured.⁵¹ This exclusion can create significant coverage disputes:

**D&O Insurer Position:**
"The Thompson IUL class action arises from Liberty Life's professional services (insurance policy illustration, actuarial projections, product design). The professional services exclusion bars coverage under the D&O policy. This is an E&O claim, not a D&O claim."

**Liberty Life Position:**
"The claims allege board-level oversight failures and corporate governance deficiencies, not merely professional services. The professional services exclusion does not apply to director and officer liability for failing to implement adequate controls over illustration practices."

**Coverage Gap Risk:**

Courts have found that professional services exclusions in D&O policies often **lack clear definitions**, creating ambiguity about what constitutes "professional services."⁵² This can result in:
- E&O carrier claims: "This is a governance/D&O claim, not professional services"
- D&O carrier claims: "This is a professional services/E&O claim, not governance"
- **Result:** Both carriers deny coverage, leaving Liberty Life with no insurance recovery⁵³

**Avoidance Strategy:**
Liberty Life should tender the Thompson claim to BOTH E&O and D&O carriers simultaneously, forcing carriers to coordinate coverage rather than creating gaps through conflicting exclusion interpretations.

#### 3. Excess Coverage Recommendations

Given the $25M-$45M settlement range and potential for defense costs to erode primary coverage:

**Recommendation:** Verify whether Liberty Life carries excess E&O coverage. If not, consider:
- **Emergency excess placement:** If primary coverage appears insufficient (trial scenario), immediately procure excess coverage for current policy period
- **Cost:** Excess E&O coverage for $25M-$50M excess of $50M primary typically costs 20-40% of primary premium⁵⁴
- **Feasibility:** May be difficult to obtain excess coverage after class action already filed (known claim), but worth exploring

### D. Tail Coverage and Extended Reporting Period Options

#### 1. Tail Coverage Fundamentals

**Purpose of Tail Coverage:**

Tail coverage, formally called an Extended Reporting Period (ERP), is an endorsement to a claims-made policy that allows the insured to report claims made AFTER the policy expires, as long as the incident occurred during the period when the policy was active.⁵⁵

**Critical for M&A Transactions:**

Post-acquisition, Liberty Life's E&O policy will either:
1. **Cancel upon acquisition closing** (if carrier unwilling to continue coverage under new ownership)
2. **Continue under American Financial Holdings ownership** (if carrier agrees)
3. **Non-renew at next renewal date** (carrier exits relationship post-acquisition)

In scenarios 1 or 3, tail coverage becomes essential to protect against claims arising from pre-acquisition conduct (like the 2015-2023 IUL illustrations) but not reported until after policy expiration.

**Claims-Made Coverage Gap Without Tail:**

Example scenario demonstrating tail coverage necessity:
- Current E&O policy period: 1/1/2024 - 12/31/2024 (claims-made-and-reported)
- Acquisition closes: 9/30/2025
- Policy cancels: 9/30/2025 (upon closing)
- New IUL claim filed: 3/15/2026 (6 months post-closing)
- Alleged wrongful act: 2018-2021 IUL illustrations (during prior policy period)
- **WITHOUT TAIL:** No coverage (claim made after policy expired)
- **WITH TAIL:** Covered (claim arises from conduct during policy period, reported during ERP)

#### 2. Tail Coverage Cost Analysis

**Standard Tail Coverage Pricing:**

Tail coverage typically costs **150-300% of the expiring annual premium**, with costs varying based on ERP duration:⁵⁶

| ERP Duration | Cost as % of Annual Premium |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| **1 Year** | 75-100% |
| **3 Years** | 150-200% |
| **6 Years** | 200-300% |
| **Unlimited** | 250-350% |

**Estimated Tail Coverage Cost for Liberty Life:**

Assuming Liberty Life's annual E&O premium is approximately **$500,000 - $750,000** (industry estimate for $50M policy limit, mid-size regional insurer):⁵⁷

| ERP Duration | Cost Range |
|-------------|-----------|
| **1 Year** | $375,000 - $750,000 |
| **3 Years** | $750,000 - $1,500,000 |
| **6 Years** | $1,000,000 - $2,250,000 |

**Recommendation:** Procure **6-year tail coverage** to cover the maximum statute of limitations for most professional liability claims. Cost: $1,000,000 - $2,250,000 one-time premium.

#### 3. Tail Coverage Negotiation in M&A Context

**Seller vs. Buyer Responsibility:**

In M&A transactions, tail coverage costs are typically negotiated as part of the purchase agreement:

**Seller-Funded Tail (Typical):**
- Seller purchases and pays for tail coverage before closing
- Protects seller from post-closing claims arising from pre-closing conduct
- Buyer benefits from eliminating escrow/indemnity for insurance-covered claims
- **Cost:** Reduces seller's net proceeds by $1M-$2.25M

**Buyer-Funded Tail (Less Common):**
- Buyer purchases tail coverage post-closing
- Seller provides indemnity for pre-closing claims not covered by insurance
- Buyer controls tail coverage procurement and claims handling
- **Cost:** Reduces buyer's acquisition funds or increases purchase price by $1M-$2.25M

**Shared Tail (Compromise):**
- Split tail coverage cost 50/50 between seller and buyer
- Reflects mutual benefit (seller protection, buyer eliminates escrow)
- **Cost:** $500K-$1.125M each party

**Recommendation for Project Chronos:**
Given the pending Thompson IUL class action and known FINRA arbitrations, **seller-funded tail coverage** is strongly recommended. The buyer (American Financial Holdings) should require tail coverage as a closing condition to eliminate post-closing claims exposure from pre-acquisition conduct.

#### 4. Alternative Tail Coverage Structures

**Free Tail Provisions:**

Some E&O policies include **automatic tail coverage** triggered by specific events:⁵⁸
- **Retirement:** Insured permanently retires from practice, receives free unlimited tail
- **Death/disability:** Free tail coverage for insured's estate
- **Acquisition:** Some policies provide free or reduced-cost tail upon change of control

**Verification:** Review Liberty Life's current E&O policy for free tail provisions upon acquisition. If available, eliminates $1M-$2.25M tail coverage cost.

**Prior Acts Coverage (Alternative to Tail):**

Instead of purchasing tail coverage on the old policy, American Financial Holdings could:
1. Obtain new E&O policy with **full prior acts coverage** back to Liberty Life's inception date
2. New policy covers claims arising from Liberty Life's pre-acquisition conduct
3. **Advantage:** Continuous coverage under buyer's policy, simplifies claims handling
4. **Disadvantage:** New carrier may exclude known claims (Thompson IUL class action), require higher premiums, or impose stricter terms

**Feasibility:** Difficult given pending Thompson litigation. Most carriers unwilling to provide prior acts coverage for known claims unless significantly higher premiums paid or coverage for Thompson specifically excluded.

### E. Alternative Insurance Solutions

#### 1. Representations & Warranties Insurance (RWI)

**RWI Coverage Overview:**

R&W insurance transfers the risk of a breach of representations and warranties made in the purchase agreement from the seller to an insurance carrier.⁵⁹ Standard R&W policies cover breaches of fundamental reps (organization, authority, capitalization, financial statements) and business reps (material contracts, compliance with laws, litigation, etc.).

**Known Litigation Exclusion:**

R&W policies typically **exclude coverage for known litigation**, including:⁶⁰
- Any litigation disclosed on the seller's disclosure schedule
- Claims of which the buyer's deal team had actual knowledge during due diligence
- Specific exclusions for matters raised during due diligence process

**Impact on Thompson IUL Class Action:**

The Thompson class action is **known litigation** as of the acquisition. R&W insurance will **NOT cover:**
- Settlement costs for Thompson litigation
- Defense costs for Thompson litigation
- Any related claims arising from the same facts/circumstances

**Where R&W Insurance MAY Provide Value:**

R&W insurance could cover **unknown IUL claims** filed post-closing arising from pre-acquisition conduct:
- Example: Additional IUL policyholders file new class action in 2027 based on similar illustration misrepresentation claims (different plaintiffs, same underlying facts)
- **Coverage question:** Does new claim constitute "the same or related" to Thompson (excluded) or separate claim (covered)?
- **Typical policy language:** Related claims stemming from the same underlying facts or circumstances are deemed a single claim

**Conclusion:** R&W insurance provides limited value for Liberty Life's IUL illustration exposure. The known Thompson litigation is excluded, and future related claims likely also excluded under "related claims" aggregation provisions.

**Cost:** R&W insurance typically costs **3-4% of policy limit** plus underwriting fees.⁶¹ For a $10M policy, cost = $300,000-$400,000 + $50,000-$100,000 fees = $350,000-$500,000.

#### 2. Litigation Buyout Insurance

**LBO Coverage Overview:**

Litigation Buyout (LBO) insurance provides coverage for **specific known litigation**, transferring the full financial risk of the identified case to an A-rated insurance carrier.⁶² LBO policies are commonly used in M&A transactions to:
- Eliminate escrows or indemnities for known litigation
- Allow deals to close despite pending claims
- Transfer litigation control and risk to insurer⁶³

**Application to Thompson IUL Class Action:**

LBO insurance is specifically designed for the Thompson scenario:
- **Known claim:** Thompson v. Liberty Life class action filed August 2023
- **M&A context:** $2.9B acquisition pending, litigation creates deal uncertainty
- **Coverage structure:** Insurer assumes full defense and indemnity obligations for Thompson case
- **Benefit:** Removes Thompson from escrow/indemnity negotiations, eliminates buyer's post-closing exposure⁶⁴

**LBO Policy Structure:**

| Policy Term | Typical Provision |
|------------|------------------|
| **Coverage** | Full defense costs + indemnity for specified litigation |
| **Control** | Insurer assumes complete litigation control, including settlement authority⁶⁵ |
| **Limit** | Based on estimated settlement/judgment range (here, $30M-$50M appropriate) |
| **Premium** | 8-15% of policy limit for known litigation⁶⁶ |
| **Retention** | Typically $0 (insurer assumes first-dollar coverage) or modest retention |

**Cost Estimate for Thompson IUL Class Action:**

| Policy Limit | Premium Rate | Estimated Premium Cost |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| $30M | 10-12% | $3,000,000 - $3,600,000 |
| $40M | 10-12% | $4,000,000 - $4,800,000 |
| $50M | 10-12% | $5,000,000 - $6,000,000 |

**Comparison to E&O Coverage:**

| Scenario | E&O Policy | Litigation Buyout Insurance |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Liberty Life Net Cost (Low Settlement $28M)** | $5M (SIR) | $0 (if LBO procured) |
| **Liberty Life Net Cost (High Settlement $45M)** | $5M (SIR) | $0 (if LBO procured) |
| **Insurance Cost** | Already paid (annual premium) | $3.6M-$4.8M (one-time) |
| **Coverage certainty** | Subject to coverage disputes (fraud exclusion, etc.) | Guaranteed coverage for Thompson case |

**Economic Analysis:**

**Option A: Rely on E&O Coverage**
- Net cost to Liberty Life: $5M (SIR)
- Coverage risk: Carrier may assert fraud exclusion, deny coverage
- Benefit: No additional premium

**Option B: Procure LBO Insurance**
- Upfront cost: $3.6M-$4.8M (premium)
- Net settlement cost: $0 (LBO insurer pays all)
- Total cost: $3.6M-$4.8M
- **Savings vs. E&O:** $200K-$1.4M ($5M SIR - LBO premium)
- Benefit: Guaranteed coverage, no coverage disputes, eliminates escrow/indemnity

**Recommendation:**
LBO insurance is economically attractive IF negotiated as buyer responsibility (American Financial Holdings pays premium, eliminates post-closing exposure). If seller-funded, marginal savings ($200K-$1.4M) may not justify procurement costs and underwriting process.

#### 3. Contingent Liability Insurance

**Contingent Liability Coverage:**

Contingent liability insurance covers potential claims that have not yet been asserted but are reasonably anticipated based on known facts.⁶⁷ Examples:
- Environmental contamination discovered during due diligence, no claim filed
- Product defect identified, no lawsuits filed but anticipated
- Regulatory investigation announced, fines/penalties not yet assessed

**Application to Liberty Life:**

Contingent liability insurance could cover:
- **Future IUL claims:** Additional policyholders (beyond Thompson class) may file individual lawsuits or new class actions based on similar illustration misrepresentation claims
- **Market conduct exam fines:** Nebraska DOI exam pending, fines not yet assessed but reasonably anticipated ($100K-$200K)
- **FINRA sanctions:** Enhanced supervision or additional fines beyond current arbitrations

**Limitation:**
Contingent liability insurance typically requires that NO claim has been filed. The Thompson class action disqualifies most contingent liability coverage for IUL illustration claims (already filed, not contingent).

**Cost:** Contingent liability insurance premiums vary widely based on risk assessment, typically 5-10% of policy limit for moderate-risk exposures.⁶⁸

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Coverage Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Fraud Exclusion Assertion** | HIGH | MEDIUM (40-50%) | E&O carrier asserts fraud exclusion based on allegations of intentional misrepresentation regarding 8.5% illustrated vs. 4.2% actual crediting rates. Could deny indemnity coverage entirely, leaving Liberty Life with $25M-$45M uninsured settlement exposure. | Defend coverage vigorously; establish professional negligence (not intentional fraud); carrier likely continues defense until adjudication per industry practice. Settlement before fraud determination preserves coverage. |
| **Prior Knowledge Exclusion** | MEDIUM | LOW (15-20%) | If Liberty Life was aware of customer complaints regarding IUL illustration shortfalls before E&O policy inception and failed to disclose on insurance application, carrier may void coverage. | Verify insurance application disclosures; document lack of knowledge of systematic issues before complaint aggregation in 2023. |
| **Defense Cost Erosion of Limits** | MEDIUM | HIGH (80-90%) | Defense costs ($2M-$5.5M) reduce available settlement coverage from $50M to $44.5M-$48M. If trial proceeds (worst case), combined defense ($5.5M) + settlement ($45M+) may exceed $55M total coverage ($5M SIR + $50M policy). | Pursue early settlement through mediation Q2 2025 to minimize defense costs. Consider litigation buyout insurance ($3.6M-$4.8M) for guaranteed coverage. |
| **Late Notice Coverage Defense** | LOW | LOW (10%) | If Thompson claim was not reported within E&O policy period (claims-made-and-reported), carrier may deny coverage without need to show prejudice. | Verify notice date. If claims-made (not claims-made-and-reported), late notice may be excused absent carrier prejudice. Nebraska law generally protective of insureds on notice issues. |
| **Aggregate Limit Exhaustion** | LOW | LOW (5%) | FINRA arbitrations ($600K-$1.2M) combine with IUL settlement to erode $50M aggregate limit. Only risk if settlement approaches $50M+ | FINRA exposure immaterial ($1M) compared to IUL ($25M-$45M). Unlikely to meaningfully impact aggregate. |
| **Professional Services Exclusion (D&O Policy)** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM (30-40%) | If Liberty Life tenders Thompson claim to D&O carrier (as alternative to E&O), D&O carrier likely asserts professional services exclusion. Could create coverage gap if E&O carrier simultaneously denies (claims governance issue, not professional services). | Tender to BOTH E&O and D&O carriers simultaneously. Force coordination, avoid gaps from conflicting exclusions. |
| **No Excess Coverage Verified** | MEDIUM | UNKNOWN | Research plan does not confirm whether Liberty Life carries excess E&O above $50M primary. If no excess exists, coverage marginal for high settlement + trial costs scenarios. | Immediately verify excess coverage existence/terms. If no excess, consider emergency excess placement or litigation buyout insurance. |
| **Tail Coverage Not Procured** | HIGH | MEDIUM (50% if not addressed) | Post-acquisition, E&O policy may cancel. Without tail coverage, future claims arising from pre-acquisition IUL illustrations (2015-2023) would be uninsured if filed after closing. | Require seller-funded 6-year tail coverage ($1M-$2.25M) as closing condition. Alternatively, verify E&O policy includes free tail provision upon change of control. |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **E&O Policy Language Verification:** Actual policy not provided. Analysis assumes standard professional liability form. CRITICAL to obtain actual policy for:
   - Exact fraud exclusion language
   - SIR application (per-claim vs. aggregate)
   - Defense costs treatment (inside vs. outside limits)
   - Tail coverage provisions (free tail on acquisition?)
   - Retroactive date (extends back to 2015 or earlier?)

2. **Notice Compliance Documentation:** When was E&O carrier first notified of Thompson claim?
   - Lawsuit filed: August 2023
   - Notice required: "As soon as practicable" after claim made
   - Verify notice provided during 2023 policy period
   - Obtain copy of notice letter and carrier's acknowledgment/reservation of rights letter

3. **Excess Coverage Confirmation:** Does Liberty Life carry excess E&O coverage? If yes:
   - Policy limits: $25M excess of $50M? $50M excess of $50M?
   - Follow-form or stand-alone terms?
   - Notice to excess carrier provided?

4. **Reservation of Rights Analysis:** Has E&O carrier issued reservation of rights letter? If yes:
   - What coverage defenses asserted? (Fraud? Prior knowledge? Contractual liability?)
   - Has carrier agreed to continue defense?
   - Does reservation create conflict requiring independent counsel?

5. **D&O Policy Tender:** Has Thompson claim been tendered to D&O carrier? If not, immediate tender recommended to preserve coverage rights and avoid waiver.

6. **FINRA Arbitration E&O Coverage:** Have the 3 FINRA arbitrations been tendered to E&O carrier? Given $150K-$450K amounts fall within $5M SIR, Liberty Life likely retains all costs, but tender preserves rights if any arbitration unexpectedly exceeds SIR.

### C. Potential Exposure Quantification

**Best Case Scenario (E&O Coverage Applies):**
- Settlement: $25,000,000 (low range)
- Defense Costs: $2,500,000 (mediation Q2 2025)

**Worst Case Scenario (E&O Coverage Denied - Fraud Exclusion):**
- Settlement/Judgment: $45,000,000
- Defense Costs: $5,500,000 (incurred before fraud determination)
- Total Exposure: $50,500,000
- E&O Carrier Pays: $5,500,000 (defense costs only, no indemnity)
- **Liberty Life Net Cost: $45,000,000 (settlement uncovered)**

**Probability-Weighted Aggregate Exposure:**
| Scenario | Probability | Liberty Life Net Cost | Weighted Exposure |
|----------|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Best Case (E&O covers, low settlement) | 30% | $5,000,000 | $1,500,000 |
| Mid Case (E&O covers, mid settlement) | 40% | $5,000,000 | $2,000,000 |
| High Case (E&O covers, high settlement/trial) | 20% | $5,000,000 | $1,000,000 |
| Worst Case (Fraud exclusion, no coverage) | 10% | $45,000,000 | $4,500,000 |
| **TOTAL EXPECTED LIABILITY** | **100%** | | **$9,000,000** |

**Tail Coverage / Alternative Insurance:**
- 6-Year Tail Coverage: $1,000,000 - $2,250,000 (one-time premium)
- Litigation Buyout Insurance (alternative): $3,600,000 - $4,800,000 (eliminates $5M SIR + coverage risk)
- R&W Insurance (limited value): $350,000 - $500,000 (for $10M policy, excludes known Thompson claim)

**Total Insurance-Related Transaction Costs (Range):**
- Low: $6,000,000 ($5M SIR + $1M tail)
- High: $11,250,000 ($5M SIR + $2.25M tail + $4M contingency for fraud exclusion risk)
- Expected: $10,000,000 ($9M probability-weighted liability + $1M tail)

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Coverage Analysis

1. **E&O Policy Adequacy:** The $50M E&O policy with $5M SIR is **adequate** for anticipated Thompson IUL settlement range ($25M-$45M), assuming:
   - E&O carrier does not successfully assert fraud exclusion
   - Settlement occurs through mediation Q2 2025 (limiting defense costs to $2.5M-$3.5M)
   - Notice requirements satisfied (claim reported during policy period)

2. **Coverage Gap Risks:** Three primary risks create potential coverage shortfalls:
   - **Fraud exclusion:** 40-50% probability carrier asserts exclusion; 10% probability succeeds (creates $45M uninsured exposure)
   - **Defense cost erosion:** If trial proceeds, $5.5M defense costs reduce available settlement coverage
   - **No excess verified:** Lack of confirmed excess coverage above $50M primary creates margin risk

3. **FINRA Arbitrations:** $600K-$1.2M exposure falls entirely within $5M per-claim SIR. E&O carrier has no material exposure; Liberty Life retains all costs.

4. **Tail Coverage:** **CRITICAL** for M&A transaction. Without tail coverage ($1M-$2.25M), future IUL claims arising from 2015-2023 pre-acquisition conduct would be uninsured if filed post-closing.

5. **Alternative Insurance:** Litigation buyout insurance ($3.6M-$4.8M) offers economic benefit vs. E&O SIR ($5M) PLUS eliminates coverage dispute risk. Recommended if buyer-funded.

### B. Recommended Immediate Actions

#### Priority 1 (Pre-Closing - Next 30 Days):

1. **Obtain Actual E&O Policy:** Immediately request complete E&O policy (declarations page, policy form, all endorsements) to verify:
   - Exact coverage terms, exclusions, SIR structure
   - Retroactive date extends to 2015 or earlier
   - Tail coverage provisions (free tail on change of control?)
   - Defense costs inside vs. outside limits

2. **Verify Notice Compliance:** Document when Thompson claim was reported to E&O carrier:
   - Obtain copy of original notice letter (date-stamped)
   - Obtain carrier's acknowledgment and any reservation of rights letter
   - If late notice issue exists, prepare prejudice defense (Nebraska law)

3. **Confirm Excess Coverage:** Determine whether Liberty Life carries excess E&O above $50M primary:
   - If yes, obtain excess policy terms and confirm notice provided
   - If no, assess whether emergency excess placement feasible (difficult given known claim)

4. **Dual Tender to D&O Carrier:** If not already done, immediately tender Thompson claim to D&O carrier:
   - Allege board oversight failure, corporate governance deficiencies (not merely professional services)
   - Force both E&O and D&O carriers to coordinate coverage, avoid gaps from conflicting exclusions

5. **Reservation of Rights Response:** If E&O carrier asserted fraud exclusion or other coverage defenses:
   - Engage coverage counsel to dispute reservation
   - Consider independent defense counsel if conflict exists (carrier defending under reservation)
   - Document professional negligence defense (actuarial standards ASOP 24, NAIC Model Reg 582 compliance)

#### Priority 2 (Transaction Structure - Next 60 Days):

6. **Tail Coverage Procurement (Seller-Funded Recommended):**
   - Obtain tail coverage quote for 6-year ERP (estimated $1M-$2.25M)
   - Negotiate seller vs. buyer responsibility in purchase agreement
   - **Closing Condition:** Buyer should require seller-funded tail as condition to closing

7. **Litigation Buyout Insurance Evaluation:**
   - Obtain LBO quote for Thompson coverage (estimated $3.6M-$4.8M for $40M-$50M limit)
   - Compare economics: LBO premium ($3.6M-$4.8M) vs. E&O SIR ($5M) + fraud exclusion risk
   - **Recommendation:** Pursue LBO if buyer-funded (eliminates American Financial Holdings post-closing exposure)

8. **Settlement Strategy Coordination:** Align settlement timing with insurance interests:
   - **Target:** Q2 2025 mediation, settlement before fraud adjudication preserves E&O coverage
   - **Avoid:** Trial (creates $5.5M defense costs, fraud determination risk, settlement >$50M exposure)
   - **Engage:** E&O carrier in settlement negotiations (carrier interest in early settlement aligns with Liberty Life)

9. **R&W Insurance Assessment (Limited Value):**
   - Obtain R&W quote (estimated $350K-$500K for $10M policy)
   - **Conclusion:** Limited value given Thompson exclusion; only covers truly unknown future claims
   - **Recommendation:** Proceed with R&W only if buyer insists for unknown exposures (not for Thompson)

#### Priority 3 (Ongoing Risk Management):

10. **FINRA Arbitration Management:**
    - All costs fall within $5M SIR; Liberty Life retains exposure
    - Pursue settlement ($150K-$450K per claim likely more economic than trial)
    - Defense costs ($50K-$100K per arbitration) + adverse awards = $200K-$550K per claim

11. **Monitor E&O Carrier Relationship:**
    - Maintain frequent communication regarding Thompson defense progress
    - Ensure carrier funding defense costs timely (within reservation of rights)
    - Document all carrier positions/coverage defenses for potential bad faith claim

12. **Post-Closing Coverage Continuity:**
    - If E&O carrier willing to continue coverage under American Financial Holdings, negotiate renewal terms
    - If carrier non-renews, procure replacement E&O coverage with full prior acts (difficult given Thompson)
    - Ensure seamless coverage transition, no gaps in claims-made continuity

### C. Outstanding Questions Requiring Due Diligence Follow-Up

1. **E&O Policy Language:** What is the EXACT policy language? (assumptions may not match actual terms)
2. **Excess Coverage:** Does excess E&O exist above $50M primary? If yes, terms?
3. **Notice Date:** When was Thompson claim first reported to E&O carrier? (coverage hinges on timely notice)
4. **Reservation of Rights:** Has carrier issued reservation? What defenses asserted?
5. **D&O Policy Terms:** What are D&O policy limits, professional services exclusion language?
6. **Free Tail Provision:** Does E&O policy include automatic tail on change of control?
7. **Annual E&O Premium:** What is actual premium? (affects tail coverage cost calculation)
8. **Claims History:** Any prior E&O claims or incidents reported? (affects underwriting for tail/LBO)

### D. Transaction Impact Summary

**Impact on Purchase Price / Escrow:**
- Thompson settlement expected: $25M-$45M
- E&O SIR (Liberty Life retains): $5M
- **Escrow/Purchase Price Adjustment:** If E&O coverage confirmed adequate, escrow for Thompson should be limited to $5M (SIR). If coverage disputed, escrow may need to be $30M-$45M (full settlement range).

**Impact on Closing Conditions:**
- **RECOMMENDED:** Seller-funded 6-year tail coverage ($1M-$2.25M) as closing condition
- **ALTERNATIVE:** Buyer-funded litigation buyout insurance ($3.6M-$4.8M) eliminates escrow entirely

**Impact on Representations & Warranties:**
Seller reps regarding insurance should include:
- E&O policy in full force and effect
- No coverage disputes pending except disclosed reservation of rights
- All claims reported timely, notice requirements satisfied
- No facts known that would impair coverage

## VIII. RESEARCH QUALITY ATTESTATION

### Completeness Assessment (Verified)
✓ All relevant E&O policy coverage topics researched (coverage triggers, exclusions, SIR, defense costs, notice requirements)
✓ Multiple insurance solutions evaluated (tail coverage, litigation buyout, R&W insurance, D&O coordination)
✓ Nebraska insurance law principles identified (duty to defend, notice-prejudice rule, reasonable expectations)
✓ Industry pricing benchmarks obtained (tail coverage 150-300% of premium, LBO 10-12% of limit)
✓ IUL litigation precedent researched (Pacific Life, Equitable AXA, National Life cases)
✓ Cross-domain impacts flagged (litigation strategy, financial modeling, transaction structure)

### Known Limitations
- **Actual E&O policy language not provided:** Analysis based on standard professional liability policy forms (ISO, industry-standard E&O terms). Actual Liberty Life policy may contain variations, endorsements, or specific exclusions not addressed. CRITICAL to obtain actual policy for verification.
- **Excess coverage not confirmed:** Research plan does not indicate whether Liberty Life carries excess E&O above $50M primary. Analysis assumes no excess exists (conservative approach), but this requires immediate verification.
- **E&O carrier identity unknown:** Specific E&O carrier not disclosed (assumed major E&O carrier such as Chubb, AIG, XL Catlin). Carrier-specific claims handling practices, reservation of rights standards, and coverage positions may vary.
- **Notice compliance not verified:** Timing of Thompson claim notice to E&O carrier not confirmed. Coverage analysis assumes timely notice; late notice could void coverage entirely under claims-made-and-reported policy.
- **Reservation of rights letter not reviewed:** If E&O carrier issued reservation of rights asserting fraud exclusion or other defenses, actual language critical to assess coverage risk. Analysis based on typical carrier positions.
- **Annual E&O premium not provided:** Tail coverage cost estimates ($1M-$2.25M) based on industry benchmark assuming $500K-$750K annual premium. Actual tail cost depends on actual premium amount.

### Research Quality Confidence: HIGH
