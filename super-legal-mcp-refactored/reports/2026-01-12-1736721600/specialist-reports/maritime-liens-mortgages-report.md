## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### A. Overview

This report analyzes Critical Issue #9 for the Project Neptune acquisition: **Maritime Liens, Preferred Ship Mortgages, and Change of Control Consents** affecting $2.8 billion in secured vessel debt across Pacific Maritime Services Corporation's (PMSC) 22-vessel fleet. The analysis addresses the Preferred Ship Mortgage Act (46 U.S.C. Chapter 313), maritime lien priority rules, change of control consent requirements for 4 institutional lenders, vessel valuation methodologies, loan-to-value (LTV) covenant risks, foreclosure procedures, and vessel title insurance recommendations.

**Transaction Context:**
- **Purchase Price:** $4.8 billion (stock purchase)
- **Fleet:** 22 U.S.-flagged vessels (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers)
- **Appraised Value:** $3.2 billion (2024 appraisals)
- **Outstanding Ship Mortgage Debt:** $2.8 billion (87.5% LTV ratio)
- **Lenders:** JP Morgan Maritime Finance ($1.2B), DNB Bank ASA ($880M), Citibank Maritime ($520M), ING Bank ($200M)

### B. Key Findings

#### 1. Preferred Ship Mortgage Structure (46 U.S.C. Chapter 313)

All 22 PMSC vessels are U.S.-flagged and documented with the U.S. Coast Guard National Vessel Documentation Center (NVDC), satisfying the Preferred Ship Mortgage Act's requirements. The 4 lenders hold properly recorded first preferred mortgages that provide:

- **Priority over most claims:** Preferred mortgages rank third in statutory priority hierarchy (after custodia legis expenses and preferred maritime liens)
- **Federal admiralty jurisdiction:** Enforceable through in rem actions against the vessel itself
- **Foreclosure rights:** Lenders can arrest vessels and force judicial sales by U.S. Marshal

**Critical Exception - Super-Priority Maritime Liens:** Under 46 U.S.C. § 31326(b), certain maritime liens have **priority over preferred mortgages** even if the mortgage was recorded first:
1. **Crew wages** (seamen, officers)
2. **Stevedore wages** (longshoremen)
3. **Maritime tort damages** (personal injury, collision)
4. **Salvage** (including contract salvage)
5. **General average** (emergency cargo jettison contributions)

**PMSC Exposure:** If PMSC owes unpaid crew wages, those claims would have priority over the entire $2.8B in mortgages. With 2,400 crew members and biweekly payroll of $16M-$24M, this creates material super-priority lien risk if payroll arrears exist.

#### 2. Change of Control Consent Requirements - **CRITICAL CLOSING CONDITION**

All 4 ship mortgage loan agreements contain change of control provisions that constitute an **Event of Default** if ownership changes without lender consent. Based on maritime finance industry standards and the research conducted:

**Lender-Specific Analysis:**

| Lender | Debt | Consent Mechanism | Timeline | Probability | Likely Conditions |
|--------|------|-------------------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **JP Morgan** | $1.2B (43%) | Bilateral consent within 30 days | 30-40 days | 70-80% | 50 bps rate increase ($6M/year), parent guarantee, updated appraisals |
| **DNB Bank ASA** | $880M (31%) | 67% syndicate vote (12 banks) | 45-60 days | 60-70% | 75 bps rate increase ($6.6M/year), 15% prepayment ($132M) |
| **Citibank** | $520M (19%) | Automatic if acquirer >$1B net worth | 20-30 days | 85-90% | Maturity extension critical (March 2027, 15 months post-closing) |
| **ING Bank** | $200M (7%) | Lender + construction guarantor consent | 40-50 days | 50-60% | Jones Act compliance verification (vessels under construction) |

**Aggregate Change of Control Cost Estimate:**

- **Interest rate increases:** 50-100 bps on $2.8B = **$14M-$28M additional annual interest**
- **Mandatory prepayments:** 10-20% of $2.8B = **$280M-$560M cash required at closing**
- **Updated vessel appraisals:** $15K-$25K × 22 vessels = **$330K-$550K**
- **Parent guarantee:** Global Logistics Partners must guarantee PMSC's $2.8B obligations

**Total Incremental Cost (Expected Value):** $19.6M/year + $420M one-time = **$500M+ NPV over 5 years**

#### 3. High Leverage (87.5% LTV) - **COVENANT BREACH RISK**

PMSC's 87.5% blended LTV ratio significantly exceeds maritime industry prudent lending standards of 70-80% LTV. This creates minimal cushion against vessel value volatility:

**Covenant Breach Sensitivity:**

- **Current headroom:** Only 2.5% ($80M buffer before breaching typical 90% LTV covenant)
- **10% vessel value decline:** Would trigger covenant breach requiring **$207M prepayment** or additional collateral
- **CII D-rated vessels:** 2 bulk carriers (M/V Sierra Nevada, M/V Cascade Ridge) face **$10M-$14M value impairment** (20-30% discount vs. C-rated comparable vessels)

**LTV Covenant Cure Mechanism:** If vessels decline in value and LTV exceeds covenant threshold (typically 90%), borrower has **30 days to cure** by:
1. Prepaying loans to restore compliance, OR
2. Posting additional collateral (mortgaging another vessel, cash pledge)

**Failure to cure = Event of Default** → lender can accelerate loan and foreclose on vessels

#### 4. Necessaries Liens - **Hidden Lien Exposure ($2M-$5M)**

Under 46 U.S.C. § 31342, suppliers of "necessaries" (bunker fuel, repairs, supplies, stevedoring, towage, drydock services) automatically acquire maritime liens on the vessel. These liens arise **without any filing requirement** and do not appear on public registers, creating undisclosed lien risk:

**Bunker Fuel Exposure:**
- PMSC consumes 2.4M tons VLSFO annually at $480M cost
- 60-day payment terms = **$80M average payables**
- Unpaid bunker invoices create necessaries liens

**Case Law - O.W. Bunker Bankruptcy:** Fifth and Ninth Circuits held that physical suppliers lack lien rights if fuel purchased through intermediary/broker, UNLESS vessel owner specifically directed supplier selection. However, the broker itself retains lien rights.

**Shipyard Repair Exposure:**
- M/V Pacific Titan drydock ($18.7M total cost) may have generated repair liens if invoices unpaid
- Typical 60-90 day payables for 22-vessel fleet = **$2M-$5M estimated exposure**

**CRITICAL: Necessaries liens for U.S.-flagged vessels are SUBORDINATE to preferred mortgages** (unlike foreign-flagged vessels, where U.S. necessaries liens have super-priority). However, undisclosed liens still create arrest risk and cargo delays.

#### 5. Citibank Refinancing Risk - **$520M MATURES MARCH 2027 (15 MONTHS POST-CLOSING)**

Citibank's $520M facility matures in March 2027, only 15 months after the anticipated acquisition closing. This creates **material refinancing risk** because:

**Current Market Rates vs. Existing Pricing:**
- Existing Citibank rate: SOFR + 325 bps (~8.6% all-in)
- Current ship mortgage market rates (2024-2025): SOFR + 400-450 bps
- **Refinancing cost increase:** $39M-$65M additional annual interest on $520M

**Five-Year NPV of Refinancing Cost:** $39M-$65M/year × 4.1 annuity factor = **$160M-$267M**

**Recommendation:** Negotiate with Citibank to **extend maturity by 24-36 months** (March 2027 → March 2029-2030) as a condition of change of control consent. Offer incentives: parent guarantee, 25-50 bps rate increase, covenant tightening. This avoids near-term refinancing at higher market rates.

**Alternative:** Refinance $520M at closing at SOFR + 400-450 bps, but this immediately crystallizes the higher cost.

#### 6. CII "D" Rating Vessel Value Impairment - **$10M-$14M WRITE-DOWN**

Since January 1, 2023, IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulations require all vessels to receive annual A-E ratings based on carbon emissions per ton-mile. Vessels rated **D for three consecutive years** OR **E for one year** must submit corrective action plans to achieve C rating or better.

**PMSC Fleet CII Status:**
- 2 A-rated vessels (premium performance)
- 8 B-rated vessels (above average)
- 10 C-rated vessels (baseline compliance)
- **2 D-rated bulk carriers:** M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge

**Market Impact of D Ratings (2024 Data):**

1. **Reduced Liquidity:** E-rated vessels have 4.2% trading frequency vs. much higher for A-C vessels; D-rated vessels show similar liquidity concerns
2. **Two-Tier Market:** A-C rated vessels command higher charter rates and sales prices; charterers increasingly prefer environmentally compliant vessels
3. **Lender Concerns:** Ship mortgage lenders hesitant to finance vessels with lower CII ratings due to uncertainty about evolving environmental standards and Poseidon Principles portfolio alignment

**Quantified Value Impairment:**
- D-rated vessel discount: **20-30%** vs. comparable C-rated vessels
- Current appraised value (2 bulk carriers): $23M each = $46M aggregate
- Post-impairment value: $16M-$18M each = $32M-$36M aggregate
- **Write-down exposure: $10M-$14M**

**LTV Covenant Impact:** If lenders conduct updated appraisals applying CII discounts:
- Post-impairment LTV on 2 D-rated vessels: **128-144%** (breach of typical 90% threshold)
- **Cure requirement: $4M-$10M prepayment** or additional collateral

**Cross-Reference:** Environmental Compliance specialist (T5) must research corrective action plan requirements for M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge, including capex for engine efficiency upgrades, slow steaming protocols, and fuel optimization.

#### 7. ING Bank Jones Act Compliance Risk - **$200M DEFAULT EXPOSURE**

ING Bank's $200M construction financing (7% of total debt) covers 2 offshore supply vessels under construction, with delivery scheduled Q2 2025. The research plan creates **critical ambiguity**:

**Two Possible Scenarios:**

**Scenario A (Low Risk):** ING's 2 financed vessels are the **U.S.-built vessels under construction at Philly Shipyard**
- Jones Act compliant (U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed)
- ING Bank consent probability: 60-70%
- No default risk

**Scenario B (High Risk):** ING's 2 financed vessels are the **foreign-built vessels ordered from COSCO China**
- Jones Act **NON-COMPLIANT** if used for U.S. coastwise trade or offshore wind operations
- Loan agreement Section 6.2 likely requires: "Vessels shall be eligible for U.S. coastwise trade under 46 U.S.C. § 55102"
- **If COSCO vessels: ING may declare immediate Event of Default, demanding $200M repayment**

**Resolution Required:**
- Obtain vessel construction contracts and build certificates IMMEDIATELY
- If COSCO vessels financed by ING: arrange **$200M refinancing** at closing at market rates (SOFR + 400-450 bps)
- **Refinancing cost:** $200M × (8.25% - 8.85%) = $16.5M-$17.7M annual interest

**Cross-Reference:** Jones Act specialist (T2) must clarify which 2 vessels are financed by ING Bank and confirm Jones Act compliance status.

#### 8. Vessel Arrest and Foreclosure Procedures

If PMSC defaults on ship mortgages or maritime lienholders assert claims, vessels can be arrested through federal admiralty in rem actions (Supplemental Rule C):

**Arrest Procedure:**
1. Claimant files verified complaint in U.S. District Court
2. Court issues Warrant of Arrest in Rem directed to U.S. Marshal
3. Plaintiff deposits $10,000 with Marshal for arrest costs
4. Marshal serves warrant on vessel, taking custody (custodia legis)
5. If not released within 14 days, plaintiff publishes public notice

**Owner's Defenses:**
- Challenge arrest at prompt hearing (lack of maritime lien, improper jurisdiction)
- Post surety bond or P&I club letter of undertaking to release vessel

**Foreclosure Sale (if claimant prevails):**
1. U.S. Marshal appraises vessel and advertises public auction
2. Vessel sold to highest bidder at Marshal's sale
3. **Sale conveys title FREE AND CLEAR of all liens** (46 U.S.C. § 31326(a))
4. Proceeds distributed in statutory priority order:
   - Priority 1: Marshal's costs (custody, sale)
   - Priority 2: Super-priority maritime liens (crew wages, torts, salvage)
   - Priority 3: Preferred ship mortgages
   - Priority 4: Necessaries liens arising before mortgage
   - Priority 5: Unsecured creditors

**Deficiency Judgment:** If sale proceeds insufficient to satisfy mortgage, lender has personal recourse claim against borrower for deficiency.

#### 9. Vessel Title Insurance - **RECOMMENDED ($16M-$32M PREMIUM)**

Maritime title insurance protects against **undisclosed maritime liens** and ownership defects. Unlike real estate liens, maritime liens:
- **Do NOT appear on public registers** (arise automatically when debt incurred)
- **Survive changes of ownership**, even by good faith purchasers
- Can be asserted months or years after services rendered

**Coverage:**
- Undisclosed necessaries liens (fuel, repairs, supplies)
- Crew wage liens
- Ownership disputes
- Defective mortgage priority (errors in NVDC recordings)
- Document forgery

**Underwriters:** NorthStandard (formerly North of England P&I), UK P&I Club, West of England P&I Club, Shipowners' Club

**Premium:** 0.5-1.0% of vessel value × $3.2B fleet = **$16M-$32M one-time premium**

**Due Diligence Benefit:** Before binding coverage, underwriter conducts comprehensive lien search:
- USCG NVDC records (mortgages, liens)
- UCC-1 financing statements
- Federal court admiralty dockets
- Crew payroll verification
- Bunker fuel and shipyard invoice audits

**Recommendation:** Bind title insurance on all 22 vessels at closing. Given 87.5% LTV (minimal equity cushion), the $16M-$32M premium is prudent risk management. Lenders may **require** title insurance as a closing condition.

| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | **$570M + $65M/year** | **$1.14B + $121M/year** | **$714M + $72M/year** |

**Five-Year NPV (7% discount rate):**
- Annual costs: $72M/year × 4.1 annuity factor = $295M
- One-time costs: $714M
- **Total NPV: $1.009 billion** (21% of $4.8B purchase price)

### D. Critical Recommendations

1. **File Change of Control Consent Requests Immediately (Day 1-5 after definitive agreement signing)**
   - Submit comprehensive consent packages to all 4 lenders
   - For DNB Bank: engage administrative agent to coordinate 12-bank syndicate vote
   - Budget 30-60 days for consent process; DNB may require 45-60 days

2. **Conduct Comprehensive Maritime Lien Search (60 days pre-closing)**
   - Engage vessel title insurance underwriters for full lien searches
   - Audit accounts payable: bunker fuel, shipyard repairs, port services
   - Verify crew payroll current (no unpaid wages, bonuses, disputes)
   - Identify and escrow funds to payoff undisclosed liens before closing

3. **Negotiate Citibank Maturity Extension**
   - Propose 24-36 month extension (March 2027 → March 2029-2030)
   - Offer incentives: parent guarantee, 25-50 bps rate increase
   - Avoids $39M-$65M/year refinancing cost at higher market rates

4. **Verify ING Bank Vessel Jones Act Compliance**
   - Obtain construction contracts for 2 offshore wind vessels IMMEDIATELY
   - Confirm vessels are U.S.-built at Philly Shipyard (not COSCO China)
   - If COSCO: arrange $200M refinancing to cure ING default

5. **Obtain Updated Vessel Appraisals**
   - Engage independent appraisers (ABS, DNV, Lloyd's Register)
   - Apply all three valuation methods (market, cost, income approaches)
   - Apply CII rating discounts to 2 D-rated vessels
   - Budget: $15K-$25K × 22 vessels = $330K-$550K

6. **Bind Vessel Title Insurance on All 22 Vessels at Closing**
   - Issue RFP to 3 underwriters (NorthStandard, UK P&I, West of England P&I)
   - Premium: $16M-$32M (0.5-1% of $3.2B fleet value)
   - Name lenders as loss payees
   - Lenders may require title insurance as closing condition given 87.5% LTV

7. **Prepay $200M-$300M at Closing to Create LTV Cushion**
   - Current 87.5% LTV leaves minimal covenant headroom (2.5%)
   - Prepayment creates buffer against vessel value volatility
   - Protects against CII D-rated vessel impairment ($10M-$14M)
   - Reduces 10% decline sensitivity (currently triggers $207M cure requirement)

### E. Finding Confidence Levels

| Finding | Confidence | Basis |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Preferred Ship Mortgage Act statutory framework (46 U.S.C. Chapter 313) | **HIGH** | Statutory certainty, NVDC documentation procedures, Coast Guard regulations |
| Change of control consent required (4 lenders, $2.8B) | **HIGH** | Standard ship mortgage covenant, confirmed by maritime finance industry sources |
| Lender consent conditions (50-100 bps rate increase, 10-20% prepayment) | **MEDIUM** | Industry practice, no access to actual loan agreements |
| 87.5% LTV ratio | **HIGH** | User research plan states $2.8B debt, $3.2B appraised value |
| CII D-rated vessel value impairment (20-30%) | **MEDIUM** | Market data from VesselsValue, maritime finance sources; actual vessel-specific impact varies |
| Citibank March 2027 maturity | **HIGH** | User research plan states 15 months post-closing maturity |
| Current ship mortgage market rates (SOFR + 400-450 bps) | **HIGH** | Maritime finance market data (2024-2025), ShipFinex, Lloyd's List |
| Necessaries lien exposure ($2M-$5M) | **MEDIUM** | Typical 60-90 day payables estimate for 22-vessel fleet; actual invoices not audited |
| ING Bank Jones Act compliance risk | **LOW** | Research plan ambiguity: uncertain whether ING financed U.S.-built or foreign-built vessels |
| Martinez tort judgment lien (80% verdict probability) | **MEDIUM** | Cross-reference to T2/T6; trial Q3 2025, judgment probability based on injury severity |

### F. Cross-Domain Flags for Coverage-Gap-Analyzer

---

## III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

### A. Target Company Maritime Assets

**Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (PMSC)** operates 22 owned vessels with total appraised value of $3.2 billion (2024 appraisals). The fleet comprises:
- 18 container ships (342,000 TEU total capacity)
- 4 bulk carriers (260,000 DWT total capacity)
- All 22 vessels documented under U.S. flag with U.S. Coast Guard
- 6 vessels designated for Jones Act coastwise trade (U.S.-built requirement satisfied)

### B. Ship Mortgage Debt Structure

**Total Outstanding Debt:** $2.8 billion across 4 institutional lenders
**Blended Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio:** 87.5% ($2.8B debt / $3.2B appraised value)

**Estimated Lender Breakdown** (based on typical maritime finance syndication):
- **Lender A (JP Morgan Maritime Finance):** $1.2B (43%) - 8 vessels
- **Lender B (DNB Bank ASA):** $880M (31%) - 7 vessels
- **Lender C (Citibank Maritime):** $520M (19%) - 5 vessels
- **Lender D (ING Bank):** $200M (7%) - 2 offshore supply vessels under construction

### C. Transaction Context

**Acquirer:** Global Logistics Partners LLC (PE-backed, New York, NY)
**Purchase Price:** $4.8 billion (stock purchase of PMSC)
**Key Risk:** Change of control constitutes Event of Default under ship mortgage agreements, requiring lender consent within 30-60 days

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. PREFERRED SHIP MORTGAGE ACT - STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

#### 1. Requirements for Preferred Mortgage Status (46 U.S.C. § 31322)

**Statutory Authority:** 46 U.S.C. § 31322 establishes the conditions that must be met for a mortgage to qualify as a "preferred ship mortgage" with enhanced priority status under federal maritime law.¹

**Four Requirements for Preferred Status:**

A mortgage attains preferred status when ALL four conditions are met:

1. **Vessel Coverage:** The mortgage must cover the "whole of the vessel" (cannot be limited to engines, equipment, or portions)²
2. **Vessel Documentation:** The vessel must be documented under U.S. flag with the Coast Guard National Vessel Documentation Center (NVDC), or an application for documentation must be filed³
3. **Eligible Mortgagee:** The lender must be "eligible" under 46 U.S.C. § 31322(a)(4), including:
   - Banks and trust companies
   - Qualified maritime lenders
   - Foreign financial institutions (since 1996 amendment allowing foreign lenders to hold preferred mortgages)⁴
4. **Recording with Coast Guard:** The mortgage instrument must be recorded with the NVDC in Falling Waters, West Virginia⁵

**Critical Timing:** A mortgage becomes a preferred mortgage **from the time all four conditions are met**, not from when the vessel is finally documented. Therefore, a mortgage typically attains preferred status when the application for documentation and the instrument have been filed with the NVDC.⁶

**PMSC Fleet Compliance:** All 22 PMSC vessels are documented under U.S. flag, satisfying the vessel documentation requirement. The research plan indicates the 4 lenders (JP Morgan, DNB Bank ASA, Citibank, ING Bank) hold preferred ship mortgages recorded with the NVDC.

#### 2. Recording Procedure with Coast Guard NVDC

**Application Form:** There is NO government-mandated form for a preferred mortgage instrument itself (parties draft mortgage agreements under maritime finance industry standards), but the **Optional Application for Filing (Form CG-5542)** MUST be attached to the mortgage when submitted to the NVDC.⁷

**NVDC Role:** The U.S. Coast Guard acts principally as a **recording agency** for mortgages and related instruments. Recording provides public notice of the lien and establishes the mortgage's priority date.⁸

**2024 Electronic Filing Update:** In December 2024, the Coast Guard updated its document submission regulations. Previously, the NVDC accepted paper submissions, fax, or PDF email attachments. The 2024 rule removed specific references to fax and PDF, replacing them with general language to accommodate evolving electronic filing technologies.⁹

**URL for NVDC Records:**
- **General NVDC Information:** https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Deputy-for-Operations-Policy-and-Capabilities-DCO-D/National-Vessel-Documentation-Center/
- **Preferred Mortgage Instructions (March 2025):** https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/NVDC/Instructions/PREFERRED%20SHIP%20MORTGAGES%2003-2025.pdf

#### 3. Benefits of Preferred Mortgage Status

A preferred ship mortgage confers significant advantages to maritime lenders:

1. **Priority Over Most Claims:** Preferred mortgages have priority over nearly all claims against the vessel (subject to exceptions detailed in Section IV.B below)
2. **Federal Court Jurisdiction:** Enforceable through federal admiralty courts with nationwide jurisdiction
3. **In Rem Enforcement:** Lender can arrest the vessel itself (not just sue the borrower personally), providing direct security interest in the collateral
4. **Cross-Border Recognition:** U.S. preferred mortgages are generally recognized by foreign courts under international maritime law principles
5. **Foreclosure Rights:** Lender can force judicial sale of vessel through U.S. Marshal's sale, with proceeds distributed according to statutory priority

---

### B. MARITIME LIEN PRIORITY - STATUTORY HIERARCHY

#### 1. Priority Scheme Under 46 U.S.C. § 31326

**Statutory Authority:** 46 U.S.C. § 31326 governs "Court sales to enforce preferred mortgage liens and maritime liens and priority of claims."¹⁰

**Key Principle:** When a vessel is sold by court order in an admiralty action in rem to enforce a preferred mortgage or maritime lien, the sale proceeds are distributed according to a statutory priority hierarchy. The vessel is sold **free and clear** of all liens, and claimants are paid from proceeds in order of priority.¹¹

**Priority Hierarchy (Highest to Lowest):**

1. **Custodia Legis Expenses:** Court costs and U.S. Marshal's expenses during vessel custody (arrest, storage, security, insurance)¹²
2. **Preferred Maritime Liens** (46 U.S.C. § 31301(5)) arising AFTER preferred mortgage filing:¹³
   - **Crew wages** (seamen, officers)
   - **Stevedore wages** (longshoremen under LHWCA)
   - **Maritime tort damages** (personal injury, collision)
   - **Salvage** (including contract salvage)
   - **General average** (emergency cargo jettison contributions)
3. **Preferred Ship Mortgages** (properly recorded with NVDC)¹⁴
4. **Maritime Contract Liens** arising BEFORE preferred mortgage filing, including:
   - **Necessaries liens** (46 U.S.C. § 31342): repairs, supplies, fuel, towage, drydock services¹⁵
5. **All Other Claims** (unsecured creditors, tort claims without maritime lien status)

#### 2. Critical Exception: Crew Wages Have SUPER-PRIORITY

**46 U.S.C. § 31326(b)(1) - Crew Wages Priority:**

> "Subject to subsection (c), a preferred mortgage lien on a documented vessel covered by subsection (a)(1) of this section has priority over all claims against the vessel **except claims for—**
> (1) **wages of a stevedore when employed directly by a person listed in section 31341(a) of this title;**
> (2) **wages (including contract wages) of a crew member** of the vessel; ..."¹⁶

**Practical Impact:** Even if a preferred mortgage was recorded BEFORE crew members performed work, **wages owed to the crew have priority over the mortgage**. This super-priority rule protects maritime workers, reflecting the historical policy that "seamen are the wards of admiralty."¹⁷

**PMSC Due Diligence Requirement:** Acquirer must verify that PMSC's payroll for all 22 vessels is current, with no unpaid wages to crew members (2,400 crew: 800 officers, 1,600 unlicensed). If PMSC owes back wages, those claims would have priority over the $2.8B in preferred mortgages.

**Estimated Exposure:** Research plan indicates 2,400 crew members. Assuming average crew wages of $80,000-$120,000 annually, a 2-month payroll period represents $32M-$48M in ongoing crew wage exposure. If payroll is current (assumed), exposure is $0. However, any wage disputes or unpaid bonuses would trigger super-priority claims.

#### 3. Necessaries Liens - Priority Over Foreign Mortgages

**46 U.S.C. § 31342 - Establishing Maritime Liens:**

Any person providing **"necessaries"** to a vessel has a maritime lien on the vessel, may bring a civil action in rem in admiralty to enforce the lien, and is not required to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel.¹⁸

**Definition of "Necessaries" (46 U.S.C. § 31301(4)):**

The term "necessaries" **includes repairs, supplies, towage, and the use of a drydock or marine railway**.¹⁹ The statute uses the word "includes," meaning the definition is **non-exclusive**—courts have interpreted necessaries broadly to encompass:

- **Bunker fuel** (most common necessaries lien)²⁰
- **Stevedoring services** (cargo loading/unloading)²¹
- **Provisions** (food, water, crew supplies)
- **Ship chandlery** (nautical equipment, ropes, paint)
- **Wharfage and dockage** (port fees)
- **Shipyard repairs** (hull repairs, engine overhauls, drydock services)²²

**Authority to Procure Necessaries (46 U.S.C. § 31341):**

The following persons are **presumed to have authority** to procure necessaries that create maritime liens:²³
- The owner
- The master (captain)
- A manager at the port of supply
- An officer or agent appointed by the owner, charterer, or buyer in possession

**Priority Exception for U.S.-Supplied Necessaries to Foreign Vessels:**

For **foreign-flagged vessels** (non-U.S. documented), a preferred mortgage lien recorded in a foreign registry is **subordinate to a maritime lien for necessaries provided in the United States**.²⁴ This exception does NOT apply to PMSC's fleet (all 22 vessels are U.S.-flagged with U.S. preferred mortgages).

**PMSC Exposure:** The research plan estimates $2M-$5M in potential necessaries liens for a 22-vessel fleet based on typical 60-90 day payables for fuel, repairs, and port services. Acquirer must conduct accounts payable due diligence to identify unpaid suppliers who could assert necessaries liens.

#### 4. Case Law: *Rainbow Line, Inc. v. M/V Tequila*, 480 F.2d 1024 (2d Cir. 1973)

**Facts:** The vessel LINGLEE was chartered to Rainbow Line. The owner, Simpson, breached the charter by prematurely withdrawing the vessel. Rainbow obtained an arbitration award for $17,849.12. Simpson then sold the vessel to Tequila, Ltd., which renamed it M/V TEQUILA. Empire Commercial Corp. loaned Tequila $180,000 secured by a first preferred mortgage recorded with the Coast Guard. Tequila defaulted within two months. The vessel was arrested in New York, with Rainbow, Empire, and 9 other claimants seeking payment from the vessel. The U.S. Marshal sold the vessel for $162,000—insufficient to pay all claims.²⁵

**Priority Issue:** If Rainbow's claim for charter breach constituted a "preferred maritime lien," it would have priority over Empire's mortgage (because Rainbow's claim arose before Empire recorded its mortgage). If Rainbow had only a contract claim without preferred lien status, Empire's mortgage would consume the entire sale proceeds, leaving nothing for Rainbow.²⁶

**Holding:** The Second Circuit analyzed whether a breach of charter party creates a maritime lien under the Commercial Instruments and Maritime Liens Act (CIMLA). The court ultimately determined that **Rainbow's claim did NOT qualify as a preferred maritime lien**, meaning Empire's preferred mortgage had priority.²⁷

**Key Principle from *Rainbow Line*:** Not all maritime contract claims create maritime liens with priority over preferred mortgages. Only specific categories of claims (crew wages, tort damages, salvage, general average, necessaries) qualify as "preferred maritime liens" under 46 U.S.C. § 31301(5). Charter party breach damages are ordinary contract claims subordinate to preferred mortgages.

#### 5. Bunker Fuel Lien Litigation: O.W. Bunker Bankruptcy Cases

**Context:** The 2015 bankruptcy of O.W. Bunker, a major marine fuel intermediary, spawned extensive litigation over whether physical suppliers (who sold fuel to O.W. Bunker, which resold to vessel owners) had maritime liens against vessels.²⁸

**Key Issue:** Under 46 U.S.C. § 31342, a supplier has a necessaries lien if it provided fuel "on the order of the owner or a person authorized by the owner" (§ 31341). If O.W. Bunker acted as an intermediary/broker, did the ultimate physical supplier have lien rights?²⁹

**Fifth Circuit Rule:** Courts denied liens to physical suppliers who contracted with intermediaries unless the vessel owner **specifically directed the selection of the particular supplier or retained control over the supplier's performance**. The Fifth Circuit held that if the intermediary (O.W. Bunker) had discretion to choose the physical supplier, the physical supplier was a subcontractor without lien rights.³⁰

**Ninth Circuit Rule:** The Ninth Circuit reached a similar conclusion in Yang Ming, finding no agency relationship where the vessel owner had not specifically directed the broker to purchase bunkers from the ultimate supplier.³¹

**PMSC Due Diligence Implication:** Acquirer should review PMSC's bunker fuel supply chain:
- If PMSC contracts directly with physical suppliers (ExxonMobil, BP Marine, Shell Marine) → suppliers have clear necessaries lien rights for unpaid fuel
- If PMSC uses intermediaries/brokers → physical suppliers may lack lien rights, but the broker itself has lien rights
- Either way, unpaid bunker fuel invoices create necessaries lien exposure

**Estimated Bunker Fuel Payables:** Research plan indicates PMSC consumes 2.4M tons of VLSFO 0.1% sulfur fuel annually at $480M annual cost. Assuming 60-day payment terms, average bunker payables are $80M (60/365 × $480M). If PMSC is current on payments (assumed), exposure is minimal. However, any payment disputes or delayed invoices create necessaries lien risk.

### C. CHANGE OF CONTROL COVENANTS - LENDER CONSENT REQUIREMENTS

#### 1. Standard Change of Control Provisions in Ship Mortgages

**Industry Practice:** Virtually all ship mortgage loan agreements contain "change of control" provisions that constitute an **Event of Default** if the borrower's ownership changes without lender consent.³²

**Typical Covenant Language (based on maritime finance market standards):**

> "Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld:
> (a) Sell, transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of any ownership interest in Borrower;
> (b) Merge, consolidate, or effect a change of control of Borrower;
> (c) Sell, mortgage, transfer, or charter the Vessel without Lender's consent."³³

**Policy Rationale:** Lenders extend ship mortgage financing based on:
- Borrower's maritime industry experience and operational expertise
- Borrower's creditworthiness and balance sheet strength
- Borrower's vessel management capabilities

A change of control to an unknown acquirer (Global Logistics Partners in this case) fundamentally alters the risk profile, justifying lender consent requirements.

#### 2. Government-Backed Ship Mortgage Precedent

While PMSC's $2.8B debt is commercial (not government-backed), government maritime lending provides instructive precedent for consent requirements:

**MARAD Title XI Program:** Loan agreements state that the borrower cannot "sell, mortgage, transfer, nor charter the Vessel" without prior written consent of the lender, **and such consent will not be unreasonably withheld**.³⁴

**National Marine Fisheries Service:** Government-backed fishing vessel mortgages similarly require borrower to obtain lender consent before ownership transfers.³⁵

**Implication:** "Consent not unreasonably withheld" standard suggests lenders must have legitimate credit-related reasons to deny consent (e.g., acquirer is insolvent, lacks maritime experience, or proposes to operate vessels in high-risk trades). Lenders cannot arbitrarily withhold consent to extract unrelated concessions.

#### 3. Typical Consent Timeline and Process

Based on maritime finance industry practice, the consent process typically follows this timeline:

**Day 0:** Definitive acquisition agreement signed between acquirer and target
**Day 1-5:** Borrower provides **written notice** to all lenders of pending change of control³⁶
**Day 5-10:** Borrower submits **consent request package** containing:
- Acquirer's audited financial statements (3 years)
- Acquirer's business plan and maritime operations experience
- Management bios demonstrating vessel management expertise
- Legal opinion confirming acquisition structure complies with loan covenants
- Updated vessel appraisals (if lender requests)

**Day 10-40:** Lender **credit review period** (30-60 days depending on loan agreement)³⁷
**Day 40-60:** Lender issues consent (unconditional, conditional, or denial)

**Consent Conditions Commonly Imposed by Lenders:**

1. **Covenant Amendments:**
   - Tighten debt/EBITDA ratio (e.g., from 4.5× to 5.0-5.5× to accommodate acquisition debt)
   - Increase minimum liquidity requirements
   - Add financial reporting frequency (quarterly instead of semi-annual)

2. **Increased Pricing:**
   - Interest rate margin increase (50-100 basis points typical)
   - Example: SOFR + 275 bps → SOFR + 325-375 bps
   - On $2.8B debt, 50 bps = $14M additional annual interest; 100 bps = $28M

3. **Mandatory Prepayment:**
   - Lender may require 10-20% principal paydown at closing
   - On $2.8B debt, 10% = $280M; 20% = $560M cash required

4. **Additional Security:**
   - Parent company guarantee (Global Logistics Partners guarantees PMSC's obligations)
   - Pledge of acquirer's equity interests in PMSC
   - Cross-collateralization with other assets

5. **Updated Vessel Appraisals:**
   - Lender may require independent appraisals (1-2 years old may be deemed stale)
   - Cost: $15,000-$25,000 per vessel × 22 vessels = $330,000-$550,000

#### 4. Lender-Specific Analysis for PMSC's $2.8B Debt

**Lender A: JP Morgan Maritime Finance ($1.2B, 43%)**

- **8 vessels:** Larger containerships and bulk carriers
- **Average loan:** $150M per vessel
- **Interest rate:** SOFR + 275 bps (currently ~8.1% assuming SOFR at 5.35%)
- **Maturity:** December 2028 (36 months remaining)
- **Change of control provision (typical):** Section 8.1(e) constitutes Event of Default, requiring lender consent within 30 days
- **Financial covenants:** Minimum $500M net worth (Global Logistics Partners likely satisfies), debt/EBITDA <4.5× (PMSC's current 3.8× compliant, but post-acquisition may breach)

**Consent Probability:** 70-80% (JP Morgan is sophisticated maritime lender, likely approves if acquirer demonstrates financial strength and vessel management plan)

**Potential Conditions:**
- 50 bps interest rate increase = $6M additional annual interest
- Updated vessel appraisals for 8 vessels = $120K-$200K
- Parent guarantee from Global Logistics Partners

---

**Lender B: DNB Bank ASA (Norwegian) ($880M, 31%)**

- **7 vessels:** Mid-size containerships
- **Syndicated facility:** 12 participating banks (DNB is administrative agent)
- **Interest rate:** SOFR + 300 bps (currently ~8.35%)
- **Maturity:** June 2029 (42 months remaining)
- **Change of control provision:** Requires **67% lender vote** to approve (syndicate consent threshold)
- **Consent timeline:** 45-60 days (longer than bilateral facilities due to syndicate coordination)

**Consent Probability:** 60-70% (syndicate decision-making is slower and more unpredictable; some participants may hold out for concessions)

**Potential Conditions:**
- 75 bps interest rate increase = $6.6M additional annual interest
- Mandatory 15% prepayment = $132M cash at closing
- Tightened LTV covenants (vessels must maintain 85% LTV vs. current 87.5% blended)

---

**Lender C: Citibank Maritime ($520M, 19%)**

- **5 vessels:** Tankers and product carriers
- **Interest rate:** SOFR + 325 bps (currently ~8.6%)
- **Maturity:** March 2027 (15 months remaining) - **REFINANCING RISK**
- **Change of control provision:** **Automatic consent** if acquirer satisfies creditworthiness threshold (net worth >$1B and investment grade rating OR net worth >$5B)

**Consent Probability:** 85-90% (Global Logistics Partners, as PE-backed logistics company, likely satisfies automatic consent criteria if net worth exceeds $1B)

**Refinancing Risk:** With only 15 months to maturity, this facility will require refinancing shortly after acquisition closes. Current ship mortgage market rates are SOFR + 400-450 bps (vs. existing 325 bps), representing potential $39M-$65M increased annual interest on $520M.³⁸

**Recommendation:** Negotiate with Citibank to **extend maturity** by 24-36 months as condition of change of control consent, avoiding near-term refinancing at higher market rates.

---

**Lender D: ING Bank ($200M, 7%)**

- **2 vessels:** Offshore supply vessels under construction at Philly Shipyard (U.S.-built, Jones Act compliant)
- **Construction financing:** $100M per vessel, vessels under construction, delivery Q2 2025
- **Interest rate:** SOFR + 350 bps (construction risk premium)
- **Maturity:** Delivery + 10 years (vessels deliver Q2 2025, loan matures Q2 2035)
- **Change of control provision:** Lender consent required **AND** construction guarantor consent required (Philly Shipyard may have guarantee)

**Consent Probability:** 50-60% (construction financing is higher risk; lender will scrutinize acquirer's ability to complete construction and manage offshore wind operations)

**Jones Act Compliance Risk (Cross-Reference T2):** Research plan indicates 2 offshore wind vessels may be foreign-built (COSCO China), which would violate Jones Act if used for U.S. coastwise trade. If these 2 vessels financed by ING Bank are the foreign-built vessels, ING may declare **immediate default** upon discovery, demanding $200M repayment.

**Critical Due Diligence:** Verify whether ING Bank's 2 financed vessels are:
- The U.S.-built vessels under construction at Philly Shipyard (Jones Act compliant) → consent likely
- OR the foreign-built COSCO vessels (Jones Act non-compliant) → default triggered, $200M refinancing required

### D. VESSEL VALUATION AND LOAN-TO-VALUE (LTV) COVENANT ANALYSIS

#### 1. Three Standard Vessel Valuation Methodologies

Professional vessel appraisals employ three recognized approaches under USPAP (Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice):³⁹

**Market Approach (Comparable Sales Method):**

The most common method, involving benchmarking a vessel against recent sales of comparable vessels. Appraisers obtain details from similar (though not identical) transactions and adjust selling prices to account for the subject vessel's specific characteristics.⁴⁰

**Challenge:** Unlike real estate, there is no publicly available database of vessel sales transactions, and buyers/sellers have little incentive to divulge prices, making comparable data difficult to obtain.⁴¹

**Cost Approach (Depreciated Replacement Cost):**

Values the vessel based on current replacement cost (what it would cost to build a new, identical vessel today) minus depreciation for age, physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and economic obsolescence.⁴²

**Challenge:** Quantifying depreciation is complex, as market conditions, technological advancements, and changing regulations (e.g., IMO environmental standards) all impact depreciation rates.⁴³

**Income Approach (Discounted Cash Flow):**

Calculates the vessel's net income over its remaining operational life and discounts future cash flows to present value. Highly sensitive to freight rate forecasts, which are volatile in maritime markets.⁴⁴

**Best Practice:** Professional appraisers consider all three methods and reconcile findings to develop a comprehensive opinion of market value, as research shows using only one or two methods does not reach accurate conclusions.⁴⁵

#### 2. PMSC Fleet Valuation - Current LTV Ratios

**Fleet Overview:**
- **Total vessels:** 22 (18 container ships, 4 bulk carriers)
- **Appraised value:** $3.2B (2024 appraisals)
- **Outstanding mortgage debt:** $2.8B
- **Blended LTV ratio:** 87.5% ($2.8B ÷ $3.2B)

**LTV Analysis by Lender:**

| Lender | Debt | # Vessels | Avg Value/Vessel | Avg Loan/Vessel | LTV |
|--------|------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-----|
| JP Morgan | $1.2B | 8 | $150M | $150M | 100% |
| DNB Bank | $880M | 7 | $126M | $126M | 100% |
| Citibank | $520M | 5 | $104M | $104M | 100% |
| ING Bank | $200M | 2 | $100M | $100M | 100% |

**Note:** The above assumes pro-rata allocation. Actual LTV ratios per vessel may vary based on individual appraisals and loan structures not provided in research materials.

**High LTV Risk:** At 87.5% blended LTV, PMSC has limited equity cushion. Ship mortgage industry standard for prudent lending is **70-80% LTV**.⁴⁶ PMSC's ratio suggests aggressive leverage, leaving little buffer for vessel value decline.

#### 3. LTV Covenant Breach Remedies

**Standard Ship Mortgage LTV Covenant:**

Ship mortgage agreements typically require vessels to maintain a maximum LTV ratio (e.g., 85-90% per vessel). The covenant protects lenders by ensuring collateral value exceeds the outstanding loan amount.⁴⁷

**Typical Covenant Language:**

> "The aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans shall not exceed 85% of the appraised market value of the Mortgaged Vessels as determined by independent appraisals conducted annually."⁴⁸

**Cure Rights for Breach:**

If vessel values decline and the LTV ratio exceeds the covenant threshold, the borrower typically has **30 days to cure** by either:⁴⁹
1. **Posting additional collateral** (mortgage another vessel, pledge cash)
2. **Prepaying loans** in an amount sufficient to restore LTV compliance

**Example:** If a vessel appraised at $150M declines to $120M, and the outstanding loan is $135M:
- Current LTV: 112.5% ($135M ÷ $120M)
- If covenant maximum is 90%, borrower must prepay $27M ($135M - [$120M × 90%])
- OR post $27M additional collateral

**Event of Default:** While some agreements provide cure rights, **failure to cure within 30 days constitutes an Event of Default**, allowing the lender to accelerate the loan and foreclose on the vessel.⁵⁰

**Enforceability:** The English court's decision in *The Alkyon* (2021) confirmed that LTV covenant breaches constitute valid Events of Default even where the borrower is current on principal and interest payments.⁵¹ However, lenders often prefer to give owners time to refinance or sell the vessel rather than force immediate foreclosure.

#### 4. CII "D" Rating Impact on Vessel Values

**IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) Regulatory Framework:**

Since January 1, 2023, IMO regulations require all vessels to receive annual CII ratings based on carbon emissions per ton-mile:⁵²
- **A:** Major superior performance (lowest emissions)
- **B:** Minor superior performance
- **C:** Moderate performance (baseline)
- **D:** Minor inferior performance
- **E:** Inferior performance (highest emissions)

**Corrective Action Plan Requirement:**

A vessel rated **D for three consecutive years** OR **E for one year** must submit a corrective action plan to the flag state showing how it will achieve a C rating or above. Failure to achieve C rating after the corrective action plan may result in trading restrictions.⁵³

**PMSC Fleet CII Status (from Research Plan):**

- **2 A-rated vessels:** Premium performance, no concerns
- **8 B-rated vessels:** Above-average performance
- **10 C-rated vessels:** Baseline compliance
- **2 D-rated bulk carriers:** M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge (poor fuel efficiency)

**Market Impact of D Ratings - Vessel Value Impairment:**

Research from VesselsValue and maritime finance sources in 2024 indicates:⁵⁴

1. **Reduced Liquidity:** Vessels rated E have substantially lower liquidity (4.2% trading frequency vs. higher frequencies for A-C rated vessels), and D-rated vessels show similar liquidity concerns.⁵⁵

2. **Two-Tier Market:** A bifurcated market has emerged, with A-C rated vessels achieving higher charter rates and sales prices than D-E rated vessels. Charterers increasingly prefer vessels with better environmental performance.⁵⁶

3. **Reduced Charter Income:** D-rated vessels experience reduced hire rates, potentially substantial reductions over a year's trading in 2024.⁵⁷

4. **Financing Concerns:** Lenders are hesitant to finance vessels with lower CII ratings due to uncertainty about long-term compliance with evolving environmental standards and concerns about portfolio climate alignment under Poseidon Principles.⁵⁸

**Quantified Value Impairment Estimate:**

Based on maritime finance industry analysis and market data:
- **D-rated vessel value impairment:** 20-30% discount vs. comparable C-rated vessels⁵⁹
- **PMSC's 2 D-rated bulk carriers:**
  - Current appraised value: $23M each (assumed based on bulk carrier market)
  - Post-impairment value: $16M-$18M each (30% discount = $16.1M; 20% discount = $18.4M)
  - **Aggregate write-down exposure: $10M-$14M** ($46M current value → $32M-$36M impaired value)

**LTV Covenant Breach Risk:**

If lenders conduct updated appraisals and apply CII-related discounts to the 2 D-rated vessels:
- Current loan balance on 2 D-rated vessels (estimated): $21M-$23M each = $42M-$46M total
- Post-impairment vessel value: $32M-$36M
- **LTV after impairment:** 128-144% (breach of typical 90% maximum)
- **Cure amount required:** $4M-$10M prepayment or additional collateral

**Cross-Reference to Environmental Compliance (T5):** This finding should be flagged for the Environmental Compliance specialist analyzing IMO regulations and CII corrective action plans.

#### 5. Covenant Headroom Analysis

**Definition:** Covenant headroom is the cushion between current metrics and covenant thresholds. Adequate headroom provides buffer against market volatility.

**PMSC Fleet Covenant Headroom:**

Assuming typical ship mortgage covenants require 90% maximum LTV per vessel:
- **Current blended LTV:** 87.5%
- **Covenant threshold:** 90%
- **Headroom:** 2.5% ($80M in value cushion on $3.2B fleet)

However, this aggregate analysis masks vessel-specific risks. If individual vessels are financed at 100% LTV (as estimated above), there is **zero headroom** on those vessels.

**Sensitivity Analysis - 10% Vessel Value Decline:**

If container shipping market experiences a downturn (e.g., freight rate collapse, oversupply) and vessel values decline 10%:
- New fleet value: $2.88B ($3.2B × 90%)
- Outstanding debt: $2.8B (unchanged)
- New LTV: 97.2%
- **Covenant breach:** Exceeds 90% threshold by 7.2%
- **Required cure:** $207M prepayment ($2.88B × 90% = $2.59B target debt)

**Recommendation:** Acquirer should negotiate with lenders to (1) obtain updated vessel appraisals at closing, (2) confirm covenant headroom on a per-vessel basis, and (3) consider prepaying $200M-$300M at closing to create adequate LTV cushion against market volatility.

### E. VESSEL ARREST AND FORECLOSURE PROCEDURES

#### 1. In Rem Admiralty Jurisdiction - Vessel as "Defendant"

**Legal Doctrine:** Under federal admiralty law (28 U.S.C. § 1333), a vessel is treated as a juridical person subject to *in rem* (against the thing) actions. Claimants with maritime liens can sue the vessel itself, not just the owner personally.⁶⁰

**Policy Rationale:** Maritime law historically recognized the vessel as security for maritime debts, allowing creditors to pursue the vessel even if ownership changes. This doctrine protects suppliers, crew, and other claimants who provide services or credit based on the vessel's identity, not the owner's credit.

#### 2. Vessel Arrest Procedure - Supplemental Rule C

**Governing Authority:** Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions, Rule C (In Rem Actions: Special Provisions).⁶¹

**Step 1: Filing Verified Complaint**

The arresting party files a **verified complaint** in U.S. District Court (admiralty jurisdiction), which includes written verification under penalty of perjury attesting to the truth of the allegations.⁶² The complaint must:
- Identify the vessel by name, official number, and location
- State the basis for the maritime lien (e.g., unpaid necessaries, preferred mortgage default)
- Specify the amount claimed

**Step 2: Issuance of Warrant of Arrest**

If the court finds probable cause, the Clerk issues a **Warrant of Arrest in Rem**, directed to the U.S. Marshal.⁶³ The arresting party must submit a memorandum of law explaining why the warrant should issue.

**Step 3: Deposit for Marshal's Costs**

The plaintiff must provide a **cash deposit** (typically $10,000) to the U.S. Marshal for:⁶⁴
- Cost of arresting the vessel
- Security services while vessel is under arrest
- Insurance during custody
- Wharfage and storage fees

**Step 4: Service by U.S. Marshal**

The U.S. Marshal or Deputy Marshal executes the warrant by physically serving it on the vessel. The Marshal takes **custody of the vessel** (custodia legis), typically by posting notice on the vessel's gangway and assuming control.⁶⁵

**Jurisdictional Limit:** Warrants may be executed only within the issuing district (exception: concurrent jurisdiction between Eastern and Southern Districts of New York).⁶⁶

**Step 5: Notice Requirements**

If the vessel is not released within **14 days** after execution of the warrant, the plaintiff must give **public notice** of the arrest as provided by Rule C(4), typically through publication in maritime trade journals.⁶⁷

**Special Notice for Mortgagees:** If the arresting party is a mortgagee, it must provide **written notice to all known lienholders**.⁶⁸

#### 3. Vessel Owner's Right to Contest Arrest

The vessel owner or operator is entitled to a **prompt hearing** in court to contest the appropriateness of the seizure. Grounds for challenging the arrest include:⁶⁹
- Lack of maritime lien (claimant's debt does not qualify)
- Improper jurisdiction (vessel arrested in wrong district)
- Insufficient amount claimed (lien amount exaggerated)

**Release by Posting Security:** The owner can obtain release by posting a **surety bond** or **letter of undertaking** from a P&I club in an amount equal to the claim plus estimated interest and costs. This substitutes the bond for the vessel as security.⁷⁰

#### 4. Foreclosure Sale by U.S. Marshal

If the claimant prevails on proof of the lien and the owner does not satisfy the judgment, the court orders a **judicial sale** of the vessel by the U.S. Marshal.⁷¹

**Marshal's Sale Procedure:**

1. **Appraisal:** Court-appointed appraiser values the vessel
2. **Public Advertisement:** Marshal publishes notice of sale (maritime press, local newspapers)
3. **Auction:** Vessel sold to highest bidder at public auction
4. **Marshal's Commission:** U.S. Marshal receives commission (typically 2-3% of sale price)
5. **Title Transfer:** Purchaser receives **Bill of Sale** from U.S. Marshal, conveying title **free and clear** of all liens⁷²

**Critical Legal Effect:** Under 46 U.S.C. § 31326(a), when a vessel is sold by court order in an admiralty in rem action, "any claim in the vessel existing on the date of sale is terminated, and the vessel is sold free of all those claims."⁷³ This provides purchasers with clean title, making U.S. Marshal's sales attractive for investors.

#### 5. Distribution of Sale Proceeds - Priority Waterfall

Sale proceeds are distributed according to the statutory priority hierarchy (46 U.S.C. § 31326):⁷⁴

**Priority 1: Custodia Legis Expenses**
- U.S. Marshal's costs (arrest, custody, sale)
- Court costs
- Wharfage and insurance during custody

**Priority 2: Preferred Maritime Liens (Super-Priority)**
- Crew wages (seamen, officers)
- Stevedore wages
- Maritime tort damages
- Salvage
- General average

**Priority 3: Preferred Ship Mortgages**
- First preferred mortgage paid first
- Second preferred mortgage paid from surplus (if any)

**Priority 4: Maritime Contract Liens Arising Before Mortgage**
- Necessaries liens (repairs, fuel, supplies)
- Other contract claims

**Priority 5: Unsecured Creditors**
- Any remaining proceeds distributed pro rata

**Deficiency Judgment:** If sale proceeds are insufficient to satisfy the preferred mortgage, the lender has a **personal recourse claim** against the borrower for the deficiency (difference between debt and sale proceeds).⁷⁵

#### 6. Example: Ship Mortgage Foreclosure with Multiple Lienholders

**Hypothetical (based on PMSC risk profile):**

M/V Pacific Titan (value $220M, mortgage $200M with JP Morgan) experiences a major casualty. PMSC stops making mortgage payments. JP Morgan forecloses, and the vessel is arrested and sold by U.S. Marshal for $180M (distressed sale discount).

**Claimants:**
1. U.S. Marshal custodia legis costs: $500K
2. Crew wages (unpaid wages during bankruptcy): $2M
3. Shipyard repair lien (emergency repairs before arrest): $8M
4. JP Morgan preferred mortgage: $200M balance

**Distribution:**
- U.S. Marshal: $500K (Priority 1)
- Crew wages: $2M (Priority 2 - super-priority)
- Remaining: $177.5M
- JP Morgan mortgage: $177.5M (Priority 3)
- Shipyard: **$0** (Priority 4 - subordinate to mortgage, no funds remaining)

**Deficiency:** JP Morgan has $22.5M deficiency claim against PMSC ($200M debt - $177.5M recovered).

**Key Insight:** Even though the shipyard's repair lien arose after JP Morgan's mortgage was recorded, the crew wage lien (Priority 2) has super-priority over the mortgage (Priority 3). The shipyard's necessaries lien ranks below the mortgage because the mortgage was recorded before the repairs were performed.

---

### F. VESSEL TITLE INSURANCE

#### 1. Maritime Title Insurance - Coverage and Purpose

**Definition:** Vessel title insurance protects purchasers and lenders against **undisclosed maritime liens** and defects in vessel ownership or mortgage priority.⁷⁶

**Why Needed - Hidden Lien Risk:**

Unlike real estate liens (recorded in county registries), **maritime liens do not appear on public registers**. A necessaries lien, crew wage lien, or tort claim arises **automatically** when the debt is incurred, without any filing requirement.⁷⁷ This creates risk for purchasers and lenders:

- Vessel may have unrecorded liens from prior operations
- Bunker suppliers, repair yards, or crew members may assert liens months or years after services rendered
- Maritime liens **survive changes of ownership**, even by good faith purchasers⁷⁸

**Example:** Acquirer purchases a vessel for $50M, unaware that the prior owner owes $1M in unpaid bunker fuel invoices. The bunker supplier arrests the vessel 6 months after purchase. Even though the acquirer bought the vessel in good faith, the bunker supplier's necessaries lien attaches to the vessel, and the acquirer must pay the $1M lien to release the vessel from arrest.

#### 2. Coverage Provided by Maritime Title Insurance

**Standard Coverage:**

Maritime title insurance policies cover:⁷⁹
- **Undisclosed maritime liens** (necessaries, crew wages, tort claims)
- **Ownership disputes** (rival claimants to vessel title)
- **Defective mortgage recording** (errors in NVDC filings affecting preferred mortgage priority)
- **Document forgery** (fraudulent bills of sale or mortgage documents)
- **Errors in vessel documentation** (defective Coast Guard documentation)

**Exclusions:**

Typical policies exclude:
- **Known liens** (disclosed in due diligence)
- **Post-policy liens** (arising after policy effective date)
- **Environmental contamination** (pollution cleanup costs require separate OPA 90 insurance)
- **Governmental fines and penalties**

#### 3. Underwriters and Premium Costs

**Specialized Underwriters:**

Maritime title insurance is a niche product offered by specialized marine insurance underwriters, including:⁸⁰
- **NorthStandard** (formerly North of England P&I Club)
- **UK P&I Club**
- **West of England P&I Club**
- **Shipowners' Club**
- **Commercial marine insurance underwriters** (Lloyd's of London syndicates)

**Note:** INTERTANKO (International Association of Independent Tanker Owners) is a trade association, not an insurance provider. However, INTERTANKO members often use the P&I clubs listed above.

**Premium Calculation:**

Maritime title insurance premiums are calculated as a **one-time premium** based on vessel value:⁸¹
- **Rate:** 0.5-1.0% of vessel value
- **PMSC Fleet:** 22 vessels, $3.2B appraised value
- **Estimated Premium:** $16M-$32M (one-time cost at closing)

**Premium Factors:**
- **Vessel age and type:** Older vessels with complex trading histories = higher premiums
- **Prior ownership:** Multiple prior owners = higher lien search costs
- **Trading routes:** Vessels trading in high-risk jurisdictions = higher premiums
- **Distressed sales:** Bankruptcy sales or foreclosure purchases = higher premiums due to elevated lien risk

#### 4. Due Diligence Benefit of Title Insurance

**Underwriter's Pre-Binding Lien Search:**

Before issuing a policy, the title insurance underwriter conducts a **comprehensive lien search**:⁸²
- USCG NVDC records (preferred mortgages, recorded liens)
- UCC-1 financing statements (state-level security interests)
- Federal court dockets (pending admiralty cases, arrests)
- Crew wage payment verification
- Bunker fuel supplier invoices
- Shipyard and repair yard invoice audits

If the lien search reveals undisclosed liens, the underwriter either:
- **Excludes the lien** from coverage (scheduled exception)
- **Requires payoff** before binding coverage
- **Increases premium** to reflect risk

**PMSC Application:** Given the $2.8B in existing ship mortgages and 87.5% LTV ratio, lenders may **require** the acquirer to obtain title insurance as a closing condition. This provides dual benefits:
1. **Protects acquirer** from undisclosed lien surprises
2. **Protects lenders** by ensuring their preferred mortgages have unimpaired priority

#### 5. Recommendation: Bind Title Insurance on All 22 Vessels

**Rationale:**

The $16M-$32M premium cost (0.5-1% of $3.2B fleet value) is **prudent risk management** given:
- **High LTV:** 87.5% leverage leaves little equity cushion for lien surprises
- **Complex operations:** 22 vessels trading globally = extensive supplier/creditor exposure
- **$2.8B lender consent:** Lenders may condition change of control consent on title insurance
- **22-vessel portfolio:** Aggregating coverage across entire fleet may yield volume discounts

**Implementation:**

1. **RFP to Underwriters:** Issue request for proposals to NorthStandard, UK P&I, West of England P&I
2. **Pre-Closing Lien Search:** Engage underwriter 60 days before closing to conduct lien searches
3. **Policy Binding:** Bind policies at closing, effective upon transfer of vessel ownership
4. **Lender Loss Payee:** Name lenders (JP Morgan, DNB, Citibank, ING) as additional insureds / loss payees

---

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| Change of control consent denial (4 lenders, $2.8B debt) | **CRITICAL** | 20-40% | File consent requests immediately; prepare refinancing alternatives; negotiate maturity extensions |
| Lender-imposed interest rate increases (50-100 bps) | **HIGH** | 70-80% | Budget $14M-$28M additional annual interest expense; negotiate fixed-rate swaps |
| Mandatory prepayment at closing (10-20% of debt) | **HIGH** | 40-60% | Secure $280M-$560M bridge financing; negotiate phased prepayment schedule |
| LTV covenant breach (87.5% current, 90% threshold) | **HIGH** | 30-40% | Obtain updated vessel appraisals; prepay $200M-$300M at closing to create headroom |
| CII D-rated vessel value impairment ($10M-$14M) | **MEDIUM** | 60-80% | Budget for write-down; implement corrective action plans (fuel optimization, speed reduction) |
| Citibank refinancing risk (March 2027 maturity, 15 months) | **HIGH** | 100% | Negotiate 24-36 month maturity extension; alternative: refinance at closing at higher rates |
| Undisclosed necessaries liens ($2M-$5M estimated) | **MEDIUM** | 40-50% | Bind vessel title insurance ($16M-$32M premium); conduct comprehensive lien searches |
| Crew wage super-priority liens (if payroll arrears exist) | **HIGH** | 10-15% | Verify current payroll status; escrow 60 days wages ($16M-$24M) if arrears exist |
| ING Bank Jones Act compliance default ($200M) | **CRITICAL** | 50-60% (if vessels are foreign-built) | Verify vessel build origin; refinance $200M if COSCO vessels trigger default |
| Martinez tort judgment lien ($8.5M claim) | **MEDIUM** | 80% (judgment likely) | Cross-reference T2/T6; maritime lien has super-priority over mortgages |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

1. **Vessel Appraisal Staleness:**
   - Research plan indicates 2024 appraisals, but lenders may require appraisals <12 months old
   - **Action:** Confirm appraisal dates; budget $330K-$550K for updated appraisals if required

2. **Bunker Fuel Payment Status:**
   - $480M annual bunker cost = $80M average 60-day payables
   - Unpaid bunker invoices create necessaries liens with priority over mortgages (if foreign suppliers)
   - **Action:** Audit accounts payable aging report for all 22 vessels; identify invoices >60 days overdue

3. **Construction Financing Vessel Identity (ING Bank $200M):**
   - Research plan ambiguity: Are ING's 2 financed vessels the U.S.-built Philly Shipyard vessels OR the foreign-built COSCO vessels?
   - If COSCO vessels: Jones Act violation triggers immediate loan default
   - **Action:** Obtain vessel construction contracts; confirm build location and Jones Act compliance

4. **DNB Bank Syndicate Participant Identities:**
   - Syndicate of 12 banks requires 67% vote for change of control consent
   - Unknown participants may have divergent risk appetites
   - **Action:** Obtain syndicate participant list; pre-socialize acquisition with key lenders

5. **Crew Wage Payment Verification:**
   - 2,400 crew members across 22 vessels = $16M-$24M biweekly payroll
   - Any unpaid wages have super-priority over $2.8B mortgages
   - **Action:** Obtain crew payroll reports for past 6 months; verify no disputes or delayed bonuses

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis

**Quantified Exposure Summary:**

| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Probability | Expected Value |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Change of Control Costs** |
| Interest rate increase (50-100 bps × $2.8B) | $14M/year | $28M/year | 70% | $19.6M/year |
| Mandatory prepayment (10-20% of $2.8B) | $280M | $560M | 50% | $420M |
| Updated vessel appraisals (22 vessels) | $330K | $550K | 80% | $352K |
| **Refinancing Risk** |
| Citibank refinancing at higher rates (March 2027) | $39M/year | $65M/year | 100% | $52M/year |
| ING Bank Jones Act default refinancing | $200M | $200M | 55% | $110M |
| **Vessel Valuation Risks** |
| CII D-rated vessel write-down (2 vessels) | $10M | $14M | 70% | $12M |
| LTV covenant breach cure (10% value decline) | $207M | $207M | 35% | $72M |
| **Maritime Lien Exposure** |
| Necessaries liens (bunker fuel, repairs) | $2M | $5M | 45% | $3.2M |
| Crew wage liens (if arrears exist) | $0 | $24M | 12% | $2.9M |
| Martinez Section 905(b) judgment lien | $2M | $5M | 80% | $3.6M |
| **Title Insurance** |
| Vessel title insurance premium (22 vessels) | $16M | $32M | 100% (recommended) | $24M |
| **TOTAL EXPOSURE** | **$570M + $65M/year** | **$1.14B + $121M/year** | | **$714M + $72M/year** |

**Notes:**
- One-time costs: Mandatory prepayment, refinancing, write-downs, title insurance, lien payoffs
- Annual recurring costs: Interest rate increases, Citibank refinancing
- Expected value = probability-weighted exposure

**Five-Year NPV of Exposure (7% discount rate):**
- Annual costs: $72M/year × 4.1 (5-year annuity factor) = $295M
- One-time costs: $714M
- **Total NPV: $1.009 billion** (21% of $4.8B purchase price)

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Preferred Ship Mortgage Structure is Valid and Enforceable**
   - All 22 PMSC vessels are U.S.-flagged and documented with Coast Guard NVDC
   - 4 lenders ($2.8B total) hold properly recorded preferred ship mortgages under 46 U.S.C. Chapter 313
   - Mortgages have priority over most claims except super-priority maritime liens (crew wages, stevedore wages, torts, salvage)

2. **Change of Control Consent is Mandatory Closing Condition**
   - All 4 loan agreements contain change of control provisions constituting Event of Default
   - Consent process requires 30-60 days (longer for DNB Bank syndicate requiring 67% vote)
   - Lenders will likely impose conditions: interest rate increases (50-100 bps), mandatory prepayments (10-20%), parent guarantees, updated appraisals
   - **Estimated incremental cost: $14M-$28M annual interest + $280M-$560M one-time prepayment**

3. **High Leverage (87.5% LTV) Creates Significant Covenant Breach Risk**
   - Industry standard prudent LTV: 70-80%; PMSC's 87.5% leaves minimal cushion
   - 10% vessel value decline triggers LTV covenant breach requiring $207M prepayment or additional collateral
   - CII D-rated vessels (M/V Sierra Nevada, M/V Cascade Ridge) face $10M-$14M value impairment, exacerbating LTV risk

4. **Necessaries Liens and Crew Wages Have Super-Priority Over Mortgages**
   - $2M-$5M estimated exposure from unpaid bunker fuel, repairs, port services (typical 60-90 day payables)
   - Crew wages (if unpaid) have absolute priority over $2.8B mortgages under 46 U.S.C. § 31326(b)(1)
   - Martinez Section 905(b) tort judgment ($2M-$5M expected) becomes maritime lien with super-priority if verdict obtained

5. **Citibank Refinancing Risk (March 2027 Maturity) is Material**
   - $520M facility matures in 15 months post-closing
   - Current market rates SOFR + 400-450 bps vs. existing 325 bps = $39M-$65M additional annual interest
   - **Recommendation:** Negotiate maturity extension as condition of change of control consent

6. **Vessel Title Insurance is Prudent Risk Management**
   - Maritime liens do not appear on public registers (arise automatically upon debt incurrence)
   - Title insurance ($16M-$32M premium) protects against undisclosed liens and defective mortgage priority
   - Lenders may require title insurance as closing condition given high LTV

### B. Recommended Next Steps

#### Pre-Closing Actions (60-90 Days Before Closing)

1. **File Change of Control Consent Requests (Day 1-5):**
   - Notify all 4 lenders within 5 business days of signing definitive agreement
   - Submit consent package: acquirer financials, management bios, business plan, legal opinions
   - For DNB Bank syndicate: engage administrative agent to coordinate 12-bank vote

2. **Conduct Comprehensive Maritime Lien Search (Day 1-60):**
   - Engage vessel title insurance underwriter (NorthStandard, UK P&I, West of England P&I)
   - Search USCG NVDC records, UCC-1 filings, federal court admiralty dockets
   - Audit accounts payable aging: bunker fuel, shipyard repairs, port services
   - Verify crew payroll current (no unpaid wages, bonuses, or disputes)

3. **Obtain Updated Vessel Appraisals (If >12 Months Old):**
   - Engage independent maritime appraisers (ABS, DNV, Lloyd's Register)
   - Apply all three valuation methods: market approach, cost approach, income approach
   - Apply CII rating discount to 2 D-rated vessels (20-30% impairment)
   - **Budget:** $15K-$25K per vessel × 22 vessels = $330K-$550K

4. **Verify Jones Act Compliance for ING Bank Financed Vessels:**
   - Obtain construction contracts for 2 offshore wind vessels
   - Confirm vessels are U.S.-built at Philly Shipyard (Jones Act compliant)
   - If COSCO China-built: prepare $200M refinancing to cure ING Bank default

5. **Negotiate Maturity Extension with Citibank:**
   - Propose 24-36 month extension (March 2027 → March 2029-2030)
   - Offer incentives: parent guarantee, interest rate increase (25-50 bps), covenant tightening
   - Alternative: refinance $520M at closing at SOFR + 400-450 bps (budget $39M-$65M/year)

#### Closing Conditions

6. **Condition Precedent: Receipt of All Lender Consents**
   - Obtain written consent or waiver from JP Morgan, DNB Bank (67% syndicate vote), Citibank, ING Bank
   - If consent denied: financing out clause allows acquirer to terminate OR acquirer arranges alternative refinancing

7. **Payoff of Identified Necessaries Liens:**
   - Escrow funds to pay identified necessaries liens discovered in lien search
   - Obtain lien releases from bunker suppliers, shipyards, stevedores before closing

8. **No Vessel Arrests or Pending In Rem Actions:**
   - Representation and warranty: No vessels subject to arrest, attachment, or admiralty proceedings as of closing
   - If arrest occurs pre-closing: suspend closing pending resolution

9. **Bind Vessel Title Insurance on All 22 Vessels:**
   - Issue RFP to 3 underwriters; obtain binding quotes
   - Premium: $16M-$32M (0.5-1% of $3.2B fleet value)
   - Name lenders as loss payees; effective date = closing date

#### Post-Closing Covenants

10. **Maintain LTV Ratios and Obtain Annual Appraisals:**
    - Comply with lender covenant requiring maximum 90% LTV per vessel
    - Obtain independent appraisals annually; provide copies to lenders
    - If LTV breached: cure within 30 days by prepayment or additional collateral

11. **Implement CII Corrective Action Plans for D-Rated Vessels:**
    - M/V Sierra Nevada and M/V Cascade Ridge must achieve C rating or better
    - Strategies: fuel optimization, slow steaming, engine efficiency upgrades
    - Budget: $150K-$250K per vessel for enhanced maintenance (cross-reference T5)

12. **Comply with Jones Act Crew Requirements:**
    - Maintain 75% U.S. citizen crew on all Jones Act vessels
    - Avoid vessel forfeiture and $39.6M per-voyage penalties (cross-reference T2)

### C. Outstanding Questions

1. **What are the specific change of control covenant provisions in each of the 4 loan agreements?**
   - Research plan estimates typical provisions, but actual loan documents not reviewed
   - Critical to understand: consent timeline (30 vs. 60 days), automatic consent thresholds (Citibank), cure rights

2. **What are the actual vessel-by-vessel LTV ratios?**
   - Analysis assumes pro-rata allocation ($2.8B debt ÷ 22 vessels)
   - Actual LTV may vary significantly by vessel (e.g., older vessels higher LTV, newer vessels lower LTV)
   - Need individual vessel appraisals and loan allocation schedules

3. **Are ING Bank's 2 financed vessels the U.S.-built or foreign-built offshore wind vessels?**
   - Research plan ambiguity creates material risk ($200M default exposure if foreign-built)
   - Need construction contracts and vessel build certificates

4. **What is the composition of DNB Bank's 12-bank syndicate?**
   - Unknown participant identities and voting dynamics
   - Some participants may be more risk-averse or demand higher pricing

5. **What is the status of Martinez Section 905(b) tort case?**
   - Trial scheduled Q3 2025 (post-closing)
   - If judgment obtained, becomes maritime lien with super-priority over mortgages
   - Need case status update and settlement prospects (cross-reference T2, T6)

### Known Limitations

1. **Ship Mortgage Loan Agreements Not Reviewed:**
   - Analysis of change of control consent provisions, LTV covenants, financial covenants, and cure rights based on maritime finance industry standards
   - Actual loan documents may contain different terms, timelines, or automatic consent thresholds
   - **Mitigation:** Research extensively cited industry sources (HFW, Seward & Kissel, maritime finance market practice) to ensure analysis reflects typical ship mortgage structures

2. **Vessel Appraisals Not Reviewed:**
   - Vessel-by-vessel valuations unknown; analysis uses aggregate $3.2B appraised value from research plan
