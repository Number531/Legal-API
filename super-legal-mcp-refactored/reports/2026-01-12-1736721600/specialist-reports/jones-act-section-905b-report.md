## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This research memorandum analyzes Jones Act compliance requirements and Section 905(b) vessel negligence liability for Global Logistics Partners' proposed $4.8B acquisition of Pacific Maritime Services Corporation (PMSC). The research addresses three critical issues: (1) Jones Act crew citizenship violations on two vessels, (2) foreign-built offshore wind vessels ineligible for U.S. operations, and (3) a pending $8.5M Section 905(b) personal injury claim (Martinez v. PMSC) scheduled for trial Q3 2025.

### Key Takeaways:

**1. Jones Act Crew Citizenship Violations — MINIMAL EXPOSURE (User Prompt Overstated Risk)**

Two PMSC vessels (M/V Cascade Spirit, M/V Columbia Express) operate with 73% U.S. citizen crew, below the 75% statutory minimum required under 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b). The user prompt stated "$39.6M penalty per voyage + vessel forfeiture" for these violations. **This is factually incorrect.** Research confirms that crew citizenship violations under § 8103 carry a civil penalty of **$500 per individual**, not per voyage or per ton of merchandise. The $39.6M figure appears to conflate two separate statutory provisions:
- **46 U.S.C. § 8103 (crew citizenship):** $500 per individual civil penalty
- **46 U.S.C. § 55102 (coastwise trade merchandise):** Forfeiture of merchandise OR value of merchandise

**CORRECTED EXPOSURE:** $500-$1,000 per vessel if detected by Coast Guard audit (total $1,000-$2,000 one-time penalty). Coast Guard audit probability is low (5-10% annually based on enforcement statistics showing 108 violations nationwide per year across thousands of U.S.-documented vessels).

**CORRECTIVE ACTION:** Hire 4 additional U.S. citizen mariners (2 per vessel) within 90 days post-closing. Cost: $620K/year ongoing ($155K annual salary × 4 crew). This is a **condition precedent** to closing or must be completed within 90 days post-acquisition to ensure Coast Guard compliance.

**2. Offshore Wind Vessels Foreign-Built — MATERIAL EXPOSURE ($5M-$56M)**

PMSC has two crew transfer vessels (CTVs) under construction at COSCO China (foreign shipyard). Research confirms that **CTVs engaged in U.S. offshore wind operations must be Jones Act-compliant** (U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-owned, U.S.-crewed) because they transport construction workers (passengers) and supplies (merchandise) between U.S. points, constituting coastwise trade under 46 U.S.C. § 55102. U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed this interpretation on August 21, 2024.

**PMSC's foreign-built vessels are NOT Jones Act-compliant and cannot be used for U.S. offshore wind operations.** This represents a **$35M stranded investment** (per user prompt). Remedial options:
- **Cancel construction:** Lose $5M-$8M in deposits
- **Re-order U.S.-built vessels:** $44M-$56M additional capital
- **Deploy to foreign offshore wind markets:** Limits revenue potential, uncertain ROI

**RECOMMENDATION:** Negotiate **$6.5M purchase price reduction** to reflect stranded investment (assume cancellation scenario, midpoint of $5M-$8M deposit loss range). Alternatively, require seller to cancel contracts pre-closing and absorb deposit loss.

**3. Martinez § 905(b) Vessel Negligence Case — MATERIAL EXPOSURE ($2M-$6M)**

Martinez v. PMSC is a pending Section 905(b) claim arising from a September 2023 incident in which a longshoreman suffered bilateral leg fractures and permanent disability when crushed by container lashing gear (alleged defective hatch cover) on M/V Pacific Horizon. Martinez has already received $420K in LHWCA workers' compensation benefits and is seeking $8.5M in tort damages ($1.2M medical + $2.8M lost wages + $4.5M pain/suffering). Trial is scheduled Q3 2025 (post-closing).

**Liability Analysis Under *Scindia* Three-Part Test:**

The U.S. Supreme Court in *Scindia Steam Navigation Co. v. De Los Santos*, 451 U.S. 156 (1981), established three vessel owner duties under Section 905(b):
1. **Turnover duty:** Vessel owner must exercise ordinary care regarding condition of ship's gear/equipment at commencement of stevedoring operations and warn stevedore of hidden dangers.
2. **Active control duty:** Vessel owner liable if it actively involves itself in cargo operations and negligently injures longshoreman.
3. **Duty to intervene:** Vessel owner must intervene if it has actual knowledge of dangerous condition and stevedore fails to correct it.

**Most likely liability theory:** **Turnover duty** — defective hatch cover at commencement of operations. PMSC's defense is that the hatch cover passed inspection in August 2023 (one month before incident), suggesting no actual knowledge of defect. However, if inspection records are weak or show pattern of deferred maintenance, PMSC's defense weakens significantly.

**Comparative Negligence:** Washington state applies **pure comparative negligence** (RCW 4.22.005), meaning Martinez's recovery will be reduced by his percentage of fault. If Martinez is found 30-40% at fault (e.g., failed to stand clear of lashing gear, violated safety protocols), the verdict would be reduced proportionally from $8.5M claimed to $5.1M-$6.0M range (before further reduction for weak liability showing).

**Punitive Damages Risk:** Recent Eastern District of Louisiana case (*In re Rodi Marine, LLC*) held that punitive damages may be awarded under Section 905(b) if vessel owner's conduct constitutes gross negligence. The Martinez claim may include punitive damages if PMSC had prior knowledge of hatch cover defects or pattern of safety violations. **Estimated punitive damages risk: 15-25% probability, $1M-$3M additional exposure if triggered.**

**Settlement Range [METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment]:** **$2.0M-$3.5M** (expected pre-trial settlement). Factors:
- Jury sympathy for injured longshoremen is high
- PMSC's inspection defense strength depends on quality of August 2023 inspection records
- Comparative fault likely 30-40% (Martinez's conduct)
- Both parties face verdict uncertainty; insurance carriers typically pressure settlement

**Verdict Range (if no settlement):** **$3.5M-$6.0M** after comparative fault reduction (best case $2.0M if 50% comparative fault; worst case $6.0M+ if minimal comparative fault and punitive damages)

**RECOMMENDATION:** This is a **known liability** that must be addressed in purchase agreement:
- **Option 1:** Require seller to settle pre-closing (target $2.5M-$3.0M within insurance policy limits)
- **Option 2:** **$3.0M purchase price reduction** (midpoint of settlement range)
- **Option 3:** **$5.0M escrow** held 18 months post-closing to secure seller indemnification for verdict/settlement

**4. Successor Liability — Stock Purchase Assumes All Pre-Closing Liabilities**

The transaction is structured as a **stock purchase** (acquire 100% equity of PMSC), meaning Global Logistics Partners will assume **all PMSC liabilities**, including the Martinez case and any unknown maritime tort claims. In asset purchases, the buyer can avoid many predecessor liabilities, but in stock purchases, the acquiring company inherits all contingent and unliquidated liabilities by operation of law.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Robust indemnification provisions:** Seller indemnifies buyer for all pre-closing liabilities, including maritime tort claims (18-24 month survival period)
- **Escrow/holdback:** $15M-$25M escrow to secure indemnification obligations
- **Insurance:** Representations & warranties insurance ($100M policy recommended with 10% retention = $10M) covering unknown/undisclosed liabilities

**5. Vessel Forfeiture Risk — Merchandise Violations (Hypothetical)**

46 U.S.C. § 55102(c) provides for **forfeiture of merchandise** (NOT vessel forfeiture) for coastwise trade violations, OR penalty equal to the greater of merchandise value or cost of transportation. If a Jones Act vessel carries non-Jones Act cargo between U.S. points, the cargo value is at risk ($300K-$500K per voyage based on M/V Cascade Spirit and M/V Columbia Express cargo values). **No evidence of such violations in user prompt.** This is a hypothetical risk that can be mitigated through fleet-wide Jones Act compliance audit post-closing.

### Risk Assessment: **MEDIUM-HIGH** (Offshore Wind + Martinez Case)

The primary risks are:
1. **$6.5M stranded investment** in foreign-built offshore wind vessels (certain exposure, 100% probability)
2. **$2M-$6M Martinez settlement/verdict** (high probability, 70-80% settlement likely)
3. **$620K/year ongoing cost** to correct crew citizenship deficiencies (certain)

**Total probability-weighted exposure: $9.75M** (Jones Act crew $1K + Offshore wind $6.5M + Martinez $2.8M + Punitive damages $450K)

- Maritime law firm publications (Jones Walker, King & Jurgens, Kreindler)
- M&A/successor liability legal analysis (Taft Law, Ballard Spahr, Shipman & Goodwin)
- State law comparative negligence resources (Washington state)

**Date Range:** Statutory provisions current through 2024; case law 1981-2024; regulatory guidance 2023-2024 (CBP August 2024, USCG 2023-2024)

### C. Limitations and Caveats

**1. Martinez Case Litigation File Not Reviewed:**
This analysis is based on facts provided in the user prompt. A complete assessment of PMSC's liability and defense strength requires review of:
- Complete litigation file (complaint, discovery responses, depositions)
- Vessel inspection and maintenance records for M/V Pacific Horizon (2020-2023)
- Expert reports (causation, damages, comparative negligence)
- Insurance coverage information (P&I club policy limits, MEL coverage, reservation of rights)

**2. Settlement/Verdict Range Based on Expert Judgment:**
The estimated settlement range ($2.0M-$3.5M) and verdict range ($3.5M-$6.0M) are based on general maritime personal injury settlement/verdict trends and expert judgment applying the *Scindia* framework to Martinez's injuries. **Actual settlement/verdict value depends on factual development** that cannot be assessed without reviewing the litigation file.

**3. Punitive Damages Availability Uncertain in Ninth Circuit:**
The Eastern District of Louisiana recognized punitive damages availability under Section 905(b) in *In re Rodi Marine, LLC*, but the Fifth Circuit has not ruled. **The Ninth Circuit (Martinez's venue) has not definitively addressed this issue.** The 15-25% probability estimate is based on limited precedent.

**4. Offshore Wind Vessel Construction Contracts Not Reviewed:**
The analysis assumes $5M-$8M deposit forfeiture per user prompt. **Actual cancellation costs depend on contract terms**, construction progress (percentage complete), and negotiation with COSCO China. A higher or lower deposit forfeiture may apply.

**5. Coast Guard Crew Citizenship Enforcement Probability:**
The 5-10% annual audit probability is based on 2005-2009 Coast Guard enforcement statistics (108 violations nationwide per year). **Actual audit probability may be higher if PMSC has prior violations** or if Coast Guard targets Jones Act fleet operators for compliance sweeps.

**6. Jones Act Fleet Cargo Operations Not Audited:**
This analysis assumes PMSC's 6 Jones Act vessels are operating in compliance with coastwise trade restrictions (U.S. cargo between U.S. points only). **A full fleet audit of voyage records, cargo manifests, and crew lists (2022-2024) is recommended** to verify no coastwise trade violations (non-Jones Act cargo between U.S. points).

**7. Indemnification Enforceability:**
The analysis recommends seller indemnification with escrow/holdback for Martinez settlement/verdict. **Enforceability depends on seller's financial condition post-closing.** If PMSC's current owners are taking cash and exiting (vs. rolling equity), adequate escrow is critical to secure indemnification obligations.

## IV. DETAILED ANALYSIS

### A. JONES ACT CREW CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS (46 U.S.C. § 8103)

#### 1. Statutory Framework

**46 U.S.C. § 8103 — The 75/25 Rule**

The Jones Act crew citizenship requirement, codified at 46 U.S.C. § 8103, commonly referred to as the "75/25 Rule," mandates that **75 percent of the seamen, excluding licensed individuals, on a United States documented vessel be United States citizens**, except for fishing or whaling vessels or yachts.¹ Not more than 25 percent of the total number of unlicensed seamen on the vessel may be aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.²

**Officer Requirements:** Subsection (a) requires that the master, chief engineer, or officer in charge of a deck or engineering watch on a United States documented vessel be a United States citizen.³

**Verified: 46 U.S.C. § 8103(a)-(b) [VERIFIED via Cornell Legal Information Institute]**

#### 2. PMSC Fleet Non-Compliance

**Two Vessels Below 75% Threshold:**
- **M/V Cascade Spirit:** 73% U.S. citizen crew (2% below threshold)
- **M/V Columbia Express:** 73% U.S. citizen crew (2% below threshold)

**Calculation Methodology:** The Coast Guard Hearing Office determines compliance by calculating the percentage of aliens lawfully admitted to the U.S. for permanent residence as a proportion of the total number of unlicensed seamen from applicable categories.⁴

#### 3. Penalty Exposure

**Civil Penalties Under 46 U.S.C. § 8103:**

A person employing an individual in violation of this section or a regulation prescribed under this section is liable to the United States Government for a **civil penalty of $500 for each individual so employed**.⁵

**PMSC Exposure Calculation:**
- Each vessel with 73% U.S. crew (vs. 75% required) has approximately 2% excess foreign crew
- Assuming crew complement of 20-25 unlicensed seamen per vessel, approximately 1-2 excess foreign crew members per vessel
- Civil penalty: $500 per individual per violation
- **Per-voyage exposure:** Minimal ($500-$1,000) if detected and cited

**Coast Guard Enforcement Statistics:**
During the period of 2005 to 2009, the Coast Guard issued an average of 108 reports of violations of 46 U.S.C. § 8103, with 75 such reports of violations issued during 2009.⁶ The Coast Guard is the primary enforcement agency for these citizenship requirements, with enforcement handled through their Hearing Offices.⁷

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION — User Prompt Overstated Penalty Risk:**

The user prompt stated: "Jones Act crew non-compliance: $39.6M penalty per voyage + vessel forfeiture if caught." This appears to conflate two different statutory provisions:

1. **46 U.S.C. § 8103 (crew citizenship):** $500 per individual civil penalty
2. **46 U.S.C. § 55102 (coastwise trade merchandise):** Vessel forfeiture OR value of merchandise/cost of transportation

**The $39.6M figure appears to derive from 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c) merchandise forfeiture provisions, NOT crew citizenship violations under § 8103.**

---

### B. JONES ACT BUILD AND COASTWISE TRADE REQUIREMENTS (46 U.S.C. § 55102)

#### 1. Statutory Framework

**46 U.S.C. § 55102 — Transportation of Merchandise**

A vessel may not provide any part of the transportation of merchandise by water between points in the United States unless the vessel is:
1. **Wholly owned by citizens of the United States** for purposes of engaging in the coastwise trade, and
2. **Has been issued a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement** under chapter 121.⁸

**Built-in-United States Requirement:** The requirement that the vessel be built in the United States is incorporated through the coastwise endorsement requirements rather than stated directly in § 55102.⁹

**Verified: 46 U.S.C. § 55102(b) [VERIFIED via Cornell Legal Information Institute]**

#### 2. Penalties and Forfeiture

**46 U.S.C. § 55102(c) — Penalties:**

Merchandise transported in violation of subsection (b) is **liable to seizure by and forfeiture to the Government**.¹⁰ Alternatively, **an amount equal to the value of the merchandise (as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security) or the actual cost of the transportation, whichever is greater**, may be recovered from any person transporting the merchandise.¹¹

**IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION:** The statute does **NOT impose a "per ton" penalty** for merchandise violations under 46 USC 55102. The penalty is based on either:
1. Seizure and forfeiture of the merchandise, OR
2. The greater of: (a) the value of the merchandise, or (b) the actual cost of transportation¹²

**Distinction from Vessel Towing Penalties:** 46 USC 55111 (vessel towing) provides for a different penalty structure: $1,100 and $60 per ton of the towed vessel.¹³

#### 3. Offshore Wind Vessels — Jones Act Applicability

**PMSC's Two Offshore Wind Service Vessels Under Construction (COSCO China — Foreign-Built):**

**Crew Transfer Vessels (CTVs) — Jones Act Compliance Required:**

Crew transfer vessels (CTVs) are used to transport construction workers from shore to a wind farm or between turbines. Since they are engaging in transportation between U.S. points, **they fall under Jones Act requirements**.¹⁴ Construction workers are considered **passengers**, so vessels transporting workers to offshore energy structures are **required to be Jones Act compliant**.¹⁵ Similarly, supplies and food for the workers are considered **merchandise**, requiring transporting vessels to be Jones Act compliant.¹⁶

**CBP 2024 Interpretations:**

U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed on **August 21, 2024**, its Jones Act interpretations relating to the installation of foundations for an offshore wind project.¹⁷ Additionally, CBP has determined that **a non-coastwise qualified jack-up vessel would become a coastwise point when attached to the seabed of the OCS** for the purpose of installing or constructing a structure to be used for the production of wind energy.¹⁸

**MARAD's Role:**

Pursuant to 46 U.S.C. § 501(b), the Maritime Administrator is required to make determinations about the availability of qualified United States flag capacity to carry coastwise cargo in connection with all requests for waivers of the Jones Act (46 U.S.C. § 55102).¹⁹

**PMSC Offshore Wind Vessel Exposure:**

The research confirms that **CTVs engaged in coastwise trade for offshore wind operations must meet Jones Act requirements**, meaning they must be **U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed**.²⁰

Since PMSC's two offshore wind service vessels are under construction at COSCO China (foreign-built), they are **NOT Jones Act-compliant** and **cannot be used for U.S. offshore wind operations** involving transportation of personnel or supplies between U.S. points.

**Remedial Options:**
1. **Cancel construction contracts:** Loss of deposits ($5M-$8M estimated per user prompt)
2. **Re-order U.S.-built vessels:** $44M-$56M additional capital per user prompt
3. **Use vessels in foreign jurisdictions only:** Limits revenue potential

---

### C. SECTION 905(b) VESSEL NEGLIGENCE LIABILITY (33 U.S.C. § 905(b))

#### 1. Statutory Framework

**33 U.S.C. § 905(b) — Vessel Third-Party Tort Liability:**

Section 905(b) provides: "In the event of injury to a person covered under this chapter caused by the negligence of a vessel, then such person, or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages by reason thereof, may bring an action against such vessel as a third party in accordance with the provisions of section 933 of this title."²¹

**Purpose:** Section 905(b) permits longshoremen who receive LHWCA workers' compensation benefits to also pursue traditional negligence claims against vessel owners if the vessel's negligence partly caused their injury.²² A 905(b) claim allows recovery of **full damages for injury, including pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost wages, lost earning capacity, lost fringe benefits and other losses**.²³

#### 2. The Scindia Test — Vessel Owner Duties

***Scindia Steam Navigation Co. v. De Los Santos*, 451 U.S. 156 (1981) [VERIFIED: U.S. Supreme Court]**

The U.S. Supreme Court in *Scindia* established **three primary duties** that vessel owners owe to longshoremen under Section 905(b):²⁴

**1. Turnover Duty:**
The shipowner has a duty with respect to the condition of the ship's gear, equipment, tools, and work space to be used in the stevedoring operations, and if he fails at least to **warn the stevedore of hidden danger** which would have been known to him in the exercise of reasonable care, he has breached his duty and is liable if his negligence causes injury to a longshoreman.²⁵

**2. Active Control Duty:**
The vessel may be liable if it **actively involves itself in the cargo operations** and negligently injures a longshoreman or if it fails to exercise due care to avoid exposing longshoremen to harm from hazards they may encounter in areas, or from equipment, under the active control of the vessel during the stevedoring operation.²⁶

**3. Duty to Intervene:**
What are the shipowner's duties when he learns that an apparently dangerous condition exists or has developed in the cargo operation, which is known to the stevedore and which may cause injury to the longshoreman? Must the owner take some action?²⁷

**Standard:** The controlling standard is that **a vessel is subject to liability if the shipowner knows of or should discover the condition and realizes it involves an unreasonable risk, and fails to exercise reasonable care to protect the longshoremen**.²⁸

**Comparative Negligence Application:**
The doctrine of assumption of risk and contributory negligence do not apply in Section 905(b) claims. Rather, **any negligence on the part of the claimant only serves to reduce the recoverable damages**.²⁹

#### 3. Washington State Comparative Negligence

Washington follows the **"pure comparative negligence"** rule, which means that even if a plaintiff is partially at fault for an accident, the plaintiff can still recover damages. However, compensation will be reduced by the plaintiff's percentage of fault.³⁰

Under Washington State's comparative negligence rule, a person injured in an accident can file a legal claim **even if they bear 99 percent responsibility** for causing the accident. However, any portion of fault for the accident attributable to the injured plaintiff can reduce the plaintiff's financial recovery in proportion to their percentage of responsibility.³¹

#### 4. Martinez v. PMSC — Application of Scindia to Defective Hatch Cover

**Case Posture:**
- **Case:** Martinez v. Pacific Maritime Services Corporation
- **Injury Date:** September 2023
- **Injury:** Longshoreman crushed by container lashing gear failure (alleged defective hatch cover)
- **Injuries Sustained:** Bilateral leg fractures, permanent disability
- **LHWCA Benefits Paid:** $420,000
- **Tort Claim:** $8.5M sought ($1.2M medical + $2.8M lost wages + $4.5M pain/suffering)
- **Trial Date:** Q3 2025 (post-closing)

**Turnover Duty Analysis:**

Under *Scindia*'s turnover duty, the vessel owner has a duty to exercise ordinary care with respect to the condition of the ship's gear, equipment, and work space at the commencement of stevedoring operations.³² If a **hatch cover was defective** and the vessel owner knew or should have known of the defect in the exercise of reasonable care, the vessel owner had a duty to **warn the stevedore** or correct the condition.³³

**PMSC's Potential Defense:** Gear was inspected in August 2023 (one month before incident) and passed inspection. If PMSC can demonstrate:
1. Regular inspection and maintenance protocols were followed
2. The defect was latent (not discoverable through reasonable inspection)
3. The stevedore was in a better position to discover the defect during operations

Then turnover duty may not have been breached.

**Active Control Duty Analysis:**

If the vessel actively involved itself in the cargo operations where the hatch cover failure occurred, PMSC could be liable under the active control duty for negligently causing injury to Martinez.³⁴ However, if stevedore personnel (not vessel crew) were controlling the hatch cover operations, this duty may not apply.

**Duty to Intervene Analysis:**

If PMSC had actual knowledge of a dangerous condition with the hatch cover and actual knowledge that the stevedore, in the exercise of poor judgment, failed to correct the dangerous condition, PMSC had a duty to intervene.³⁵ The facts as presented do not suggest PMSC had actual knowledge of an ongoing dangerous condition during operations.

**Most Likely Liability Theory:** **Turnover duty** — defective hatch cover at commencement of operations.

#### 5. Punitive Damages Availability

**Recent Development:** The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana held in ***In re Rodi Marine, LLC*** that **punitive damages may be awarded under Section 905(b)** of the LHWCA.³⁶ The court found that longshoremen may pursue punitive damages under § 905(b), and at least two sections of the Eastern District have now adopted this position.³⁷

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** The Martinez claim includes a request for damages that may encompass punitive damages if PMSC's conduct is found to constitute gross negligence (e.g., knowingly operating with defective equipment, failure to maintain inspection records, pattern of safety violations).

**Fifth Circuit Status:** The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet addressed this issue at the appellate level.³⁸ **The Martinez case is being litigated in Washington state (likely W.D. Washington — Ninth Circuit)**, not the Fifth Circuit, so Ninth Circuit precedent will control.

**Ninth Circuit Precedent on Punitive Damages:** Research indicates the Ninth Circuit has not definitively ruled on punitive damages availability under § 905(b), creating uncertainty for the Martinez case.

#### 6. Settlement Value Analysis

**Claimed Damages Breakdown:**
- **Medical expenses:** $1.2M (past and future treatment for bilateral leg fractures, permanent disability)
- **Lost wages and earning capacity:** $2.8M (longshoreman with permanent disability, reduced earning capacity)
- **Pain and suffering:** $4.5M (bilateral leg fractures, permanent impairment, reduced quality of life)
- **Total claimed:** $8.5M

**Comparative Negligence Reduction:**

Under Washington's pure comparative negligence rule, if Martinez is found 30-50% at fault (e.g., failed to stand clear, violated safety protocols), the verdict would be reduced proportionally.³⁹

**Settlement Range Estimation [METHODOLOGY: Expert Judgment]:**

Based on the following factors:
1. **Jury sympathy:** Longshoremen injured on the job receive sympathetic treatment from juries⁴⁰
2. **PMSC's inspection defense:** If inspection records demonstrate August 2023 inspection passed, reduces liability finding probability
3. **Comparative fault:** Martinez's conduct in standing too close to lashing gear, failure to observe safety protocols (estimated 30-40% fault)
4. **Ninth Circuit § 905(b) damages precedent:** Generally allows full compensatory damages
5. **Trial risk vs. settlement certainty:** Both parties face verdict uncertainty

**Estimated Settlement Range:** **$2.0M - $3.5M**

**Estimated Jury Verdict Range (if no settlement):** **$3.5M - $6.0M** (after comparative fault reduction from $8.5M claimed)

- **Best case for PMSC:** $2.0M (strong inspection defense, 50% comparative fault by Martinez)
- **Expected case:** $3.0M - $4.0M (30-40% comparative fault)
- **Worst case for PMSC:** $6.0M+ (weak inspection records, minimal comparative fault, potential punitive damages if gross negligence shown)

### D. SUCCESSOR LIABILITY FOR PRE-CLOSING MARITIME TORT CLAIMS

#### 1. Stock Purchase vs. Asset Purchase Distinction

**General Rule:** The risk of unknown liabilities is **lower in asset acquisitions** than in merger or stock transactions.⁴¹ Stock purchases generally carry **higher successor liability risk** because the acquiring company assumes all liabilities of the target company, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities.⁴²

**PMSC Transaction Structure:** **Stock purchase** (acquire 100% equity of PMSC) per research plan.

**Implication:** Global Logistics Partners will assume **all liabilities of PMSC**, including the Martinez § 905(b) claim and any other pending or unknown maritime tort claims.

#### 2. Maritime Tort Liability in Stock Acquisitions

**Pre-Closing Tort Liability:** Where potentially significant liabilities may be imposed on a buyer long after the transaction closes (such as product liability and environmental clean-up costs), proper pre-closing investigation can identify and quantify the risks. Once identified, the risks can be allocated and mitigated through measures such as **indemnification for liabilities that come to light immediately after closing** and **insurance coverage for other claims**.⁴³

**Maritime-Specific Considerations:**

Maritime law applies to a tort when it satisfies both the "location" and "connection" tests:
- **Location test:** The tort occurs on navigable waters or, for injuries suffered on land, that the injury be caused by a vessel on navigable waters⁴⁴
- **Connection test:** The incident could have a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce⁴⁵

**Martinez Case — Maritime Tort Status:** **VERIFIED** — longshoreman injured on vessel during cargo operations on navigable waters = maritime tort subject to admiralty jurisdiction.

#### 3. Shipowner's Limitation of Liability Act — NOT APPLICABLE to Martinez

**Limitation Act Standard:** In order to limit liability under the Shipowner's Limitation of Liability Act (46 U.S.C. §§ 30501-30512), the owner must prove there was no prior knowledge of any problems that could cause a mishap.⁴⁶ In situations where the shipowner or corporate management was **aware of any negligence** or if the **vessel was unseaworthy**, the limitation of liability does **NOT apply**.⁴⁷

**Application to Martinez:** If PMSC had **actual knowledge** of the defective hatch cover before the September 2023 incident, the Limitation Act would not provide protection. PMSC's defense that the hatch cover passed inspection in August 2023 suggests PMSC did not have actual knowledge of the defect, but this is a factual issue for litigation.

#### 4. Indemnification and Risk Allocation in Purchase Agreement

**Standard Indemnification Provisions for Pre-Closing Torts:**

In M&A transactions involving maritime companies, the purchase agreement should include:

1. **Seller indemnification for pre-closing tort claims:** Seller (PMSC's current owners) indemnifies buyer (Global Logistics Partners) for all liabilities arising from incidents occurring prior to closing date⁴⁸
2. **Escrow or holdback:** Portion of purchase price held in escrow (e.g., $10M-$25M) to secure indemnification obligations for 12-24 months post-closing⁴⁹
3. **Insurance:** Representations & warranties insurance policy covering unknown/undisclosed liabilities, including maritime tort claims⁵⁰

**Martinez Case Timing:** Incident occurred September 2023, trial scheduled Q3 2025 (post-closing). This is a **known liability** that should be:
- **Disclosed in schedules** to purchase agreement
- **Reflected in purchase price adjustment** (reduce price by estimated settlement value $2M-$5M), OR
- **Subject to specific indemnification** by seller with escrow to secure obligation

**Indemnification Challenges:** An indemnification right may be of little value when assets are being purchased from a distressed or insolvent seller.⁵¹ If PMSC's current owners (family-owned, 3rd generation) are rolling equity or taking cash and exiting, the buyer must ensure adequate escrow/holdback to secure indemnification for Martinez settlement/verdict.

## V. RISK FACTORS AND CONCERNS

### A. Identified Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Quantified Exposure | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Jones Act Crew Non-Compliance (2 vessels)** | Low | High (80%) | $500-$1,000 per violation if detected | Hire 4 additional U.S. citizen crew (2 per vessel) within 90 days post-closing |
| **Offshore Wind Vessels Foreign-Built (2 vessels)** | High | Certain (100%) | $5M-$8M (cancel deposits) OR $44M-$56M (re-order U.S.-built) | Cancel construction contracts OR re-order from U.S. shipyards OR deploy vessels to foreign markets only |
| **Martinez § 905(b) Trial Verdict** | High | High (80%) | $2M-$5M settlement / $3.5M-$6M+ verdict | Negotiate pre-closing settlement, allocate via purchase price adjustment or seller indemnification with escrow |
| **Punitive Damages in Martinez Case** | Medium | Low (15-25%) | Additional $1M-$3M if gross negligence shown | Thorough review of PMSC inspection/maintenance records pre-closing to assess gross negligence risk |
| **Vessel Forfeiture — Merchandise Violations (hypothetical)** | Critical | Very Low (<1%) | Value of cargo per voyage ($300K-$500K per voyage) | Ensure all 6 Jones Act vessels have valid coastwise endorsements, maintain crew citizenship compliance |

### B. Red Flags Requiring Further Investigation

**1. Jones Act Crew Citizenship Violations — MINIMAL RISK (User Prompt Overstated)**

The user prompt stated "$39.6M penalty per voyage + vessel forfeiture" for crew citizenship violations. **This is incorrect.** Research confirms:
- **46 U.S.C. § 8103 (crew citizenship):** $500 per individual civil penalty
- **46 U.S.C. § 55102 (coastwise trade merchandise):** Forfeiture of merchandise OR value of merchandise

**The $39.6M figure conflates two separate statutes.** Crew citizenship violations under § 8103 carry minimal penalties ($500-$1,000 per vessel if detected). **Vessel forfeiture applies to merchandise violations under § 55102, NOT crew citizenship violations.**

**CORRECTED EXPOSURE:**
- **M/V Cascade Spirit:** Approximately 1-2 excess foreign crew × $500 = $500-$1,000 per violation
- **M/V Columbia Express:** Approximately 1-2 excess foreign crew × $500 = $500-$1,000 per violation
- **Total exposure if Coast Guard audits both vessels:** $1,000-$2,000 one-time penalty

**Coast Guard Audit Probability:** Low (5-10% annually based on 2005-2009 enforcement statistics showing 108 violations nationwide per year across thousands of U.S.-documented vessels)

**2. Offshore Wind Vessels — MATERIAL EXPOSURE ($5M-$56M)**

**VERIFIED:** CTVs must be Jones Act-compliant (U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-owned, U.S.-crewed) to operate in U.S. offshore wind projects transporting personnel and supplies between U.S. points.

**PMSC's two vessels under construction at COSCO China are foreign-built and NOT Jones Act-compliant.**

**Options:**
1. **Cancel construction:** Lose $5M-$8M in deposits (per user prompt estimate)
2. **Re-order U.S.-built:** $44M-$56M additional capital vs. Chinese-built cost
3. **Deploy to foreign offshore wind markets:** Limits revenue potential, reduces U.S. market exposure

**Recommendation:** Negotiate purchase price reduction of $5M-$8M to reflect stranded investment, OR require seller to cancel contracts pre-closing and absorb deposit loss.

**3. Martinez § 905(b) Case — MATERIAL EXPOSURE ($2M-$6M)**

**Known Liability:** Incident occurred September 2023, LHWCA benefits already paid ($420K), tort claim filed, trial scheduled Q3 2025.

**Liability Assessment:**
- **Turnover duty:** Most likely theory — defective hatch cover at commencement of operations
- **Defense strength:** Depends on PMSC inspection records (August 2023 inspection claimed to have passed)
- **Comparative negligence:** Martinez likely 30-40% at fault for failing to stand clear

**Settlement Probability:** High (70-80%) — both parties face verdict uncertainty, insurance carrier likely pressuring settlement

**Expected Outcome:**
- **Pre-closing settlement:** $2.0M-$3.5M (most likely)
- **Post-closing verdict:** $3.5M-$6.0M (if no settlement)

**Risk Allocation:** This is a **known liability** that must be addressed in purchase agreement:
- **Option 1:** Purchase price reduction of $3.0M (midpoint of settlement range)
- **Option 2:** Seller indemnification with $5.0M escrow held for 18 months post-closing
- **Option 3:** Representations & warranties insurance to cover verdict if exceeds $3.0M

### C. Potential Exposure Analysis — Summary Table

| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate | Probability-Weighted | Notes |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Jones Act Crew Violations** | $500 | $2,000 | $1,000 (80% × $1,250 avg) | Minimal exposure, easily corrected |
| **Offshore Wind Vessels** | $5M | $56M | $6.5M (100% × $6.5M cancel scenario) | Assume cancellation vs. re-order |
| **Martinez Settlement/Verdict** | $2M | $6M | $2.8M (80% × $3.5M expected) | Known liability, settlement likely |
| **Punitive Damages Risk (Martinez)** | $0 | $3M | $450K (15% × $3M) | Low probability, depends on gross negligence finding |
| **TOTAL JONES ACT / 905(b) EXPOSURE** | **$7.5M** | **$67M** | **$9.75M** | Expected value analysis |

## VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. Summary of Conclusions

1. **Jones Act Crew Citizenship Non-Compliance (Critical Issues #1, #2):**
   - **FINDING:** Two vessels (M/V Cascade Spirit, M/V Columbia Express) have 73% U.S. citizen crew, below the 75% statutory minimum under 46 U.S.C. § 8103(b).
   - **PENALTY EXPOSURE:** **Minimal** — $500 per individual per violation = $500-$1,000 per vessel if detected by Coast Guard audit (NOT $39.6M as stated in user prompt).
   - **CORRECTION REQUIRED:** Hire 4 additional U.S. citizen crew members (2 per vessel) within 90 days post-closing.
   - **COST:** $155K annual salary per crew member × 4 = $620K/year ongoing.

2. **Offshore Wind Vessels Foreign-Built (Critical Issue #9):**
   - **FINDING:** Two crew transfer vessels under construction at COSCO China (foreign-built) are **NOT Jones Act-compliant** and **cannot be used for U.S. offshore wind operations** transporting personnel/supplies between U.S. points.
   - **EXPOSURE:** $5M-$8M lost deposits (if cancel) OR $44M-$56M additional capital (if re-order U.S.-built).
   - **RECOMMENDATION:** Negotiate **$6.5M purchase price reduction** to reflect stranded investment. Alternatively, require seller to cancel contracts pre-closing and absorb deposit loss.

3. **Martinez § 905(b) Vessel Negligence Case (Critical Issue #6):**
   - **FINDING:** Martinez v. PMSC pending trial Q3 2025, $8.5M claimed (bilateral leg fractures, permanent disability).
   - **LIABILITY THEORY:** Turnover duty — defective hatch cover at commencement of stevedoring operations (*Scindia* test).
   - **SETTLEMENT RANGE:** $2.0M-$3.5M (expected)
   - **VERDICT RANGE:** $3.5M-$6.0M (if no settlement, after 30-40% comparative fault reduction)
   - **RECOMMENDATION:** Require seller to settle pre-closing OR allocate via **$3.0M purchase price reduction** (midpoint) OR **$5.0M escrow** for 18 months to secure indemnification.

4. **Successor Liability for Pre-Closing Maritime Torts:**
   - **FINDING:** Stock purchase structure means Global Logistics Partners assumes **all PMSC liabilities**, including Martinez case and any unknown maritime tort claims.
   - **MITIGATION:** Robust indemnification provisions, escrow/holdback ($15M-$25M recommended for 18-24 months), representations & warranties insurance ($100M policy recommended).

5. **Vessel Forfeiture Risk — Merchandise Violations:**
   - **FINDING:** 46 U.S.C. § 55102(c) provides for **forfeiture of merchandise** (NOT vessel forfeiture) for coastwise trade violations, OR penalty equal to greater of merchandise value or transportation cost.
   - **EXPOSURE:** Hypothetical — if Jones Act vessel carries non-Jones Act cargo between U.S. points, cargo value at risk ($300K-$500K per voyage). **No evidence of such violations in user prompt.**
   - **MITIGATION:** Ensure all 6 Jones Act vessels maintain valid coastwise endorsements and crew citizenship compliance.

### B. Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (Pre-Closing):**

1. **Jones Act Crew Compliance:**
   - **Action:** Identify and recruit 4 additional U.S. citizen mariners (2 per non-compliant vessel) for hire immediately post-closing.
   - **Timeline:** 90 days post-closing to achieve full compliance.
   - **Cost:** $620K/year ongoing (4 crew × $155K annual salary).
   - **Verification:** Obtain USCG crew documentation and citizenship verification for all crew members on M/V Cascade Spirit and M/V Columbia Express.

2. **Offshore Wind Vessels:**
   - **Action:** Negotiate **$6.5M purchase price reduction** to reflect stranded investment in foreign-built vessels.
   - **Alternative:** Require seller to cancel COSCO China construction contracts pre-closing and absorb $5M-$8M deposit loss.
   - **Alternative 2:** Conduct market analysis on foreign offshore wind opportunities (Europe, Asia) to determine if vessels can be deployed profitably outside U.S. market.

3. **Martinez § 905(b) Settlement:**
   - **Action:** Require seller to negotiate **pre-closing settlement** of Martinez case with insurance carrier and plaintiff's counsel.
   - **Target Settlement:** $2.5M-$3.0M (within insurance policy limits, avoids trial risk).
   - **If Pre-Closing Settlement Not Achieved:**
     - **Option A:** **$3.0M purchase price reduction** (reflect expected settlement cost).
     - **Option B:** **$5.0M escrow** held 18 months post-closing to secure seller indemnification for verdict/settlement.

4. **Due Diligence — Vessel Inspection Records:**
   - **Action:** Obtain and review **all inspection and maintenance records** for M/V Pacific Horizon (Martinez incident vessel) from 2020-2023.
   - **Purpose:** Assess **gross negligence risk** (punitive damages exposure) by determining whether PMSC had prior knowledge of hatch cover defects or pattern of maintenance failures.
   - **Red Flags:** Failed inspections not corrected, deferred maintenance on critical equipment, prior similar incidents.

5. **Purchase Agreement — Indemnification and Risk Allocation:**
   - **General Indemnification:** Seller indemnifies buyer for all pre-closing liabilities, including maritime tort claims (18-24 month survival period).
   - **Escrow/Holdback:** $15M-$25M escrow to secure indemnification obligations.
   - **Specific Martinez Indemnification:** Seller indemnifies for Martinez settlement/verdict up to $6.0M (high-end estimate).
   - **Insurance:** Obtain **$100M representations & warranties insurance policy** covering unknown/undisclosed liabilities (10% retention = $10M).

**Short-Term Actions (0-90 Days Post-Closing):**

6. **Crew Hiring and Onboarding:**
   - Hire 4 U.S. citizen mariners (qualified able-bodied seamen or equivalent ratings).
   - Complete USCG credentialing and documentation.
   - Assign 2 crew to M/V Cascade Spirit, 2 crew to M/V Columbia Express.
   - **Deadline:** 90 days post-closing to achieve 75%+ U.S. crew citizenship compliance.

7. **Coast Guard Notification (if required):**
   - Determine whether change of vessel ownership requires notification to USCG National Vessel Documentation Center.
   - Update vessel documentation to reflect new ownership (Global Logistics Partners subsidiary).
   - Ensure coastwise endorsements remain valid post-acquisition.

8. **Martinez Case Management:**
   - If not settled pre-closing, engage defense counsel to assess trial strategy.
   - Engage with PMSC's P&I club/MEL insurance carrier to confirm coverage for settlement/verdict.
   - Monitor trial schedule (Q3 2025) and settlement negotiations.

**Long-Term Considerations:**

9. **Offshore Wind Market Strategy:**
   - If COSCO China vessels are completed, deploy to **foreign offshore wind markets** (Europe, Asia) where Jones Act does not apply.
   - Evaluate **U.S. offshore wind market entry** via purchase or lease of Jones Act-compliant CTVs from U.S. shipyards.
   - Monitor MARAD Jones Act waiver activity for offshore wind projects (unlikely but possible regulatory relief).

10. **Fleet-Wide Jones Act Compliance Audit:**
    - Conduct comprehensive audit of all 6 Jones Act vessels:
      - Verify U.S.-built status (Coast Guard build certificates)
      - Verify coastwise endorsements current and valid
      - Verify 75%+ U.S. citizen crew on all vessels
      - Review cargo operations to ensure no coastwise trade violations (non-Jones Act cargo between U.S. points)
    - **Timeline:** Complete within 6 months post-closing.

### C. Outstanding Questions for Data Room / Seller
