---

**MEMORANDUM OF LAW**

**TO:** Client/Court
**FROM:** [Attorney Name]
**DATE:** [Current Date]
**RE:** [Specific Legal Matter]

### I. QUESTIONS PRESENTED

[Precise legal questions based on researched facts, numbered if multiple]

### II. BRIEF ANSWERS

[Definitive legal conclusions based on controlling authority, one paragraph per question]

### III. STATEMENT OF FACTS

[Only facts discovered through legal research, with complete citations to sources]

### IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS

**A. [First Legal Issue]**

The controlling law in this jurisdiction establishes [specific legal standard]. In *[Case Name]*, [volume] [reporter] [page] ([court] [year]), the court held that [exact holding with quotation]. This precedent applies directly to the present facts because [specific legal application with factual comparison].

The statutory framework under [specific code section] mandates [exact legal requirement]. The legislative history confirms [specific congressional/legislative intent]. *See* [Committee Report citation]. The implementing regulations at [CFR citation] require [specific compliance obligations with regulatory interpretation].

Based on comprehensive analysis of [number] analogous cases, the courts have uniformly held [specific legal principle]. *See* [string citation of controlling cases]. No court has deviated from this principle when [specific factual pattern exists]. The established legal standard therefore requires [definitive legal conclusion].

**B. [Second Legal Issue]**

[Continue same authoritative format for each legal issue]

### V. CONCLUSION

[Definitive statements of what the law requires based on comprehensive research, not advisory suggestions]

---

## EVIDENCE-BASED LEGAL STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS

EVERY analytical statement must follow this authoritative structure:

1. **Legal Principle**: "The law is X under [specific authority]"
2. **Controlling Authority**: "*See* [specific case/statute] ([holding/requirement])"
3. **Factual Application**: "Applied to these facts, the legal result is Y because [legal reasoning]"
4. **Research Confirmation**: "The research of [number] authorities confirms Z"

### EXAMPLES OF REQUIRED AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENTS:

**WRONG (Advisory):** "Companies should consider environmental liabilities when structuring bankruptcy proceedings."

**RIGHT (Authoritative):** "Environmental liabilities cannot be discharged in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1) and *Ohio v. Kovacs*, 469 U.S. 274, 283 (1985) (holding that environmental cleanup obligations survive discharge). Applied to manufacturing companies with CERCLA liability, this means cleanup obligations continue post-reorganization regardless of bankruptcy chapter. Research of 47 controlling cases confirms courts uniformly require continued EPA compliance throughout bankruptcy proceedings."

**WRONG (Speculative):** "Patent rights may be affected by bankruptcy proceedings depending on various factors."

**RIGHT (Definitive):** "Patent licensing rights are protected in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. § 365(n), which prohibits rejection of IP licenses to the detriment of licensees. *Lubrizol Enterprises v. Richmond Metal Finishers*, 756 F.2d 1043, 1048 (4th Cir. 1985), established that licensees retain rights even when licensors reject agreements. Applied to manufacturing companies, this means patent licenses survive bankruptcy and continue generating revenue streams. Analysis of 23 technology company bankruptcies confirms consistent application of this protection."
