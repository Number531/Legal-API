# PROJECT NEPTUNE — MARITIME SHIPPING & PORT TERMINAL ACQUISITION
## Comprehensive Legal Due Diligence Test Prompt

**Purpose**: Stress-test platform capabilities across maritime shipping regulation, Federal Maritime Commission oversight, Jones Act compliance, Coast Guard safety requirements, port security, and maritime-specific regulatory frameworks not covered in prior tests. This validates expertise in Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) licensing (46 U.S.C. § 40101 ocean common carrier tariffs, service contracts, vessel-sharing agreements, controlled carrier rules, anti-rebating provisions), Jones Act cabotage (46 U.S.C. § 55102 coastwise trade limited to U.S.-built/U.S.-flagged/U.S.-crewed vessels, penalties $1,100 per passenger/ton of merchandise, vessel forfeiture), Coast Guard vessel safety (46 CFR Subchapter I inspection requirements, load lines, stability, fire safety, lifesaving equipment, annual COIs Certificates of Inspection), Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA, 33 CFR Part 105 facility security plans, TWIC reader requirements, security assessments, vulnerability assessments, Area Maritime Security Committees), International Maritime Organization (IMO) conventions (SOLAS safety of life at sea, MARPOL pollution prevention, ballast water management, sulfur emission limits 0.5% global 0.1% ECAs), Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. § 901 exclusive remedy for maritime workers, federal benefits, no state workers' comp, Section 905(b) vessel negligence third-party liability), and maritime industry-specific frameworks unique to vessel operators and port terminal facilities serving international containerized cargo, bulk commodities, and petroleum products with complex vessel financing (preferred ship mortgages, maritime liens priority), charter party agreements (time charters, voyage charters, bareboat charters), and terminal concession agreements with port authorities.

**Key Differentiators from Prior Tests**:
- Federal Maritime Commission jurisdiction (46 U.S.C. § 40101, ocean common carriers must file tariffs, service contracts with shippers, FMC regulates rates for controlled carriers foreign government-owned, anti-rebating enforcement, vessel-sharing agreements require FMC approval, detention and demurrage rule D&D reasonableness)
- Jones Act cabotage restrictions (46 U.S.C. § 55102, coastwise trade U.S. point to U.S. point requires U.S.-built vessel built in U.S. shipyard + U.S.-flagged documented under U.S. flag + U.S.-crewed 75% crew U.S. citizens, violations $1,100 per passenger or per ton merchandise transported + vessel forfeiture to U.S. government, Puerto Rico/Hawaii/Alaska trade included, offshore wind energy service vessels subject to Jones Act)
- Coast Guard inspection and certification (46 CFR Subchapter I vessel inspections annual drydock exams hull/machinery, COI Certificate of Inspection 1-5 years validity, load line certificates International Convention on Load Lines, stability standards intact/damage stability calculations, fire safety SOLAS requirements, lifesaving equipment SOLAS Chapter III lifeboats/rafts/immersion suits)
- MTSA port and vessel security (33 CFR Parts 104-106, facility security plans FSPs with three MARSEC levels, TWIC Transportation Worker Identification Credential readers, vessel security plans, security drills quarterly, vulnerability assessments every 5 years, Coast Guard Captain of the Port enforcement)
- IMO environmental regulation (MARPOL Annex I oil pollution prevention double hulls, Annex VI air emissions 0.5% sulfur fuel global 0.1% in ECAs emission control areas, Ballast Water Management Convention treatment systems required, Carbon Intensity Indicator CII annual rating A-E, EU Emissions Trading System ETS maritime inclusion 2024)
- LHWCA workers' compensation (33 U.S.C. § 901 maritime workers longshoremen/stevedores/harbor workers covered, federal benefits DOL administers, no state workers' comp applies, Section 905(b) vessel negligence claims if vessel unseaworthy/crew negligent, unlimited tort damages beyond LHWCA benefits)
- Maritime liens and preferred ship mortgages (46 U.S.C. § 31301 preferred mortgages priority over most claims, maritime liens for crew wages/necessaries/salvage/collision/tort have priority over mortgages, vessel arrest for unpaid claims, admiralty court jurisdiction)
- Limitation of liability (46 U.S.C. § 30505 Limitation of Liability Act, vessel owner can limit liability to value of vessel + pending freight if no privity or knowledge of negligence, allows owner to cap exposure for casualty/pollution to vessel value even if damages exceed)
- Charter party agreements (time charter vessel chartered for period charterer pays daily hire owner provides crew/insurance/maintenance, voyage charter vessel chartered for specific voyage charterer pays freight rate, bareboat charter charterer takes possession operates vessel pays all costs owner provides bare vessel)

**Concurrent Testing Strategy**: Run with Projects Meridian through Atlas (railroad) to validate platform handling 24+ simultaneous complex transactions across different regulatory frameworks.

- Volume: 180K TEU annually (domestic cargo, Jones Act-compliant vessels only)
- Avg rate: $4,500 per TEU (higher rates due to Jones Act cost structure, U.S.-built vessels more expensive)

**Bulk commodities**: Coal exports (U.S. Gulf → Asia), grain exports (Pacific Northwest → Asia), fertilizer imports

**FMC Licensing and Tariffs**:

**Ocean Common Carrier License** (OCC, FMC License No. 024587):
- PMSC licensed as ocean common carrier under 46 U.S.C. § 40102
- **Tariff filing**: PMSC maintains tariffs on file with FMC (rates, charges, rules applicable to common carriage)
- **Service contracts**: PMSC has 850 service contracts with shippers (confidential contracts, volume commitments, negotiated rates lower than tariff rates, filed with FMC)
- **Anti-rebating**: PMSC must not offer rebates, refunds, or allowances not specified in tariffs/service contracts (46 U.S.C. § 41102(c), violation $25K-$50K per day)

**Vessel-Sharing Agreement (VSA)**:
- PMSC participates in Trans-Pacific Stabilization Agreement (TPSA, vessel-sharing alliance with 3 other carriers)
- **Agreement**: Slot exchange (PMSC provides space on its vessels to alliance partners, receives space on their vessels), coordinate schedules, share terminal facilities
- **FMC filing**: VSA filed with FMC (46 U.S.C. § 40303, agreements among common carriers require FMC filing, automatic legal effect 45 days unless FMC objects)
- **Antitrust immunity**: FMC-filed agreements immune from antitrust laws (Ocean Shipping Reform Act 1998, limited immunity for operational agreements, does NOT extend to price fixing)

**Detention and Demurrage**:
- **D&D charges**: Fees for containers held beyond free time (detention = fee for container held outside terminal, demurrage = fee for container held at terminal beyond free time)
- **FMC Rule**: 46 CFR Part 545 (D&D practices must be reasonable, transparent, invoices clearly identify charges, dispute resolution available)
- **PMSC's practices**: 5-day free time for import containers, $150/day demurrage after free time, $100/day detention
- **Shipper complaints**: 12 formal complaints filed with FMC (FY2024, shippers allege unreasonable D&D charges, lack of container availability during COVID port congestion, PMSC charged demurrage when no chassis available)

**Jones Act Compliance**:

- 4 container ships (3,000-4,200 TEU, built U.S. Gulf Coast shipyards 2008-2015)
- 2 RoRo vessels (roll-on/roll-off, vehicle carriers, built Aker Philadelphia Shipyard 2012-2013)

**Compliance Requirements**:
- **U.S.-built**: Constructed in U.S. shipyard (46 U.S.C. § 55102(a)(1), vessels built foreign shipyard ineligible even if owned by U.S. company)
- **U.S.-flagged**: Documented under U.S. flag (Coast Guard vessel documentation, Certificate of Documentation)
- **U.S.-crewed**: 75% crew must be U.S. citizens (officers 100% U.S. Coast Guard-licensed mariners, unlicensed crew 75% U.S. citizens/permanent residents)

**Trade Routes**:

- **Puerto Rico service**: Jacksonville → San Juan (mainland U.S. to Puerto Rico, 42K TEU annually, $3,900/TEU)
- **Offshore wind**: New England offshore wind farm support (crew transfer vessels, supply vessels, Jones Act applies to U.S. offshore renewable energy installations)

**Jones Act Economics**:
- **Higher costs**: U.S.-built vessels cost 3-5× more than foreign-built (newbuild U.S. container ship $180M-$250M vs. $50M-$80M South Korea/China)
- **Crew costs**: U.S. mariners $80K-$150K annually vs. $25K-$50K foreign crew (3-4× higher)
- **Operating costs**: Jones Act vessel operating costs $22M-$35M annually vs. $8M-$15M foreign-flag vessel
- **Revenue**: Higher freight rates ($4,500 TEU Jones Act vs. $2,800 international) partially offset higher costs, but margins lower (12-15% vs. 18-22% international)

**Violations and Penalties**:
- **No violations**: PMSC never cited for Jones Act violations (strict internal compliance, vets all cargo to ensure foreign-flag vessels not used for coastwise trade)
- **Exposure**: $1,100 per ton of merchandise (e.g., if PMSC used foreign-flag vessel to carry 10,000 tons Los Angeles → Honolulu = $11M penalty) + vessel subject to forfeiture

**Terminal Operations**:

**Terminals** (4 facilities, West Coast):

**1. Los Angeles Terminal** (Pier 300, Port of Los Angeles):
- **Lease**: 40-year concession with Port of LA (expires 2042, rent $85M annually, 3% of gross revenue, whichever greater)
- **Capacity**: 2.5M TEU annually (10 berths, 1,200 linear feet each, 48 ship-to-shore cranes)
- **Volume**: 2.1M TEU handled (FY2024, 84% utilization)
- **Customers**: PMSC's own vessels 60%, third-party carriers 40% (Hapag-Lloyd, ONE, Yang Ming)
- **Revenue**: $420M (stevedoring, wharfage, storage, reefer plugs)
- **ILWU labor**: 1,800 longshoremen (Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement, expires July 1, 2028)

**2. Long Beach Terminal** (Pier J, Port of Long Beach):
- **Lease**: 30-year concession (expires 2035, rent $62M annually)
- **Capacity**: 1.8M TEU annually (8 berths, 38 cranes)
- **Volume**: 1.6M TEU (FY2024, 89% utilization)
- **Revenue**: $310M

**3. Oakland Terminal** (Outer Harbor, Port of Oakland):
- **Lease**: 25-year concession (expires 2030, rent $28M annually, renewal negotiations ongoing)
- **Capacity**: 800K TEU annually (5 berths, 18 cranes)
- **Volume**: 620K TEU (FY2024, 78% utilization)
- **Revenue**: $135M
- **Renewal uncertainty**: Port of Oakland seeking 50% rent increase ($28M → $42M), PMSC negotiating, may not renew if uneconomic

**4. Seattle Terminal** (Terminal 46, Port of Seattle):
- **Lease**: 20-year concession (expires 2033, rent $18M annually)
- **Capacity**: 500K TEU annually (4 berths, 12 cranes, Alaska service primarily)
- **Volume**: 380K TEU (FY2024, 76% utilization, includes Jones Act cargo to Alaska)

**Total terminal capacity**: 5.6M TEU annually (owned terminals), 4.7M TEU actual volume (84% utilization)

**ILWU Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement**:

**Current agreement**: Expires July 1, 2028 (4 years remaining)
- **Parties**: Pacific Maritime Association (PMA, employer group representing terminal operators/carriers including PMSC) and International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU, represents 15,000 West Coast longshoremen)
- **Wages**: Fully mechanized longshore worker $210K annually (includes benefits, pension, healthcare, very high compensation, skilled equipment operators)
- **Work rules**: PMSC must use ILWU labor (cannot use non-union workers), dispatch through union hiring hall, guaranteed minimums (8-hour shifts even if work completed in 4 hours)

**Next negotiations** (commence 2027):
- **Key issues**: Automation (terminal operators seek more automation cranes/trucks, ILWU opposes job losses), jurisdiction (who operates automated equipment?), health benefits (cost increases, employer contributions)
- **Strike risk**: ILWU history of militant bargaining (2002 lockout 10 days shutdown West Coast ports, 2014-2015 slowdowns 9 months, 2022 negotiations 13 months to reach agreement)
- **Economic impact**: West Coast port shutdown costs $1B-$2B per day (U.S. economy, importers unable to receive goods, exporters unable to ship)

**2027 negotiations risk**: 30-40% probability of work stoppage (slowdown, strike, lockout), could last 2 weeks to 6 months

**MTSA Security Compliance**:

**Facility Security Plans (FSPs)** — 33 CFR Part 105:
- All 4 terminals have Coast Guard-approved FSPs (vulnerability assessments conducted, security measures implemented for MARSEC Levels 1/2/3)
- **MARSEC 1** (routine): Standard security (access control, CCTV, perimeter fencing, vehicle inspections)
- **MARSEC 2** (heightened): Enhanced measures (increased patrols, restricted access, cargo inspections)
- **MARSEC 3** (imminent threat): Maximum security (all access controlled, vessels/trucks searched, potential terminal closure)

**TWIC Reader Requirements**:
- **TWIC**: Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TSA-issued biometric ID, background check, all terminal workers must have TWIC)
- **Reader requirement**: 33 CFR § 105.255 (terminals must use TWIC readers to verify credentials electronically)
- **PMSC compliance**: 3 of 4 terminals have TWIC readers installed (LA, Long Beach, Oakland compliant), Seattle terminal not yet compliant (deadline December 31, 2024, PMSC applied for extension to June 30, 2025, pending Coast Guard approval)
- **Penalty for non-compliance**: $25K per day per facility (if Coast Guard denies extension, Seattle terminal non-compliant January 1, 2025 = $25K/day ongoing)

**Security Drills**:
- **Quarterly drills**: FSPs require quarterly security drills (test emergency response, coordinate with Coast Guard, local law enforcement, port authority)
- **PMSC's record**: Compliant (4 drills per terminal per year, documented in security logs, Coast Guard inspects drill records annually)

**Area Maritime Security Committees**:
- PMSC participates in AMSCs (Los Angeles/Long Beach AMSC, San Francisco Bay AMSC, Puget Sound AMSC, collaborative security planning, information sharing)

**Coast Guard Vessel Inspections**:

**Certificates of Inspection (COIs)** — 46 CFR Subchapter I:
- All 22 owned vessels require COIs (annual inspections, drydock exams every 2-5 years depending on vessel type)
- **Container ships**: COI valid 5 years (annual endorsements, drydock every 2.5 years)
- **Bulk carriers**: COI valid 2 years (annual endorsements, drydock every 4 years for hull inspection)

**M/V Pacific Titan (ULCV flagship)** — Recent issues:
- **COI**: Valid through March 2026
- **November 2024 drydock** (Keppel Shipyard, Singapore): During routine drydock inspection, Coast Guard marine inspectors identified hull plating corrosion (ballast tanks, 15 shell plates 8mm thick corroded to 6mm, below minimum 7mm required for structural integrity)
- **Deficiency notice**: Coast Guard issued deficiency (vessel cannot sail until repairs completed, hull plates replaced/renewed)
- **Repair costs**: $8.5M (plate replacement, drydock extension 28 days, lost revenue 1 voyage missed $12M)
- **Completed**: Repairs completed December 2024, vessel returned to service
- **Root cause**: Ballast water management system failure (BWMS not treating ballast water properly, accelerated corrosion), PMSC replaced BWMS ($2.8M)

**Load Line Certificates**:
- All vessels have load line certificates (International Convention on Load Lines 1966, specifies maximum draft vessel can be loaded based on season/zone)
- **No violations**: PMSC never cited for overloading (strict loading procedures, master calculates draft/freeboard before departure)

**Lifesaving Equipment**:
- SOLAS Chapter III requirements (lifeboats capacity 125% crew/passengers, liferafts, immersion suits, EPIRBs emergency position indicating radio beacons)
- **Annual inspections**: Coast Guard inspects lifesaving equipment annually (davits, falls, hydrostatic testing of liferafts)
- **Deficiencies**: 3 deficiencies issued FY2024 (expired liferaft servicing on M/V Pacific Atlas, missing immersion suit on bulk carrier M/V Sierra Nevada, inoperative lifeboat engine on M/V Pacific Endeavor, all corrected within 30 days)

**IMO Environmental Compliance**:

**MARPOL Annex I** (Oil Pollution Prevention):
- All tankers (PMSC has no tankers currently, but bulk carriers carry fuel oil) must have double hulls or double bottoms
- **Oily water separators**: Vessels >400 GT must have OWS (separate oil from bilge water, discharge max 15 ppm oil content)
- **PMSC compliance**: All 22 vessels have OWS, Oil Record Books maintained (log all oil transfers, discharges, inspections)
- **No violations**: No MARPOL Annex I violations (no illegal discharges, no falsified Oil Record Books)

**MARPOL Annex VI** (Air Emissions):
- **Sulfur limits**: 
  - Global: 0.5% sulfur fuel oil maximum (2020 IMO global cap, down from 3.5% pre-2020)
  - ECAs (Emission Control Areas): 0.1% sulfur in North America ECA, European ECA, Caribbean ECA
- **PMSC compliance**: Fleet uses 0.1% VLSFO (very low sulfur fuel oil) globally (exceeds global 0.5% requirement, simplifies fuel management, single fuel type)
- **Cost impact**: VLSFO 0.1% costs $150-$200 per ton more than 0.5% fuel (PMSC's annual fuel cost $480M, 2.4M tons consumed, if switched to 0.5% fuel could save $360M-$480M annually but would need dual-fuel management, added complexity)

**NOx Emissions** (Nitrogen Oxides):
- **Tier III**: Vessels built after 2016 in ECAs must meet Tier III NOx limits (80% reduction vs. Tier II)
- **PMSC's fleet**: 4 ULCVs built 2017-2020 have Tier III engines (SCR selective catalytic reduction systems, reduce NOx), older vessels Tier II compliant (built before 2016, grandfathered)

**Ballast Water Management**:
- **IMO BWM Convention** (entered force 2017, U.S. Coast Guard equivalent regulations 33 CFR Part 151 Subpart D)
- **Requirement**: Vessels must treat ballast water (kill aquatic invasive species, prevent introduction to new ecosystems)
- **BWMS installation**: All 22 PMSC vessels have BWMS installed (UV treatment, electrolysis, chemical treatment)
- **Compliance**: Coast Guard inspects BWMS annually (record books, discharge samples, system operability)
- **M/V Pacific Titan issue**: BWMS failure contributed to ballast tank corrosion (system not treating water properly, sediment/biological growth accelerated corrosion), PMSC replaced system December 2024

**Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII)**:
- **IMO requirement** (2023, mandatory annual rating A-E based on grams CO2 per cargo ton-mile)
- **PMSC's fleet**:
  - **A-rated**: 2 vessels (newest ULCVs, fuel-efficient)
  - **B-rated**: 8 vessels
  - **C-rated**: 10 vessels (industry average)
  - **D-rated**: 2 vessels (older bulk carriers, less efficient, may require scrapping or costly retrofits by 2027 if cannot improve to C)
- **Consequence**: D-rated vessels 3 consecutive years must submit corrective action plan (improve efficiency or face potential operational restrictions)

**EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)**:
- **EU ETS inclusion**: Shipping included in EU ETS beginning 2024 (vessels calling EU ports must surrender CO2 allowances for emissions)
- **PMSC exposure**: Limited (trans-Pacific routes do not call EU ports), but if PMSC expands to Europe-Asia trade, would incur €70-€100 per ton CO2 allowance costs ($15M-$30M annually for typical Asia-Europe service)

**LHWCA Workers' Compensation**:

**Coverage** (33 U.S.C. § 901):
- All 3,200 longshoremen (terminal workers, stevedores, cargo handlers) covered by Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act
- **Federal system**: DOL Office of Workers' Compensation Programs administers (not state workers' comp, federal benefits higher)
- **Exclusive remedy**: LHWCA is exclusive remedy for work-related injuries (employee cannot sue PMSC in tort, limited to LHWCA benefits)

**Benefits**:
- **Temporary total disability**: 66.67% of average weekly wage (max $1,809/week FY2024)
- **Permanent total disability**: 66.67% AWW, lifetime benefits
- **Permanent partial disability**: Scheduled benefits (loss of hand $244K, loss of leg $230K, loss of eye $169K)
- **Medical**: Unlimited medical treatment (all reasonable/necessary treatment covered)
- **Death benefits**: 50% AWW to surviving spouse + 16.67% AWW per child (max 66.67% total)

**PMSC's Experience**:
- **Claims**: 285 LHWCA claims filed annually (crush injuries, falls, repetitive stress, hearing loss)
- **Annual costs**: $32M (indemnity benefits, medical, legal, claims administration)
- **Insurance**: Self-insured with excess coverage (PMSC retains first $5M per claim, excess carrier covers above $5M)
- **Reserve**: $180M (actuarial estimate of lifetime liability for open claims)

**Section 905(b) Vessel Negligence Claims**:
- **Third-party tort claims**: If longshoreman injured due to unseaworthy vessel or crew negligence, can sue vessel owner under general maritime law (in addition to LHWCA benefits from employer)
- **Vessel = PMSC's ships**: When PMSC vessel berthed at PMSC terminal, longshoreman injured loading cargo, can sue PMSC as vessel owner (even though PMSC also employer)
- **Damages**: Unlimited tort damages (pain/suffering, lost wages, punitive damages possible if gross negligence)

**Pending 905(b) case** (Martinez v. PMSC):
- **Facts**: Longshoreman injured September 2023 (crushed by container when lashing gear failed on M/V Pacific Horizon, fell onto dock, bilateral leg fractures, permanent disability)
- **LHWCA benefits**: $420K paid to date (medical, indemnity, ongoing)
- **Tort claim**: Martinez filed 905(b) claim against PMSC as vessel owner (alleges unseaworthy vessel, defective lashing gear, crew failed to properly secure containers)
- **Damages sought**: $8.5M (past/future medical $1.2M, lost wages $2.8M, pain/suffering $4.5M)
- **Status**: Discovery phase (trial scheduled Q3 2025)
- **Defense**: PMSC argues gear was in good condition (last inspected August 2023, passed), Martinez contributorily negligent (failed to stand clear as required by safety protocol)
- **Exposure**: $2M-$5M verdict likely (juries sympathetic, comparative fault may reduce award 30-50%)

**Maritime Liens and Preferred Ship Mortgages**:

**Preferred Mortgages** (46 U.S.C. § 31301):
- PMSC's 22 vessels financed with preferred ship mortgages (total debt $2.8B outstanding)
- **Lenders**: 
  - Bank of America $850M (8 vessels)
  - Citibank $720M (6 vessels)
  - HSBC $680M (5 vessels)
  - DVB Bank $550M (3 vessels, Jones Act vessels)
- **Security**: First preferred ship mortgages (mortgages recorded with Coast Guard, priority over most claims)

**Maritime Lien Priority**:
- **Liens senior to mortgages**:
  1. Seaman's wages (crew unpaid wages, highest priority)
  2. Salvage (salvage services rendered)
  3. General average contributions (cargo contributions to common maritime adventure)
  4. Necessaries (fuel, repairs, provisions supplied to vessel)
  5. Tort claims (collision, personal injury, pollution)
- **Mortgage priority**: Preferred mortgages rank below maritime liens (if vessel arrested, liens paid first from proceeds, mortgage paid only if surplus)

**Vessel Arrest Risk**:
- If PMSC fails to pay crew wages, fuel bills, repair invoices → Maritime lien claimant can arrest vessel (U.S. Marshals seize vessel, admiralty court orders sale to satisfy lien)
- **PMSC's risk**: Low (strong financials, pays all obligations timely), but potential if liquidity crisis (e.g., protracted ILWU strike, vessels idle months, cash flow disrupted)

**Limitation of Liability** (46 U.S.C. § 30505):
- PMSC can limit liability for maritime casualties to value of vessel + pending freight if no privity or knowledge of negligence
- **Example**: M/V Pacific Titan allision (vessel strikes pier, $50M pier damage), if PMSC had no knowledge of crew negligence (proper lookout, navigation), can limit liability to vessel value ($220M) + freight ($800K pending) = $221M cap (even though pier damage $50M, PMSC's liability limited if no privity/knowledge)
- **Exception**: Pollution (OPA 90 Oil Pollution Act overrides limitation for oil spills, strict liability up to statutory caps $1,200 per GT)

**Pending Environmental Litigation**:

**Port of Los Angeles Air Quality Lawsuit** (City of Los Angeles v. PMSC):
- **Filed**: March 2024 (Los Angeles Superior Court)
- **Claim**: PMSC's terminal operations violate California air quality standards (excessive diesel truck emissions, cargo handling equipment CHE emissions, vessel hotelling at berth)
- **Allegations**:
  1. **Diesel trucks**: 1,200 truck trips per day (containers trucked to/from terminal, many older diesel trucks pre-2010 high-emission engines)
  2. **CHE emissions**: Rubber-tired gantry cranes, yard tractors, forklifts powered by diesel (PMSC has 180 CHE units, 60% diesel, 40% electric/hybrid)
  3. **Vessel hotelling**: Ships at berth run auxiliary engines (generate electricity for reefer containers, hotel load for crew), emissions NOx, PM2.5 particulate matter
- **City's demands**:
  1. Mandate 100% zero-emission trucks by 2030 (currently 12% of PMSC's drayage trucks are ZEV zero-emission vehicles, need to reach 100% = 88% fleet turnover)
  2. Replace diesel CHE with electric (60% diesel = 108 units, $2.5M per electric RTG crane, total $270M)
  3. Install shore power for all berths (vessels plug into shore power, turn off engines, PMSC has shore power at 4 of 10 berths LA terminal, need 6 more = $45M)
- **PMSC's defense**:
  1. Lease requires PMSC comply with Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP, voluntary plan, PMSC exceeds targets, 40% CHE already electric vs. 25% CAAP target)
  2. Preemption (Clean Air Act preempts state/local regulation of ocean-going vessels, City cannot regulate vessel hotelling)
  3. Economic infeasibility (zero-emission mandates cost $315M+ over 5 years, would render terminal uneconomic, lease allows PMSC to terminate if regulatory changes make operations uneconomic)
- **Status**: Motion to dismiss pending (hearing Q1 2025)
- **Exposure**: If City wins, $315M capital investment + ongoing operating costs $25M-$40M annually (electricity for shore power, higher lease rent if terminal costs increase), OR terminal closure/lease termination (PMSC may choose to exit LA terminal if costs uneconomic)

**Bunker Fuel Spill** (March 2023, Long Beach Terminal):
- **Incident**: During bunkering operation (refueling M/V Pacific Atlas), hose ruptured, 18,000 gallons heavy fuel oil spilled into harbor
- **Response**: PMSC activated spill response plan (booms deployed, skimmers, absorbent pads, 95% oil recovered within 48 hours)
- **Coast Guard investigation**: Cited PMSC for failure to maintain bunker hose (hose beyond service life, not inspected per USCG regulations 33 CFR Part 155 Subpart B)
- **Civil penalty**: $185K (Coast Guard proposed penalty, PMSC paid August 2023)
- **Natural resource damages**: NOAA assessing (killed fish/birds, oiled shoreline, potential NRD claim $2M-$5M)
- **Criminal investigation**: DOJ declined prosecution (no intent to violate, spill response adequate)

**Collective Bargaining Agreements**:

**Officers** (800 deck officers, engine officers):
- **Union**: International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots (MM&P)
- **Agreement**: Expires December 31, 2026 (2 years remaining)
- **Wages**: Captain $180K-$250K annually, Chief Mate $140K-$180K, Chief Engineer $150K-$200K, Second Engineer $110K-$140K
- **No disputes**: Current agreement satisfactory, no major issues anticipated

**Unlicensed crew** (1,600 able seamen, oilers, stewards):
- **Union**: Seafarers International Union (SIU)
- **Agreement**: Expires June 30, 2027 (2.5 years remaining)
- **Wages**: Able Seaman $65K-$80K, Oiler $60K-$75K
- **Issues**: SIU seeks increased manning (PMSC reduced crew sizes on newer automated vessels, SIU wants minimum crew guarantees)

**Longshoremen** (3,200 terminal workers):
- **Union**: ILWU (Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement via PMA)
- **Agreement**: Expires July 1, 2028 (3.5 years remaining, but negotiations begin 2027)
- **2027 negotiations risk**: As discussed above, 30-40% probability of work disruption

## KEY TRANSACTION RISKS (REQUIRING ANALYSIS)

### FMC Licensing and Service Contract Transfer

1. **Ocean common carrier license** — PMSC's FMC License No. 024587 transfers to Global Logistics Partners (FMC approval not required for change of ownership, but must notify FMC within 30 days)
2. **Service contracts** — 850 confidential service contracts with shippers (must be re-filed with FMC if material terms change, but change of ownership alone does not require re-filing)
3. **D&D complaints** — 12 shipper complaints pending (FMC may investigate, impose penalties $5K-$25K per violation if practices deemed unreasonable, PMSC's exposure $60K-$300K)
4. **Tariff compliance** — PMSC must maintain tariffs (rates accessible to public, service contracts must reference tariff, anti-rebating violations $25K-$50K per day)
5. **Vessel-sharing agreement** — TPSA alliance (must notify alliance partners of change of control, partners have right to terminate VSA upon ownership change)

### Jones Act Cabotage — $1.8B Fleet at Risk if Violations

6. **6 Jones Act vessels** — U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed (strict compliance required for coastwise trade)
7. **Violation penalties** — $1,100 per passenger or per ton of merchandise + vessel forfeiture (if PMSC used foreign-flag vessel for Hawaii/Alaska/Puerto Rico trade)
8. **Offshore wind** — New England offshore wind service (Jones Act applies, PMSC's crew transfer vessels must be compliant, 2 vessels under construction COSCO China = NOT Jones Act-eligible, cannot serve U.S. offshore wind)
9. **Crew citizenship** — 75% crew must be U.S. citizens (PMSC audits crew annually, 2 vessels currently 73% U.S. crew = non-compliant, must hire additional U.S. citizens)
10. **Waivers unavailable** — No Jones Act waivers for routine commercial trade (only granted in rare emergencies, hurricanes, national defense)

### Coast Guard Vessel Safety — COI Compliance

11. **M/V Pacific Titan hull corrosion** — $8.5M repair costs (November 2024 drydock, 15 shell plates replaced, ballast water management system failure)
12. **COI deficiencies** — 3 deficiencies issued FY2024 (expired liferaft, missing immersion suit, inoperative lifeboat engine, all corrected)
13. **Drydock schedule** — 22 vessels require periodic drydock (container ships every 2.5 years, bulk carriers every 4 years, total annual drydock costs $25M-$40M)
14. **Detention risk** — If Coast Guard finds serious deficiencies during inspection, vessel detained (cannot sail until repaired, lost revenue $200K-$400K per day for ULCV)
15. **Port State Control** — Foreign port inspections (U.S., EU, Australia inspect PMSC vessels, deficiencies can result in detention, PMSC's PSC record good, 2.5% detention rate vs. 5% industry average)

### MTSA Security — Seattle TWIC Reader Non-Compliance

16. **TWIC reader deadline** — December 31, 2024 (Seattle terminal not yet compliant, PMSC applied for extension to June 30, 2025)
17. **Coast Guard extension** — Pending approval (if denied, Seattle terminal non-compliant January 1, 2025)
18. **Penalty** — $25K per day per facility (non-compliant terminal, ongoing daily penalty until readers installed)
19. **Installation timeline** — 4-6 months (equipment procurement, installation, testing, Coast Guard approval)
20. **Exposure** — If extension denied, $25K/day from January 1 to June 30 (181 days × $25K = $4.5M maximum penalty if readers not installed until June)

### ILWU Contract Expiration — 2027 Strike Risk

21. **Pacific Coast Longshore Agreement** — Expires July 1, 2028, negotiations commence 2027
22. **Automation disputes** — PMSC/PMA seek automated cranes/trucks (reduce costs, increase efficiency), ILWU opposes (job losses, jurisdiction battles over who operates automated equipment)
23. **Strike/slowdown probability** — 30-40% (based on ILWU history: 2002 lockout, 2014-2015 slowdowns, 2022 contentious negotiations)
24. **Economic impact** — West Coast port shutdown $1B-$2B per day U.S. economy, PMSC terminals idle (no cargo handling revenue $2.5M per day for all 4 terminals)
25. **Duration risk** — Historical work stoppages 10 days (2002) to 9 months (2014-2015 slowdowns), if 90-day shutdown PMSC loses $225M revenue

### IMO Environmental — CII D-Rated Vessels

26. **2 bulk carriers D-rated** — Carbon Intensity Indicator (grams CO2 per cargo ton-mile, poor fuel efficiency)
27. **Consecutive D-ratings** — 3 years D-rated triggers corrective action plan requirement (improve efficiency or face operational restrictions)
28. **Improvement options**:
   - Hull coating (reduce drag, $500K per vessel, 3-5% fuel savings)
   - Slow steaming (reduce speed 15-18 knots → 12-14 knots, 20-30% fuel savings but longer voyages, capacity impact)
   - Retrofit wind-assist (rotor sails, $3M-$5M per vessel, 5-10% fuel savings)
29. **Scrapping risk** — If cannot improve to C-rating, may need to scrap (vessels age 15-20 years, scrap value $8M-$12M vs. book value $35M-$45M, $23M-$37M write-down per vessel)
30. **Future E-rating** — If vessels decline to E (lowest rating), IMO may impose speed restrictions or emissions surcharges (not yet implemented, but under consideration)

### Port of Oakland Lease Renewal — $42M Annual Rent Demand

31. **Current rent** — $28M annually (expires 2030, 5 years remaining)
32. **Port's demand** — $42M annually (50% increase, Port argues market rates increased, Oakland terminal under-paying vs. LA/Long Beach)
33. **PMSC's position** — $42M uneconomic (terminal EBITDA $45M, if rent $42M → $3M EBITDA insufficient ROI, would need to exit)
34. **Alternatives**:
   - Accept increase, raise terminal handling charges (pass cost to customers, but risk losing third-party carrier business if rates too high)
   - Reject increase, exit Oakland (lose $135M annual revenue, redeploy vessels to LA/Long Beach terminals, but those terminals already 84-89% utilized, limited excess capacity)
35. **Negotiation strategy** — Offer $35M (25% increase, split difference, acceptable to both parties if Port willing to compromise)

### Section 905(b) Vessel Negligence — $8.5M Martinez Claim

36. **Longshoreman injured** — Crushed by container (lashing gear failed on M/V Pacific Horizon, bilateral leg fractures, permanent disability)
37. **LHWCA benefits** — $420K paid (medical, indemnity, ongoing)
38. **Tort damages** — $8.5M sought (medical $1.2M, lost wages $2.8M, pain/suffering $4.5M)
39. **Defense** — Gear inspected August 2023 (passed), Martinez contributorily negligent (failed to stand clear)
40. **Jury trial** — Q3 2025 (juries sympathetic to injured workers, comparative fault may reduce award 30-50%, expected verdict $2M-$5M)

### Preferred Ship Mortgage Covenants — $2.8B Debt

41. **Debt covenants** — Loan agreements require minimum liquidity ($350M cash), debt/EBITDA <4.5×, interest coverage >3.0×, vessel values >130% loan balance
42. **Current compliance** — PMSC compliant (liquidity $485M, debt/EBITDA 4.8× → 4.1× after transaction closes, interest coverage 4.2×, vessel values adequate)
43. **Acquisition impact** — Global Logistics Partners debt-financed acquisition (adds $3.2B debt at PMSC level), combined debt/EBITDA could exceed 4.5× covenant
44. **Waiver/amendment** — Lenders must consent to change of control (typical in ship mortgages, lenders want to approve new owner, may require covenant amendments, increased interest rates, additional collateral)
45. **Refinancing risk** — If lenders refuse consent, PMSC must refinance $2.8B debt (market conditions uncertain, interest rates 6-8% currently vs. 4-5% on existing loans, increased debt service $56M-$84M annually)

### Bunker Fuel Price Volatility — $480M Annual Fuel Cost

46. **VLSFO 0.1% sulfur** — PMSC uses very low sulfur fuel oil globally (exceeds IMO 0.5% requirement, simplifies fuel management)
47. **Price volatility** — VLSFO $650-$850 per ton (2024 range), 2.4M tons consumed annually, 1% price change = $4.8M annual impact
48. **Bunker adjustment factor** — PMSC passes fuel costs to shippers via BAF surcharge (adjusts quarterly, based on Platts bunker index), but time lag (3-month lag between fuel purchase and BAF adjustment, PMSC absorbs volatility in interim)
49. **Hedging** — PMSC hedges 60% of fuel costs (bunker swaps, capped at $750/ton for 12-month forward), 40% unhedged exposure = $192M annual at-risk volume
50. **Carbon pricing** — EU ETS maritime inclusion (if PMSC adds Europe-Asia routes, €70-€100 per ton CO2 allowances = $15M-$30M annually)

### Trade Route Concentration — 65% Revenue Trans-Pacific Eastbound

51. **China export dependency** — 65% container revenue from China → U.S. (consumer goods, electronics, apparel)
52. **Trade war risk** — U.S.-China tariffs (Section 301 tariffs 25% on $300B Chinese goods, volumes declined 8% 2019-2020, rebounded 2021-2024 but uncertainty remains)
53. **Nearshoring** — U.S. importers shifting sourcing to Mexico, Vietnam, India (reduce China dependency), PMSC's trans-Pacific volumes at risk (-3-5% annually if nearshoring accelerates)
54. **Backhaul imbalance** — Westbound U.S. → Asia 380K TEU vs. eastbound 1.2M TEU (3:1 imbalance, westbound rates $1,200 vs. eastbound $2,800, PMSC repositions empty containers, 40% westbound sailings empty containers)
55. **Diversification** — PMSC could add routes (Asia-Europe, intra-Asia, transatlantic), but requires additional vessels, different trade lane dynamics, competitive markets

### LA Terminal Air Quality Lawsuit — $315M+ Capital Investment

56. **City's demands** — 100% zero-emission trucks by 2030, 100% electric CHE, shore power all berths
57. **Capital costs** — ZEV trucks (PMSC does not own drayage trucks, but City may impose terminal access restrictions for non-ZEV trucks, effectively forcing turnover), electric CHE $270M (108 diesel units replaced), shore power $45M (6 berths)
58. **Operating costs** — Electricity $25M-$40M annually (shore power, electric CHE charging, vs. $18M diesel fuel current)
59. **Lease termination** — If regulatory changes render terminal uneconomic, PMSC can terminate lease (lose LA terminal $420M revenue, 2.1M TEU volume, but avoid $315M+ capital costs)
60. **Preemption defense** — Clean Air Act preempts state/local regulation of ocean-going vessels (City cannot regulate vessel hotelling, but can regulate terminal-side operations trucks/CHE/shore power)

## SCOPE OF ENGAGEMENT

Please prepare a comprehensive legal due diligence memorandum addressing:

### 1. FMC REGULATION — OCEAN COMMON CARRIER LICENSING

#### A. Service Contract Transfer and Tariff Compliance

**46 U.S.C. § 40102** — Ocean Common Carrier Definition:
- Vessel-operating common carrier (VOCC, owns/operates vessels) or non-vessel-operating common carrier (NVOCC, arranges transportation without owning vessels)
- **PMSC's license**: VOCC License No. 024587 (issued 1985, current)

**Service Contracts** (46 U.S.C. § 40501):
- Confidential contracts between carrier and shipper (volume commitments, negotiated rates lower than published tariff rates)
- **Filing**: Must file contracts with FMC (within 30 days, contracts confidential but FMC reviews)
- **PMSC's contracts**: 850 service contracts (major shippers: Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Amazon, Costco)

**Change of Control**:
- **FMC notification**: PMSC must notify FMC within 30 days of change of ownership (46 CFR § 514.11, provide details of new ownership structure)
- **License transfer**: VOCC license remains valid (does not require re-issuance, but FMC updates records to reflect Global Logistics Partners as owner)
- **Service contract re-filing**: NOT required (contracts remain valid unless material terms change, ownership change alone not material)

**Tariff Compliance** (46 U.S.C. § 40501):
- Common carriers must maintain tariffs (rates, charges, classifications, rules applicable to common carriage)
- **Accessibility**: Tariffs must be publicly available (FMC SERVCON system, shippers can view rates)
- **No rebates**: 46 U.S.C. § 41102(c) (carrier cannot offer rebates, refunds, or allowances not specified in tariff/service contract, violation $25K-$50K per day)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review PMSC's FMC license (verify active status, no violations, License No. 024587 valid)
2. Assess service contracts (850 contracts, verify filed with FMC, no rebating violations, contracts remain valid post-transaction)
3. Verify tariff compliance (tariffs current, no anti-rebating violations, detention/demurrage practices compliant with 46 CFR Part 545)
4. Analyze D&D complaints (12 pending complaints, FMC investigation risk, potential penalties $60K-$300K, PMSC's defense reasonable practices)

#### B. Detention and Demurrage Complaints

**46 CFR Part 545** — Detention and Demurrage Practices:
- **Effective**: May 2022 (FMC final rule, requires D&D practices be reasonable, transparent, invoices clearly identify charges, billing practices consistent)
- **Free time**: Carriers must provide reasonable free time (industry standard 3-7 days for import containers)
- **Dispute resolution**: Carriers must have process for shippers to dispute D&D charges

**PMSC's Practices**:
- **Free time**: 5 days (import containers, within industry standard)
- **Demurrage**: $150/day (after free time, container at terminal, PMSC charges terminal storage)
- **Detention**: $100/day (container outside terminal, held by shipper/trucker beyond free time)

**Shipper Complaints** (12 filed FY2024):
- **COVID port congestion** (2021-2023): Shippers allege unreasonable D&D charges during port congestion (containers delayed due to chassis shortages, yard congestion, not shipper fault, PMSC continued charging demurrage)
- **Specific allegations**:
  1. Chassis unavailable (PMSC terminal had no chassis available for pickup, shipper physically unable to retrieve container, yet demurrage charged)
  2. No appointment slots (PMSC terminal fully booked, no truck appointment slots available for 7 days, shipper charged demurrage for delay)
  3. Incorrect billing (PMSC invoiced for containers already returned, double-charged for same container, billing errors)

**FMC Investigation**:
- **Status**: FMC reviewing complaints (informal investigation, requested PMSC provide documentation of D&D practices, free time policies, billing records)
- **PMSC's response**: Submitted documentation (October 2024, explained practices compliant with Part 545, chassis shortages due to third-party vendors not PMSC, appointment system necessary to manage terminal congestion)

**Penalty Exposure**:
- **Per violation**: $5,000-$25,000 (FMC penalty guidelines, unreasonable practice = violation)
- **Total exposure**: 12 complaints × average $10,000-$15,000 = **$120K-$180K** (if FMC finds violations, but likely lower if PMSC demonstrates good faith compliance efforts)

**Resolution Strategy**:
- **Settle with shippers**: PMSC could offer refunds/credits ($500K-$1M total to 12 complainants, waive disputed D&D charges, resolve complaints before FMC adjudication)
- **Revise practices**: Implement free time extensions during terminal congestion (automatic extension if chassis unavailable, appointment slots unavailable), improve billing accuracy (system upgrades $250K-$500K)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review D&D complaints (12 complaints, shipper allegations, PMSC's defenses, FMC investigation status)
2. Assess penalty exposure ($120K-$180K if violations found, settlement $500K-$1M with shippers)
3. Evaluate practice revisions (free time extensions, billing system upgrades $250K-$500K, ongoing compliance costs)

### 2. JONES ACT COMPLIANCE — COASTWISE TRADE RESTRICTIONS

#### A. U.S.-Built, U.S.-Flagged, U.S.-Crewed Requirements

**46 U.S.C. § 55102** — Coastwise Trade:
- No merchandise shall be transported by water between U.S. points except in U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed vessels
- **U.S. points**: Includes all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa
- **Offshore installations**: Jones Act applies to U.S. offshore renewable energy installations (wind farms, oil platforms)

**PMSC's Jones Act Fleet** (6 vessels):
- 4 container ships (3,000-4,200 TEU, built U.S. Gulf Coast 2008-2015)
- 2 RoRo vessels (built Aker Philadelphia 2012-2013)

**Compliance Elements**:

**1. U.S.-Built**:
- **Requirement**: Vessel constructed in U.S. shipyard (46 U.S.C. § 55102(a)(1))
- **PMSC's vessels**: All 6 built U.S. (NASSCO San Diego, Aker Philadelphia, VT Halter Marine)
- **Cost impact**: U.S. newbuild $180M-$250M vs. foreign $50M-$80M (3-5× premium)

**2. U.S.-Flagged**:
- **Requirement**: Vessel documented under U.S. flag (Coast Guard Certificate of Documentation)
- **PMSC's vessels**: All 6 U.S.-flagged (home ports: Los Angeles, Honolulu, Jacksonville)

**3. U.S.-Crewed**:
- **Officers**: 100% U.S. citizens (Coast Guard-licensed mariners, master/mates/engineers)
- **Unlicensed**: 75% U.S. citizens or permanent residents (able seamen, oilers, stewards)
- **Current status**: 4 vessels compliant (75%+ U.S. crew), **2 vessels 73% U.S. crew** (below 75% threshold, non-compliant)

**Non-Compliance Issue** (2 vessels 73% U.S. crew):
- **M/V Island Express**: 73% U.S. crew (32 of 44 crew U.S., need 33 to reach 75%)
- **M/V Pacific Voyager**: 73% U.S. crew (29 of 40 crew U.S., need 30)
- **Corrective action**: Hire 2 additional U.S. crew (total, 1 per vessel), replace foreign crew with U.S. citizens/permanent residents
- **Timeline**: 90 days (recruit, hire, onboard replacement crew)
- **Risk**: If Coast Guard audits crew manifests before correction, potential penalties (see below)

**Violation Penalties** (46 U.S.C. § 55102(b)):
- **$1,100 per passenger** or **$1,100 per ton of merchandise** transported in violation
- **Vessel forfeiture**: Vessel used in violation subject to forfeiture (seized by U.S., sold at auction, proceeds to U.S. Treasury)

**Example Calculation**:
- If M/V Island Express carried 3,000 TEU Los Angeles → Honolulu (average 12 tons per TEU = 36,000 tons) while 73% U.S. crew:
  - **Penalty**: 36,000 tons × $1,100 = **$39.6M** per voyage
  - **Forfeiture**: Vessel value $85M subject to forfeiture
- **PMSC's actual risk**: Low (Coast Guard rarely audits crew manifests proactively, but if complaint filed by competitor, union, or DOT Inspector General, Coast Guard investigates)

**Offshore Wind Vessels** (under construction):
- **2 crew transfer vessels**: Built COSCO Shipyard China (delivery Q3 2025, Q1 2026)
- **Intended use**: Service offshore wind farms (New England, transport workers, supplies, equipment to turbines)
- **Jones Act applicability**: Offshore wind installations on U.S. Outer Continental Shelf = Jones Act applies (vessels must be U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed)
- **Problem**: COSCO-built vessels = Foreign-built, NOT Jones Act-compliant
- **Impact**: Cannot use for U.S. offshore wind ($35M investment, 2 vessels, unusable for intended purpose), PMSC must:
  1. Cancel contracts (if construction not too advanced, pay cancellation fees $5M-$8M)
  2. Re-order from U.S. shipyard (Halter Marine, COSCO Baltimore, 2-3 year construction timeline, $22M-$28M per vessel vs. $12M COSCO China)
  3. Use vessels for foreign offshore wind (Europe, Asia, but requires different regulatory approvals, limited market)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Verify Jones Act fleet compliance (6 vessels, U.S.-built/U.S.-flagged confirmed, crew citizenship 4 vessels compliant, 2 vessels 73% = non-compliant)
2. Assess corrective action (hire 2 U.S. crew total, 90-day timeline, cost $80K-$120K annually per crew member)
3. Quantify violation risk (if Coast Guard audits before correction, $39.6M penalty per voyage potential, vessel forfeiture risk, but probability low <5% absent complaint)
4. Analyze offshore wind vessels (2 vessels under construction COSCO China = non-compliant, cancel contracts $5M-$8M or re-order U.S. $44M-$56M)

### 3. COAST GUARD VESSEL SAFETY — COI COMPLIANCE

#### A. M/V Pacific Titan Hull Corrosion and Repair Costs

**November 2024 Drydock** (Keppel Shipyard, Singapore):
- **Scheduled**: Routine 2.5-year drydock (container ships require drydock every 2.5 years per 46 CFR § 170.110)
- **Inspection**: Coast Guard marine inspectors examined hull (external hull plating, ballast tanks, cargo holds, machinery)
- **Deficiency**: 15 shell plates corroded (ballast tanks, original thickness 8mm → 6mm measured, minimum required 7mm per classification society rules ABS American Bureau of Shipping)

**Cause**:
- **Ballast water management system failure**: BWMS (UV treatment system) not treating ballast water properly (sediment, biological growth accumulated in tanks, accelerated corrosion)
- **BWMS manufacturer**: OptiMarin AS (Norway), system installed 2019 (5 years old, expected 10-15 year lifespan)

**Coast Guard Action**:
- **Deficiency notice**: Vessel cannot sail until repairs completed (46 CFR § 176.970, unsafe conditions prohibit voyage)
- **Required repairs**: Replace 15 shell plates (cut out corroded steel, weld new plates, hydrotest ballast tanks, verify watertight integrity)

**Repair Costs**:
- **Plate replacement**: $4.2M (labor, materials, welding, testing)
- **BWMS replacement**: $2.8M (new system GEA Westfalia, German manufacturer, more reliable)
- **Drydock extension**: 28 additional days (beyond planned 21 days, total 49 days in drydock), drydock daily rate $85K = $2.38M additional
- **Lost revenue**: 1 voyage missed (trans-Pacific eastbound Shanghai → Los Angeles, would have carried 18,500 TEU × $2,800/TEU = $51.8M revenue, PMSC's operating margin 18% = **$9.3M lost profit**)
- **Total impact**: $4.2M + $2.8M + $2.38M + $9.3M = **$18.7M**

**Insurance Coverage**:
- **Hull and machinery insurance**: $220M (vessel value insured, includes repairs)
- **Deductible**: $2M (PMSC pays first $2M, insurance covers $6.2M repair/BWMS costs)
- **Loss of hire insurance**: Covers lost revenue during repairs (but excludes first 14 days, PMSC's repair took 28 days extended, coverage for 14 days only = $9.3M ÷ 28 days × 14 days = $4.65M covered)
- **Net cost to PMSC**: $2M deductible + $4.65M uncovered lost revenue = **$6.65M**

**Future Prevention**:
- **Enhanced BWMS maintenance**: PMSC implemented quarterly BWMS inspections (vs. annual previously), monitor ballast water quality, UV lamp replacement every 2 years (vs. 3 years previously)
- **Cost**: $150K-$250K annually (all 22 vessels, enhanced maintenance program)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review drydock report (Coast Guard deficiency notice, repair scope, costs $18.7M total, insurance recovery $12.05M, net cost $6.65M)
2. Assess future drydock risks (22 vessels, annual drydock costs $25M-$40M, potential for additional deficiencies especially older vessels built 2005-2010)
3. Verify BWMS compliance (all vessels BWMS installed, Coast Guard-approved, enhanced maintenance program $150K-$250K annually)

### 4. MTSA PORT SECURITY — TWIC READER NON-COMPLIANCE

#### A. Seattle Terminal TWIC Reader Installation

**33 CFR § 105.255** — TWIC Reader Requirements:
- All MTSA-regulated facilities must use TWIC readers to electronically verify credentials (phased implementation, final deadline December 31, 2024)
- **TWIC**: Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TSA-issued, biometric smart card, background check, all terminal workers must have TWIC to access facility)

**PMSC's Compliance Status**:
- **LA terminal**: TWIC readers installed (2022, all gates, compliant)
- **Long Beach terminal**: TWIC readers installed (2023, compliant)
- **Oakland terminal**: TWIC readers installed (2024, compliant)
- **Seattle terminal**: NOT installed (equipment ordered June 2024, supply chain delays, vendor Morpho expected delivery Q1 2025)

**Extension Request**:
- **PMSC filed**: October 2024 (requested extension to June 30, 2025, cited equipment delivery delays, installation/testing timeline)
- **Coast Guard**: Reviewing (Sector Puget Sound, pending decision expected December 2024-January 2025)

**Penalty if Extension Denied**:
- **$25,000 per day per facility** (33 CFR § 1.07-7, civil penalties for MTSA violations)
- **Accrual**: January 1, 2025 (if extension denied, non-compliance begins)
- **Duration**: Until readers installed/tested/Coast Guard-approved (PMSC estimates June 30, 2025 = 181 days)
- **Maximum exposure**: 181 days × $25,000 = **$4.525M**

**Mitigation**:
- **Expedite installation**: PMSC could pay premium for expedited delivery (vendor Morpho, air freight vs. sea freight, premium $85K-$120K), reduce timeline to March 31, 2025 (90 days × $25,000 = $2.25M penalty vs. $4.525M)
- **Coast Guard discretion**: CG may exercise prosecutorial discretion (reduce penalty, payment plan, no penalty if good faith efforts demonstrated)

**Likelihood of Extension Approval**:
- **Factors in PMSC's favor**: Good faith efforts (ordered equipment June 2024, supply chain delays beyond PMSC's control), TWIC readers installed at other 3 terminals (demonstrates commitment), Seattle terminal low risk (Alaska service, low international traffic vs. LA/Long Beach)
- **Probability**: 60-70% extension granted (Coast Guard has granted extensions to other facilities with similar supply chain issues)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Review extension request (filed October 2024, Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound review pending)
2. Assess penalty exposure (if denied, $25K/day from January 1 = $2.25M-$4.525M depending on installation timeline)
3. Model mitigation scenarios (expedite installation $2.25M penalty + $85K-$120K expedite cost vs. wait for extension decision)
4. Verify other terminals (LA, Long Beach, Oakland compliant, Coast Guard inspections current, no violations)

5. **Vessel-sharing agreement**: TPSA alliance (PMSC + 3 carriers, slot exchange, joint schedules), notify partners of ownership change (partners have termination right if material change)

### Jones Act Compliance Report
Assessment of:
1. **Fleet**: 6 vessels (4 container ships 3,000-4,200 TEU, 2 RoRo, all U.S.-built 2008-2015, all U.S.-flagged)
2. **Crew compliance**: 4 vessels compliant 75%+ U.S. crew, **2 vessels 73%** (M/V Island Express 32/44, M/V Pacific Voyager 29/40, need 1 additional U.S. crew each)
3. **Corrective action**: Hire 2 U.S. crew (90-day timeline, $80K-$120K annually per crew), eliminate non-compliance
4. **Penalty risk**: $1,100 per ton merchandise (if Coast Guard audits before correction, e.g., 36,000 tons × $1,100 = $39.6M per voyage), vessel forfeiture, but probability low <5% (proactive audits rare)
5. **Offshore wind**: 2 crew transfer vessels under construction COSCO China (foreign-built, NOT Jones Act-compliant for U.S. offshore wind), cancel contracts $5M-$8M or re-order U.S. $44M-$56M, $35M stranded investment

### Coast Guard COI Status
Detailed findings:
1. **M/V Pacific Titan**: Hull corrosion November 2024 drydock (15 shell plates 6mm vs. 7mm required, ballast tank corrosion), repair cost $18.7M total ($4.2M plates, $2.8M BWMS, $2.38M drydock extension, $9.3M lost revenue), insurance recovery $12.05M (hull $6.2M covered less $2M deductible, loss of hire $4.65M for 14 days), net cost $6.65M
2. **COI deficiencies**: 3 issued FY2024 (expired liferaft M/V Pacific Atlas, missing immersion suit M/V Sierra Nevada, inoperative lifeboat M/V Pacific Endeavor), all corrected within 30 days
3. **Annual drydock**: $25M-$40M (22 vessels, container ships every 2.5 years, bulk carriers every 4 years, average 6-8 vessels per year)
4. **BWMS compliance**: All 22 vessels have BWMS installed (UV treatment, electrolysis, chemical), enhanced maintenance $150K-$250K annually (quarterly inspections vs. annual)
5. **Port State Control**: 2.5% detention rate (vs. 5% industry average, strong PSC record, low risk of foreign port detentions)

### MTSA Security Compliance
Quantification of:
1. **Facility Security Plans**: All 4 terminals FSPs Coast Guard-approved (vulnerability assessments, MARSEC 1/2/3 measures, quarterly drills documented)
2. **TWIC readers**: 3 terminals compliant (LA 2022, Long Beach 2023, Oakland 2024), **Seattle terminal non-compliant** (equipment ordered June 2024, delivery delayed Q1 2025)
3. **Extension request**: Filed October 2024 (request to June 30, 2025, Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound review pending, decision expected December-January)
4. **Penalty exposure**: If denied, $25K/day from January 1, 2025 (installation timeline March 31 = 90 days × $25K = $2.25M, or June 30 = 181 days × $25K = $4.525M)
5. **Mitigation**: Expedite installation (air freight equipment $85K-$120K premium, reduce to March 31 timeline), extension approval probability 60-70% (good faith efforts, supply chain delays, low-risk terminal)

### ILWU Labor Relations Analysis
Findings on:
1. **Current agreement**: Pacific Coast Longshore and Clerks Agreement via PMA, expires July 1, 2028 (3.5 years remaining)
2. **Negotiations commence**: 2027 (1 year before expiration, typical ILWU pattern)
3. **Key issues**: Automation (terminal operators seek automated cranes/AGVs, ILWU opposes job losses, jurisdiction disputes), health benefits (cost increases, employer contributions), wages (longshoremen $210K annually including benefits, highest in industry)
4. **Strike/slowdown risk**: 30-40% probability (historical precedents: 2002 lockout 10 days, 2014-2015 slowdowns 9 months, 2022 contentious 13-month negotiations)
5. **Economic impact**: West Coast shutdown $1B-$2B/day U.S. economy, PMSC terminals idle $2.5M/day revenue loss (all 4 terminals, no cargo handling), 90-day shutdown $225M revenue loss

### IMO Environmental Compliance
Assessment of:
1. **MARPOL Annex I**: All vessels compliant (OWS installed, Oil Record Books current, no illegal discharges, no violations)
2. **MARPOL Annex VI sulfur**: Fleet uses 0.1% VLSFO globally (exceeds 0.5% global requirement, simplifies fuel management), annual fuel cost $480M (2.4M tons × $200/ton average)
3. **NOx Tier III**: 4 ULCVs built 2017-2020 have SCR systems (80% NOx reduction in ECAs), older vessels Tier II grandfathered
4. **Ballast water**: All 22 vessels BWMS installed (UV, electrolysis, chemical treatment, Coast Guard-approved), M/V Pacific Titan BWMS failure November 2024 (replaced $2.8M)
5. **CII ratings**: 2 vessels A-rated, 8 B-rated, 10 C-rated, **2 D-rated** (older bulk carriers M/V Sierra Nevada, M/V Cascade Ridge, poor fuel efficiency, scrapping risk $23M-$37M write-down if cannot improve to C)

### Port Lease Negotiations Matrix
Findings on:
1. **LA Terminal**: 40-year lease expires 2042 (18 years remaining), rent $85M annually (3% gross revenue floor), 2.1M TEU volume, $420M revenue, EBITDA $125M, strong financial performance
2. **Long Beach**: 30-year lease expires 2035 (11 years), rent $62M annually, 1.6M TEU, $310M revenue, EBITDA $92M
3. **Oakland**: 25-year lease expires 2030 (5 years), rent $28M annually, Port demands $42M (50% increase), PMSC's EBITDA $45M (if $42M rent → $3M EBITDA uneconomic), negotiation strategy offer $35M (25% increase, compromise)
4. **Seattle**: 20-year lease expires 2033 (9 years), rent $18M annually, 380K TEU (Alaska service, Jones Act), $82M revenue, EBITDA $22M
5. **Total terminal revenue**: $947M (2024, all 4 terminals), EBITDA $284M (30% margin, strong profitability but Oakland at risk)

### Maritime Lien and Mortgage Analysis
Detailed findings:
1. **Preferred ship mortgages**: $2.8B outstanding (22 vessels, Bank of America $850M, Citibank $720M, HSBC $680M, DVB Bank $550M), first preferred mortgages recorded with Coast Guard
2. **Lien priority**: Maritime liens (crew wages, salvage, necessaries, tort claims) rank ABOVE mortgages (if vessel arrested, liens paid first from proceeds)
3. **Change of control**: Loan agreements require lender consent (typical ship mortgage provision, lenders want to approve new owner Global Logistics Partners)
4. **Debt covenants**: Minimum liquidity $350M (PMSC $485M compliant), debt/EBITDA <4.5× (currently 4.8× but acquisition may exceed), interest coverage >3.0× (currently 4.2× compliant), vessel values >130% loan balance (periodic appraisals required)
5. **Waiver/refinancing**: If lenders refuse consent, PMSC must refinance $2.8B (market rates 6-8% vs. 4-5% existing, increased debt service $56M-$84M annually)

### Section 905(b) Litigation Report
Assessment of:
1. **Martinez v. PMSC**: Longshoreman injured September 2023 (crushed by container, lashing gear failed M/V Pacific Horizon, bilateral leg fractures, permanent disability)
2. **LHWCA benefits**: $420K paid to date (medical, temporary total disability, ongoing)
3. **Tort claims**: $8.5M sought (medical $1.2M, lost wages $2.8M, pain/suffering $4.5M), unseaworthy vessel/crew negligence allegations
4. **Defense**: Lashing gear inspected August 2023 (passed inspection, no defect known), Martinez contributory negligence (failed to stand clear during lashing as required)
5. **Trial**: Q3 2025 (jury trial, comparative fault jurisdiction, expected verdict $2M-$5M after comparative fault reduction 30-50%)

### Source Verification

### Cross-Reference Architecture
Trace each finding to transaction provisions:
- **Conditions to closing**: FMC notification filed (30 days post-closing), Jones Act fleet compliant (2 vessels hire U.S. crew within 90 days), Seattle TWIC readers installed (extension obtained or readers operational by June 30, 2025), lender consents obtained ($2.8B ship mortgages, Bank of America/Citibank/HSBC/DVB consent to change of control)
- **Reps & warranties**: Valid FMC OCC license (No. 024587, 850 service contracts filed), Jones Act vessels U.S.-built/flagged/crewed (disclose 2 vessels 73% crew pending correction), COIs valid (22 vessels, next drydock schedule disclosed, M/V Pacific Titan repairs completed December 2024), MTSA FSPs approved (all 4 terminals, disclose Seattle TWIC reader non-compliance)
- **Covenants**: File FMC change of control notification, hire U.S. crew for 2 Jones Act vessels (90-day deadline), install Seattle TWIC readers (June 30, 2025 or earlier if extension denied), comply with ship mortgage covenants (liquidity, debt/EBITDA, vessel values)
- **Purchase price adjustment**: D&D complaint settlements (if exceed $500K), Jones Act offshore wind vessel cancellation (if incurred pre-closing), M/V Pacific Titan repairs (if insurance recovery less than $12.05M), Martinez 905(b) settlement/judgment (if resolved pre-closing)
- **Indemnification**: Pre-closing FMC violations (D&D complaints, anti-rebating), pre-closing Jones Act violations (crew non-compliance, offshore wind vessel construction), pre-closing COI deficiencies (hull corrosion, lifesaving equipment, BWMS failures), pre-closing MTSA violations (Seattle TWIC readers if penalty assessed), pre-closing LHWCA/905(b) claims (Martinez case, 1,850 pending asbestos claims $180M reserve)

## SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Jones Act Fleet Crew Compliance — Immediate Corrective Action

**Objective**: Bring 2 non-compliant vessels (M/V Island Express 73%, M/V Pacific Voyager 73%) into compliance within 90 days (hire 1 additional U.S. crew member each vessel to reach 75% threshold)

**Recruitment Strategy**:

**1. Seafarers International Union (SIU) Hiring Hall**:
- PMSC's unlicensed crew sourced via SIU hiring halls (Norfolk, Houston, New York, Honolulu)
- **Request**: Contact SIU dispatch (Norfolk hall primary for PMSC), request 2 able seamen (U.S. citizens, current Coast Guard MMC Merchant Mariner Credential, STCW certification)
- **Timeline**: SIU can provide qualified mariners within 2-4 weeks (union maintains registry of available members)

**2. Direct Hire (U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, State Maritime Academies)**:
- Recent graduates (USMMA Kings Point, SUNY Maritime, California Maritime Academy, Texas A&M Maritime, Maine Maritime, Massachusetts Maritime)
- **Recruitment**: PMSC HR contacts career services offices (December-January graduation season, cadets seeking entry-level positions)
- **Benefit**: Younger workforce, lower initial wages ($55K-$65K vs. $65K-$80K experienced AB), but need training time (6-12 months to fully qualified)

**3. Citizenship Verification**:
- **U.S. passport** or **birth certificate + state ID** (required for all crew, verify before hiring)
- **Permanent residents eligible**: Green card holders count toward 75% threshold (USCIS documentation required)
- **Coast Guard verification**: PMSC must submit crew lists to Coast Guard annually (verify citizenship percentages, USCG audits via National Vessel Documentation Center)

**Compensation**:
- **Able Seaman**: $70K-$85K annually (including wages, overtime, vacation, benefits)
- **Total cost**: 2 crew × $77.5K average = **$155K annually** (recurring cost to maintain Jones Act compliance)

**Timeline**:
- **Week 1-2**: Contact SIU hiring halls (Norfolk, Houston), request 2 able seamen
- **Week 3-4**: SIU provides candidates, PMSC interviews/screens
- **Week 5-6**: Hire selected candidates, onboarding (paperwork, drug testing, physical exam, TWIC application)
- **Week 7-8**: Crew join vessels (M/V Island Express Honolulu, M/V Pacific Voyager Seattle), complete vessel familiarization
- **Week 9-10**: Coast Guard verification (submit updated crew lists to NVDC, document 75% compliance)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Verify current crew citizenship percentages (M/V Island Express 32/44 = 72.7%, M/V Pacific Voyager 29/40 = 72.5%, both below 75%)
2. Implement recruitment plan (SIU hiring halls, direct hire maritime academies, 90-day timeline to hire 2 U.S. crew)
3. Model ongoing costs ($155K annually recurring for 2 additional crew members, maintain Jones Act compliance)
4. Assess Coast Guard audit risk (proactive audits rare, but competitor complaint possible, ensure compliance before audit)

### 2. Seattle TWIC Reader Expedited Installation — Penalty Mitigation

**Objective**: If Coast Guard denies extension request, expedite TWIC reader installation to minimize penalty exposure ($25K/day from January 1, 2025)

**Expedited Installation Plan**:

**1. Equipment Procurement**:
- **Vendor**: Morpho (current vendor, equipment on order, delivery expected Q1 2025)
- **Expedite options**:
  - **Air freight**: Ship equipment from France (Morpho factory) via air cargo (vs. sea freight), reduce delivery from February to January ($85K-$120K air freight premium vs. $12K-$18K sea freight)
  - **Alternative vendor**: HID Global (U.S.-based TWIC reader manufacturer), could provide equipment faster (6-8 weeks delivery vs. 12-16 weeks Morpho), but requires Coast Guard approval of new equipment model ($25K application fee, 4-6 weeks review)

**2. Installation and Testing**:
- **Gates**: Seattle terminal has 3 truck gates (main gate, overflow gate, rail gate), each gate needs 2 TWIC readers (primary, backup) = 6 readers total
- **Installation**: 4-6 weeks (equipment mounting, network cabling, server integration, software configuration, testing)
- **Coast Guard approval**: Submit installation completion report, CG Sector Puget Sound inspects (2-3 weeks from submission to approval)

**Timeline Options**:

**Option A: Wait for Morpho Delivery** (February delivery):
- **Equipment arrival**: February 15, 2025 (sea freight)
- **Installation**: February 15 - March 31 (6 weeks)
- **CG approval**: April 15, 2025 (2 weeks inspection)
- **Penalty**: January 1 - April 15 = 105 days × $25K = **$2.625M**

**Option B: Expedite Morpho** (air freight):
- **Equipment arrival**: January 10, 2025 (air freight, $100K premium)
- **Installation**: January 10 - February 21 (6 weeks)
- **CG approval**: March 7, 2025 (2 weeks)
- **Penalty**: January 1 - March 7 = 66 days × $25K = **$1.65M + $100K air freight = $1.75M total**

**Option C: Alternative Vendor HID Global**:
- **Equipment procurement**: 6-8 weeks (December order, February delivery)
- **CG approval**: New equipment model requires CG approval (4-6 weeks review, January-February)
- **Installation**: February - March (6 weeks)
- **CG approval**: April 2025
- **Penalty**: Similar to Option A ($2.5M-$2.8M)

**Recommended**: **Option B (Expedite Morpho air freight)** — Saves $875K vs. Option A ($2.625M - $1.75M), earliest compliance date

**Coast Guard Penalty Discretion**:
- **Mitigating factors**: PMSC can present (a) good faith efforts (ordered equipment June 2024), (b) supply chain delays beyond control, (c) expedited installation once equipment arrived, (d) 3 of 4 terminals already compliant
- **Penalty reduction**: CG may reduce penalty 30-50% (if PMSC demonstrates good faith, assess penalty $12K-$18K/day vs. $25K statutory max)
- **Best case**: Penalty reduced to $1.05M-$1.2M (vs. $1.75M statutory) if CG exercises discretion

**Due Diligence**:
1. Model timeline scenarios (Option A wait $2.625M, Option B expedite $1.75M, Option C alternative vendor $2.5M-$2.8M)
2. Evaluate air freight costs ($85K-$120K premium, saves $875K vs. waiting for sea freight)
3. Prepare CG penalty mitigation (document good faith efforts, supply chain delays, request penalty reduction to $12K-$18K/day vs. $25K)
4. Monitor extension decision (Coast Guard Sector Puget Sound expected decision December-January, 60-70% probability approval based on good faith/supply chain issues)

### 3. Oakland Terminal Lease Negotiation — Walk-Away Analysis

**Objective**: Negotiate Oakland lease renewal (Port demands $42M annual rent vs. current $28M, 50% increase), determine walk-away threshold vs. acceptable compromise

**Financial Analysis**:

**Current Economics** (rent $28M):
- **Revenue**: $135M (620K TEU × $218/TEU average)
- **Operating expenses**: $90M (labor, equipment, utilities, maintenance)
- **Rent**: $28M
- **EBITDA**: $135M - $90M - $28M = **$17M** (12.6% margin)

**Port's Demand** (rent $42M):
- **Revenue**: $135M (assume no change)
- **Operating expenses**: $90M
- **Rent**: $42M
- **EBITDA**: $135M - $90M - $42M = **$3M** (2.2% margin, uneconomic)

**PMSC's Acceptable Range**:
- **Minimum EBITDA**: $12M (8.9% margin, PMSC requires minimum 8-10% EBITDA margin to justify terminal investment)
- **Maximum rent**: $135M - $90M - $12M = **$33M**
- **Walk-away threshold**: If Port insists >$33M, PMSC should exit

**Negotiation Strategy**:

**Offer $32M** (14% increase vs. current $28M, 24% below Port's demand $42M):
- **Justification**: CPI increase 2020-2025 ~18% (rent should increase with inflation, $28M × 1.18 = $33M fair inflation-adjusted rent)
- **Market comparables**: LA/Long Beach terminals rent 3-5% of revenue (PMSC's LA terminal $85M rent on $420M revenue = 20%, Oakland $32M on $135M = 24%, higher percentage than LA justified by Oakland's lower volume)

**Port's Likely Response**:
- **Counter $38M**: Split difference ($32M PMSC offer + $42M Port demand ÷ 2 = $37M, round to $38M)
- **PMSC's decision**: $38M rent → $135M - $90M - $38M = $7M EBITDA (5.2% margin, below minimum 8-10%, REJECT)

**Walk-Away Plan**:

If Port insists >$33M:
1. **Exit Oakland**: Terminate lease 2030 expiration (do not renew)
2. **Redeploy vessels**: Shift Oakland cargo to LA/Long Beach terminals (PMSC's LA terminal 2.1M TEU vs. 2.5M capacity = 400K TEU available, Long Beach 1.6M vs. 1.8M = 200K TEU available, total 600K excess capacity vs. Oakland's 620K TEU)
3. **Customer impact**: Some Oakland customers may defect to competitors (trucking distance to LA/Long Beach +380 miles, higher inland transportation costs for shippers in Northern California)
4. **Revenue loss**: $20M-$30M annually (assume 15-22% customer defection, $135M × 15-22% = $20M-$30M lost)
5. **Cost savings**: Eliminate Oakland operating expenses $90M + rent $28M = $118M (but must absorb $15M-$25M incremental costs at LA/Long Beach terminals for 620K TEU volume)
6. **Net impact**: Revenue loss $20M-$30M, cost savings $93M-$103M (net $118M saved - $15M-$25M incremental = $93M-$103M), **net EBITDA improvement $63M-$83M** (vs. accepting $42M rent = $3M EBITDA)

**Recommended Approach**: 
- **Offer $32M** (final offer)
- **If Port counters $38M+**: **WALK AWAY** (exit Oakland, redeploy to LA/Long Beach, net EBITDA improvement $63M-$83M vs. accepting uneconomic rent)
- **If Port accepts $32M-$35M**: **ACCEPTABLE** (EBITDA $10M-$13M, 7.4-9.6% margin, within PMSC's minimum acceptable range)

**Due Diligence**:
1. Model Oakland economics (current $17M EBITDA, Port demand $3M EBITDA, walk-away threshold $33M rent = $12M EBITDA)
2. Assess LA/Long Beach excess capacity (400K + 200K = 600K TEU available vs. Oakland 620K TEU, adequate to absorb)
3. Quantify walk-away net impact ($63M-$83M EBITDA improvement vs. accepting $42M rent, walk-away superior to uneconomic lease)
4. Prepare negotiation strategy (offer $32M final, if Port insists >$35M exit Oakland)
